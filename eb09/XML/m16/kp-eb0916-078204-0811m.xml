                    Louis</hi></label><hi rend="smallcaps">de Secondât, Baron de la Brède et de</hi>
                    (1689-1755), philosophical historian, was born at the chateau of La Brède, about
                    10 miles to the south-east of Bordeaux, in January 1689 (the exact date being
                    unknown), and was baptized on the 18th of that month. His mother was Marie
                    Françoise de Penel, the heiress of a Gascon-English family. She had brought La
                    Brède as a dowry to his father, Jacques de Secondât, a member of a good if not
                    extremely ancient house, which seems first to have risen to importance in the
                    early days of the 16th century. The title of Montesquieu came from his uncle,
                    Jean Baptiste de Secondât, “président à mortier” in the parliament of
                    Bordeaux,—an important office, which, as well as his title, he left to his
                    nephew. Montesquieu was in his youth known as Μ. de la Brède. His mother died
                    when he was seven years old, and when he was eleven he was sent to the Oratorian
                    school of Juilly, near Meaux, where he stayed exactly five years, and where, as
                    well as afterwards at Bordeaux, he was thoroughly educated. The family had long
                    been connected with the law, and Montesquieu was destined for that profession.
                    He was made to work hard at it notwithstanding his prospects (for his uncle’s
                    office was his by reversion); but, as in his later life, he seems to have
                    tempered much study with not a little society. His father died in 1713, and a
                    year later Montesquieu, or, as he should at this time strictly be called, La
                    Brède, was admitted counsellor of the parliament. In little more than another
                    twelvemonth he married Jeanne Lartigue, an heiress and the daughter of a knight
                    of the order of St Louis, but plain, somewhat ill-educated, and a Protestant.
                    Montesquieu does not seem to have made the slightest pretence of affection or
                    fidelity towards his wife—things which, indeed, the times did not demand; but
                    there is every reason to believe that they lived on perfectly good terms. Like
                    the three previous years, 1716 was an eventful one to him; for his uncle died,
                    leaving him his name, his important judicial office, and his whole fortune. He
                    thus became one of the richest and most influential men in the district. He
                    continued to hold his presidency for twelve years, in the course of which he had
                    much judicial work to perform, as well as the nondescript administrative
                    functions which under the old <hi rend="italic">regime</hi> fell to the
                    provincial parliaments. He was none the less addicted to society, and he took no
                    small part in the proceedings of the Bordeaux Academy, to which he contributed
                    papers on philosophy, politics, and natural science. He also wrote much less
                    serious things, and it was during the earlier years of his presidency that he
                    finished, if he did not begin, the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Persanes.</hi> They
                    were completed before 1721, and appeared in that year anonymously, with Cologne
                    on the title-page, but they were really printed and published at Amsterdam. This
                    celebrated book (the original notion of which is generally set down to a work of
                    Dufresny, the comic author, but which is practically original) would have been
                    surprising enough as coming from a magistrate of the highest dignity in any
                    other time than in the regency of the duke of Orleans, and even as it was it
                    rather scandalized the graver among Montesquieu’s contemporaries. In the guise
                    of letters written by and to two Persians of distinction <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0812-0783"/> travelling in Europe, Montesquieu not only
                    satirized unmercifully the social, political, ecclesiastical, and literary
                    follies of his day in France, but indulged in a great deal of the free writing
                    (so free as very nearly to deserve the term licentious) which was characteristic
                    of the tale-tellers of the time. But what scandalized grave and precise readers
                    naturally attracted the majority, and the <hi rend="italic">Lettres
                    Persanes</hi> were very popular, passing, it is said, through four editions
                    within the year, besides piracies. Then the vogue suddenly ceased, or at least
                    editions ceased for nearly nine years to appear. It is said that a formal
                    ministerial prohibition was the cause of this, and it is not improbable; for,
                    though the regent and Dubois must have enjoyed the book thoroughly, they were
                    both shrewd enough to perceive that underneath its playful exterior there lay a
                    spirit of very inconvenient criticism of abuses in church and state. The fact is
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Persanes</hi> is the first book of what is
                    called the Philosophe movement. The criticism is scarcely yet aggressive, much
                    less destructive, and in Montesquieu’s hands it never became so; but what it
                    might become in the hands of others was obvious enough. It is this precursorship
                    in his own special line which in all probability made Voltaire so jealous of
                    Montesquieu, as well as the advantage which a wealthy and well-born noble of
                    high official position had over himself. It is amusing to find Voltaire
                    describing the <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi> as a “trumpery book,” a “book
                    which anybody might have written easily.” It is not certain that, in its
                    peculiar mixture of light badinage with not merely serious purpose but
                    gentlemanlike moderation, Voltaire could have written it himself, and it is
                    certain that no one else at that time could. The reputation acquired by this
                    book brought Montesquieu much into the literary society of the capital, and he
                    composed for, or at any rate contributed to, one of the coteries of the day the
                    clever but rather rhetorical <hi rend="italic">Dialogue de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sylla</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic

                    which the dictator gives an apology for his conduct. For Mademoiselle de
                    Clermont, a lady of royal blood, a great beauty and a favourite queen of
                    society, he wrote the curious prose poem of the <hi rend="italic">Temple de
                    Gnide.</hi> This is half a narrative, half an allegory, in the semi-classical or
                    rather pseudo-classical taste of the time, decidedly frivolous and dubiously
                    moral, but of no small elegance in its peculiar style. A later <hi rend="italic"
                    >jeu d'esprit</hi> of the same kind, which is almost but not quite certainly
                    Montesquieu’s, is the <hi rend="italic">Voyage</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Paphos,</hi> in which his warmest admirers have found little to
                    praise. In 1725 Montesquieu was elected a member of the Academy, but an almost
                    obsolete rule requiring residence in Paris was appealed to, and the election was
                    annulled. It is doubtful whether a hankering after Parisian society, or an
                    ambition to belong to the Academy, or a desire to devote himself to literary
                    pursuits of greater importance, or simple weariness of not wholly congenial work
                    determined him to give up his Bordeaux office; it is certain that he continued
                    to hold it but a short time after this. It is tolerably clear that he had
                    already begun his great work, and the character of some papers which, about this
                    time, he read at the Bordeaux Academy is graver and less purely curious than his
                    earlier contributions. In 1726 he sold the life tenure of his office, reserving
                    the reversion for his son, and went to live in the capital, returning, however,
                    for half of each year to La Brède. There was now no further formal obstacle to
                    his reception in the Académie Française, but a new one arose. Ill-wishers had
                    brought the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Persanes</hi> specially under the minister
                    Fleury’s attention, and Fleury, a precisian in many ways, was shocked by them.
                    There are various accounts of the way in which the difficulty was got over, but
                    all seem to agre⅛ that Montesquieu made concessions which were more effectual
                    than dignified. He was elected and received in January 1728. Almost immediately
                    afterwards he started on a tour through Europe to observe men, things, and
                    constitutions. He travelled through Austria to Hungary, but was unable to visit
                    Turkey as he had proposed. Then he made for Italy, where he met Chesterfield.
                    They sojourned together at Venice for some time, and a curious story is told of
                    the way in which either a piece of mischief on Chesterfield’s part, or
                    Montesquieu’s own nervousness and somewhat inordinate belief in his own
                    importance, made the latter sacrifice his Venetian notes. At Venice, and
                    elsewhere in Italy, he remained nearly a year, and then journeyed by way of
                    Piedmont and the Rhine to England. Here he stayed for some eighteen months, and
                    acquired an admiration for English character and polity which never afterwards
                    deserted him. He returned, not to Paris, but to La Brède, and to outward
                    appearance might have seemed to be settling down as a squire. He altered his
                    park in the English fashion, made sedulous inquiries into his own genealogy,
                    arranged an entail, asserted, though not harshly, his seignorial rights, kept
                    poachers in awe, and so forth. Nor did he neglect his fortune, but, on the
                    contrary, improved his estates in every way, though he met with much opposition,
                    partly from the dislike of his tenants to new-fangled ways, and partly from the
                    insane economic regulations of the time, which actually prohibited the planting
                    of fresh vineyards.</p>
                <p>Although, however, Montesquieu was enough of a <hi rend="italic">grand
                    seigneur</hi> to be laughed at, and enough of a careful steward of his goods to
                    be reviled for avarice, by those of his contemporaries who did not like him,
                    these matters by no means engrossed or even chiefly occupied his thoughts. In
                    his great study at La Brède (a hall rather than a study, some 60 feet long by 40
                    wide) he was constantly dictating, making abstracts, revising essays, and in
                    other ways preparing his great book. Like some other men of letters, though
                    perhaps no other has had the experience in quite the same degree, he found
                    himself a little hampered by his earlier work. He may have thought it wise to
                    soften the transition from the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Persanes</hi> to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Esprit des Lois,</hi> by interposing a publication graver than
                    the former and less elaborate than the latter. He had always, as indeed was the
                    case with most Frenchmen of his century, been interested in ancient Rome and her
                    history; and he had composed not a few minor tractates on the subject, of which
                    many titles and some examples remain, besides the already-mentioned dialogue on
                    Sylla. All these now took form in the <hi rend="italic">Considérations
                    sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les Causes</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Grandeur et la
                    Décadence des Romains,</hi> which appeared in 1734 at Amsterdam, without the
                    author’s name. This, however, was perfectly well known; indeed, Montesquieu
                    formally presented a copy to the French Academy. Anonymity of title-pages was a
                    fashion of the day which meant nothing. The book was not extraordinarily popular
                    in France at the time. The author’s reputation as a jester stuck to him, and the
                    salons affected to consider the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Persanes</hi> and the
                    new book respectively as the “grandeur ' <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> and the
                    “décadence de Μ. de Montesquieu;” but more serious readers at once perceived its
                    extraordinary merit, and it was eagerly read abroad. A copy of it exists or
                    existed which had the singular fortune to be annotated by Frederick the Great,
                    and to be abstracted from the Potsdam library by Napoleon. It is said, moreover,
                    by competent authorities to have been the most enduringly popular and the most
                    widely read of all its author’s works in his own country, and it has certainly
                    been the most frequently and carefully edited. Its merits are indeed undeniable.
                    Merely scholastic criticism may of course object to it, as to every other book
                    of the time, the absence of the exactness of modern critical inquiry into the
                    facts of history; but this is only a new example of a frequent <hi rend="italic"
                    >ignoratio elenchi.</hi> The virtue of Montesquieu’s book is not in its facts
                    but in its views. It is (putting Bossuet and Vico aside) almost <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n813/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0813-0784"/> the first important essay in the philosophy of
                    history. The point of view is entirely different from that of Bossuet, and it
                    seems entirely improbable that Montesquieu knew anything of Vico. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Grandeur</hi><hi rend="italic">et Décadence</hi> the
                    characteristics of the <hi rend="italic">Esprit des Lois</hi> appear with the
                    necessary subordination to a narrower subject. Two things are especially
                    noticeable in it: a peculiarity of style, and a peculiarity of thought. The
                    style has a superficial defect which must strike every one, and which was not
                    overlooked by those who were jealous of Montesquieu at the time. The page is
                    broken up into short paragraphs of but a few lines each, which look very ugly,
                    which irritate the reader by breaking the sense, and which prepare him to expect
                    an undue and ostentatious sententiousness. The blemish, however, is chiefly
                    mechanical, and, though no editor has hitherto had the perhaps improper audacity
                    so to do, it would be perfectly possible to obliterate it without changing a
                    word. On the other hand, the merits of the expression are very great. It is
                    grave and destitute of ornament, but extraordinarily luminous and full of what
                    would be called epigram, if the word epigram had not a certain connotation of
                    flippancy about it. It is a very short book; for, printed in large type with
                    tolerably abundant notes, it fills but two hundred pages in the last edition of
                    Montesquieu’s works. But no work of the century, except Turgot’s second <hi
                    rend="italic">Sorbonne Discourse,</hi> contains, in proportion to its size, more
                    weighty and original thought on historical subjects, while Montesquieu has over
                    Turgot the immense advantage of style.</p>
                <p>Although, however, this <hi rend="italic">ballon d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">essai,</hi> in the style of his great
                    work, may be said to have been successful, and though much of that work was, as
                    we have seen, in all probability already composed, Montesquieu was in no hurry
                    to publish it. He went on “cultivating the garden” diligently both as a student
                    and as an improving landowner. He had lawsuits, sometimes on his own account,
                    sometimes on that of others, and in one case he won from the city of Bordeaux no
                    less than eleven hundred <hi rend="italic">arpents</hi> of, it is true, the
                    unproductive <hi rend="italic">landes</hi> of the country. He is said to have
                    begun a history of Louis XI., and there is a story that it was completed but
                    burnt by mistake. He wrote the sketch of <hi rend="italic">Lysimaque</hi> for
                    Stanislaus Leczinski; he published new and final editions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Temple de Gnide,</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Lettres
                    Persanes,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Sylla</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Eucrate</hi> (which indeed had never been published, properly
                    speaking). After allowing the <hi rend="italic">Grandeur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et Décadence</hi> to be reprinted without alterations some half dozen times, he
                    revised and corrected it. He also took great pains with the education of his son
                    Charles and his daughter Denise, of whom he was extremely fond. He frequently
                    visited Paris, where his favourite resorts were the salons of Madame de Tencin
                    and Madame d’Aiguillon. But all the time he must have been steadily working at
                    his book, indeed, a contemporary accuses him of having only gone into society to
                    pick up materials for it. But it seems that he did not begin the final task of
                    composition till 1743. Two years of uninterrupted work at La Brède finished the
                    greater part of it, and two more the rest. It was finally published at Geneva in
                    the autumn of 1748, in two volumes quarto. The publication was, however,
                    preceded by one of those odd incidents which in literature illustrate Clive’s
                    well-known saying about courts-martial in war. Montesquieu summoned a committee
                    of friends, according to a very common practice, to hear and give an opinion on
                    his work. It was an imposing and certainly not an unfriendly one, consistingof
                    Hénault, Helvétius, the financier Silhouette, the dramatist Saurin, Crébillon
                    the younger, and lastly, Fontenelle,—in fact, all sorts and conditions of
                    literary men. The members of this eminently competent tribunal unanimously,
                    though for different reasons and in different forms of expression, advised the
                    author not to publish a book which has been recently described by a judge of
                    certainly not less competence as “one of the most important books ever written,”
                    and which, when importance of matter and excellence of manner are jointly
                    considered, may be almost certainly ranked as the greatest book of the French
                    18th century.</p>
                <p>Montesquieu, of course, did not take his friends’advice. In such cases no man
                    ever does, and in this case it was certainly fortunate. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Esprit des Lois</hi> represents the reflexions of a singularly clear, original,
                    and comprehensive mind, corrected by forty years’ study of men and books,
                    arranged in accordance with a long deliberated plan, and couched in language of
                    remarkable freshness and idiosyncrasy. The title has been somewhat cavilled at,
                    and, like that of the <hi rend="italic">Considérations,</hi> it gave a handle to
                    the somewhat malicious frivolity of the salons. But if it had been preserved in
                    full it would have escaped much of the criticism which it has received. In the
                    original editions it runs <hi rend="italic">I.’Esprit</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Lois:</hi><hi rend="italic">ou</hi><hi rend="italic">du Rapport</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">que les Lois doivent</hi><hi rend="italic">avoir</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">avec</hi><hi rend="italic">la Constitution</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de chaque Gouvernement, les Moeurs, le Climat, la Religion, le Commerce,
                    etc.</hi> It consists of thirty-one books, which in some editions are grouped in
                    six parts. This division into parts is known to have entered into the author’s
                    original plan, but he seems to have changed his mind about it. Speaking
                    summarily, the first part, containing eight books, deals with law in general and
                    with forms of government; the second, containing five, with military
                    arrangements, with taxation, &amp;c.; the third, containing six, with manners
                    and customs, and their dependence on climatic conditions; the fourth, containing
                    four, with economic matters; and the fifth, containing three, with religion. The
                    last five books, forming a kind of supplement, deal specially with Roman,
                    French, and feudal law. The most noteworthy peculiarity of the book to a cursory
                    reader lies in the section dealing with effects of climate, and this indeed was
                    almost the only characteristic which the vulgar took in, probably because it was
                    easily susceptible of parody and <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">absurdum.</hi> But this theory is but the
                    least part of the claims of the book to attention. Its vast and careful
                    collection of facts, the novelty and brilliancy of the generalizations founded
                    on them, the constructive spirit which penetrates it, its tolerance, its placid
                    wisdom lighted up by vivacious epigram, could only escape the most careless
                    reader. The singular spirit of moderation which distinguishes its views on
                    politics and religion was indeed rather against it than in its favour in France,
                    and Helvétius, who was as outspoken as he was good-natured, had definitely
                    assigned this as the reason of his unfavourable judgment. On the other hand, if
                    not destructive it was sufficiently critical, and it thus raised enemies on more
                    than one side. Montesquieu was thought too English in his ideas by some, the
                    severe defenders of orthodoxy considered him latitudinarian, and one zealous
                    Jansenist informed him that he was “a pig.” It was long suspected, but is now
                    positively known, that the book (not altogether with the goodwill of the pope)
                    was put on the Index, and the Sorbonne projected, though it did not carry out, a
                    regular censure. To all these objectors the author replied in a masterly <hi
                    rend="italic">défense',</hi> and there seems to be no foundation for the late
                    and scandalous stories which represent him as having used Madame de Pompadour’s
                    influence to suppress criticism. The fact was that, after the first snarlings of
                    envy and incompetence had died away, he had little occasion to complain. Even
                    Voltaire, who was his decided enemy, was forced at length to speak in public, if
                    not in private, complimentarily of the <hi rend="italic">Esprit,</hi> and from
                    all parts of Europe the news of success arrived.</p>
                <p>Montesquieu enjoyed his triumph rather at La Brède than at Paris. He was becoming
                    an old man, and, unlike Fontenelle<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n814/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0814-0785"/>, he does not seem to have preserved in old age
                    the passion for society which had marked his youth. A rather dubious
                    description, published long after his death, represents him as “wandering in his
                    woods from morn to night with a white cotton nightcap on his head, and a vine
                    prop on his shoulder.” This, in the florid language of its time (the Republican
                    period), is probably only an imaginative expression of his known interest in
                    managing his estate. But he certainly spent much of his later years in the
                    country, though he sometimes visited Paris, and on one visit had the
                    opportunity, which he is likely to have enjoyed, of procuring the release of his
                    admirer La Beaumelle from an imprisonment which La Beaumelle had suffered at the
                    instance of Voltaire. He is said also to have been instrumental in obtaining a
                    pension for Piron. Indeed, indigent or unlucky men of letters found in him a
                    constant protector, and that not merely at the royal expense. Nor did he by any
                    means neglect literary composition. The curious little romance of <hi
                    rend="italic">Arsace et Ismenie,</hi> a short and unfinished treatise on Taste,
                    many of his published <hi rend="italic">Pensées,</hi> and much unpublished
                    matter date from the period subsequent to the <hi rend="italic">Esprit des
                    Lois.</hi> He did not, however, live many years after the appearance of his
                    great work. At the end of 1754 he visited Paris, with the intention of getting
                    rid of the lease of his house there and finally retiring to La Brède. He was
                    shortly after taken ill with an attack of fever, which seems to have affected
                    the lungs, and in less than a fortnight he died, on 10th February 1755, aged
                    sixty-six. He was buried in the church of Saint Sulpice with little pomp, and
                    the Revolution obliterated all trace of his remains.</p>
                <p>The literary and philosophical merits of Montesquieu and his position, actual and
                    historical, in the literature of France and of Europe, form a subject of rather
                    unusual interest in its kind. At the beginning of this century the vicomte de
                    Bonald classed him with Racine and Bossuet, as the object of a “religious
                    veneration” among Frenchmen. But Bonald was not quite a suitable spokesman for
                    France, and it may be doubted whether the author of the <hi rend="italic">Esprit
                    des Lois</hi> has ever really occupied any such position in his own country. For
                    a generation after nis death he remained indeed the idol and the great authority
                    of the moderate reforming party in France, and at such times as that party
                    recovered power during the revolutionary period Montesquieu recovered vogue with
                    it. But the tendency of the century and a quarter which have passed since his
                    death has been to reduce the numbers and position of this party ever more and
                    more, and Montesquieu is not often quotable, or quoted, either by Republicans,
                    Bonapartiste, or Legitimists, at the present day. Again, his serious works
                    contain citation of or allusion to a vast number of facts, and the exact (let it
                    be hoped that posterity will not call it the pettifogging) criticism of our time
                    challenges the accuracy of these facts. Although he was really the founder, or
                    at least one of the founders, of the sciences of comparative politics and of the
                    philosophy of history, his descendants and followers in these sciences think
                    they have outgrown him. In France his popularity has always been dubious and
                    contested. It is a singular thing that, until within the last decade, there has
                    been no properly edited edition of his works, and nothing even approaching a
                    complete biography of him, the place of the latter being occupied by the meagre
                    and rhetorical <hi rend="italic">Eloges</hi> of the last century. He is, his
                    chief admirers assert, hardly read at all in France to-day, and a tolerable
                    familiarity with modern French literature enables its possessor to corroborate
                    this by first-hand knowledge, to the effect that no writer of equal eminence is
                    so little quoted. The admirers just mentioned attempt to explain the fact by
                    confessing that Montesquieu, great as he is, is not altogether great according
                    to French principles. It is not only that he is an Anglo-maniac, but that he is
                    rather English than French in style and thought. His work, at least the <hi
                    rend="italic">Esprit,</hi> is lacking in the proportion and the almost
                    ostentatious lucidity of arrangement which a Frenchman demands. His sentences
                    are often enigmatical, and suggestive rather than clear. He is almost entirely
                    dispassionate in politics, but he lacks the unswerving deductive consistency
                    which Frenchmen love in that science. His wit, it is said, is quaint and a
                    little provincial, his style irregular and in no definite <hi rend="italic"
                    >genre.</hi></p>
                <p>Some of these things may be allowed to exist and to be defects in Montesquieu,
                    but they are balanced by merits which render them almost insignificant. Of the
                    minor works, which are on the whole rather unworthy of their author, nothing
                    need be said here. In the few <hi rend="italic">Pensées,</hi> and in detached
                    thoughts of the same kind scattered about the tolerably numerous letters which
                    have reached us, there is much acuteness and point, as also in some of the best
                    sentences of the <hi rend="italic">Considérations</hi> and of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Esprit.</hi> But no one would put Montesquieu as a <hi
                    rend="italic">pensée,</hi> or maxim, writer beside La Rochefoucauld and Joubert,
                    Pascal and Vauvenargues. It is on his three principal works that his fame does
                    and must rest. Each one of these is a masterpiece in its kind. It is doubtful
                    whether the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Persanes</hi> yield at their best either
                    in wit or in giving lively pictures of the time to the best of Voltaire’s
                    similar work, though they are more unequal. There is, moreover, the great
                    difference between Montesquieu and Voltaire that the former is a rational
                    reformer, and not a mere <hi rend="italic">persifleur</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >frondeur,</hi> to whom faultfinding is more convenient for showing off his wit
                    than acquiescence. Of course this last description does not fully or always
                    describe Voltaire, but it often does. It is seldom or never applicable to
                    Montesquieu. Only one of Voltaire’s own charges against the book and its author
                    must be fully allowed. He is said to have replied to a friend who urged him to
                    give up his habit of sneering at Montesquieu, “il est coupable de lèse-poesie,”
                    and this is true. Not only are Montesquieu’s remarks on poetry (he himself
                    occasionally wrote verses, and very bad ones) childish, but he is never happy in
                    purely literary appreciation. The <hi rend="italic">Considérations</hi> are
                    noteworthy, not only for the complete change of style (which from the light and
                    mocking tone of the <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi> becomes grave, weighty, and
                    sustained, with abundance of striking expression), but for the profundity and
                    originality of the views, and for the completeness with which the author carries
                    out his plan. These words—except, perhaps, the last clause—apply with increasing
                    force to the <hi rend="italic">Esprit des Lois.</hi> The book has been accused
                    of desultonness, but this arises, in part at least, from a misapprehension of
                    the author’s design. At the same time, it is impossible to say that the
                    equivocal meaning of the word ‘ ’ law,” which has misled so many reasoners, has
                    not sometimes misled Montesquieu himself. For the most part, however, he keeps
                    the promise of his sub-title (given above) with fidelity, and applies it with
                    exhaustive care. It is only in the last few books, which have been said to be a
                    kind of appendix, that something of irrelevancy suggests itself. The real
                    importance of the <hi rend="italic">Esprit</hi><hi rend="italic">des Lois,</hi>
                    however, is not that of a formal treatise on law, or even on polity. It is that
                    of an assemblage of the most fertile, original, and inspiriting views on legal
                    and political subjects, put in language of singular suggestiveness and vigour,
                    illustrated by examples which are always apt and luminous, permeated by the
                    spirit of temperate and tolerant desire for human improvement and happiness, and
                    almost unique in its entire freedom at once from doctrinairianism, from
                    visionary enthusiasm, from egotism, and from an undue spirit of system. As for
                    the style, no one who does not mistake the definition of that much used and much
                    misused word can deny it to Montesquieu. He has in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Esprit</hi> little ornament, but his composition is wholly admirable. Every now
                    and then there are reminiscences, perhaps a little more close than is necessary,
                    of the badinage of the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Persanes,</hi> but these are
                    rare, and the author’s wit is for the most used only to lighten his pages. Y et
                    another great peculiarity of this book, as well as of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Considérations,</hi> has to be noticed. The genius of the author for
                    generalization is so great, his instinct in political science so sure, that even
                    the falsity of his premises frequently fails to vitiate his conclusions. He has
                    known wrong, but he has thought right.</p>
                <p>The sole edition of Montesquieu'which need be mentioned here is that of Edouard
                    Laboulaye (7 vols., Paris, 1875-1879), the sole biography that of Louis Vian
                    (Paris, second edition, 1879). From the latter the facts of the above notice are
                    principally drawn. The bibliography of Montesquieu’s published works is not of
                    any special interest, but in respect of <hi rend="italic">anecdota</hi> he
                    occupies a singular position. There is known to exist at La Brède a great mass
                    of MSS. materials for the <hi rend="italic">Esprit des Lois,</hi> additional <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres Persanes,</hi> essays and fragments of all kinds, diaries,
                    letters, notebooks, and so forth. The present possessors, however, who represent
                    Montesquieu, though not in the direct male line, have hitherto refused
                    permission to examine these to all editors and critics, though the publication
                    of some of them has been vaguely promised. At present they are chiefly known by
                    a paper contributed nearly half a century ago to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> of the Academy of Agen (1834). (O. SA.)</p>
