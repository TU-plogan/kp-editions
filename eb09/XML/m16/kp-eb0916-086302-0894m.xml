                    the almost complete absence of ritual in the Moslem worship, the mosque, at
                    least in its earlier forms, is one of the simplest of all religious
                    buildings,—its normal arrangement being an open court <hi rend="italic"

                    during the first half-century after the Flight, but now as a rule no mosque is
                    without at least one. From the upper gallery of this the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moedhdhin</hi> announces to the faithful the times for prayer,—five times
                    during the day, and twice at night. Blind men are generally selected for this
                    office, so that they may not overlook the neighbouring houses.</p>
                <p>Most mosques have endowed property, which is administered by a warden <hi
                    rend="italic">(Nazir),</hi> who also appoints the imâms-and other officials. The
                    larger mosques have two imâms: one is called (in Arabia and Egypt) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Khatib,</hi> and he preaches the sermon on Fridays (the Moslem
                    Sabbath); the other, the <hi rend="italic">Râtib,</hi> reads the Koran, and
                    recites the five daily prayers, standing close to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mihrdb,</hi> and leading; the congregation, who repeat the prayers with him,
                    and closely follow his postures. The imâms do not form a priestly sect; they
                    generally have other occupations, such as teaching in a school or keeping a
                    shop, and may at any time be dismissed by the warden, in which case they lose
                    the title of imâm. Doorkeepers and attendants, to sweep the floor, trim the
                    lamps, and perform other menial offices, are attached to each mosque, in numbers
                    varying according to its size and endowment. Moslem women, as a rule, are
                    expected to say their prayers at home, but in some few mosques they are admitted
                    to one part specially screened off for them. This is the case in the mosque of
                    Sitta Zainab in Cairo. In the A⅛s⅛ mosque at Jerusalem there is a latticed
                    balcony for the women, who can see without being visible to the male worshippers
                    below.</p>
                <p>The greatest possible splendour both of material and workmanship is often
                    lavished on the building and its <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0895-0864"/> fittings. The whole outside is frequently
                    decorated with the most elaborate surface-carving in stone or marble,—the
                    pavement of the richest marbles, inlaid in intricate patterns, the walls
                    panelled in a similar way, or decorated with the most minute mosaics of glass,
                    mother-of-pearl, agates and other costly stones. The central niche and the
                    pulpit are of special magnificence; and, if the latter is of wood, it is often
                    covered with delicate ivory carvings, and inlay of pearl and ebony. Very
                    beautiful surface-ornament, executed in hard stucco, and enriched with gold and
                    colours, is used to decorate arches, wall surfaces, and the pendentives of
                    domes, which latter generally have the so-called “stalactite” form of
                    ornament—one of great beauty and complexity. The woodwork of doors, screens, and
                    ceilings is frequently very gorgeous with carving, inlay, and elaborate
                    painting; the whole of the doors outside are often covered with very delicate
                    pierced and embossed work in bronze, or more rarely iron. The magnificent tiles
                    from Persia, Damascus, and Rhodes, enamelled in brilliant blue, green, and red,
                    on a white ground, are often used to cover the walls. Traceried windows in
                    pierced marble or stucco work often occur; these are filled with brilliant
                    coloured glass, always in very small pieces, forming a transparent mosaic of
                    jewel-like richness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>Some mosques, especially the Karûbîn mosque at Fez in Morocco, possess a
                    collection of magnificent illuminated MSS., chiefly copies of the Koran and
                    other religious books; in the large collection at Fez, MSS. of Aristotle’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> with the works of Averroes and other
                    commentators, exist in considerable number; some few of the MSS. are as early as
                    the 10th century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plans of Mosques.—</hi> Considerable diversities exist in the
                    plan and arrangement of mosques in various countries, either because the Moslem
                    conquerors adopted to some extent the existing buildings and architecture of the
                    conquered people, or on account of the new mosque being built on a site already
                    cramped by surrounding buildings. The first of these causes influenced to some
                    extent the mosques of India, and to a much greater extent those of European
                    Turkey. The second cause, the cramped site, especially in Cairo, created a
                    special type of plan. Nevertheless, when free from such disturbing influences,
                    there is one normal plan adopted, at least in early times, by the Moslems in all
                    countries—from India to Cordova, and from northern Syria to Egypt.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The great mosque of <hi

                    >Medina.</hi></p></note> This normal plan is a very simple one, and is the
                    natural product of a country like Arabia, unskilled in architecture, where land
                    was worth but little, and timber very scarce. (See fig. 1.)</p>
                <p>Though not the earliest, the great mosque of Cordova is the most magnificent, and
                    in the main the best preserved, of this typical form.<note anchored="true"

                    begun in 784-5 by the caliph 'Abd al-Rahman I. (Abderame) and completed by his
                    son Hisham in 793-4; though it was afterwards enlarged, and then to some extent
                    injured by additions—the work of the Christians, who made it into a cathedral—
                    yet it still remains but little altered, except by the loss of its magnificent
                    carved and inlaid wood ceiling and sumptuous <hi rend="italic">Mimbar.</hi> It
                    consists (omitting recent additions) of two main parts, a large cloistered open
                    court, with at one side a covered building for prayer. In one respect only it
                    differs from the usual plan: the open court is generally much larger than the
                    roofed space, whereas at Cordova it is smaller. For the sake of brevity this
                    arrangement will, in the rest of the article, be referred to as the “normal
                    plan.” In spite of neglect and alterations this mosque is still one of the most
                    imposing buildings in the world. The long ranges of aisles, nineteen from east
                    to west and thirty-one from north to south—on their marble columns the spoils of
                    many a Greek and Roman temple—seem to stretch almost endlessly in every
                    direction, and each range of pillars appears to lose itself in the gloom of
                    distance, so that from no point can any idea be formed of what is the real size
                    of the whole building. The side towards the court was quite open, and all over
                    the court orange-trees were planted at regular intervals, continuing the lines
                    of the columns within, and set at the same distances apart; so that aisles of
                    orange-trees in long ranges covered the open space, just as the marble columns
                    did within. No words can describe the jewel-like splendour of the mosaics in the
                    sanctuary, which in complicated Arabesque patterns, mixed with elaborate Cufic
                    inscriptions, cover the walls and even the arches, which cross and recross each
                    other in the most fanciful and daring way, forming a sort of aisle round three
                    sides of the sanctuary. There is documentary evidence to show that these glass
                    mosaics, though of thoroughly Oriental design, are, like those in the mosques of
                    Jerusalem and Damascus, the work of Christian artists from Byzantium.</p>
                <p>The most important early mosques were all built on this normal plan, with but
                    very slight variations. The following are some of the finest examples of this
                    type :—</p>
                <p>Mosque of 'Amr, Old Cairo, begun in 642 A.D., but much enlarged at the end of the
                    7th century, and afterwards partly rebuilt (see fig. 1).</p>
                <p>Mosque of Sidi-'Okba at Kairawân in Tunis, latter part of 7th century.</p>
                <p>Mosque of Sidi-'Okba near Biskra in Algeria, about 684. Mosque of Edris at Fez in
                    Morocco, end of 8th century.</p>
                <p>Great mosque of Damascus, 708.</p>
                <p>Great mosque of Cordova, 784-794 (described above).</p>
                <p>Mosque of Ibn Τύΐύη, Cairo, 879.</p>
                <p>Mosque of Al-Azhar, Cairo, begun about 970.</p>
                <p>Great mosque at Old Delhi, 1196-1235.</p>
                <p>The first of these, the mosque of 'Amr (see Coste, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Architecture</hi><hi rend="italic">Arabe),</hi> is now in a partly ruined
                    condition. Its east wall probably still retains some of the original work of
                    'Amr, who in 642 built a small mosque on the site of the present one. But little
                    remains except its fine antique marble columns to tell of its former splendour
                    in mosaic, stucco reliefs enriched with painting, and magnificent inlaid wood
                    ceilings and screens. According to Makrizi, it once contained 1290 MSS. of the
                    Koran, and was lighted by 18,000 lamps. In general effect, like all mosques of
                    this simple and extensive plan, it is very stately, from the vast size of its
                    area, and its great number of closely-ranked columns and arches, the latter
                    being of many forms—pointed, semicircular, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n896/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0896-0865"/> and horse-shoe. Fig. 1 gives its plan as a good
                    typical specimen of this normal type of mosque.</p>
                <p>The mosque at Kairawan, Tunis, said to have been founded by '0kba (see <hi
                    rend="italic">supra,</hi> p’ 567), follows the normal plan, with 439 fine
                    antique marble columns, horse-shoe arches, some pointed and others round, and
                    flat ceiling of dark wood, once magnificently painted. Its sanctuary is ten
                    aisles deep by seventeen wide. In the centre of the court is a marble fountain
                    over the sacred well, said to communicate with the spring Zemzem at Mecca. Its
                    minaret, a rather later addition, is very massive and stately; it is square, in
                    three stories, each battlemented, the walls battering considerably. The
                    sanctuary is domed, and the <hi rend="italic">Mihràb</hi> is decorated with
                    magnificent tiles. Adjoining the sanctuary is a small room for a library.</p>
                <p>The other great mosque of Sidi-Okba, built soon after his death in 682, and
                    containing his tomb, is in Algeria near Biskra; it much resembles the Kairawan
                    mosque, but is less splendid, some of the columns being not of marble but of
                    baked clay decorated with painting.</p>
                <p>The great mosque of Fez, about the same date, is also very large and magnificent,
                    with <hi rend="italic">Mimbar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mihràb</hi> richly
                    ornamented with minute mosaics; it has also a fine inlaid and painted wood
                    ceiling, and some elaborately-carved doors. It still possesses a fine library.
                    (See Amici, <hi rend="italic">Journey to Fez,</hi> 1878.)</p>
                <p>The great mosque of Damascus was built on the site of a Christian basilica,
                    erected by Theodosius in 395-408. From 636, when the Arabs conquered Damascus,
                    until 708 this basilica was used jointly both by the Christians and the Moslems.
                    The basilica was then pulled down, and the present mosque built by the caliph
                    Walid. It has the normal plan, and is 508 feet by 320 feet. Its sanctuary is
                    only three aisles deep; it has a central dome on the south or Mecca side, and on
                    the east and west a largo porch. Samhudi records that one of the conditions of
                    peace concluded between the Byzantine emperor and Walid was that the emperor
                    should furnish a certain number of workers in mosaic for the decoration of the
                    mosques at Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, and Damascus.</p>
                <p>The mosque of Ahmed Ibn Τΰΐύη, in Cairo, completed in 879, has the normal plan,
                    with the exceptional addition of an outer court, or wide passage, running round
                    three sides of the rectangle,— probably to cut it off completely from the noise
                    of the surrounding streets. It is built of brick, coated with delicate reliefs
                    in stucco, once enriched with painting. The <hi rend="italic">Mihràb</hi> has
                    beautiful mosaics, and the <hi rend="italic">Mimbar</hi> is a marvel of delicate
                    carving and inlay. The pillars and arches are of brick enriched with elaborate
                    stucco-work. It has a very remarkable minaret on the west side, with a spiral
                    external staircase. The architect was a Copt, an Egyptian Christian. It is
                    perhaps the earliest important building in which the pointed arch is largely
                    used.</p>
                <p>The mosque Al-Azhar, “The Splendid,” was built in the centre of New Cairo about
                    970 and, though frequently restored, has in the main been little altered. It is
                    on the normal plan, with ranges of pointed and slightly horse-shoe arches,
                    supported on more than 400 fine antique columns of marble and porphyry, chiefly
                    from Roman buildings. Among its later decorations are magnificent wall-coverings
                    of the most beautiful Persian tiles. It has a special interest in being the
                    chief university of the Moslem world, containing some thousands of students <hi
                    rend="italic">(mujàwirin),</hi> for whom certain parts of the mosque <hi
                    rend="italic">{Riwàk)</hi> are screened off, according to the country from whicn
                    they come. Thus special parts are reserved for natives of the various provinces
                    of Egypt, of Morocco, Syria, Arabia, India, Turkey, &amp;c. Each student can, if
                    he is too poor to hire lodgings, live, eat, and sleep in the mosque. Each has a
                    large chest in which to keep his clothes and books; these are piled against the
                    walls to a height of seven or eight feet. The students pay no fees, but the
                    richer ones give presents to the lecturers, who sit on the matting in various
                    parts of the sanctuary or cloister, while the students sit round each lecturer
                    in a circle. The usual course of study lasts for three years, though some
                    students remain for much longer. The chief of the lecturers, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sheikh al-Azhar,</hi> receives about £100 a year, the others
                    little or nothing, as regular pay. The Koran, sacred and secular law, logic,
                    poetry, and arithmetic, with some medicine and geography, are the chief subjects
                    of study.</p>
                <p>Of mosques which are not built on the normal plan the earliest and most important
                    are the two in the Hariιm al-Sherif (High Sanctuary) at Jerusalem (see vol.
                    xiii. p. 642).</p>
                <p>The Kubbet al-Sakhra (Dome of the Rock), popularly, but wrongly, called the
                    “Mosque of Omar,” is not, strictly speaking, a mosque at all. It belongs rather
                    to the class of ‘‘ shrines, ”—generally small square, circular, or octagonal
                    buildings erected over some sacred spot or tomb. It is a very beautiful
                    building, with high central dome, and double ambulatory round it,—the outer wall
                    being octagonal, and the dome, with the pillars that carry it, circular in plan.
                    It is decorated in a vety sumptuous way by inlay of rich marbles and very
                    splendid glass mosaics. The outer wall and most of the internal mosaics are
                    later than the dome itself. Its windows of mosaic-like stained glass are very
                    beautiful, and are almost the only Moslem example of the use of lead “cames,”
                    instead of the bits of glass being fitted into marble or stucco tracery; this,
                    as well as the glass wall-mosaics, was probably the work of Byzantine
                    artificers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See De

                <p>The mosque within the same enclosure, called Al-Aksâ, is entirely roofed, with
                    many aisles and columns, having no open court, quite unlike the usual
                    arrangement of a mosque.</p>
                <p>The finest and largest group of mosques is at Cairo. Many of them are very
                    complicated buildings, with no resemblance to the normal plan before described.
                    In some cases a hospital, a school, a court of justice, a monastery, or very
                    frequently a tomb, forms part of the building, and causes considerable
                    modifications in its plan.</p>
                <p>The finest of these is the mosque of the sultan Hasan, built between 1356 and
                    1359 (fig. 2), a good specimen of a mosque built in a crowded site with a wing
                    for a tomb. In plan it is cruciform, the central part being open to the sky; the
                    eastern arm of the cross is the sanctuary, and farther east is the stately domed
                    tomb of the sultan himself. All four arms of the cross are vaulted in stone with
                    a plain waggon vault. Its magnificent entrance on the north, with an enormously
                    high arch, decorated with stalactite reliefs in stone, is set somewhat askew to
                    follow the line of the old street. It has two minarets, one of great height and
                    grandeur.</p>
                <p>The Muristân Kalaùn is a combination of hospital, tomb, and mosque,—an enormous
                    buildingcovering a very large area. It was built by Sultan Kalaùn at the
                    beginning of the 14th century; his tomb, built 1320, which forms part of this

                    list of the mosques of Cairo would occupy a large space; they are over four
                    hundred in number, and are mostly remarkable for some beauty in design or
                    richness in their ornament and material.</p>
                <p>The mosque of Ibrahim Agha should specially be noted for the splendid Persian
                    tiles which cover the east wall of its sanctuary; these are of the end of the
                    16th century, and are unrivalled in beauty both of drawing and colour. The tiles
                    are 9 inches square, and work into large designs with very graceful sweeping
                    curves of foliage, drawn with the greatest skill, and painted in the most
                    brilliant yet harmonious colours—perfect masterpieces of coloured decoration.

                <p>The so-called “Tombs of the Caliphs," really tomb-mosques of Egyptian sultans,
                    are a large group of very fine buildings, less than a mile outside the walls of
                    Cairo. The largest is that of Sultan Barkιik, with a superb dome and two stately
                    minarets. In addition to an extensive open court, it has on each side of the
                    sanctuary a magnificent tomb-chamber containing the bodies of the sultan
                    himself, who died in 1399, and various members of his family.</p>
                <p>The most beautiful and graceful of all these mosques is that which contains the
                    tomb of Sultan Kâit-Bey, who died in 1496; its dome is entirely covered
                    externally with beautiful and delicate reliefs carved in stone. Its minaret is a
                    masterpiece of invention and extreme grace of outline, combined with the richest
                    and most exquisite detail; like most of the Cairo mosques, its exterior is
                    ornamented by bands of red stone alternating with the yellow Mokattam limestone.
                    Inside, marble inlaid pavements and mosaic on the walls, with decorations in
                    painted stucco and wood carved and inlaid give extreme splendour to the
                    building. Fig. 3 gives its plan as a typical example of the combined mosque and
                    tomb, —the latter the more important. The mosque inside the walls of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n897/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0897-0866"/> Cairo, built by the same sultan, is also very
                    beautiful, and remarkable for its carvings and mosaics.</p>
                <p>It should be observed that the magnificent mosques of Egypt, as of other
                    countries, owe little or nothing to the native architectural talentof the Arabs
                    themselves. Their own buildings at the time of the Prophet were of the simplest
                    and rudest description, but they were always ready to make use of the
                    architectural skill and constructive power of the people they conquered.</p>
                <p>The earlier buildings of Egypt are mainly the product of Coptic and Byzantine
                    skill,while rather later the art of Persia, both in its general designs and
                    details of workmanship, exercised a paramount influence over the whole Moslem
                    world. Another influence must not be forgotten, that of French and English
                    Gothic, produced by the buildings erected by the crusaders during their
                    occupation of Palestine. One of the Cairo mosques, that of Kalaun, possesses a
                    fine arched doorway, taken from a Christian church at Acre—a fine specimen of
                    Early English work, which would not be out of place in Salisbury Cathedral.
                    Moslem translations of the clustered jamb-shafts and deep arch-mouldings of this
                    style often occur.</p>
                <p>The rest of northern Africa contains many mosques of great size and splendour;
                    among these the most important, in addition to those already mentioned as having
                    the normal plan, are—(1) the mosquetomb of'Abdallah b. Wadib in Kairawan, Tunis,
                    a very large building, containing several courts and cloisters, dating from the
                    same early period as the other great mosque in Kairawan; its minaret is covered
                    outside with fine blue and green tiles; (2) the great mosque of Algiers, 10th
                    century; and (3) that of Tlemcen, in the extreme west of Algeria, built in the
                    middle of the 12th century; this has a very splendid pavement, partly composed
                    of Algerian onyx, and a beautiful bronze chandelier, 8 feet in diameter, given
                    by Sultan Yarmorak, 1248-83.</p>
                <p>In Spain, at Zahra near Cordova, was one of the grandest of the early mosques,
                    finished in 941; but nothing of it now exists. Several churches in Spain were
                    originally built as mosques, such as S. Cristo de la Luz at Toledo, a small,
                    nearly square building, roofed by dome-like vaulting on marble pillars.</p>
                <p>In Persia but little now remains of the magnificent early mosques, built with
                    such splendour, especially during the reign of Hârùn al-Rashid. At Erzeroum
                    there is a fine mosque, combined with tomb and hospital, almost Early Gothic in
                    style, dating from the 13th century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    At Tabriz there is another church-like mosque, evidently the work of Byzantine
                    builders; according to Texier, this belongs to the 16th century, but it is
                    probably two or three hundred years earlier.</p>
                <p>The mosque of Houen, near Caesarea in Cilicia, is a fine large rectangular
                    building, covered with low domes on square piers. It dates from the second half
                    of the 12th century.</p>
                <p>At Tchekirghe near Broussa is a very remarkable mosque—that of Murad I., built in
                    the 13th century, almost in the style of contemporary Italian Gothic. Its main
                    façade bears an extraordinary resemblance to one of the earlier Sienese
                    palaces.</p>
                <p>The later capital of Persia—Ispahan—became the centre of the highest development
                    of the Persian arts under Shah 'Abbâs I., 1585-1629; to this period belongs the
                    splendid mosque called Masjid Shah, a strangely-planned building of great size,
                    enriched in the most sumptuous way, inside and out, by wall-coverings of the
                    finest Persian enamelled tiles. The mosque of Sultan Hosein, built as late as
                    1730, preserves much of the old beauty of design and decoration.</p>
                <p>India is especially rich in mosques of great size and beauty. The earlier ones
                    are much influenced by the still older Hindu architecture, and some of the
                    larger mosques are built of materials from the old Jain temples. It is recorded
                    that twenty-seven Hindu temples were destroyed to build the great mosque in Old
                    Delhi, erected 1196 to 1235, which presents a curious mixture of the
                    semi-barbarous Hindu carved work with the more refined and graceful decoration
                    of the Moslem builders. This great mosque is on the normal plan, as is the 13th
                    century mosque at Ajmir, also built on the ruins of a Hindu temple. A whole
                    volume would not suffice to describe the magnificent mosques of India, such as
                    those at Ahmedabad, Mandu, Maldah, Bijapur, Fathipur, and countless others. The
                    introduction in the 17th century of Florentine marble and mosaic workers
                    produced a new and very splendid style of building, of which the “pearl mosque”
                    and the Taj Mehal at Agra are the finest specimens.</p>
                <p>At Srinagar in Kashmir there is a large and very remarkable mosque of the normal
                    plan, constructed entirely of wood logs, with numerous pillars of deodar pine;
                    it was built by Shah Hamadan, and is an extremely picturesque building. (See
                    Cole, <hi rend="italic">Ancient Buildings in Kashmir,</hi> 1869.)</p>
                <p>In Turkey the mosques are either old Christian basilicas, such as S. Sophia and
                    S. Saviour’s at Constantinople, and the numerous fine early churches of
                    Thessalonica and Trebizond, or else are mostly copies, more or less accurate, of
                    Justinian’s splendid church of S. Sophia, a building which seems to have been
                    enthusiastically admired and appreciated by the Ottoman conquerors. The mosque
                    of Solaimân the Magnificent, 1550-1555, is the finest of these Turkish
                    reproductions of S. Sophia. Another, rather less close a copy, is the mosque of
                    Sultan Ahmed, 1608. None of this latter class are of course earlier than the
                    middle of the 16th century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In the present century Moslem art has produced but little of architectural
                    importance. The great mosque of Al ohammed Ali, on the citadel of Cairo, is the
                    work of a German architect, and though built of rich materials is of small
                    artistic value or interest; it is a large but feebly designed building of the S.
                    Sophia type. Unfortunately European influence seems now to be rapidly destroying
                    the feeling for true art that still survives among Moslem nations.</p>
