                    de</hi> (1760-1828), Spanish dramatist and poet, was the son of N. F. Moratin
                    mentioned below, and was born at Madrid on 10th March 1760. His poetical and
                    artistic tastes were early developed, but his father, keenly alive to the
                    difficulties of the literary calling, caused him to be apprenticed to a
                    jeweller. At the age of eighteen Moratin surprised his friends by winning the
                    second prize of the Academy for a heroic poem on the conquest of Granada, and
                    two years afterwards he attracted still more general attention by a similar
                    success of his <hi rend="italic">Leccion</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetica,</hi> a
                    satire upon the popular poets of the day. Through Jovellanos he was now
                    appointed secretary to Cabarrus on his special mission to France in 1787, and
                    during his stay there he diligently improved his opportunities of becoming
                    acquainted with the contemporary French drama, and of cultivating the
                    acquaintance of men of letters. Of the literary friendships he then formed the
                    most important was that with Goldoni; indeed, Moratin is much more correctly
                    styled “the Spanish Goldoni” than “the Spanish Molière.” On his return to Spain
                    Florida Blanca presented him to a sinecure benefice in the diocese of Burgos;
                    and in 1790 his first play, <hi rend="italic">El Viejo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi><hi rend="italic">la Nina</hi> (The Old Husband and the Young Wife), a
                    highly finished but somewhat dreary verse comedy in three acts, written in 1786,
                    but delayed by objections of the actors, was at length produced at the Teatro
                    del Principe. Its success was only moderate. <hi rend="italic">El</hi><hi

                    >Comedia</hi><hi rend="italic">Nueva,</hi> on the other hand, given at the same
                    theatre two years afterwards, at once became deservedly popular, and had
                    considerable influence in modifying the public taste. It is a short prose comedy
                    in two acts, avowedly intended to expose the follies and absurdities of the
                    contemporary dramatists—the school of Lope de Vega run to seed—who commanded the
                    support of the masses; and it is still read with pleasure for the simple
                    ingenuity of its plot, the liveliness of its dialogue, and the easy grace of its
                    style, while to the student of literature it throws much useful light on the
                    contemporary state of the Spanish drama, and on the reforming aims of the author
                    and his party. In the same year (1792) Florida Blanca was disgraced, but Moratin
                    at once found another patron in Godoy, who provided him with a pension and the
                    means for foreign travel; he accordingly passed through France into England,
                    where he began the free and somewhat incorrect translation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamlet</hi> which was printed in 1798, but which has never been performed. From
                    England he passed to the Low Countries, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, and on
                    his return to the Peninsula in 1796 he received a lucrative post at the Foreign
                    Office. His next appearance in the drama did not take place until 1803, when <hi
                    rend="italic">El Earon</hi> was first publicly exhibited in its present form. It
                    successfully weathered a determined attempt to damn it, and still keeps the
                    stage. It was followed in 1804 by <hi rend="italic">La Mogigata</hi> (The Female
                    Hypocrite), of which imperfect manuscript copies had begun to circulate as early
                    as 1791. It was favourably received, as on the whole it deserved to be, by a
                    public which was now at one with the author as to the canons of his art, and an
                    attempt to suppress it by means of the Inquisition on alleged religious grounds
                    <hi rend="italic">(La Mogigata</hi> being an imitation, a somewhat feeble one,
                    of Molière’s <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe')</hi> was successfully frustrated.
                    Moratin’s last and crowning triumph in the*department of original comedy was
                    achieved in 1806, when <hi rend="italic">El Si de las Ninas</hi> (A Girl’s Yes)
                    was performed night after night to crowded houses, ran through several Spanish
                    editions in a year, and was soon translated into several foreign languages. In
                    1808, on the fall of the Prince of the Peace, Moratin found it necessary to
                    leave Spain, but shortly afterwards he returned and consented to accept the
                    office of royal librarian under Joseph Bonaparte—a false step, which, as the
                    event proved, permanently alienated from him the sympathies of his country, and
                    compelled him to spend almost all the rest of his life in exile. In 1812 his <hi
                    rend="italic">Escuela de</hi><hi rend="italic">los</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Maridos,</hi> a translation and adaptation to the more dignified and stately
                    Spanish standard of Molière’s <hi rend="italic">Ecole</hi><hi rend="italic">des

                    >Lui)</hi> at Barcelona. From 1814 to 1828 Moratin lived in France, principally
                    at Paris, and devoted himself to the preparation of a learned work on the
                    history of the Spanish drama <hi rend="italic">(0rigenes del Teatro
                    Espanol),</hi> which unfortunately stops short of the period of Lope de Vega. He
                    died at Paris on 21st June 1828.</p>
