                    born in Milk Street in the City of London, 7th February 1478. He received the
                    rudiments of education at St Anthony’s School in Threadneedle Street, at that
                    time under Nicolas Holt held to be the best in the city. He was early placed in
                    the household of Cardinal Morton, archbishop of Canterbury. Admission to the
                    cardinal’s family was esteemed a high privilege, and was sought as a school of
                    manners and as an introduction to the world by the sons of the best families in
                    the kingdom. Young Thomas More obtained admission through the influence of his
                    father, Sir Thomas, then a rising barrister and afterwards a justice of the
                    Court of King’s Bench. The usual prognostication of future distinction is
                    attributed in the case of More to Cardinal Morton, “who would often tell the
                    nobles sitting at table with him, where young Thomas waited on him, whosoever

                    in Greek. Learning Greek was not the matter of course which it has since become.
                    Greek was not as yet part of the arts curriculum, and to learn it voluntarily
                    was ill looked upon by the authorities. Those who did so were suspected of an
                    inclination towards novel and dangerous modes of thinking, then rife on the
                    Continent and slowly finding their way to England. More’s father, who intended
                    his son to make a career in his own profession, took the alarm; he removed him
                    from the university without a degree, and entered him at New Inn to commence at
                    once the study of the law. The young man had been kept in a state of humiliating
                    dependence in money matters, having had no allowance made him, and having had to
                    apply to his father even for a pair of new shoes when the old were worn out.
                    This system was pursued by his parents not from niggardliness but on principle;
                    and Thomas More in later years often spoke with approbation of this severe
                    discipline, as having been a means of keeping him from the vulgar dissipations
                    in which his fellow-students indulged. After completing a two-years’ course in
                    New Inn, an Inn of Chancery, More was admitted in February 1496 at Lincoln’s
                    Inn, an Inn of Court. “At that time the Inns of Court and Chancery presented the
                    discipline of a well-constituted university, and, through professors under the
                    name of readers and exercises under the name of mootings, law was systematically
                    taught” (Campbell). In his professional studies More early distinguished
                    himself, so that he was appointed reader-in-law in Furnival’s Inn; but he would
                    not relinquish the studies which had attracted him in Oxford. We find him
                    delivering a lecture to audiences of “all the chief learned of the city of
                    London.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Roper, <hi
                    rend="italic">Life.</hi></p></note> The subject he chose was a compromise
                    between theology and the humanities, being St Augustine’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Civitate.</hi> In this lecture More sought less to
                    expound the theology of his author than to set forth the philosophical and
                    historical contents of the treatise. The lecture-room was a church, St Lawrence
                    Jewry, placed at his disposal by Grocyn, the rector.</p>
                <p>Somewhere about this period of More’s life two things happened which gave in
                    opposite directions the determining impulse to his future career. More’s was one
                    of those highly susceptible natures which take more readily and more eagerly
                    than common minds the impress of that which they encounter on their first
                    contact with men. Two principal forms of thought and feeling were at this date
                    in conflict, rather unconscious than declared, on English soil. Under the
                    denomination of the “old learning,” the sentiment of the Middle Ages and the
                    idea of church authority was established and in full possession of the religious
                    houses, the universities, and the learned professions. The foe that was
                    advancing in the opposite direction, though without the conscience of a hostile
                    purpose, was the new power of human reason animated with the revived sentiment
                    of classicism. In More’s mind both these hostile influences found a congenial
                    home. Each had its turn of supremacy, and in his early years it seemed as if the
                    humanistic influence would gain the final victory. About the age of twenty he
                    was seized with a violent access of devotional rapture. He took a disgust to the
                    world and its occupations, and experienced a longing to give himself over to an
                    ascetic life. He took a lodging near the Charterhouse, and subjected himself to
                    the discipline of a Carthusian monk. He wore a sharp shirt of hair next his
                    skin, scourged himself every Friday and other fasting days, lay upon the bare
                    ground with a log under his head, and allowed himself but four or five hours’
                    sleep. This access of the ascetic malady lasted but a short time, and More
                    recovered to all outward appearance his balance of mind. But he never entirely
                    emancipated himself from the sentiment of devotion, though in later life it
                    exhibited itself in a more rational form. Even when he was chancellor he would
                    take part in church services, walking in their processions with a surplice.
                    This, however, was at a later time. For the moment the balance of his faculties
                    seemed to be restored by a revival of the antagonistic sentiment of humanism
                    which he had imbibed from the Oxford circle of friends, and specially from
                    Erasmus. The dates as regards More’s early life are uncertain, and we can only
                    say that it is possible that the acquaintance with Erasmus might have begun
                    during Erasmus’s first visit to England in 1499. Tradition has dramatized their
                    first meeting into the story given by Cresacre More,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> p.
                    93.</p></note> —that the two happened to sit opposite each other at the lord
                    mayor’s table, that they got into an argument during dinner, and that, in mutual
                    astonishment at each other’s wit and readiness, Erasmus exclaimed, “Aut tu es
                    Morus, aut nullus,” and the other replied, “Aut tu es Erasmus, aut diabolus !”
                    Rejecting this legend, which bears the stamp of fiction upon its face, we have
                    certain evidence of acquaintance between the two men in a letter of Erasmus with
                    the date “Oxford, 29th October 1499.” If we must admit the correctness of the
                    date of <hi rend="italic">Ep.</hi> 14 in the collection of Erasmus’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistolae,</hi> we should have to assume that their acquaintance
                    had begun as early as 1497. Ten years More’s senior, and master of the
                    accomplishments which More was ambitious to acquire, Erasmus could not fail to
                    exercise a powerful influence over the brilliant young Englishman. More’s
                    ingenuous demeanour, quick intelligence, and winning manners fascinated Erasmus
                    from the first, and acquaintance rapidly ripened into warm attachment. This
                    contact with the prince of letters revived in More the spirit of the “new
                    learning,” and he returned with ardour to the study of Greek, which had been
                    begun at Oxford. The humanistic influence was sufficiently strong to save him
                    from wrecking his life in monkish mortification, and even to keep him for a time
                    on the side of the party of progress. He acquired no inconsiderable facility in
                    the Greek language, from which he made and published some translations. His
                    Latin style, though wanting the inimitable ease of Erasmus and often offending
                    against idiom, is yet in copiousness and propriety much above the ordinary Latin
                    of the English scholars of his time.</p>
                <p>More’s attention to the new studies was always subordinate to his resolution to
                    rise in his profession, in which he was stimulated by his father’s example. As
                    early as 1502 he was appointed under-sheriff of the city of London, an office
                    then judicial, and of considerable dignity. He first attracted public attention
                    by his conduct in the parliament of 1504, by his daring opposition to the king’s
                    demand for money. Henry VII. was entitled, according to feudal laws, to a grant
                    on occasion of his daughter’s marriage. But he came to the House of Commons for
                    a much larger sum than he intended to give with his daughter. The members,
                    unwilling as they λvere to vote the money, were afraid to offend the king, till
                    the silence was broken by More, whose speech is said to have moved the House to
                    reduce the subsidy of three-fifteenths which the Government had demanded to
                    £30,000. One of the chamberlains went and told his master that he had been
                    thwarted by a beardless boy. Henry never forgave the audacity; but, for the
                    moment, the only revenge he could take was upon <pb break="no"

                    into the Tower, and he only released him upon payment of a fine of £ 100. Thomas
                    More even found it advisable to withdraw from public life into obscurity. During
                    this period of retirement the old dilemma recurred. One while he devoted himself
                    to the sciences, “perfecting himself in music, arithmetic, geometry, and
                    astronomy, learning the French tongue, and recreating his tired spirits on the
                    viol,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Roper, <hi
                    rend="italic">Life.</hi></p></note> or translating epigrams from the Greek
                    anthology; another while resolving to take priest’s orders.</p>
                <p>From dreams of clerical celibacy he was roused by making acquaintance with the
                    family of John Colt of New Hall, in Essex. The “honest and sweet conversation”
                    of the daughters attracted him, and though his inclination led him to prefer the
                    second he married the eldest, not liking to put the affront upon her of passing
                    her over in favour of her younger sister. The death of the old king in 1507
                    restored him to the practice of his profession, and to that public career for
                    which his abilities specially fitted him. From this time there was scarce a
                    cause of importance in which he was not engaged. His professional income
                    amounted to &lt;£400 a year, equal to £4000 in present money, and, “considering
                    the relative profits of the law and the value of money, probably indicated as
                    high a station as £10,000 at the present day” (Campbell). It was not long before
                    he attracted the attention of the young king and of Wolsey. The Latin verses
                    which he presented to Henry on the occasion of his coronation did not deserve
                    particular notice amid the crowd of congratulatory odes. But the spirit with
                    which he pleaded before the Star Chamber in a case of the Crown <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> the Pope recommended him to the royal favour, and marked
                    him out for employment. More obtained in this case judgment against the crown.
                    Henry, who was present in person at the trial, had the good sense not to resent
                    the defeat, but took the counsel to whose advocacy it was due into his service.
                    In 1514 More was made master of the requests, knighted, and sworn a member of
                    the privy council. He was repeatedly employed on embassies to the Low Countries,
                    and was for a long time stationed at Calais as agent in the shifty negotiations
                    carried on by Wolsey with the court of France. In 1519 he was compelled to
                    resign his post of under-sheriff to the city and his private practice at the
                    bar. In 1521 he was appointed treasurer of the exchequer, and in the parliament
                    of 1523 he was elected speaker. The choice of this officer rested nominally with
                    the House itself, but in practice was always dictated by the court. Sir Thomas
                    More was pitched upon by the court on this occasion in order that his popularity
                    with the Commons might be employed to carry the money grant for which Wolsey
                    asked. To the great disappointment of the court More remained firm to the
                    popular cause, and it was greatly owing to his influence that its demands were
                    resisted. From this occurrence may be dated the jealousy which the cardinal
                    began to exhibit towards More. Wolsey made an attempt to get him out of the way
                    by sending him as ambassador to Spain. More defeated the design by a personal
                    appeal to the king, alleging that the climate would be fatal to his health.
                    Henry, who saw through the artifice, and was already looking round for a more
                    popular successor to Wolsey, made the gracious answer that he would employ More
                    otherwise. In 1525 More was appointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and
                    no pains were spared to attach him to the court. The king frequently sent for
                    him into his closet, and discoursed with him on astronomy, geometry, and points
                    of divinity. This growing favour, by which many men would have been carried
                    away, did not impose upon More. He dis couraged the king’s advances, showed
                    reluctance to go to the palace, and seemed constrained when there. Then the king
                    began to come himself to More’s house at Chelsea, and would dine with him
                    without previous notice. Roper mentions one of these visits, when the king after
                    dinner walked in the garden by the space of an hour, holding his arm round
                    More’s neck. Roper afterwards congratulated his father-in-law on the
                    distinguished honour which had been shown him. “I thank our Lord,” was the
                    reply, “I find his grace my very good lord indeed; and I believe he doth as
                    singularly favour me as any subject within this realm. Howbeit, son Roper, I may
                    tell thee I have no cause to be proud thereof, for if my head would win him a
                    castle in France, it should not fail to go.” As a last resource More tried the
                    expedient of silence, dissembling his wit and affecting to be dull. This had the
                    desired effect so far that he was less often sent for. But it did not alter the
                    royal policy, and in 1529, when a successor had to be found for Wolsey, More was
                    raised to the chancellorship. The selection was justified by More’s high
                    reputation, but it was also significant of the modification which the policy of
                    the court was then undergoing. It was a concession to the rising popular party,
                    to which it was supposed that More’s politics inclined him. The public favour
                    with which his appointment had been received was justified by his conduct as
                    judge in the Court of Chancery. Having heard causes in the forenoon between
                    eight and eleven, after dinner he sat again to receive petitions. The meaner the
                    suppliant was the more affably he would speak to him, and the more speedily he
                    would despatch his case. In this respect he formed a great contrast to his
                    predecessor, whose arrears he soon cleared off. One morning being told by the
                    officer that there was not another cause before the court, he ordered the fact
                    to be entered on record, as it had never happened before. He not only refused
                    all gifts, such as had been usual, himself, but took measures to prevent any of
                    his connexions from interfering with the course of justice. One of his
                    sons-in-law, Heron, having a suit in the chancellor’s court, and refusing to
                    agree to any reasonable accommodation, because the judge “was the most
                    affectionate father to his children that ever was in the world,” More thereupon
                    made a decree against him.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately for Sir Thomas More, a lord chancellor is not merely a judge, but
                    has high political functions to perform. In raising More to that eminent
                    position, the king had not merely considered his professional distinction but
                    had counted upon his avowed liberal and reforming tendencies. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Utopia,</hi> which, though written earlier, More had allowed to be
                    printed as late as 1516, he had spoken against the vices of power and declared
                    for indifference of religious creed with a breadth of philosophical view of
                    which there is no other example in any Englishman of that age. At the same time,
                    as he could not be suspected of any sympathy with Lutheran or Wickliffite
                    heretics, he might fairly be regarded as qualified to lead the party which aimed
                    at reform in state and church within the limits of Catholic orthodoxy. But in
                    the king’s mind the public questions of reform were entirely sunk in the
                    personal one of the divorce. The divorce was a point upon which Sir Thomas would
                    not yield. And, as he saw that the marriage with Anne Boleyn was determined
                    upon, he petitioned the king to be allowed to resign the great seal, alleging
                    failing health. With much reluctance, the royal permission was given and the
                    resignation accepted, 10th May 1532, with many gracious expressions of good will
                    on the part of the king. The promise held out of future bounty was never
                    fulfilled, and More left office, as he had entered it, a poor man. His
                    necessitous condition was so notorious that the clergy in convocation voted him
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n847/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0847-0818"/> a present of &lt;£5000. This he peremptorily
                    refused, either for himself or for his family, declaring that he “had rather see
                    it all cast into the Thames.” Yet the whole of his income after resigning office
                    did not exceed £100 a year.</p>
                <p>Hitherto he had maintained a large establishment, not on the princely scale of
                    Wolsey, but in the patriarchal fashion of having all his sons-in-law, with their
                    families, under his roof. When he resigned the chancellorship he called his
                    children and grandchildren together to explain his reduced circumstances. “If we
                    wish to live together,” said he, “you must be content to be contributories
                    together. But my counsel is that we fall not to the lowest fare first: we will
                    not, therefore, descend to Oxford fare, nor to the fare of New Inn, but we will
                    begin with Lincoln’s Inn diet, where many right worshipful men of great account
                    and good years do live full well; which if we find ourselves the first year not
                    able to maintain, then we will in the next year come down to Oxford fare, where
                    many great learned and ancient fathers and doctors are continually conversant;
                    which if our purses stretch not to maintain neither, then may we after, with bag
                    and wallet, go a-begging together, hoping that for pity some good folks will
                    give us their charity.”</p>
                <p>More was now able, as he writes to Erasmus, to return to the life which had
                    always been his ambition, when, free from business and public affairs, he might
                    give himself up to his favourite studies and to the practices of his devotion.
                    Of the Chelsea interior Erasmus has drawn a charming picture, which may vie with
                    Holbein’s celebrated canvas, The Household of Sir Thomas More.</p>
                <p>“More has built, near London, upon the Thames, a modest yet commodious mansion.
                    There he lives surrounded by his numerous family, including his wife, his son,
                    and his son’s wife, his three daughters and their husbands, with eleven
                    grandchildren. There is not any man living so affectionate to his children as
                    he, and he loveth his old wife as if she were a girl of fifteen. Such is the
                    excellence of his disposition that whatsoever happeneth that could not be
                    helped, he is as cheerful and as well pleased as though the best thing possible
                    had been done. In More’s house, you would say that Plato’s Academy was revived
                    again, only, whereas in the Academy the discussions turned upon geometry and the
                    power of numbers, the house at Chelsea is a veritable school of Christian
                    religion. In it is none, man or woman, but readeth or studieth the liberal arts,
                    yet is their chief care of piety. There is never any seen idle; the head of the
                    house governs it not by a lofty carriage and oft rebukes, but by gentleness and
                    amiable manners. Every member is busy in his place, performing his duty with
                    alacrity; nor is sober mirth wanting.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>But More was too conspicuous to be long allowed to enjoy the happiness of a
                    retired life. A special invitation was sent him by the king to attend the
                    coronation of Anne Boleyn, accompanied with the gracious offer of £20 to buy a
                    new suit for the occasion! More refused to attend, and from that moment was
                    marked out for vengeance. A first attempt made to bring him within the meshes of
                    the law only recoiled with shame upon the head of the accusers. They were
                    maladroit enough to attack him on his least vulnerable side, summoning him
                    before the privy council to answer to a charge of receiving bribes in the
                    administration of justice. One Parnell was put forward to complain of a decree
                    pronounced against him in favour of the contending party Vaughan, who he said
                    had presented a gilt cup to the chancellor. More stated that he had received a
                    cup as a New Year’s gift. Lord Wiltshire, the queen’s father, exultingly cried
                    out, “So, did I not tell you, my lords, that you would find this matter true?”
                    “But, my lords,” continued More, “having pledged Mrs. Vaughan in the wine
                    wherewith my butler had filled the cup, I restored the cup to her.” Two other
                    charges of a like nature were refuted as triumphantly. But the very futility of
                    the accusations must have betrayed to More the bitter determination of his
                    enemies to compass his destruction. Foiled in their first ill-directed attempt,
                    they were compelled to have recourse to that tremendous engine of regal tyranny,
                    the law of treason. A bill was brought into parliament to attaint Elizabeth
                    Barton, a nun, who was said to have held treasonable language. Barton turned out
                    afterwards to have been an impostor, but she had duped More, who now lived in a
                    superstitious atmosphere of convents and churches, and he had given his
                    countenance to her supernatural pretensions. His name, with that of Fisher, was
                    accordingly included in the bill as an accomplice. When he came before the
                    council, it was at once apparent that the charge of treason could not be
                    sustained, and the efforts of the court agents were directed to draw from More
                    some approbation of the king’s marriage. But to this neither cajolery nor
                    threats could move him. The preposterous charge was urged that it was by his
                    advice that the king had committed himself in his book against Luther to an
                    assertion of the pope’s authority, whereby the title of “Defender of the Faith”
                    had been gained, but in reality a sword put into the pope’s hand to fight
                    against him. More was able to reply that· he had warned the king that this very
                    thing might happen, that upon some breach of amity between the crown of England
                    and the pope Henry’s too pronounced assertion of the papal authority might be
                    turned against himself, “therefore it were best that place be amended, and his
                    authority more slenderly touched.” “Nay,” replied the king, “that it shall not;
                    we are so much bound to the see of Rome that we cannot do too much honour unto
                    it. Whatsoever impediment be to the contrary, we will set· forth that authority
                    to the utmost; for we have received from that see our crown imperial,” “which,”
                    added More, “till his grace with his own mouth so told me, I never heard
                    before.” Anything more defiant and exasperating than this could not well have
                    been said. But it could not be laid hold of, and the charge of treason being too
                    ridiculous to be proceeded with, More’s name was struck out of the bill. When
                    his daughter brought him the news, More calmly said, “I’ faith, Meg, quod
                    differtur, non aufertur: that which is postponed is not dropt.” At another time,
                    having asked his daughter how the court went, and how Queen Anne did, he
                    received for answer, “Never better; there is nothing else but dancing and
                    sporting.” To this More answered, “Alas, Meg, it pitieth me to remember unto
                    what misery, poor soul, she will shortly come; these dances of hers will prove
                    such dances that she will spurn our heads off like footballs; but it will not be
                    long ere her head will dance the like dance.”<note anchored="true"

                    the only trustworthy record, the life by his son-in-law Roper, More’s reply ends
                    with the words, “she will shortly come.” In this, as in other instances, the
                    later statement has the appearance of having been an imaginative extension of
                    the earlier.</p>
                <p>In 1534 the Act of Supremacy was passed, and the oath ordered to be tendered.
                    More was sent for to Lambeth, where he offered to swear to the succession, but
                    steadily refused the oath of supremacy as against his conscience. Thereupon he
                    was given in charge to the abbot of Westminster, and, persisting in his refusal,
                    was four days afterwards committed to the Tower. After a close and even cruel
                    confinement (he was denied the use of pen and ink) of more than a year, he was
                    brought to trial before a special commission and a packed jury. Even so More
                    would have been acquitted, when at the last moment Rich, the solicitor-general,
                    quitted the bar and presented himself as a witness for the crown. Being sworn,
                    he detailed a confidential conversation he had had with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n848/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0848-0819"/> prisoner in the Tower. He affirmed that, having
                    himself admitted in the course of this conversation “that there were things
                    which no parliament could do,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> no parliament could
                    make a law that God should not be God,” Sir Thomas had replied, “No more could
                    the parliament make the king supreme head of the church.” By this act of perj
                    ury a verdict of “guilty” was procuredfrom the jury. The execution of the
                    sentence followed within the week, on 7th July 1535. The head was fixed upon
                    London Bridge. The vengeance of Henry was not satisfied by this judicial murder
                    of his friend and servant; he enforced the confiscation of what small property
                    More had left, expelled Lady More from the house at Chelsea, and even set aside
                    assignments which had been legally executed by More, who foresaw what would
                    happen before the commission of the alleged treason. More’s property was settled
                    on Princess Elizabeth, afterwards queen, who kept possession of it till her
                    death. At his death Sir Thomas More was in the fifty-eighth year of his age. He
                    was twice married, but had children only by his first wife. His eldest daughter
                    Margaret, married to William Roper, is one of the foremost women in the annals
                    of the country for her virtues, high intelligence, and various accomplishments.
                    She read Latin and Greek, was a proficient in music, and in the sciences, so far
                    as they were then accessible. Her devotion to her father is historical; she gave
                    him not only the tender affection of a daughter but the high-minded sympathy of
                    a soul great as his own.</p>
                <p>It is unfortunate for More’s reputation that he has been adopted as a champion of
                    a party and a cause which is arrayed in hostility to the liberties and
                    constitution of his country. Apart from the partisan use which is made of his
                    name, we must rank him among the noblest minds of England, as one who became the
                    victim of a tyrant whose policy he disapproved and whose servile instruments he
                    despised. If his language towards the tyrant is often more servile than became a
                    freeman, we must remember that such was the court style of the period, and that
                    we must not construe literally phrases of compliment. It is, however, impossible
                    to deny that More’s policy in later life did not bear out the more liberal
                    convictions of his earlier years. His views and feelings contracted under the
                    combined influences of his professional practice and of public employment. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Utopia,</hi> published in 1516, he not only denounced the
                    ordinary vices of power, but evinced an enlightenment of sentiment which went
                    far beyond the most statesmanlike ideas to be found among his contemporaries,
                    pronouncing not merely for toleration but rising even to the philosophical
                    conception of the indifference of religious creed. It was to this superiority of
                    view, and not merely to the satire on the administration of Henry VII., that we
                    must ascribe the popularity of the work in the 16th century. For, as a romance,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Utopia</hi> has little interest either of incident or of
                    character. It does not, as has been said, anticipate the economical doctrines of
                    Adam Smith, and much of it is fanciful without being either witty or ingenious.
                    Mackintosh says of it: “It intimates a variety of doctrines, and exhibits a
                    multiplicity of projects, which the writer regards with almost every possible
                    degree of approbation and shade of assent, from the frontiers of serious and
                    entire belief, through gradations of descending plausibility, where the lowest
                    are scarcely more than exercises of ingenuity, and to which some wild paradoxes
                    are appended, either as a vehicle, or as an easy means, if necessary, of
                    disavowing the serious intention of the whole of this Platonic fiction.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Epistola</hi><hi rend="italic">ad Dorpium</hi> at a later
                    date exhibits More emphatically on the side of the new learning. It contains a
                    vindication of the study of Greek, and of the desirability of printing the text
                    of the Greek Testament,—views which at that date required an enlightened
                    understanding to enter into, and which were condemned by the party to which More
                    afterwards attached himself. At the most, he can be doubtfully exculpated from
                    the charge of having tortured men and children for heresy. It is admitted by
                    himself that he inflicted punishment for religious opinion. Erasmus only
                    ventures to say in his friend’s defence “that while he was chancellor no man was
                    put to death for these pestilent opinions, while so many suffered death in
                    France and the Low Countries.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Life of Sir Thomas More</hi> was written by his son-in-law
                    Roper about the end of Mary’s reign. It was preserved in MS. during the reign of
                    Elizabeth, and handed about in copies, many of which were carelessly made. It
                    was not given to the press till 1626, with the date of Paris. Reprints were made
                    by Hearne (1716), by Lewis (1729,1731), and by Singer (1817, 1822). Roper's life
                    is the source of all the many subsequent biographies. More’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life</hi> in MS. (Harleian 6253), anonymous, but by Nicolas Harpsfield, was
                    also written in Mary’s reign. All that is material in this MS. is taken from
                    Roper. Another anonymous <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> written in 1599, printed
                    in Wordsworth’s <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Biography,</hi> ii. 43-185, is
                    chiefly compiled from Roper and Harpsfield. The preface is signed B. R.</p>

                    Gratz, 1689) translates Roper, interweaving what material he could find
                    scattered through More’s works and letters and the notices of him in the
                    writings of his contemporaries. Cresacre More, great-grandson of Sir Thomas,
                    compiled a new life about the year 1627. It was printed without date but,
                    according to the editor, Hunter, in 1631. The title of this edition is— <hi
                    rend="italic">The Life of Sir Thos. More, Lord High Chancell&lt;nιr of
                    England,</hi> 4to, s. 1. et a. and with new title-page, 1642,1726,1828. This
                    life is cited by the subsequent biographers as an independent authority. But it
                    is almost entirely borrowed from Roper and Stapleton. The additions made have
                    sometimes the appearance of rhetorical amplifications of Roper’s simple
                    statements. At other times they are decorative miracles. The whole is couched in
                    that strain of devotional exaggeration in which the lives of the saints are
                    usually composed. The author seems to imply that he had received supernatural
                    communications from the spirit of his ancestor. Already, only eighty years after
                    More’s execution, hagiography had taken possession of the facts, and was
                    transmuting them into an edifying legend. Cresacre More’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life</hi> cannot be alleged as evidence for any facts which are not otherwise
                    vouched. It has been remarked by Hunter that More’s life and works have been all
                    along manipulated for political purposes, and in the interest of the holy see.
                    In Mary’s reign, and in the tide of Catholic reaction, Roper and Harpsfield
                    wrote lives of him; Ellis Heywood dedicated his <hi rend="italic">11 Moro</hi>
                    to Cardinal Pole, and Tottell reprinted the folio of his English works.
                    Stapleton prepared his <hi rend="italic">Très</hi><hi rend="italic">Thom«</hi>
                    in 1588, when the recovery of England to the see of Rome was looked for by the
                    Spanish invasion. In 1599, when there was a prospect of a disputed succession,
                    the anonymous <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> by B. R. was composed; and soon after
                    Charles had allied himself with a Catholic, the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> by
                    Cresacre More issued from the press. Hunter might have added that Stapleton was
                    being reprinted at Gratz at the time when the conversion of England was expected
                    from James II. The later lives σf Sir Thomas More have been numerous, but the
                    only one which has any critical value is that by G. T. Rudhart <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thomas</hi><hi rend="italic">Morus, aus den Quellen bearbeitet,</hi> Nuremberg,
                    1829. Other lives are by J. Hoddesdon, London, 1652, 1662; by Cayley, 2 vols.,
                    London, 1808; by Mackintosh, <hi rend="italic">Lardner’s Cab. Cyclop.,</hi>
                    London, 1831, 1844; and in More’s <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> London, 1845; by
                    Lord Campbell in <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Chancellors,</hi> vol. i.,
                    1848-50; by D. Nisard in <hi rend="italic">Renaissance</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Réforme</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by Baumstark, Freiburg, 1879. A
                    biographical study on More’s Latin poems is <hi rend="italic">Philomorus</hi> by
                    J. H. Marsden, 2d ed., London, 1878.</p>
                <p>More’s writings are numerous, and a complete bibliography of them would occupy
                    several columns. His English <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> were collected and
                    published in one vol. folio by Rastall, London, 1530, and reprinted by Tottell,
                    London, 1557. His Latin <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> were also separately
                    collected in one vol., Basel, 1563; Louvain, 1566; and, most complete, Frankfort
                    and Leipsic, 1689. The <hi rend="italic">Utopia</hi> has had numerous editions,
                    the first is Louv., 1516. There aie two English translations of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Utopia,</hi> by R. Robynson, London, 1551, 1556, 1624, and by
                    Gilb. Burnet, 1688. The Latin poems, <hi rend="italic">Progymnasmata,</hi>
                    appeared in 1518, 1520, 1563. This last edition contains the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Utopia</hi> and other prose Latin pieces. (Μ. P.)</p>
