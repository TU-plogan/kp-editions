                    (1821-1868). The name of Méryon is associated with that spirited revival of
                    etching in France which took place in the middle of the 19th century,—say from
                    1850 to 1865,—but it is rather by the individuality of his own achievements, and
                    the strength of his artistic nature, than by the influence he exercised that
                    Méryon best deserves fame. No doubt his work encouraged others to employ the
                    same medium of expression, and so great was his own perfection of <hi
                    rend="italic">technique</hi> that he may well have been made a model; but, after
                    all, the medium he selected, and in which he excelled, was but the accident of
                    his art; he was driven to it in part by stress of circumstances—by colour
                    blindness; and, even with colour blindness, his extraordinary certainty of hand
                    and his delicate perception of light, aided by his potent imagination, would
                    have made him a great draughtsman not alone upon the copper.</p>
                <p>Charles Méryon was born in Paris in 1821. His father was an English physician,
                    his mother a French dancer. It was to his mother’s care that Méryon’s childhood
                    was confided. She was supplied with money, and she gave the boy passionate
                    affection, if not a wise training. But she died when he was still very young,
                    and Méryon in due time entered the French navy, and in the corvette “Le Rhin”
                    made the voyage round the world. He was already a draughtsman, for on the coast
                    of New Zealand he made pencil drawings which he was able to employ, years
                    afterwards, as studies for etchings of the landscape of those regions. The
                    artistic instinct developed, and, while he was yet a lieutenant, Méryon left the
                    navy. Finding that he was colour-blind, Méryon determined to devote himself to
                    etching. He entered the work-room of one Bléry, from whom he learnt something of
                    technical matters, and to whom he always remained grateful. Méryon was by this
                    time poor. It is said that he might have had assistance from his kindred, but he
                    was too proud to ask it. And thus he was reduced to the need of executing for
                    the sake of daily bread much work that was wholly mechanical and irksome.
                    Resolutely, though unwillingly, he became the hack of his art, doing frequently,
                    from the day when he was first a master of it to the day when insanity disabled
                    him, many dull commissions which paid ill, but paid better than his original
                    works. Among learner’s work, done for his own advantage, are to be counted some
                    studies after the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n54/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0054-0045"/> Dutch etchers such as Zeeman and Adrian van de
                    Velde. Having proved himself a surprising copyist, he proceeded to labour of his
                    own, and began that series of etchings which are the greatest embodiments of his
                    greatest conceptions—the series called “Eaux-fortes sur Paris.” These plates,
                    executed from 1850 to 1854, are never to be met with as a set; they were never
                    expressly published as a set. But they none the less constituted in Méryon’s
                    mind an harmonious series. For him their likenesses and their contrasts were
                    alike studied; they had a beginning and an end; and their differences were lost
                    in their unity.</p>
                <p>Besides the twenty-two etchings “sur Paris” characterized below, Méryon did
                    seventy-two etchings of one sort and another,—ninety-four in all being
                    catalogued in Wedmore’s <hi rend="italic">Méryon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >and</hi><hi rend="italic">Méryovüs</hi><hi rend="italic">Paris ∙,</hi> but
                    these include the works of his apprenticeship and of his decline, adroit copies
                    in which his best success was in the sinking of his own individuality, and dull
                    and worthless portraits chiefly of forgotten celebrities. Yet among the
                    seventy-two prints outside his professed series there are at least a dozen that
                    will aid his fame. Three or four beautiful etchings of Paris do not belong to
                    the series at all. Two or three etchings, again, are devoted to the illustration
                    of Bourges, a city in which the old wooden houses were as attractive to him for
                    their own sakes as were the stone-built monuments of Paris. But generally it was
                    when Paris engaged him that he succeeded the most. He would have done more work,
                    however,—though he could hardly have done better work,—if the material
                    difficulties of his life had not pressed upon him and shortened his days. He was
                    a bachelor, unhappy in love, and yet, it is related, almost as constantly
                    occupied with love as with work. The depth of his imagination and the surprising
                    mastery which he achieved almost from the beginning in the technic⅛lities of his
                    craft were appreciated only by a few artists, critics, and connoisseurs, and he
                    could not sell his etchings, or could sell them only for about 10d. a piece. The
                    fact that his own original work was of incalculably greater value than his best
                    copies of his most celebrated forerunners had not yet impressed itself upon
                    anybody. Disappointment told upon him, and, frugal as was his way of life,
                    poverty must have told on him. He became subject to hallucinations. Enemies, he
                    said, waited for him at the corners of the streets; his few friends robbed him
                    or owed him that which they would never pay. A very few years after the
                    completion of his Paris series, he was lodged in the madhouse of Charenton. Its
                    order and care restored him for a while to health, and he came out and did a
                    little more work, but at bottom he was exhausted. In 1867 he returned to his
                    asylum, and died therein 1868. In the middle years of his life, just before he
                    was placed under confinement, he was much associated with Bracquemond and with
                    Flameng,—skilled practitioners of etching, while he was himself an undeniable
                    genius,—and the best of the portraits we have of him is that one by Bracquemond
                    under which the sitter wrote that it represented “the sombre Méryon with the
                    grotesque visage.” And it did.</p>
                <p>There are twenty-two pieces in the Eaux-fortes sur Paris. Some of them are
                    insignificant. That is because ten out of the twenty-two were destined as
                    headpiece, tailpiece, or running commentary on some more important plate. But
                    each has its value, and certain of the smaller pieces throw great light on the
                    aim of the entire set. Thus, one little plate—not a picture at all—is devoted to
                    the record of verses made by Méryon, the purpose of which is to lament the life
                    of Paris. The misery and poverty of the town Méryon had to illustrate, as well
                    as its splendour. The art of Méryon is completely misconceived when his etchings
                    are spoken of as views of Paris. They are often “views,” but they are so just so
                    far as is compatible with their being likewise the visions of a poet and the
                    compositions of an artist. It was an epic of Paris that Méryon determined to
                    make, coloured strongly by his personal sentiment, and affected here and there
                    by the occurrences of the moment,—in more than one case, for instance, he
                    hurried with particular affection to etch his impression of some old-world
                    building which was on the point of destruction. Nearly every etching in the
                    series is an instance of technical skill, but even the technical skill is
                    exercised most happily in those etchings which have the advantage of impressive
                    subjects, and which the collector willingly cherishes for their mysterious
                    suggestiveness or for their pure beauty. Of these, the Abside de Notre Dame is
                    the general favourite; it is commonly held to be Méryon’s masterpiece. Light and
                    shade play wonderfully over the great fabric of the church, seen over the spaces
                    of the river. As a draughtsman of architecture, Méryon was complete; his
                    sympathy with its various styles was broad, and his work on its various styles
                    unbiassed and of equal perfection—a point in which it is curious to contrast him
                    with Turner, who, in drawing Gothic, often drew it with want of appreciation. It
                    is evident that architecture must enter largely into any representation of a
                    city, however much such representation may be a vision, and however little a
                    chronicle. Besides, the architectural portion even of Méryon’s labour is but
                    indirectly imaginative; to the imagination he has given freer play in his
                    dealings with the figure, whether the people of the street or of the river or
                    the people who, when he is most frankly or even wildly symbolical, crowd the
                    sky. Generally speaking, his figures are, as regards draughtsmanship,
                    “landscape-painter’s figures.” They are drawn more with an eye to grace than to
                    correctness. But they are not “landscape-painter’s figures” at all when what we
                    are concerned with is not the method of their representation but the purpose of
                    their introduction. They are seen then to be in exceptional accord with the
                    sentiment of the scene. Sometimes, as in the case of La Morgue, it is they who
                    tell the story of the picture. Sometimes, as in the case of La Rue des Mauvais
                    Garçons,—with the two passing women bent together in secret converse,—they at
                    least suggest it. And sometimes, as in I.’Arche du Pont Notre Dame, it is their
                    expressive gesture and eager action that give vitality and animation to the
                    scene. Dealing perfectly with architecture, and perfectly, as far as concerned
                    his peculiar purpose, with humanity in his art, Méryon was little called upon by
                    the character of his subjects to deal with Nature. He drew trees but badly,
                    never representing foliage happily, either in detail or in mass. But to render
                    the characteristics of the city, it was necessary that he should know how to
                    pourtray a certain kind of water—river-water, mostly sluggish—and a certain kind
                    of sky—the grey obscured and lower sky that broods over a world of roof and
                    chimney. This water and this sky Méryon is thoroughly master of; he notes with
                    observant affection their changes in all lights.</p>
                <p>Méryon’s excellent draughtmanship, and his keen appreciation of light, shade, and
                    tone, were, of course, helps to his becoming a great etcher. But a living
                    authority, himself an eminent etcher, and admiring Méryon thoroughly, has called
                    Méryon by preference a great original engraver,—so little of Méryon’s work
                    accords with Mr Haden’s view of etching. Méryon was anything but a brilliant
                    sketcher; and, if an artist’s success in etching is to be gauged chiefly by the
                    rapidity with which he records an impression, Méryon’s success was not great.
                    There can be no doubt that his work was laborious and deliberate, instead of
                    swift and impulsive, and that of some other virtues of the etcher—‘ ‘ selection”
                    and ‘ ‘ abstraction” as Mr Hamerton has defined them—he shows small trace. But a
                    genius like Méryon is a law unto himself, or rather in his practice of his art
                    he makes the laws by which that art and he are to be judged. He was a great
                    etcher, and by his most elaborate labour he seemed somehow to ensure the more
                    completely for his picture that virtue of unity of impression which, it may well
                    be admitted, offener belongs to rapid than to deliberate work. In Méryon’s
                    etchings the hand-work never seems to be in arrear of the thought. As long as
                    the hand-work must continue, the thought and passion are retained. Méryon knows
                    the secrets of his craft as well as did the older masters of it; but he turns
                    them to his own purposes. He is unexcelled in strength and in precision, nor is
                    he often rivalled in delicacy. These qualities, and others more distinctly
                    technical, which it would take too long to insist on here, students find in his
                    etchings. But the incommunicable charm of Méryon’s prints and their lasting
                    fascination are due to the fact that, behind all technical qualities, and as
                    their veιy source and spring, there lies the potent imagination of the artist,
                    poetical and vivid, directing him what to see in his subject, and how to see it.
