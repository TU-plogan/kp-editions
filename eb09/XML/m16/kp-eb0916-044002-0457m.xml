                <p><label type="entry">MINING</label></p>
                <p>THE art of mining consists of those processes by which useful minerals are
                    obtained from the earth’s crust.</p>
                <p>This definition is wider than what is popularly known as mining, for it includes
                    not only underground excavations but also open workings; at the same time it
                    excludes underground workings which are simply used for passages, such as
                    railway tunnels and sewers, and galleries for military purposes. We must remark
                    also that the word “mine,” or its equivalent in other languages, varies in
                    signification in different countries on account of legal enactments or decisions
                    which define it. Thus, in France and Belgium, the workings for mineral are
                    classified by the law of 1810, according to the nature of the substance wrought,
                    into <hi rend="italic">mines,</hi><hi rend="italic">minières, et carrières.</hi>
                    In the United Kingdom, on the contrary, it is the nature of the excavation which
                    decides the question for certain legislative purposes, and the term mine is
                    restricted to workings which are carried on underground by artificial light. The
                    consequence is that what is merely an underground stone quarry in France becomes
                    a true mine in England, whilst the open workings for iron ore, such as exist in
                    Northamptonshire, would be true mines under the French law. It is necessary,
                    therefore, in an article on mining, to go beyond the English legal definition of
                    a mine, and include the methods of working minerals in excavations open to
                    daylight as well as in those which are purely subterranean. Furthermore, as it
                    is customary for the miner to cleanse his ore to a greater or less extent before
                    selling it to the smelter, we shall treat, under the head of mining, those
                    processes which a·re commonly known as the dressing or mechanical preparation of
                    ores; and, finally, a few remarks will be made concerning legislation affecting
                    mines in the United Kingdom, accidents in mines, and the production of the
                    useful minerals in various parts of the globe.</p>

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Manner in which the Useful Minerals Occur.—</hi> The
                    repositories of the useful minerals may be classified according to their shape
                    as (A) tabular deposits, and (B) masses.</p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Tabular Deposits.—</hi> These are deposits which have a more
                    or less flattened or sheet-like form. They may be divided, according to their
                    origin, into (1) beds or strata, and (2) mineral veins or lodes.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Beds.—</hi> Geology teaches us that a large proportion of
                    the rocks met with at the surface of the earth consist of substances arranged in
                    distinct layers, owing to the fact that these rocks have been formed at the
                    bottom of seas, lakes, or rivers by the gradual deposition of sediment, by
                    precipitation from solutions, and by the growth or accumulation of animal and
                    vegetable organisms. If any one of these layers consists of a useful mineral, or
                    contains enough to make it valuable, we say that we have a deposit in the form
                    of a bed, stratum, or seam. Of course the most important of all bedded or
                    stratified deposits is coal, but, in addition, we have beds of anthracite,
                    lignite, iron ore, especially in the Oolitic rocks, cupriferous shale,
                    lead-bearing sandstone, silver-bearing sandstone, diamond-, gold-, and
                    tin-bearing gravels, to say nothing of sulphur, rock-salt, clays, various kinds
                    of stone, such as limestone and gypsum, oil-shale, alum-shale, and slate.</p>
                <p>The characteristic feature of a bed is that it is a member of a series of
                    stratified rocks; the layer above it is called the <hi rend="italic">roof</hi>
                    of the deposit, and the one below it is the <hi rend="italic">floor.</hi> Its
                    <hi rend="italic">thickness</hi> is the distance from the roof to the floor at
                    right angles to the planes of stratification; its <hi rend="italic">dip</hi> is
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n458/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0458-0441"/> inclination downwards measured from the
                    horizontal; its <hi rend="italic">strike</hi> is the direction of a horizontal
                    line drawn in the middle plane.</p>
                <p>The thickness of beds that are worked varies within very wide limits. Whilst the
                    thickness of certain workable beds of coal is only 1 foot, and that of the
                    Mansfeld cupriferous shale only 10 to 20 inches, we find on the other hand one
                    of the beds of lead-bearing sandstone at Mechernich no less than 85 feet thick,
                    and beds of slate far exceeding that thickness. It must not be supposed,
                    however, that the thickness of a bed necessarily remains uniform. Occasionally
                    this is the case over a very large area; but frequently the thickness varies,
                    and the bed may dwindle away gradually, or increase in size, or become divided
                    into two owing to the appearance of a parting of valueless rock. Fig. 1 shows
                    beds of shale, limestone, iron ore, and sandstone. Any one of these beds may be
                    valuable enough to be worked.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Mineral Veins or Lodes.</hi> —Veins or lodes are tabular or
                    sheet-like deposits of mineral which have been formed since the rocks by which
                    they are surrounded; they differ, therefore, by their subsequent origin from
                    beds, which, as just stated, are of contemporaneous origin with the enclosing
                    rocks (although of course cases occur in which the deposit is lying
                    unconformably upon very much older strata, or is covered unconformably by very
                    much younger strata). It is necessary to explain that the term “vein” in this
                    definition is used in a more restricted sense than is sometimes customary among
                    miners, who speak of <hi rend="italic">veins</hi> of coal, clay-ironstone, and
                    slate, which geologically are true beds. They see a band of valuable mineral or
                    rock, and, careless of its origin, call it metaphorically a vein or seam. On the
                    other hand, the definition is broader than that which prevails among some
                    geologists, who would confine the term vein to deposits occupying spaces formed
                    by fissures.</p>
                <p>The term “lode” was defined in 1877 by Mr Justice Field in the celebrated Eureka
                    <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Richmond case as follows:—“We are of opinion,
                    therefore, that the term, as used in the Acts of Congress, is applicable to any
                    zone or belt of mineralized rock lying within boundaries clearly separating it
                    from the neighbouring rocks.” This interpretation seems suitable for the
                    peculiar mining tenure of the United States, where the discoverer of a vein or
                    lode can obtain a mining claim of 500 yards in length along the lode. It
                    protects the prospector, whose object is to obtain a secure title, the mode of
                    origin of the deposit being a matter of small importance to him so long as it is
                    worth working. In many cases also it would be impossible to decide upon the mode
                    of origin until workings had progressed considerably, and even then there would
                    be room for disputes.</p>
                <p>No doubt a very large number of mineral veins are simply the contents of
                    fissures; others are bands of rock impregnated with ore adjacent to fissures or
                    planes of separation; others, again, have been formed by the more or less
                    complete replacement of the constituents of the original rock by particles of
                    ore.</p>
                <p>Veins may occur in igneous or in sedimentary rocks, and in the latter they
                    frequently cut across the planes of stratification.</p>
                <p>Like a bed, a vein has its dip and strike; but, as the dip of veins is generally
                    great, the inclination is usually measured from the vertical, and is then spoken
                    of as the <hi rend="italic">τ&lt;,nderlie</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hade.</hi>
                    The bounding planes of a vein are called the <hi rend="italic">walls</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cheeks,</hi> and they are frequently smooth and striated, showing
                    that one side must have slid against the other. The upper wall is known as the
                    <hi rend="italic">hanging wall,</hi> the lower one aS the <hi rend="italic">foot
                    wall.</hi> The width of a vein is measured at right angles to the walls.</p>
                <p>A typical example of a fissure-vein is shown in fig. 2, representing a lead lode
                    in slate at Wheal Mary Ann mine<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>C. Le Neve Foster, “Remarks on the Lode at Wheal Mary Ann,
                    Menheniot,” <hi rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Geol. Soc. Cornwall,</hi> vol. ix. p.
                    153.</p></note> in Cornwall.</p>
                <p>It is evident that a fissure in the surrounding slate has here been filled up by
                    the successive deposition of bands of mineral on both sides.</p>
                <p>A large proportion of the contents of a lode may consist of fragments of the
                    walls that have fallen into the original fissure, and these are often tightly
                    cemented together by minerals that have been introduced subsequently. The
                    horizontal section of part of the Comstock lode<note anchored="true"

                    “country” rock enclosed within the walls.</p>
                <p>Where a lode consists of rock impregnated with ore, the mineralized. part may
                    fade away gradually into the surrounding <hi rend="italic">rock (country)</hi>
                    without there being any distinct wall, as shown in fig. 3, which is an
                    illustration taken from the Great Flat Lode<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>C. Le Neve Foster, “On the Great Flat Lode south of Redruth
                    and Camborne, and on some other Tin Deposits formed by the Alteration of
                    Granite,” <hi rend="italic">Quart. Jowr. Geol. Soc.,</hi> *&gt;1. xxxiv. p.
                    644.</p></note> near Redruth in Cornwall.</p>
                <p>The celebrated Ruby Hill deposit in the Eureka district, Nevada, is a mineralized
                    zone of dolomitic limestone varying in width from a few inches to 450 feet, and
                    having a mean width of 250 feet. It contains numerous irregular ore-bodies,
                    which consist mainly of highly ferruginous carbonate of lead, rich in silver and
                    gold. This mineralized limestone band, long called a lode by miners, has been
                    determined by the decision just mentioned to be a lode in the eyes of the
                    law.</p>
                <p>Veins often continue for a great distance along their strike. The Van lode in
                    Montgomeryshire is known for a length of 9 miles, whilst the Great Quartz Vein
                    in California has been traced for a distance of no less than 80 miles. Veins are
                    of less uniform productiveness than beds, and are rarely worth working
                    throughout. Rich portions alternate with poor or worthless portions. The rich
                    parts have received various names according to the forms they assume: fig. 4
                    represents a longitudinal section along the strike <hi rend="italic">(course)
                    of</hi> a lode, and the stippled parts are ore-bodies; B, B, B are <hi
                    rend="italic">bunches;</hi> A is a large bunch or <hi rend="italic">course of
                    ore</hi>; when an ore-body forms a sort of continuous column we have a <hi
                    rend="italic">shoot,</hi> and ore-bodies which on being excavated leave
                    chimney-like openings are called <hi rend="italic">pipes</hi> (fig. 4, C). In
                    the United States the Spanish word <hi rend="italic">bonanza,</hi> literally
                    meaning “fair weather” or “prosperity,” is frequently used for a rich body of
                    ore.</p>
                <p>The richness of veins is dependent in many cases upon the nature of the adjacent
                    rock <hi rend="italic">(country),</hi> upon the underlie, and upon the strike,
                    variations in any one of these three elements being often sufficient to cause a
                    decided change of productiveness.</p>
                <p>Various theories have been formed concerning the origin of mineral veins. Some
                    geologists suppose that the minerals now constituting the veinshave been
                    dissolved out of the adjacent rocks and re-deposited in the vein cavity; others,
                    on the contrary, believe that the ores have been brought up from great depths by
                    mineral springs. In all probability both theories are correct, some lodes having
                    been formed by the former process and some by the latter; and, furthermore,
                    other lodes appear to owe their origin to a gradual substitution of valuable
                    minerals in the place of some of the constituents of a worthless rock. One of
                    the most important contributions to the science of ore-deposits of late years
                    has been the discovery by Professor F. Sandberger of small quantities of silver,
                    lead, copper, nickel, cobalt, bismuth, arsenic, antimony, and tin in silicates,
                    such as oUvine, augite, hornblende, and mica, which are constituents of igneous
                    rocks. He therefore regards these rocks as the sources ιrom which lodes have
                    derived their riches.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Masses.—</hi> These are deposits of mineral, often of J
                    irregular shapes, which cannot be distinctly recognized as beds or veins. Such,
                    for instance, are the red haematite <pb break="no"

                    china clay in Cornwall.</p>
                <p>Under this head also are included by most authors the so-called “stockworks” or
                    “reticulated masses,” names applied to masses of sedimentary or igneous rock
                    which are penetrated by so many little mineral veins as to make the whole worth
                    excavating.</p>
                <p>It must be understood that we cannot expect nature to make distinct lines of
                    demarcation between the different kinds of deposits. Though we may be able to
                    see clearly that a seam of coal is contemporaneous with the enclosing rocks, and
                    that a vein intersecting beds of shale and sandstone was formed subsequently,
                    cases frequently occur where the origin of the mineral is uncertain. For
                    example, we have the lead-bearing sandstone of Mechernich and the silver-bearing
                    sandstone of Utah. The grains of sand are of sedimentary origin; but opinions
                    differ as to whether the lead and silver respectively were deposited with the
                    sand or were introduced subsequently by solutions percolating through the beds.
                    In the case of the well-known bed of Cleveland ironstone, Dr Sorby considers
                    that the iron was “derived partly from mechanical deposition and partly from
                    subsequent chemical replacement of the originally deposited carbonate of
                    lime.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    Furthermore, a bed may be so folded and contracted as to lose its original
                    sheet-like form in places and assume the shape of an irregular mass. This may
                    happen even with a coal seam.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>J. Callon, <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Mining,</hi> vol.

                <p>All kinds of deposits are subject not only to irregularities of origin dependent
                    upon their mode of formation but also to dislocations or shiftings known as
                    faults, heaves, or throws.</p>
                <p>We will take the case of a bed (fig. 7). AB is a seam λvhich ends off suddenly at
                    B, whilst the continuation is found at a lower level at CD. The bed was
                    evidently once continuous; but a fracture took place along the line XY followed
                    by a displacement. As a rule the portion of rock on the hanging-wall side of a
                    fault appears to have slid downwards, but occasionally this is not so, and we
                    have a reversed fault (fig. 8). It is very evident, in some cases, that the
                    motion took place, not along the line of greatest dip, but in a dia gonal
                    direction, causing a displacement sideways as well as downwards. Nevertheless,
                    where beds or veins are not horizontal, a mere shift along the line of dip is
                    sufficient to cause an apparent heave sideways. This will be understood from
                    fig. 9. Let AB and CD represent two portions of a lode dislocated by the fault
                    EF. The point B' corresponded originally with B, and the dislocation was caused
                    by a simple sliding of B ’ along the line of dip BB'.</p>
                <p>An instance of the complication caused by a succession of faults is shown in fig.

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Prospecting, or Search for Mineral.—</hi> The object of the
                    prospector is to discover valuable deposits of mineral. This search is beset
                    with many difficulties: the outcrops of mineral deposits are frequently hidden
                    by soil; the nature of the deposit itself is generally entirely changed near the
                    surface; and, in addition to this, the explorer may have to pursue his work in
                    trackless forests far away from any settlements.</p>
                <p>The prospector seeks for natural sections of the rocks, such as occur in cliffs
                    or in river valleys and their tributary gullies and gorges; he examines the
                    materials constituting the river-beds, often digging up and washing portions in
                    a pan, in order to ascertain whether they contain traces of the heavy ores or
                    metals. If, while prospecting in a valley, he discovers stones that have the
                    appearance of having once belonged to veins, he endeavours to trace them to
                    their source, and is perhaps rewarded by finding similar fragments, but less
                    water-worn, as he goes up the stream; further on he may come upon large blocks
                    of veinstuff lying about, and finally find the vein itself laid bare in a gorge,
                    or at the bottom of a brook, or possibly projecting above the soil in the form
                    of huge crags of quartz. Thus at the Great Western quicksilver mine in
                    California the outcrop of the vein appears as a dike over 100 feet wide, and
                    having precipitous sides in places 75 feet high.<note anchored="true"

                    lying about are known in Cornwall as shoad-stones, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >shoading</hi> is the term given to the process of tracking them to the parent
                    lode.</p>
                <p>The upper portion of a deposit is frequently much altered by atmospheric
                    agencies, and bears little resemblance to the undecomposed bed or vein which
                    will eventually be met with at a greater or lesser depth. The principal
                    difference consists in the change of sulphides into oxides or oxidized
                    compounds. Thus iron pyrites, which is such a common constituent of mineral
                    veins, is converted into hydrated oxide of iron, and a vein originally
                    consisting largely of iron pyrites and quartz now becomes a cindery mixture of
                    quartz and ochre, known in Cornwall as <hi rend="italic">gossan.</hi> This
                    gossan, or <hi rend="italic">iron hat,</hi> may often furnish important
                    indications concerning the nature of the lode itself, because such minerals as
                    pyromorphite or cerussite point to the existence of galena, whilst melaconite,
                    cuprite, malachite, and azurite are the forerunners of chalcopyrite or copper
                    glance. The gossan itself may contain a sufficient quantity of valuable ores to
                    be worth working.</p>
                <p>The seams containing native sulphur in Sicily often show no trace of that element
                    immediately at the surface, as the sulphur-bearing limestone weathers into a

                <p>Other signs of mineral deposits are given by springs and by certain plants
                    dependent upon the deposit or its associated minerals for part of their
                    nourishment. The appearance of the so-called lode-lights may be explained by the
                    production of phosphoretted hydrogen from the action of organic matter and water
                    upon phosphates, which are so common in the upper parts of mineral veins; and
                    one hears also of differences in the appearance of the vegetation along the line
                    of the deposit, of places where snow will not lie in winter, and of vapours
                    hanging over the ground. Though some writers refuse to put any value upon these
                    indications, they should not be entirely overlooked, because the outcrop of a
                    lode, of different nature and texture to the surrounding rocks, and which is
                    generally a channel for water, may readily cause the phenomena just mentioned.
                    Where the surface is cultivated and the natural springs are tapped by
                    adit-levels or other mine-workings, these appearances cannot be looked for to
                    any great extent. With one special mineral, magnetic iron, the position of the
                    deposit may be traced out with some degree of accuracy with a dipping needle;
                    this is used in Sweden.</p>
                <p>After having acquired an idea of the position of a vein or seam by some of the
                    surface indications just mentioned, it is necessary, before attacking it by
                    shafts or levels, to obtain more certain data concerning it. In the case of
                    mineral veins, trenches are dug at right angles to the supposed strike; and,
                    when the upper part of the deposit has been cut in several places, its general
                    course and dip can be determined sufficiently for the purpose of arranging the
                    future workings. These trenches are called “costean pits”; in some cases,
                    instead of a trench, a pit is sunk a short distance and a little tunnel driven
                    out.</p>
                <p>Where the mineral to be wrought occurs as a bed or mass, the process of boring is
                    resorted to, and indeed this method is also applied in the case of veins,
                    especially in the United States. Boring is a work of such importance that it
                    deserves to be treated under a separate heading.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Boring with Rods and Ropes—Diamond Drills.—</hi> The object
                    of boring is to reach a deposit by a small hole and ascertain its nature, its
                    depth from the surface, thickness, dip, and strike. Bore-holes are also used for
                    obtaining water, brine, and petroleum, which either rise to the surface or have
                    to be pumped up from a certain depth, and finally for tapping water in old
                    workings or for effecting ventilation. The methods of boring may be classified
                    as follows :—(1) boring with the rod; (2) boring with the rope; (3) boring with
                    the diamond drill.</p>
                <p>In the first method tools for cutting and removing the rock are fixed to rods,
                    which are lengthened as the hole increases in depth, and which are worked by
                    hand or by machinery at the surface. Where the ground is soft, such as sand or
                    clay, tools like augers can be employed; but in harder ground it becomes
                    necessary to have recourse to percussion; various forms of chisel are used, the
                    simplest being made of the shape shown in fig. 11.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Serio, <hi rend="italic">Leitfaden zur
                    Bergbaukunde,</hi> Berlin, 1878, p. 59.</p></note> The rods generally consist of
                    bars of square iron, from 1 inch to 2 inches on the side. The length of each rod
                    depends upon the height of the tower, derrick, or shears erected above the
                    bore-hole, which should be an exact multiple of the individual parts.</p>
                <p>These are made in lengths of 15 to 30 or rarely 40 feet, and with a suitable
                    tower it is possible to detach or attach two or three lengths at a time, instead
                    of having to make or unmake eveιy joint. The mode of connexion usually preferred
                    is by a screw joint as shown in fig. 12; care is taken to have all the joints
                    exactly alike, so that any two bars can be screwed together. In order to
                    diminish the weight of the rods, which becomes consider able in deep holes, wood
                    has sometimes been employed. The rods are connected by male and female screws
                    attached to the rods by sockets of sheet iron, or by a fork-like arrangement. At
                    the surface a head is screwed to the uppermost rod by which the rods can be
                    lifted, and they are turned by means of cross-bars called tillers.</p>
                <p>When the depth is small the rods are lifted by hand and then allowed to drop,
                    being turned slightly at each lift so that the cutting chisel may strike a new
                    place each time. For greater depths a lever has to be employed, the rods being
                    suspended at one end, whilst the other end can be pressed down by men using
                    their hands or feet. The spring pole is another arrangement, in which the
                    elasticity of a long pole is made use of for lifting the rod at each stroke. The
                    length of the stroke can be maintained the same while the bore-hole is deepened
                    by means of a screw in a swivel-head at the top of the rod.</p>
                <p>With deep holes, and especially those of large diameter, steam machinery has to
                    be employed for working the rod; the engine may be direct-acting and stand
                    immediately above the bore-hole, but a commoner arrangement is to employ a
                    single-acting cylinder working a beam. Occasionally also the beam is actuated by
                    a connecting-rod worked by a crank.</p>
                <p>The actual boring machinery has now been described, and the mere boring appears
                    to be a very simple matter, consisting only in lifting the rod a little and
                    allowing it to drop, the rod being turned slightly before each stroke.
                    Nevertheless the process of putting down a bore-hole is not so simple as it
                    seems, for there are numerous indispensable accessory operations which take up
                    much time. In the first place the débris have to be removed, and in order to
                    effect this the rods must be drawn up, the swivel-head is disconnected and a cap
                    screwed on. A length of rods is now drawn up by a hand or steam windlass and
                    disconnected. It is well to have as many caps as there are lengths to be drawn
                    up, and then each length can be suspended in the house. Sometimes a <hi
                    rend="italic">grip</hi> which catches the rod at the bulging joint is used
                    instead of a cap. The next operation consists in lowering by means of a rope the
                    <hi rend="italic">shell-pump</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sludger,</hi> which is a
                    hollow cylinder with a clack or a ball-valve (fig. 13). It is worked up and down
                    a little till it is filled, and it is then drawn up and emptied at the surface.
                    The operation h repeated, if necessary, and the boring is resumed with the
                    rod.</p>
                <p>Occasionally a bore-hole has to be widened slightly with a tool called a <hi
                    rend="italic">reamer.</hi> Soft beds may have to be bored through with a <hi
                    rend="italic">wimble</hi>; and, unless the rocks are hard and firm, the hole has
                    to be lined with a tube, generally of sheet-iron. Accidents may occur, causing
                    an immense amount of trouble, such as the breaking of rods or chisel, and many
                    ingenious implements have been devised for seizing the broken rod or the
                    fragments of tools which prevent further progress with the work.</p>
                <p>In boring at considerable depths, the weight of the rod becomes so great that
                    much vibration ensues when the mass is suddenly arrested by the chisel striking
                    against the bottom of the hole. Various devices have been contrived for
                    overcoming this difficulty and producing a tool which will act independently of
                    the rod. One of the best-known arrangements is the free-falling tool invented by
                    Kind (fig. 14).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J.
                    Callon, <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Mining,</hi> vol. i., Atlas, plate ix.
                    fig. 52.</p></note> The head of the actual boring-rod is held by a click or
                    grapple; when the main rod descends, the resistance of the water in the hole
                    slightly stops the sliding disk D, the jaws J, J open, the head is disengaged,
                    and the boring part falls and strikes the bottom without any injurious
                    vibrations being communicated to the main rod. When this descends farther the
                    head is caught again by the click. Special tools also are used for cutting an
                    annular groove at the bottom of a bore-hole and breaking off the core, which is
                    then brought up, with certain precautions, so as to show the nature and dip of
                    the strata traversed.</p>
                <p>In order to obviate the great loss of time which ensues from connecting and
                    disconnecting long lengths of rods, recourse may be had to boring with the rope.
                    In this method, known as the Chinese method, the chisel is worked by a rope in
                    the same manner as the sludger already described. Messrs Mather and Platt of
                    Manchester have long used with success, in many parts of England and various
                    other countries, a system of boring by means of a flat hempen rope.</p>

                    of the diamond drill. The working part of the drill consists of the so-called
                    crown, which is a short piece of tube made of cast steel, at one end of which a
                    number of black diamonds are fastened into small cavities (fig. 15). The crown
                    is screwed on to wroughtiron pipes, which constitute the boring rod. Machinery
                    at the surface causes the rod to rotate, and the result is the cutting of an
                    annular groove at the bottom of the hole, leaving a core, which, breaking off
                    from time to time, is caught by a little shoulder, and brought up to the surface
                    with the rod. In places where it is not necessary to make any verification of
                    the rocks traversed, the crown is arranged with diamonds in the centre also. The
                    débris, in either case, are washed away by a stream of water, which is forced
                    down the tube and flows up the sides of the hole. With this system a bore-hole
                    can be deepened continuously at a speed altogether unattainable by the other
                    methods, which require stoppages for cleaning out. It has the further advantage
                    of making it possible to drill holes in any direction; and prospecting diamond
                    drills are constantly used with much success inside many metal mines, especially
                    in the United States.</p>

                    Little Champion Rock-Drill,which is largely employed in the Lake Superior
                    district for prospecting. It can be used above or below ground. Two inclined
                    cylinders drive a horizontal crank shaft, which works bevel gear, causing the
                    drill to revolve. At the same time a countershaft is likewise set in motion, and
                    this effects the advance of the drill by gearing driving the feed-screw; as
                    there are three kinds of gearing, the speed can be varied at pleasure. The
                    feed-screw and its connexions are carried by a swivel-head, and this can be
                    turned so as to drill holes at an angle. The drum shown above the cylinders is
                    used for hoisting out the drill-rods by a rope. The rods are lap-welded iron
                    tubes 1⅞ inches in diameter, fitted with a bayonet joint.</p>

                    Methods—Machine Drills—Driving Levels and Sinking Shafts.—</hi> The kind of
                    ground in which mining excavations have to be carried on varies within the
                    widest limits, from loose quicksands to rocks which are so hard that the best
                    steel tools will scarcely touch them.</p>
                <p>Loose ground can be removed with the shovel; but in the special case of peat
                    sharp spades are employed, which cut through the fibres and furnish lumps or
                    sods of convenient form for drying and subsequent use as fuel. What is called
                    <hi rend="italic">fair, soft,</hi> or easy ground, such as clay, shale,
                    decomposed clay-slate, and chalk, requires the use of the pick and the shovel.
                    The pick is a tool of very variable form, according to the material operated on.
                    Thus there are the navvy’s pick, the single-pointed pick with a striking head at
                    the other end called the pollpick (fig. 18), and numerous varieties of the
                    double-pointed pick (fig. 19), the special tool of the collier, but also largely
                    used in metal mining. When the ground, though harder, is nevertheless “jointy,”
                    or traversed by many natural fissures, the wedge comes into play. The Cornish
                    tool known as a <hi rend="italic">gad</hi> is a pointed wedge (fig. 20). The
                    so-called “pick and gad” work consists in breaking away the easy ground with the
                    point of the pick, wedging off pieces with the gad driven in by a sledge or the
                    poll of the pick, or prizing them off with the pick after they have been
                    loosened by the gad. The Saxon gad is held on a little handle, and is struck
                    with a hammer. It is used for wedging off pieces of jointy ground, and in former
                    days even hard rocks were excavated by its aid. The process consisted in
                    chipping out a series of parallel grooves and then chipping away the ridges left
                    between the grooves. As a method of working this process is obsolete; but it is
                    useful on a small scale for cutting recesses <hi rend="italic">(hitches)</hi>
                    for timber, for dressing the sides of levels or shafts before putting in dams,
                    and for doing work in places where blasting might injure pumps or other
                    machinery.</p>
                <p>We now come to hard ground; and in this class we have a large proportion of the
                    rocks met with by the miner, such as slate of various kinds, hard grits and
                    sandstone, limestone, the metamorphic schists, granite, and the contents of many
                    mineral veins. Rocks of this kind are attacked by boring and blasting. The tools
                    employed are the jumper, the borer or drill, the hammer, the sledge <hi
                    rend="italic">(mallet,</hi> Cornwall), the scraper and charger, the tamping bar
                    or stemmer, in some places the pricker or needle, the claying bar, the crowbar,
                    and finally the shovel for clearing away the broken rock.</p>
                <p>The jumper (fig. 21) is merely a long bar of iron terminating in two chisel-like
                    edges made of steel; generally there is a swelling in the middle, and sometimes
                    the jumper tapers all the way from the middle to the edge or bit. The jumper is
                    most commonly used when it is necessary to bore holes downwards, and is <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n462/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0462-0445"/> largely employed in quarries; occasionally it is
                    used in boring holes horizontally, as for instance in the salt mines of
                    Cheshire. The jumper is held in the desired direction, lifted up, and thrust
                    down; it is turned a little after each stroke.</p>
                <p>However, the miner’s tool is generally the borer proper, or drill (fig. 22),
                    which is a bar of round or octagonal steel, usually from ∣ inch to 1 j inches in
                    diameter, with one end forged into a chisel-shaped edge, the exact shape and
                    degree of sharpness varying according to the hardness of the rock. The hole is
                    bored by striking the drill with a hammer or sledge and turning it after each
                    blow. Boring is said to be single-handed if the miner holds the drill in one
                    hand and strikes with the hammer in the other, whilst it is called double-handed
                    when one man turns and another strikes. The hammers for single-handed boring
                    usually vary in weight from 2 to 6 or 7 ft).</p>
                <p>The double-handed boring hammer, or sledge (fig. 23), weighs from 6 to 10 ft&gt;
                    or more. If a hole is directed downwards, the miner pours in a little water and
                    bores the hole wet. From time to time he draws out the sludge with the scraper,
                    a little disk at the end of a metal rod, and he takes a fresh borer when the
                    tool he is using has become blunt. The depth bored varies with the rock and the
                    nature of the excavation; but in driving levels in the ordinary way the depth is
                    commonly from 18 inches to 3 feet.</p>
                <p>Holes for blasting are sometimes bored by tools like carpenters’ augers. One of
                    the simplest, which is used in some French slate-mines, is very like a brace and
                    bit, and the tool is kept pressed against the rock by means of a screw fixed in
                    a frame resting on the ground.</p>
                <p>The pricker, or needle, is a slender tapering rod of copper or bronze, with a
                    ring at the large end. It is used for maintaining a hole in the <hi
                    rend="italic">tamping</hi> through which the charge can be fired. The use of
                    needles made of iron is prohibited in many countries, on account of the danger
                    of their striking sparks which might fire the charge. The tamping bar, or <hi
                    rend="italic">stemmer,</hi> is a rod of iron, copper, or bronze, or iron shod
                    with copper, and it is used for ramming in dried clay, slate pounded up, or
                    other fine material, upon the powder, and so creating a resistance sufficient to
                    make the gases generated by the explosion of the charge rend the rock in the
                    manner required. The claying bar is used for lining wet holes with clay, and so
                    rendering them temporarily watertight.</p>
                <p>Shovels vary much in different districts. In the southwest of England the
                    long-handled shovel is preferred to the common one with a short handle; in
                    Germany the ore or rubbish is frequently scraped into a tray with a sort of
                    hoe.</p>
                <p>In addition to these tools the miner requires an explosive, and a means of firing
                    the charge at the bottom of the hole which will give him time to escape. Twenty
                    years ago gunpowder was the only explosive in common use in mines, but at the
                    present day its place has been taken to a very large extent by mixtures
                    containing nitro-glycerin or gun-cotton. The powder used for blasting in mines
                    usually contains less saltpetre than that which is employed for sporting or
                    military purposes. The following is an analysis of mining powder by Captain
                    Noble and Sir F. Abel:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    >(Kieselguhr')</hi> called dynamite or giant powder is now one of the commonest
                    explosives met with. It has the advantage over powder that it is far more
                    powerful, that it may be used in wet holes or under water, that it is very
                    effective even in ground full of “vughs” or cavities, and that it requires no
                    hard tamping, which is always a source of danger. Its plasticity too enables it
                    to fill the space at the bottom of a bore-hole, which is rarely a true cylinder,
                    more completely than any solid cartridge can do. One disadvantage is that it has
                    to be thawed in cold weather, and there is also the fact that occasionally the
                    whole of a charge of dynamite fails to go off, and unnoticed remnants have
                    exploded and caused serious and even fatal accidents when struck with the pick
                    or borer. The danger is enhanced when the remnants have been left in contact
                    with water, which causes a separation of the sensitive nitro-glycerin, so that
                    even a blow upon the adjacent rock may lead to an accident if any of the
                    explosive oil has leaked into cracks. The strongest dynamite contains about 75
                    per cent, of nitroglycerin, the rest being kieselguhr. A newer explosive is
                    blasting gelatin; it is made by mixing nitro-cotton with nitro-glycerin, until
                    enough nitro-cotton has been dissolved to convert the nitro-glycerin into a
                    jelly-like mass. The blasting gelatin in ordinary use contains no less than 93
                    per cent, of nitro-glycerin, with 7 per cent, of nitro-cotton, and its strength
                    is very great.</p>
                <p>Gun-cotton <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> is not much in favour in ordinary
                    mining; but mixed with some nitrate or mixture of nitrates, such as the nitrates
                    of barium and potassium, and known as cotton powder, tonite, and potentite, it
                    is employed extensively. Though not quite so powerful as dynamite, nitrated
                    gun-cotton possesses the important advantage of not requiring to be thawed in
                    cold weather. As in the case of dynamite, accidents have been caused by remnants
                    of charges; and with both explosives it is necessary to examine carefully the
                    bottoms of all holes after blasting, and to destroy any possible remnants by
                    firing off a detonator in any bottom or “socket” which cannot with certainty be
                    pronounced free from danger.</p>
                <p>The commonest method of firing a charge is by means of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >safety-fuse,</hi> a cord containing a core of gunpowder introduced during the
                    process of manufacture; it may be rendered waterproof by tar or
                    gutta-percha.</p>
                <p>In blasting in the ordinary way the charge of gunpowder is put in either loose or
                    enclosed in a paper bag, and it is pressed down to the bottom of the hole with a
                    wooden stick, whilst a piece of fuse also is inserted extending from the charge
                    well beyond the hole. If the powder is loose the miner carefully wipes down the
                    sides of the hole with a wet <hi rend="italic">swab stick</hi> (a wooden rod
                    with the fibres frayed at one end), or with a wisp of hay twisted round the
                    scraper, in order to remove any loose grains adhering to the fuse or the sides
                    of the hole, and then presses in a wad of hay or paper. A little fine tamping,
                    often the dust from boring a dry hole, is now thrown in and rammed down with the
                    wooden charging stick, and the same process is repeated, and when harder tamping
                    is required the metal bar is brought into operation, until the hole is
                    completely filled.</p>
                <p>As the safety fuse burns slowly, at the rate of about 2 or 3 feet a minute, the
                    miner can secure ample time for retreat by taking a sufficient length. It is
                    usual to ignite the fuse by a candle-end fixed under it by a piece of clay, and
                    it takes a little ^nιe for the candle to burn through the fuse.</p>
                <p>The old plan of firing a charge, which is still in use in many <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n463/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0463-0446"/> places, consists in inserting the needle into the
                    charge and then tamping up the hole. Care is taken to draw out the needle a
                    little as the tamping proceeds, so as to prevent too much force being required
                    for its final withdrawal. The small hole left in this way serves for the
                    insertion of a straw, rush, or series of small quills, filled with fine powder,
                    which like the fuse reaches from the charge to the outside. A short squib which
                    shoots a stream of sparks down the needle hole is also used occasionally. The
                    straw or squib is lighted by some kind of slow match, made either by dipping a
                    cotton strand in melted sulphur or soaking a piece of paper or a lucifer in the
                    tallow of a candle; touch-paper also is used.</p>
                <p>Dynamite, blasting gelatin, gun-cotton, and cotton-powder are fired by the
                    detonation of a fulminating cap. A long copper cap containing fulminate of
                    mercury is fastened into the safety-fuse by squeezing with a pair of nippers,
                    and is then inserted into a small cartridge of the explosive <hi rend="italic"
                    >{primer),</hi> and placed above the rest of the charge. Fig. 24 shows a hole
                    charged with two dynamite cartridges, a primer with cap, and filled up with
                    water as tamping. Sometimes gun-cotton is fired by a small charge of powder
                    above it.</p>
                <p>Several substitutes for explosives have been tried with the object of getting rid
                    of the flame, which is dangerous in collieries giving off firedamp. Among these
                    may be mentioned plugs of dry wood which swell when wetted, wedges worked by
                    hydraulic pressure, cartridges containing compressed air at extremely high
                    pressures, and lastly cartridges of compressed lime which expands when water is
                    brought into it.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of firing several holes simultaneously, Messrs Bickford, Smith,
                    &amp; Co., the original inventors and makers of the safety-fuse, have brought
                    out a new fuse (fig. 25), the action of which will be easily understood from the
                    figure. An ordinary fuse is fixed into a metal case called the igniter, from
                    which a number of instantaneous fuses convey fire to as many separate holes. It
                    is found in practice that this fuse answers very well.</p>
                <p>Charges may be readily fired singly or simultaneously with the aid of
                    electricity, either of high tension obtained from a frictional,
                    magneto-electric, or dynamo-electric machine, or of low tension from a galvanic
                    battery. The former is preferred.</p>
                <p>Fig. 26 shows a section of one of Brain’s high-tension fuses. A is a cylindrical
                    wooden case containing a paper cartridge B, with an electric igniting
                    composition C at the bottom. Two copper wires D, D enclosed in gutta-percha E, E
                    reach down to the composition, where they are about - <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi> ⅛ inch apart. A copper cap or detonator G is fixed on to the small end of
                    the wooden case. The insulated wires D, D are long enough to reach beyond the
                    borehole. The ends of the wires are scraped bare, and one wire of the first hole
                    is twisted together with a wire of the next hole, and so on, and finally the two
                    odd wires of the first and last hole are connected to the two wires of a single
                    cable, or to two separate cables, extending to some place of safety to which the
                    men can retreat. Here the two cable wires are connected by binding screws to a
                    frictional electrical machine or dynamo exploder. A few turns of the handle
                    charge a condenser, and by pressing a knob or by some other device the circuit
                    is completed and the discharge effected. The electricity passes through the fuse
                    wires making a spark at each break, and so firing the electric igniting
                    composition. The flame flashes through the hole H, and ignites the fulminating
                    mercury I, the detonation of which causes the explosion of the dynamite,
                    blasting gelatin, or tonite surrounding the cap.</p>
                <p>One great advantage of electric firing is that the miner can retire to a
                    perfectly safe place before attempting to explode the charge. This is important
                    in sinking shafts, where the means of escape are less easy than in levels. A
                    second advantage is that there is no danger of a “hang fire,” an occasional
                    source of accidents with the ordinary safety-fuse.</p>
                <p>One of the greatest improvements in the art of mining during the last few years
                    has been the introduction of machinery for boring holes for blasting; most of
                    the machines imitate percussive boring by hand, but a few rotary machines are
                    also in use. A percussive drill or perforator consists of a cylinder with a
                    piston to which the drill is fastened. Compressed air is made to act alternately
                    on each side of the piston, and in this manner the drill receives its
                    reciprocating motion. Various arrangements have been adopted for securing the
                    automatic rotation of the drill. In some cases also the advance forward of the
                    machine, as the hole is deepened, is also effected automatically; but in many of
                    the best drills this work is left to the man in charge. It is impossible within
                    the limits of this article to describe the various drills now in use, or even to
                    make a complete enumeration of them.</p>
                <p>The following, in alphabetical order, are the names of some of the best-known
                    drills:—Barrow, Beaumont, Burleigh, Champion, Cornish, Cranston, Darlington,
                    Desideratum, Doering, Dubois and François,Dynamic, Eclipse, Excelsior, Ferroux,
                    Fröhlich, Ingersoll, Laxey, Mackean, Osterkampf, Band, Roanhead, Sandycroft,
                    Schram. An account of two of the simplest, the Barrow and the Darlington drills,
                    will be sufficient to give a general idea of the construction of these
                    machines.</p>
                <p>“The Barrow drill (fig. 27) consists essentially of a gun-metal cylinder C about
                    2 feet in length and 4 inches in diameter, in which works a cast-steel
                    piston-rod D, fitted with two pistons G, about 12 inches apart, mid-way between
                    which is the tappet, or boss, G ’. In a valve-box on the top of the cylinder is
                    placed the oscillating slide-valve H (shown separately), hinged at Μ, which is
                    worked by the reciprocation of the tappet G' coming in contact with its lower
                    edges, which for this purpose are formed with two slopes at each end, as shown.
                    It has ports corresponding with openings in the slide-valve face for admitting
                    the fresh steam or compressed air from the inlet pipe I (fig. 28) to the ports
                    <hi rend="italic">j</hi> at each end of the cylinder, and for letting the spent
                    or exhaust air or steam escape by the exhaust pipe J. This simple arrangement
                    constitutes the whole valve gear of the machine.</p>
                <p>“The borer is inserted into a hole formed in the fore end of the piston rod, and
                    is fixed therein by means of a screw. Its rotation is effected by hand, by means
                    of the handle D ', turning a spindle D', which is so fitted by means of the
                    cotter <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> made fast in the piston DG, and fitting in a
                    slot in the spindle D', that the latter can slide in the piston DG, but when
                    turned by the handle causes the piston to turn with it. The spindle D' has a
                    pinion E gearing into the pinion F, on the adjusting and feeding screw C', so
                    that when the piston D is turned by means of the handle D" the cylinder C is
                    simultaneously pushed along the bed-plate A. These pinions can be easily
                    disconnected by loosening the nut/, and thus the piston and the adjusting screw
                    can be turned independently of one another when required.</p>
                <p>“The borers used are respectively 1∣ inches, 1 ⅛ inches, and 1 inch in diameter,
                    the length of the stroke 4 inches, and the maximum number of blows about three
                    hundred per minute. The air is <pb break="no"

                    pressure of 50 to 55 lb to the square inch, in wrought-iron pipes 2 inches in
                    diameter in the shaft, and 1⅛ inches in the level, and admitted through a
                    flexible tube into the inlet I on the left-hand side of the cylinder. The cost
                    of the pipes is rather under 7d. a foot, or about 3s. 3d. per fathom. The air is
                    compressed at the surface by a 14-inch compressor, worked by a 12-inch
                    horizontal engine, capable, however, of working two machine drills. The gross
                    weight of the machine, including the bed-plate and gudgeon, is about 115
                    lb.”</p>
                <p>The method of fixing the machine for work is as follows :—“The bed-plate A of the
                    machine is formed with a gudgeon A' which fits into, and can be adjusted to any
                    position in, a socket formed in or on a clamp B', which can be fixed on any part
                    of the wrought-iron bar or column B, thus forming a universal joint. This bar or
                    column can be placed in position either horizontally or vertically, as may be
                    most convenient, but is generally placed across the level, against the sides of
                    which it is secured by means of the clamp I., and adjusting screw Μ, and claws N
                    and N'. If necessary, wooden wedges 0, O' are driven in between the claws and
                    the wall to make it still firmer. The weight of the bar is about 120 lb.”<note

                <p>Air-compressing plant of greater size has now been erected at Dolcoath mine, to
                    which the above description refers. At Snailbeach mine in Shropshire they have
                    two air-compressors of 18 inches diameter and 5 feet stroke; the air-main is at
                    first 9 inches in diameter, then 6 inches, whilst 2-inch gas-pipe is used in the
                    levels.</p>
                <p>A rock-drill which has done, and is doing, excellent work is that of Mr John
                    Darlington. Its construction will be understood by referring to figs. 29, 30,
                    and 31; <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the cylinder, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the
                    piston rod, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the borer; <hi rend="italic">d, d</hi> are
                    two openings for bringing in compressed air, either of which may be used
                    according to the position of the drill; <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is the inlet
                    hose with a stopcock, /drill-holder, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> stretcher bar, <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> piston, <hi rend="italic">j</hi> rifled bar for turning
                    piston and drill, <hi rend="italic">k</hi> ratchet wheel attached to rifled bar,
                    <hi rend="italic">I</hi> rifled nut fixed in the piston head, <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> wood for lessening weight of piston rod and blocking space, <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> portway for allowing the compressed air to pass to the top
                    of the piston and give the blow, <hi rend="italic">o</hi> exhaust portway. The
                    action oi the drill is as follows. The compressed air is always acting on the
                    underside of the piston, and when the upper side of the piston communicates with
                    the outer atmosphere the piston moves rapidly backwards and uncovers the portway
                    <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> The compressed air rushes through and presses against
                    the upper side of the piston, which has a greater area than the lower side, the
                    difference being equal to the area of the piston rod. The piston is driven
                    rapidly downwards and the drill strikes its blow. At the same time it uncovers
                    the exhaust port <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and then the constant pressure on the
                    annular area on the underside of the piston produces the return stroke. The
                    number of blows per minute is from six hundred to eight hundred. The rotation of
                    the drill is effected by the rifled bar. On the down-stroke of the piston the
                    bar with its ratchet wheel is free to turn under a couple of pawls, and
                    consequently the piston moves straight whilst the bar and ratchet wheel turn.
                    When the up-stroke is being made the ratchet wheel is held by the pawls and the
                    piston is forced to make part of a revolution. As the hole is deepened the
                    cylinder is advanced forwards by turning the handle <hi rend="italic">p</hi>;
                    this works an endleg screw <hi rend="italic">q</hi><pb break="no"

                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the cradle carrying the feed-screw and supporting
                    the cylinder. It is centred on the clamp <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> As this clamp
                    can be fixed in any position on the bar, and as the cradle can be turned on the
                    clamp, it is evident that holes can be bored in any direction.</p>
                <p>In driving a level with the Darlington drill it is usual to fix the stretcher bar
                    horizontally across the level so as to command the upper part of the face; holes
                    can then be bored with the cradle above the bar or below it. The bar is then
                    shifted low enough to bore the bottom holes. It is found that all the necessary
                    holes can be bored from two positions of the bar. The bar therefore has simply
                    to be fixed twice; the alterations in position for boring holes in various
                    directions are managed by shifting the clamp on the bar and turning the cradle
                    on the clamp. Fig. 31 shows the stretcher bar fixed in a vertical position,
                    which is sometimes convenient.</p>
                <p>In order to clear out the sludge from holes that are “looking downwards,” a jet
                    of water, supplied from a hose attached to a halfinch gas-pine leading from a
                    cistern at a higher level, is made to play into the holes during the process of
                    boring.</p>
                <p>For sinking shafts Mr Darlington has the drill fixed in a cylindrical case with a
                    large external thread which works in a nut on the clamp. The drill is fed
                    forwards by turning a hand-wheel attached to the case.</p>
                <p>Rotating machine drills are also used in mines as well as those with percussive
                    action. Stapff pointed out some years ago that, if a rock may be chipped off by
                    power communicated by a blow, it may also be chipped off by a similar amount of
                    power communicated by pressure. Brandt’s rotatory boring-machine consists of a
                    hollow borer which has a steel crown with cutting edges screwed on. The tool is
                    kept tight against the rock by the pressure of a column of water, and is at the
                    same time made to rotate by two little water-pressure engines, whilst a stream
                    of water passing down through the borer washes away the débris and keeps the
                    cutting edges cool. In principle, therefore, this drill resembles the original
                    diamond boring machine of De la Roche-Tolay and Perret, save that the crown is
                    made of steel and not of diamonds. During the last few years it has been tried
                    with success in railway tunnels and in mines. Jarolimek’s drill<note

                    is fed forwards and pressed against the rock by a differential screw
                    arrangement. The machine can be worked by hand, or by a little water-pressure or
                    compressed-air engine or an electro-motor. In working certain minerals occurring
                    in seams the undercutting may be performed by machines similar to those used in
                    coal mines (see vol. vi. p. 68).</p>
                <p>We now come to the application of the tools and machine drills to the purpose of
                    breaking ground for driving levels and sinking shafts.</p>
                <p>A level or drift is a more or less horizontal passage or tunnel, whilst a shaft
                    is a pit either vertical or inclined. In driving a level by hand labour in hard
                    ground, the first thing the miner has to do is to take out a cut, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> blast out a preliminary opening in tħe “end” or
                    “forebreast.” The position of this cut is determined by the joints, which the
                    miner studies carefully so as to obtain the greatest advantage from these
                    natural planes of division. Thus fig. 32 shows a case in which, owing to joints,
                    it was advisable to begin with a hole No. 1, and then bore and blast 2, 3, and 4
                    one after the other. The miner as a rule does not plan the position of any hole
                    until the previous one has done its work; in fact he regulates the position and
                    depth of each hole by the particular circumstances of the case. Though a vein
                    and its walls may be hard, there is occasionally a soft layer of clay (DD, DD,
                    fig. 33) along one wall (&lt;¾r, Cornwall; <hi rend="italic">gouge,</hi> United
                    States). The miner then works this away with the pick, and, having excavated a
                    groove as deep as possible, he can now blast down the lode by side holes and so
                    push the level forward.</p>
                <p>In sinking a shaft a similar method of proceeding is observed. A little pit (s⅛λ)
                    is blasted out in the most convenient part, and the excavation is widened to the
                    full size by a succession of blasts, each hole being planned according to
                    circumstances. This series of operations is repeated, and the shaft is thus
                    gradually deepened.</p>
                <p>Where boring machinery is employed, less attention, and sometimes no attention,
                    is paid to natural joints, because when once the drill is in its place it is
                    very little trouble to bore a few more holes, and the work can then be carried
                    on according to a system which is certain of effecting the desired result.</p>
                <p>A common method of procedure for hard ground is shown in figs. 34 and 35. Four
                    centre holes are bored about a foot apart at first, but converging till at a
                    depth of 3 feet they are within 6 inches, or less, of each other. Other holes
                    are then bored around them until the end is pierced by twenty or thirty holes in
                    all. The four centre holes are then charged and fired simultaneously, either by
                    electricity or by Bickford’s instantaneous fuse, and the result is the removal
                    of a large core of rock. The holes round the opening are then charged and fired,
                    generally in volleys of several holes at a time, and the level is thus carried
                    forward for a distance of 3 feet. If the ground is more favourable fewer holes
                    are required, and they may be bored deeper,—in fact as much as 6 feet in some
                    instances. Occasionally the four centre holes are directed so that they meet at
                    the apex of an acute pyramid, and then, after all have been charged with
                    blasting gelatin, only one of them receives a primer and cap; the shock of the
                    explosion of one charge fires the other three adjacent charges simultaneously.
                    The preliminary opening is not necessarily made in the centre of a level, and
                    sometimes it is blasted out in the bottom or one side.</p>
                <p>In sinking shafts by boring machinery operations are conducted much in the same
                    way as in levels, save ot course that the holes are directed downwards. Fiers.
                    36 and 37 are a section and plan of a shaft which is now being sunk at the
                    Foxdale mines in the Isle of Man.</p>
                <p>About forty-five holes are bored in the bottom of the shaft before the drills are
                    removed; two of the holes A, B, and occasionally four, are bored only 4 feet
                    deep, and are blasted with ordinary fuse. They serve simply to smash up and
                    weaken the core; then the six holes nearest the centre, which are 8 feet deep,
                    are blasted all together with Bickford’s instantaneous fuse, and the result is
                    the removal of a large core leaving a deep <hi rend="italic">sink.</hi> The
                    remaining holes are fired in volleys of four at a time in the ordinary way. In
                    this manner the shaft, which is in hard granite, is being deepened at the rate
                    of 3⅜ or 4 fathoms a month. Tonite is the explosive used.</p>
                <p>Sundry machines have been invented and used for driving levels without blasting.

                    way at present into ordinary mining. The Bosscyeuse of MM. Dubois and François
                    acts on a different principle. It is a strong machine worked by compressed air.
                    It first of all drills holes 4 inches in diameter by percussion; a striking head
                    is then substituted for the drill, and wedges, on the principle of the plug and
                    feathers, are inserted into the holes; and powerful blows with the striking head
                    wedge off the rock in lumps. This machine is being used with success in Belgium
                    for driving levels and crosscuts in fiery mines.</p>
                <p>Some comparative experiments between hand-labour, a percussive drill, and a
                    rotatory drill have lately been made in one of the Freiberg mines,<note

                <p>The advantages of machine work are very marked indeed both as regards rate and
                    cost of driving, and wages earned by the men. Brandt’s rotatory drill did its
                    work cheaper and faster than Schram’s machine; but nothing is said in the
                    original notice of the advantage of a machine driven by compressed air for
                    ventilating workings such as advanced headings in which these drills are
                    employed.</p>
                <p>Brandt’s machine was worked with water at a pressure of 83⅛ atmospheres, of which
                    56 ’ 6 atmospheres were obtained by pressure pumps provided with an accumulator,
                    and 26’9 atmospheres by natural fall, owing to the working level being 277
                    metres below the pumps. The water was conveyed to the machine in iron pipes of
                    1⅛ inches diameter inside. The diameter of the holes bored was 2⅜ inches, and
                    they could be bored in gneiss at the rate of 1⅜ inches per minute. The stretcher
                    bar on which the machine is carried is hollow, and has a piston which can be
                    forced out by hydraulic pressure so as to fix the bar firmly. A similar bar is
                    sometimes used with percussive drills.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>As a method of breaking ground the ancient process of fire-setting requires to be
                    mentioned. Before blasting was known it was largely employed, but its use is now
                    confined to a few places on the Continent where the rocks are exceedingly hard
                    and where wood is abundant and cheap. Piles of wood are heaped up against the
                    face of the workings and set on fire. On returning to the working place two or
                    three days afterwards, when the rocks have cooled a little, it is found that the
                    ground has split and flaked off, and that much has been loosened which can be
                    removed by the pick and wedge.</p>
                <p>We finally come to water as an agent for removing rocks. Streams of water were
                    formerly used in South Wales for working beds of clay ironstone at the outcrop.
                    The water washed away the clay and shale and left the clean nodules of
                    ironstone. The china clay of Cornwall is also worked by water: a stream of water
                    is turned on to the soft mass, and the workman loosens the ground with a pick;
                    the water carries off the particles of decomposed rock in suspension to regular
                    settling pits. Water under pressure has rendered vast services to the miner in
                    working auriferous alluvia. The system is described and figured at p. 746 of
                    vol. x., so it is unnecessary here to enter into details. In the special case of
                    salt-mines recourse may be had to the solvent action of water, directed by
                    suitable jets, for making excavations.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Principles of Employment of Mining Labour.—</hi> As a large
                    proportion of the expenditure in mining is for actual manual labour, it is very
                    important that means should be taken to prevent any waste in this department.
                    Three principles are in vogue—payment by time, by work done either measured or
                    weighéd, and by the value of the ore extracted.</p>
                <p>The overseers, called captains in many metal mines, are naturally paid by the
                    month, and where strict supervision can be exercised, such as is possible at the
                    surface, on the dressing-floors for instance, the same principle may be adopted;
                    but when men are working underground, and often in small gangs of only two or
                    three persons at some distance apart, piecework of some kind is more economical
                    and satisfactory in ev^ry way.</p>
                <p>In driving levels and sinking shafts it is usual for the men to work at a certain
                    price per running yard or fathom. The agents have to see that the excavation,
                    whether shaft or level, is maintained of the full dimensions agreed upon, and
                    preserved in the proper direction. At the end of a certain time, generally a
                    month, the work is measured by the agent. From the gross amount obtained by
                    multiplying the price by the number of fathoms driven or sunk it is necessary to
                    deduct the cost of the materials supplied to the men by the mining company, such
                    as explosives, steel, candles, Ac., and the remainder is divided among the
                    persons who took the contract. When the useful mineral is being obtained the men
                    may be paid at so much per cubic yard or fathom excavated, or at so much per ton
                    of mineral extracted; the overseer of course has to see, in this latter case,
                    that worthless rock is not sent to the surface. Payment by the number of inches
                    bored is a method in use in some countries, where the men are not experienced or
                    enterprising enough to undertake the work in any other way. A foreman points out
                    to the men the position and direction in which the holes must be bored, measures
                    them when completed, and subsequently charges and fires them.</p>
                <p>The third method is that which is known as the tribute system. The miner working
                    on tribute is allowed to speculate upon the value of the ore in a certain
                    working area assigned to him and called his <hi rend="italic">pitch.</hi> He
                    gives the mining company all the ore he extracts at a certain proportion of its
                    value, after he has paid all the cost of breaking it, hoisting it to the
                    surface, and dressing it. Thus, supposing he takes a pitch at 5s. in the £, and
                    produces marketable copper ore of the value of £50, his share will be 50 × 5s.
                    =£12, 10s., less the cost of the materials he has been supplied with, and all
                    expenses for winding, dressing, sampling, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Means of Securing Excavations by Timber, Iron, and
                    Masonry.—</hi> The following kinds of timber are those most frequently employed
                    for securing excavations underground: oak, larch, pitch pine, spruce fir, and
                    acacia. In ifiany mines the timber is attacked by dry rot, which gradually
                    renders it useless, and when the timber has often to be renewed the expense may
                    be very considerable. Various methods of preventing dry rot have been tried with
                    more or less success, such as letting water trickle over the timber in the mine
                    or treating it with preservative solutions beforehand. Brine, creosote, and
                    solutions of chloride of zinc, sulphate of zinc, sulphate of copper, and
                    sulphate of iron increase the duration of timber. It was found by experiments
                    carried on at Commentry during a long series of years that one of the best
                    plans‘was to soak the timber for twenty-four hours in a strong solution of
                    sulphate of iron. The total cost was only jd. per yard of prop, whilst the
                    timber lasted eleven times as long as when this simple treatment was
                    omitted.</p>
                <p>Timber is used in various forms—either whole and merely sawn into lengths, or
                    squared up, or sawn in half, or sawn into planks of various thicknesses.</p>
                <p>Where the roof of a bed is weak it may be kept up by simple props; but in some
                    coalmines and clay-mines a better support is obtained by logs <hi rend="italic"
                    >(chocks)</hi> laid two by two crosswise (fig. 38).</p>
                <p>Though a level is an excavation of a very simple nature, the methods of timbering
                    it vary considerably, because the parts requiring support may either be the roof
                    alone, or the roof and one or two sides, or the roof, sides, and bottom.</p>
                <p>If the roof only is weak, as is the case with a soft lode between two hard walls,
                    a <hi rend="italic">cap</hi> with a few boards resting on ⅛ (fig. 39) is
                    sufficient to prevent falls. If one side is weak the cap must be <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0467-0450"/> supported by a side prop or <hi rend="italic"
                    >leg</hi> (fig. 40), and very often by two legs. The forms of joint between the
                    cap and leg are numerous</p>
                <p>(fig. 41), depending to a great extent upon the nature of the pressure, whether
                    coming upon the top or sides. With round timber the top of the leg is sometimes
                    hollowed as shown in fig. 42 A, but occasionally the joint is flat and a thick
                    nail, or <hi rend="italic">nog,</hi> is put in (fig. 42 B)</p>
                <p>to prevent the effects of side pressure, or, better, a piece of thick plank is
                    nailed under the cap (fig. 43). Where the floor of a level is soft and weak, a
                    sole-piece or <hi rend="italic">sill</hi> becomes necessary, and, if the sides
                    or roof are likely to fall in, a lining of poles or planks is used (fig.
                    43).</p>
                <p>In some very heavy ground in the Comstock lode a special system of timbering is
                    adopted (fig. 44).</p>
                <p>If the ground is loose, so that the roof or sides, or both, will run in unless
                    immediately supported, the method of working called <hi rend="italic"
                    >spilling</hi> or <hi rend="italic">poling</hi> is pursued. It consists in
                    supporting the weak parts by boards or poles kept in advance of the last frame
                    set up. The poles or boards <hi rend="italic">(laths)</hi> are driven forward by
                    blows from a sledge, and the ground is then worked away with the pick; as soon
                    as a sufficient advance has been made a new frame is set up to support the ends
                    of the poles or boards and the process is repeated (figs. 46 and</p>
                <p>46). In running ground it is necessary to have the laths fitting closely
                    together, and the working face also must be supported by <hi rend="italic"
                    >breast-boards</hi> kept in place by little struts resting against the frame.
                    These are removed and advanced one by one after the laths in the roof and side
                    have been driven beyond them.</p>
                <p>On account of the high price of timber, iron is sometimes employed in its place.
                    One method in use in the Harz consists in bending a rail into the form shown in
                    fig. 47 and making it support other rails laid longitudinally, against which
                    flattish stones are placed; the vacant spaces are then filled with rubbish.</p>
                <p>Masonry has long been used for supporting the sides of mining excavations. The
                    materials necessary are stone, ordinary bricks, or slag-bricks, and they may be
                    built up alone <hi rend="italic">(dry walling)</hi> or with the aid of mortar or
                    hydraulic cement. The bottom of a level is occasionally lined with concrete to
                    carry a large stream of water, which otherwise might run into lower workings
                    through cracks and crevices. Dry walling is not uncommon, and it may be combined
                    with the use of timber (or iron) as shown in fig. 69, in which a level is
                    maintained between two walls keeping back a mass of rubbish.</p>
                <p>Figs. 48 and 49 show methods of securing a drift by arches when a lode has been
                    removed.</p>
                <p>The timbering required for shafts varies according to the nature of the ground
                    and the size of the excavation. A mere lining of planks set on their edges (fig.
                    50) suffices for small shafts, corner pieces being nailed to keep the successive
                    frames together. In some of the salt-mines of Cheshire the shafts are lined with
                    4-inch planks united by mortice and tenon joints.</p>
                <p>The usual method of securing shafts is by <hi rend="italic">sets</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">frames.</hi> Each set consists of four pieces, two longer ones
                    called <hi rend="italic">wall-plates</hi> and two shorter ones called <hi
                    rend="italic">endpieces.</hi> They are joined by simply halving the timber as
                    shown in fig. 51. A more complicated joint (fig. 52) is often preferred. The
                    separate frames are kept apart by corner pieces <hi rend="italic"
                    >(studdies,</hi> Cornwall; <hi rend="italic">jogs,</hi> Flintshire), and loose
                    ground is prevented from falling in by boards or poles outside the frames.</p>
                <p>As shafts are frequently used for the several purposes of pumping, hoisting, and
                    affording means of ingress and egress by ladders, it becomes necessary in such
                    cases to divide them into compartments. Pieces of timber parallel to the
                    end-pieces <hi rend="italic">(buntons</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dividings)</hi>
                    are fixed across the shaft, and serve to stay the wall-plates and carry the
                    guides as well as to support planks <hi rend="italic">(casing boards)</hi> which
                    are nailed to them so as to form a continuous partition or brattice. The
                    magnificent timbering of some of the shafts on the Comstock lode is described by
                    Mr James D. Hague as follows:<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"> United</hi><hi rend="italic">

                    Parallel,</hi> vol. iii., “Mining Industry,” p. 103.</p></note> — “The timbering
                    consists of framed sets or cribs of square timber, placed horizontally, 4 feet
                    apart, and separated by uprights or posts introduced between them. Cross-timbers
                    for the partitions between the compartments form a part of every set. The whole
                    is covered on the outside by a lagging of 3-inch plank placed vertically.” Figs.
                    53, 54, and 55, copied from Mr Hague’s plates, illustrate this method <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0468-0451"/> of timbering. Fig. 53 is a plan of the shaft: “S,
                    S are the longitudinal or all-timbers, T, T the transverse end-timbers, P
                    partitiontimbers, <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> guide-rods between λvhich the cage
                    moves, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> gains cut in the sill-timbers, to receive the
                    ends of the posts. The sheathing or lagging is seen enclosing the whole frame?’
                    Fig. 54 is a transverse section through the partition P of fig. 53, “between the
                    pumping compartment and the adjoining hoisting compartment, looking towards the
                    latter. In this figure, G, G are the posts, S the sill-timbers, P the
                    partition-timbers, the ends of which are framed with short tenons that are
                    received in gains cut in the silltimbers and the ends of the posts, <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> guide-rod, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> lagging or sheathing.”
                    Fig. 55 is an end view of the frame shown in fig. 53. “The single piece T forms
                    the end, while the double pieces P forming the partitions are seen beyond.” “The
                    outer timbers of each set, that is, the two sides and ends of the main frame,
                    are 14 inches square; the posts, ten in number, four at the comers and two at
                    each end of the three partitions, are of the same size. The dividing timbers,
                    forming the partitions, are 12 inches square.”</p>
                <p>When ground is loose or running, recourse must be had to a <hi rend="italic"
                    >spilling</hi> process like that described for levels. Strong balks of timber
                    are fixed at the surface or in solid ground, and then the first frame is hung
                    from these <hi rend="italic">bearers,</hi> and each successive frame from the
                    one above it. Iron bars with cotters may be used for suspending the sets; but on
                    the Comstock lode each bolt is made in two parts with a tightening screw in the
                    middle, and the sets can thus be kept very firmly together. The laths are driven
                    in advance, in the manner explained in the case of levels, and a new frame is
                    put in as soon as the excavation has been sufficiently deepened within the
                    protecting sheath of boards. In very unstable ground it may be necessary to put
                    in the frames touching each other, so that the shaft becomes encased in a solid
                    box of timber, occasionally 14 inches thick.</p>
                <p>Like levels, shafts may be lined with masonry or brickwork, and these have the
                    advantage of being far more permanent than timber, and of requiring fewer
                    repairs. This kind of shaft-lining is especially desirable in the loose ground
                    near the surface; because, if the working is discontinued temporarily, the shaft
                    still remains secure and available for use at any future time, whereas if timber
                    is put in it often decays, the top of the shaft collapses, and much expense is
                    incurred in the process of reopening it. The section of the shafts that are
                    walled is generally circular as affording the best resistance to pressure; but
                    elliptical walling is also met with. Another shape is like a rectangle, save
                    that the sides, instead of being straight, form curves of large radius. The
                    walling may be dry or with mortar, according to circumstances.</p>
                <p>The masonry is put in either in one length or in successive portions in
                    descending order, and this is the usual plan. The shaft is sunk a certain depth,
                    with temporary timbering if necessary, and when firm ground has been reached a
                    bed is cut out round the shaft, and on this is placed a crib or curb AB (fig.
                    56)<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J. Callon, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures on Mining,</hi> vol. i., Atlas, plate xxviii.</p></note>
                    consisting of segments of timber which form a ring. This serves for a foundation
                    for the brickwork, which is built up to the surface; the temporary timbering is
                    removed, and the space filled up with earth or concrete. Sinking is then resumed
                    below the curb, and for a certain distance of a smaller diameter, so as to leave
                    a bracket, or ledge, to support the first curb. On arriving, after a certain
                    depth of sinking, at another firm bed, a second curb CD is put in and a portion
                    of brickwork built up. When the ledge of rock is reached, it is carefully
                    removed in small sections and the brickwork brought up to the first curb. This
                    process is repeated till the shaft is completed, or reaches rock in which no
                    masonry is requisite. If, owing to the nature of the ground, it is impossible at
                    first to find a firm seat for the curbs, it becomes necessary to hang them by
                    iron bolts from a strong bearing frame at the surface.</p>
                <p>When shafts pass through very watery strata, it is most desirable to stop all
                    influx into the mine for the purpose of saving the heavy expense of pumping. The
                    manner in which this is effected by a watertight lining, known as tubbing, is
                    described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Coal,</hi> vol. vi. p. 62, where
                    will also be found an account of Triger’s plan of sinking shafts with compressed
                    air, and the very successful method of boring shafts through water-bearing
                    ground invented by Messrs Kind &amp; Chaudron,</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Exploitation, or Working Away of Veins, Beds, and
                    Masses.—</hi> We have described how shafts are sunk and levels driven, and we
                    now come to the processes employed in removing the mineral.</p>
                <p>The deposit must first of all be reached by a shaft, or, where the contour of the
                    country permits it, by a level. In the case of a vein an exploratory shaft is
                    often sunk on the course of the lode for 20 or 30 fathoms, and, if the
                    indications found in a level driven out from this shaft warrant further
                    prosecution of the mine, a first working shaft is sunk to intersect the lode at
                    a depth of 100 fathoms or more from the surface. Crosscuts are then driven out
                    at intervals of 10,15, or 20 fathoms to reach the lode, as shown in fig. 57,
                    which represents a section at right angles to the line of strike. Sometimes the
                    main shafts are carried down all the way along the dip of the deposit, though
                    perpendicular shafts have the advantages of quicker and cheaper winding and
                    cheaper pumping, to say nothing of the possibility of utilizing the cages for
                    the rapid descent and ascent of the miners. If an inclined shaft appears to be
                    advisable, great care should be taken to sink it in a straight line. In either
                    case levels are driven out along the strike of the lode as shown in the
                    longitudinal section fig. 58, in the hopes of meeting with valuable ore-</p>
                <p>bodies such as are represented by the stippled portions of the figure. For the
                    purpose of affording ventilation, and still further exploring the ground and
                    working it, intermediate shafts, called <hi rend="italic">winzes</hi> (Cornwall)
                    or <hi rend="italic">sumps</hi> (North Wales), are sunk in the lode.</p>
                <p>The actual mode of removing the lode itself depends a good deal upon
                    circumstances, viz., its width, the nature of its contents, and the walls that
                    enclose it; but the methods of working may generally be brought under one of two
                    heads, viz., underhand stoping or overhand stoping. The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >slope</hi> is equivalent to step, and the term stoping means working away any
                    deposit in a series of steps. <hi rend="italic">Underhand</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">bottom stopes</hi> are workings arranged like the steps of a
                    staircase seen from above, whilst <hi rend="italic">overhand</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">back stopes</hi> are like similar steps seen from underneath. Both
                    methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and both are largely used.</p>
                <p>We will first take underhand stoping, as this is the older method. In the old
                    days the miner began in the floor of the level (fig. 59), and sank down a few
                    feet, removing the part 1; he followed with 2, 3, 4, &amp;c., until the
                    excavation finally presented the appearanc∙ shown in fig. 60. Any valueless rock
                    or mineral was deposited upon platforms of timber <hi rend="italic"
                    >(stulls),</hi> and the ore was drawn up into the level <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n469/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0469-0452"/> by a windlass. One great disadvantage of this
                    method is that the ore and water have to be drawn up some distance by hand
                    labour; much timber is required for the stulls if there is a large quantity of
                    worthless stuff in the vein, or if the sides are weak. The advantages are that
                    ore can be worked away as soon as the level is driven, that the men are always
                    boring downwards, and, lastly, that the ore can be carefully picked after it is
                    broken, without fear of any valuable particles being lost.</p>
                <p>A more economical method of working by underhand stopes, and one largely employed
                    in Cornwall at the present day, consists in reserving any attack upon the
                    ore-ground until a lower level has been driven. An intermediate shaft <hi
                    rend="italic">{winze)</hi> between the two levels is then made, either by
                    sinking from the upper level or rising from the lower one. The work of stoping
                    is commenced at the two upper ends of the winze, and the lode is removed in a
                    succession of steps, the workings assuming the appearance exhibited in fig. 61.
                    The steps are generally made steep, so that the ore may readily roll into the
                    winze, and so that the bore-holes may do better execution; but these steep
                    stopes are dangerous if a man happens to slip and fall. The huge open chasms
                    left by the removal of a large lode in this way are also a source of danger; for
                    there is always a risk of falls of rock, and from places which cannot easily be
                    examined.</p>

                    explain the general arrangement of the workings of the largest tin mine in
                    Cornwall. The lode after producing copper ores to a considerable depth changed
                    its character and became rich in tin. The workings for tin ore are confined
                    almost entirely, to the granite. The section fig. 62 shows that the mam shaft of
                    the mine is at first vertical and then carried down on the dip of the lode.</p>
                <p>The process of overhand stoping is precisely the reverse of that which has been
                    just described; the work is commenced from a rise</p>
                <p>(fig. 64 A), or better from the two bottom ends of a winze (fig. 64 B). As soon
                    as the men have excavated a sufficient height of the roof of the level, they put
                    in strong pieces of timber from wall to wall, and <pb break="no"

                    throw down the rubbish upon the platform <hi rend="italic">(stull, bunning)</hi>
                    thus formed. In the midst of the rubbish chimney· like openings <hi
                    rend="italic">(mills, passes)</hi> are reserved, lined with boards or
                    dry-walling, and closed at the bottom with shoots provided with doors. The ore
                    is thrown into these passes, which are tapped when necessary; the ore falls into
                    the tram-waggon placed ready to receive it.</p>
                <p>Fig. 65 gives a transverse section showing the rubbish resting on the stull. This
                    is what may be called the typical method of stoping, when the lode affords
                    rubbish enough for the men to stand on and to keep them close to the rock they
                    are attacking. Very often such is not the case, and the whole of the lode has to
                    be sent to the surface for treatment. If the walls are firm, the lode is
                    sometimes stoped away, a stull put in, and a sufficient heap of broken ore is
                    left upon the stull to give the men good standing ground; the excess is thrown
                    over the ends of the stu∏, or the great heap is tapped by cutting a hole in the
                    stull-covering, and allowing a quantity to run down into the level.</p>
                <p>Another method consists in putting in temporary stages upon which the men stand
                    to do their work, whilst the excavation is left as an open space (fig. 66). This
                    mode of working is incompatible with weak walls. If a lode does not afford
                    rubbish enough for completely filling up the excavated space, or if it is too
                    narrow for men to do their work comfortably, one of the walls may be cut into
                    and blasted down (fig. 67), so that the men always stand upon a firm bed of
                    rubbish while at work, and there is no fear of a collapse of the mine. In
                    certain special cases rubbish is sent down from the surface to fill up the
                    excavations.</p>
                <p>The advantages of overhand stoping are — that the miner is assisted by gravity in
                    his work, that no ore or rock has to be drawn up by hand labour, and that less
                    timber is required. On the other hand, the miner is always menaced by falls, but
                    as he is close by he can constantly test the solidity of the roof and sides by
                    sounding them with his sledge; there is the further disadvantage that particles
                    of ore may be lost in the rubbish, but this loss is often prevented by laying
                    down boards or sheets of iron while the lode is being broken down.</p>
                <p>When very wide lodes come to be worked, recourse is often had to special methods.
                    The great lode at the famous Van mine, in Montgomeryshire, is sometimes 40 feet
                    in width, and the hanging wall is weak. The lode is stoped away overhand, and
                    the cavities packed with rubbish, part of which is derived from the lode itself,
                    whilst the greater portion is supplied from a special quarry at the surface.

                    the original cross cut (not in the line of section) by which the lode was
                    reached, B is the <hi rend="italic">flucan,</hi> C the bastard lode, generally
                    worthless, E the main lode, H permanent levels, and K <hi rend="italic"

                    the level H with P the permanent level in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >country.</hi></p>
                <p>If the lode is not firm enough to allow of the stopes being carried for its full
                    width, the crosscut method is adopted; the workings in this case, instead of
                    proceeding along the strike, are carried across the deposit from one wall to
                    another.</p>
                <p>The lode is removed in successive horizontal slices A,B,C,D,E, and for each slice
                    a level (I., fig. 69) is driven, either in the lode.</p>
                <p>or partly or entirely in the country; from this level crosscuts arc put out 6 or
                    8 feet wide, as shown in the plan (fig. 70). These arc regularly timbered
                    according to the necessities of the case, and, when No. 1 is completed, No. 2 is
                    begun, and the rubbish from No. 2 thrown into the empty space of No. 1 crosscut.
                    If the quantity is insufficient, deads are brought in from the surface oι from
                    exploratory workings in worthless rock in the neighbourhood. Sometimes the
                    crosscuts are not driven side by side, but 1 and 5 would be driven first,
                    leaving 2, 3, and 4 as a solid pillar; then 3 would be worked away, and finally
                    2 and 4 between the timber and rubbish on each side. The greater part of the
                    timber can be recovered when the next slice above is taken off, as the props are
                    put in with the small ends downwards, and can be drawn up with levers. Μ (fig.
                    69) is a level reserved in the deads for traffic and ventilation. This method of
                    working is applicable not only to lodes but also to irregular masses.</p>
                <p>In working away the soft “bonanzas” or ore-bodies of the great Comstock lode,
                    which are from 10 to 30 or even 40 or 50 feet wide, and which are enclosed in
                    very unstable ground, a special method of timbering is employed (figs. 71 and
                    72).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> James D. Hague,

                    framing timbers together in rectangular sets, each set being composed of a
                    square base placed horizontally, formed of four timbers, sills, and
                    cross-pieces, 4 to 6 feet long, framed together, surmounted by four posts 6 to 7
                    feet high, at each comer, and capped by a frame-work, similar to that of the
                    base. These cap-pieces, forming the top of any set, are at the same time the
                    sills or base of the next set above, the posts, as the sets rise one above the
                    other in the stope, being generally placed in position directly over those
                    below.” “The timbers are usually of 12-inch stuff square-hewn or sawn.” Each
                    post has a tenon 9 inches long at the upper end, and a tenon of 2 inches at the
                    lower end, which fit into mortices in the cap and sill respectively; and “the
                    sills and caps have short tenons on each end and shoulders cut to receive the
                    ends of the post and the horizontal cross-pieces.” The walls of the excavation
                    are sustained by a lagging of 3-inch or 4-inch plank. The whole width of the
                    ore-body is stoped away at once, and its place ≡lied by timbering, and ly the
                    vacant space is filled with waste rock derived from dead work in the mine or
                    from special excavations, — underground quarries in fact,—in barren ground. The
                    stoping is carried on overhand, starting from an intermediate shaft or winze,
                    and fig. 73 will explain how the different frames are built up one above the
                    other.</p>
                <p>Another method of working a wide lode is to attack it in slices <pb break="no"

                    separately as if it were a lode of ordinary dimensions, and filling up with
                    rubbish (fig. 74).</p>
                <p>We now come to beds or seams. The mode of working the most important beds that
                    occur in the earth’s crust, viz., coal seams, has already been described in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Coal</hi> (vol. vi. p. 64 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.),</hi> and details have been given concerning the removal of the mineral by
                    pillai’ working and long-wall working. Both these methods are applicable in the
                    case of seams of other minerals. Such for instance are the beds of fire-clay and
                    clay-ironstone which are -wrought by both the processes just mentioned, and
                    often in connexion with coal.</p>
                <p>Next in importance to coal is ironstone, and a brief account of the workings in
                    the Cleveland district will explain the manner in which more than one-third of
                    the iron ore raised in the British Isles is obtained by mining. It resembles the
                    ‘ ‘ bord and pillar” system used for working coal in Durham.</p>
                <p>The Cleveland ore occurs in the form of a bed from 6 to 16 feet thick in the
                    Middle Lias, lying pretty level. A mainway (fig. 75) is driven about 12 feet
                    wide for a considerable distance, and at right angles to it <hi rend="italic"
                    >bords</hi> are driven 5 yards wide for a length of 30 yards, and then at right
                    angles a <hi rend="italic">wall</hi> 7 or 8 feet wide and 20 yards long. By
                    drivages of this kind the bed is cut up into pillars or blocks 30 yards long by
                    20 yards wide. The pillars are subsequently removed in the following way. A <hi
                    rend="italic">place,</hi> or drift, <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> 6 feet wide, is
                    driven across the pillar 10 yards from the corner, and portions <hi
                    rend="italic">(lifts)</hi> about 6 yards wide are worked away in the order 1, 2,
                    3. After No. 1 lift has been removed, the timber put in to support the roof
                    temporarily is withdrawn, and the roof is allowed to fall; No. 2 is then taken,
                    and No. 3 in the same way. While these lifts are being taken out, another place
                    <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> is being driven across the pillar 10 yards from the
                    first, and the pillar removed entirely by a series of fresh lifts.</p>
                <p>Fig. 76 represents in section and plan the chambers and pillars of the
                    underground gypsum quarries which supply the well-known plaster of Paris to all
                    the world.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Callon, <hi
                    rend="italic"> Lecture» on Mining,</hi> vol. 11. plate xli.</p></note> The
                    principal bed is from 50 to 60 feet in thickness; pillars are left 10 feet
                    square at the base, and the <hi rend="italic">stalls</hi> between them are 16
                    feet wide. The workings are slightly arched, and are not carried up to the roof,
                    for the purpose of better maintaining the security of the chambers, because
                    heavy damages would have to be paid if they “caved in” and rendered the surface
                    useless. A similar layer left for the floor prevents <hi rend="italic"
                    >creep</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Coal,</hi> vol. vi. p. 64), and enables
                    the underground roads to be kept in good repair.</p>
                <p>Underground slate quarries afford examples of very various methods of removing
                    thick beds of mineral of comparatively little intrinsic value. At Angers in
                    France, where the beds dip at a high angle, the underground workings are carried
                    on like an open quarry under a trong roof of slate; the floor is continually
                    being worked away in steps, and an immense open chamber is left. In the</p>
                <p>Festiniog district in North Wales the principal bed, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >vein</hi> as it is called, is more than 100 feet thick in places, and the
                    method of working consists in making alternate pillars and chambers each 30 feet
                    to 50 feet wide along the strike (cross-section and plan, figs. 77 and 78). The
                    pillars follow lines of natural cross-rending PP ’, which commonly make an angle
                    of 25° to 35° with the direction of the dip. The excavations are arranged in
                    regular lines, and form continuous chambers extending very often from the
                    surface to the very lowest workings. A, B,C,D are the original working levels.
                    The slate of the supporting pillars is entirely lost, as these cannot be removed
                    with safety. This method of working requires a strong roof. In the Ardennes, on
                    the contrary, the pillars are carried along indefinitely along the strike (fig.
                    79, cross-section). The slate in each longitudinal chamber is removed in slices
                    parallel to the bedding, and the men stand upon the rubbish, which finally fills
                    up the chambers completely.</p>
                <p>Rock-salt constitutes another important mineral which occurs in the form of
                    stratified deposits. The principal source of the Cheshire salt is a bed 84 feet
                    thick lying horizontally; but only the bottom part, 15 feet to 18 feet thick, is
                    mined. Pillars 10 yards square are left promiscuously about 25 yards apart, as
                    shown in fig. 80, which represents part of Marston Hall rock-salt mine.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> Joseph Dickinson, “Report on
                    the Salt Districts,” <hi rend="italic"> Reports of the Inspector» of Mines for
                    the year</hi> 1881, p. 6&lt;J.</p></note> The workings are advanced by making in
                    the upper part an excavation 5 feet 9 inches high, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >roofing (a,</hi> fig. 81); and then the lower two-thirds of the part worked are
                    removed by blasting slanting holes. Many of the old salt mines have collapsed
                    from weakness of the roof or insufficiency of the pillars, and have become
                    inundated; the brine is then extracted by pumping and evaporated for salt.</p>
                <p>In some countries, especially when the beds of salt are impure or much mixed with
                    clay or shale, the formation of brine is conducted regularly by making a network
                    of drivages within a rectangular, elliptical, or circular area in thick beds of
                    saliferous marl, and then introducing fresh water by pipes, so as to form
                    underground ponds which gradually dissolve the roof and sides. The brine is
                    drawn off and either pumped up or conveyed by adits to the surface.</p>
                <p>A few words remain to be said about open workings. Some minerals are always
                    obtained in this way; others are worked open before regular underground mining
                    begins; and, thirdly, it often happens that underground and surface work are
                    both carried on simultaneously on the same deposit. Among deposits worked
                    opencast are peat, numerous kinds of stone, iron ore, cupreous pyrites, lead
                    ore, gold-and tin-bearing alluvia, and diamantiferous rock.</p>
                <p>Owing to its soft, spongy, and fibrous texture, and the fact of its often lying
                    below the water-level, peat has to be worked in a special manner. Trenches are
                    dug about a foot deep with a sharp spade, which cuts out sods of convenient size
                    for drying and burning. When one layer has been removed in this way, another is
                    taken off, and so on. If water is reached the working can still be pursued by
                    using the long spade <hi rend="italic">(grand louclιet,</hi> France) with a
                    handle of 16 or 20 feet. It cuts out a sod 3 or 4 feet long at each thrust.</p>
                <p>When a deposit is more or less solid the workings are frequently arranged in
                    steps, the height and breadth of each depending upon the firmness of the
                    rock.</p>
                <p>In many cases the first work consists in removing worthless rock at the surface
                    <hi rend="italic">(overbτιrden),</hi> and where the underlying deposit is thick
                    or very valuable it will pay to remove a very great thickness of overburden, on
                    account of tne advantages of working a deposit open. These advantages are—entire
                    removal of the deposit without loss in pillars, no expense for timbering or for
                    packing with rubbish or for ventilating or lighting the workings, better
                    ventilation, easier supervision, longer working hours, less danger.</p>
                <p>As an example of a large open working may be mentioned the great Penrhyn slate
                    quarry near Bangor, employing about 3000 hands, and worked by a succession of
                    terraces on an average 60 feet high by 30 feet wide (fig. 82). Reference has
                    already been made to the thick lead-bearing sandstone of Mechernich, which is in
                    part worked as an open quarry. Mokta-el-Hadid, near Bona in Algeria, and the Rio
                    Tinto mines in Spain, afford instances of extensive combined open and
                    underground workings for iron ore and cupriferous pyrites respectively.</p>
                <p>Local laws regulating the size of the working areas, or claims, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n472/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0472-0455"/> owned by separate individuals or companies,
                    considerably affect the methods of working. This is especially the case with the
                    diamond deposits of South Africa. The diamantiferous rock at the celebrated
                    Kimberley mine (formerly called Colesberg Kopje) occurs in the shape of an
                    elliptical upright mass, the greatest length being about 330 yards and the
                    greatest breadth about 200 yards. The superficial area is about 9 acres; the
                    mass extends downwards within almost perpendicular walls of shale, and is worked
                    in places to a depth of about 400 feet. The claims are only 31 feet square, and
                    are more than four hundred in number, and these have in some instances been
                    subdivided into portions as small as the sixteenth of a claim; but, as at the
                    present time one company may own very many claims, the number of individual
                    holdings is less numerous than formerly when the limit was two claims. The
                    working is earned on vertically downwards, and, as the claims are not all worked
                    at the same rate, those that progress most rapidly are surrounded by
                    perpendicular walls of neighbouring claims. The shale, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >reef,</hi> enclosing the deposit is constantly falling into the huge open pit,
                    and has to be cut away to a slope, the expense of this work being charged to the
                    claim-holders generally by the mining board. The diamantiferous rock is
                    extracted by innumerable wire-rope inclines.</p>
                <p>We have already referred to the method of working gold-bearing alluvia by the
                    hydraulic process, which has rendered such services in the United States <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Gold,</hi> vol. x. p. 746). At the same time one must not be
                    blind to the evils of this method of working, which have at last necessitated
                    legislative interference. Some idea of the extent of the mischievous results of
                    hydraulic mining will be gathered from the statement that one working alone, the
                    Gold Run Ditch and Mining Company, for the last eight years has been discharging
                    4000 to 5000 cubic yards of sand, gravel, and boulders daily, for a period of
                    five months each year, into a tributary of the Sacramento. As a natural
                    consequence deposits are formed lower down the river, obstructing the navigable
                    channels, rendering overflows more frequent and destructive, and causing
                    valuable land to be destroyed by deposits of sand. The superior court of
                    Sacramento county, California, has recently decided that the hydraulic mining
                    companies must build dams to impound the coarse and heavy debris, or take other
                    efficacious means to prevent their being washed down the rivers.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Carriage or Transport of Minerals along the Underground
                    Roads.—</hi> After the mineral has been broken down in a deposit it is necessary
                    to pick out any barren rock and then convey to the surface all that is of
                    value.</p>
                <p>The simplest and oldest method of transport along underground roads is carriage
                    on the back, and this method may still be seen at the present day even in
                    countries where the art of mining is generally highly advanced. Thus, for
                    instance, in the little slate mines near Cochem on the Moselle men and lads
                    carry up all the blocks of slate upon their backs, walking upon steps cut in the
                    rock; they come up with their hands upon the ground bent almost double under the
                    weight of the block, which rests upon a thick pad. Again, the blocks of slate
                    are still carried on the back from the actual working place to the nearest
                    tram-road, in the slate mines of the Ardennes. In the Sicilian sulphur mines the
                    same method is common, and it is found also in parts of Spain and China, where
                    baskets are used, whilst bags are employed in Mexico and also in Japan. Even in
                    England the system still survives in the Forest of Dean, where boys carry iron
                    ore in wooden trays from the very irregular ore-producing cavities either to the
                    surface or to the nearest shaft.</p>
                <p>Sledges, or <hi rend="italic">sleds,</hi> enable greater loads to be transported;
                    but they are not available unless the conveyance is along roads sloping
                    downwards. They have been largely employed in coal mines, and are still resorted
                    to in some collieries for conveying the coal from the working place to the
                    nearest tram-road.</p>
                <p>We next come to wheeled carriages. The simplest is the wheelbarrow. The barrow
                    used in Cornwall at the present day is not unlike that figured more than three
                    centuries ago by Agricola. The navvy’s barrow is more advantageous, but it
                    requires a wider and higher level. The barrow runs upon the natural floor of the
                    level, upon boards, or upon thin strips of iron. Carts drawn by horses may be
                    used in large underground quarries. Excepting in special cases it is advisable
                    to replace barrows by waggons running upon rails. * The oldest form is the
                    German <hi rend="italic">Hund.</hi></p>
                <p>It consists of a rectangular wooden body, with four wheels, resting upon two
                    boards as rails, and it is kept on the track by a pin which runs between the
                    boards.</p>
                <p>Cast-iron tram-plates were introduced in the last century, and were finally
                    succeeded by iron rails, which are now in general use, though steel threatens to
                    displace iron in this as in other departments of mining. Various forms of rail
                    are employed. The simplest is a bar of iron set on its edge in transverse
                    sleepers, or flat iron nailed to longitudinal sleepers. Small T-headed and
                    bridge rails are not uncommon. In the Harz the rails sometimes lie on stone
                    sleepers; a hole is bored in the stone, plugged with wood, and the rail is
                    nailed on. The gauge varies from 14 inches to 3 feet or more; 20 inches to 22
                    inches is a common gauge in metal mines. Arrangements of course have to be made
                    for passing from one line to another by <hi rend="italic">points</hi>; but the
                    transference is frequently best effected by putting down flat plates of cast
                    iron, upon the smooth surface of which the waggons can be handled with ease and
                    turned in any direction; raised ledges guide the wheels into any particular
                    track.</p>
                <p>The form and size of the waggons running upon the rails necessarily vary
                    according to the size of the underground roads and the manner in which the
                    mineral is raised in the shaft. In some mines the practice exists of loading the
                    mineral in the level into an iron bucket <hi rend="italic">(kibble)</hi>
                    standing upon a <hi rend="italic">trolley,</hi> which is merely a small platform
                    upon wheels. This trolley is pushed <hi rend="italic">(trammed)</hi> to the
                    shaft; the full kibble is hooked on to the winding-rope and drawn up, whilst an
                    empty kibble is placed upon the trolley and trammed back along the level, where
                    it is again loaded from a shoot <hi rend="italic">(mill, pass)</hi> or by the
                    shovel. The usual plan, however, is to have a waggon, which is tipped on coming
                    to an enlargement of the shaft <hi rend="italic">(plat, lodge)</hi> where the
                    level joins it. These waggons may be made of wood or sheet-iron, and of late
                    years sheet-steel for the body and caststeel for the wheels have been coming
                    into favour.</p>
                <p>The most modern system in metal mines is to imitate collieries, and use waggons
                    which are drawn up in cages. Fig. 83 represents the plain but strong waggon of
                    the Van mines, consisting of a rectangular body of sheet-iron resting on an oak
                    frame, and provided with cast-steel wheels. The wheels are loose upon the axles,
                    which themselves run loose in the pedestals. The waggon is emptied by being run
                    on to a “tippler,” which enables it to be completely overturned with great ease.
                    A commoner plan is to construct the waggon with a hinged door at one end, and
                    the contents are discharged by opening this door and raising the body.</p>
                <p>The motive power for tramming waggons along the levels of metal mines is
                    generally supplied by men or boys, though, where large quantities have to be
                    extracted, and where the roads are favourable, recourse may be had to ponies and
                    horses and the various kinds of mechanical haulage described in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Coal,</hi> vol. vi. p. 69.</p>
                <p>Trains of cars are sometimes drawn along underground railways by locomotives;
                    they have the great disadvantage of polluting the air with the products of
                    combustion, and consequently they are not available unless the ventilation is
                    very good. A small locomotive of 2 horse-power nominal is used on an 18⅛-inch
                    track in the adit-level of the Great Laxey mine (Isle of Man), now approaching a
                    mile in length, and full-sized locomotives ply along the adit of the Rio Tinto
                    mines. Locomotives worked by compressed air improve the ventilation instead of
                    injuring it, and are not a source of danger in cases where fire-damp may be
                    present; but, except in special cases, they cannot be worked so cheaply as
                    engines fired with coal. Conveyance by electric railroads underground has hardly
                    gone beyond the experimental stage, but the results obtained at the Zaukeroda

                    profit in this department of mining.</p>
                <p>A few instances of transport by boats may still be met with. The boats used in
                    the underground canal at Klausthal are 31 feet <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n473/mode/1up"

                    inches deep. Each boat carries 5 or 6 tons.</p>
                <p>Where roads have a strong gradient, inclined planes are employed, either
                    self-acting if the mineral has to be lowered, or worked by stationary engines if
                    the mineral has to be raised (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Coal,</hi> vol. vi. p.
                    69).</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Winding, or Raising in the Shafts, with the Machinery and
                    Apparatus required.—</hi> In speaking of the transport by underground roads, we
                    mentioned that the mineral is occasionally brought to the surface on the backs
                    of men or boys. In other cases daylight is reached by adit-levels provided with
                    railroads; but in by far the greater number of mines it is necessary to hoist
                    the mineral, and often much rubbish, up vertical or inclined pits generally
                    known as shafts.</p>
                <p>In beginning to sink a shaft from the surface, or in sinking a winze, hand-power
                    applied by a windlass is sufficient. The broken rock at the bott&lt;5m of the
                    shaft is shovelled into a wooden or iron bucket <hi rend="italic">(kibble),</hi>
                    which is drawn up by a rope passing round the barrel of the windlass. When a
                    depth of 20 or 30 yards has been reached it is more advantageous to introduce
                    horse-power, and the usual machine by which this power is applied, called a <hi
                    rend="italic">gin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">horse-whim,</hi> is a common sight
                    in many metalliferous districts. It consists of a vertical axis carrying a
                    barrel or drum 8 to 12 feet in diameter, round which is coiled the rope, which
                    after passing over a pulley hangs down the shaft. The axis carries an iron pin
                    at each end, the lower one working in a stone and the upper one in a socket in
                    the span-beam or cross-bar of the supporting frame. Under the barrel is a long
                    driving beam to which a horse is harnessed, and, as will be readily understood,
                    the kibble is drawn up or lowered down as the horse walks round. It is most
                    economical to have two kibbles, for then they balance each other.</p>
                <p>Where steam and water-power are not available, a large number of horses or mules
                    are sometimes harnessed to whims, and ore raised from depths of 200 fathoms.
                    These, however, are exceptional cases; and, especially since the introduction of
                    portable engines, the use of steam-power even for comparatively small depths,
                    such as 100 yards, is daily increasing. In hilly districts water-power is
                    generally at. hand, and huge reservoirs are frequently constructed for storing
                    the rainfall, and so affording an adequate and constant supply. It may be
                    utilized by water-wheels, turbines, and water-pressure engines.</p>
                <p>There are three systems of winding by steam or waterpower which are in regular
                    use :—(1) by buckets <hi rend="italic">(kibbles),</hi> baskets, or bags swinging
                    loose in the shafts; (2) by boxes working between guides <hi rend="italic"
                    >(skips,</hi> Cornwall); (3) by cages carrying one or more waggons.</p>
                <p>The buckets are made of wood, sheet-iron, or sheet-steel. Their shape varies; it
                    may be round or elliptical, straight in the side or bulging in the middle. Fig.
                    84 represents a kibble made of sheet-iron. When the shaft is inclined, the side
                    upon which the kibble slides is carefully lined with boards <hi rend="italic"
                    >(bed-planks)</hi> resting upon cross sleepers. Planks of hard wood like beech
                    last longer and require fewer repairs than deal boards. In the Harz, poles fixed
                    lengthwise take the place of boards, which are customary in Great Britain. Even
                    where shafts are perpendicular a lining of planks is often put in round the
                    winding compartment, unless the space is considerable, and the kibble then
                    glides up smoothly, and there is less risk of accidents. A more modern system is
                    to use wire-rope guides for the kibble, which is thus kept from swinging about.
                    Another advantage of this plan is that a light cage can easily be substituted
                    for the kibble and used for the ascent and descent of the men. Mr Galloway has
                    patented a method of sinking shafts with wire-rope guides, the upper ends of
                    which are coiled upon drums at the surface. By adopting this expedient the
                    guides can be lengthened as the shaft is deepened.</p>
                <p>A word must be said about the actual loading and emptying of the kibble.
                    Sometimes, as already mentioned, the kibble is filled at the working place or
                    from a shoot <hi rend="italic">(pass,</hi> Cornwall) carried down into the
                    level, and then conveyed on a trolley to the shaft, where it is hooked on to the
                    rope and drawn up. More frequently the filler standing in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >plat</hi> loads the kibble with a shovel; and in order to save time two kibbles
                    are often provided, one being filled while the other is making the journey to
                    and from the surface. In this case it is necessary to have some kind of <hi
                    rend="italic">clevis,</hi> which will enable the kibble to be readily detached
                    from the winding-rope, and quickly and securely fastened on again. On its
                    arriving at the surface the <hi rend="italic">lander</hi> seizes an eye or ring
                    at the bottom of the kibble by a pair of tongs suspended by a chain, and the
                    rope is now lowered. The kibble is thus turned over and the contents fall into a
                    tram-waggon.</p>
                <p>The inconveniences of this method of winding are considerable, especially in
                    inclined shafts where the direction and amount of the inclination are not
                    constant. There is great wear and tear of the bed-plank and casing-boards; and,
                    unless constant attention is paid to repairs, places are worn out where the
                    kibble catches, causing the rope to break. The fall of a kibble and its contents
                    not only does much damage to the shaft, but also is a source of danger to the
                    men. The introduction of boxes <hi rend="italic">(skips)</hi> working between
                    guides or conductors was therefore a decided step in advance, for the system
                    allows the winding to be carried on with less friction and with greater rapidity
                    and safety. The guides are often'made of pieces of timber (like <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> fig. 53) bolted to the endpieces and dividings. It is only
                    in perpendicular shafts that guides made of wire-rope or iron rods can be
                    applied. The skip is a box of rectangular section made of sheet-iron or
                    sheet-steel, with a sloping bottom, and provided with a hinged door closed by a
                    bolt for discharging its contents. Fig. 85<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Moissenet, <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Mines,</hi> ser. 6, vol. ii., 1862, plate vii.</p></note> shows how the
                    skip runs upon the guides by means of four cast-iron or (better) cast-steel
                    wheels. In an inclined shaft the guides sometimes have iron rails laid on them
                    so as to diminish the wear. Some of the skips in Cornwall are made to hold as
                    much as a ton and a half of tin-bearing rock. The skip is filled with a shovel
                    by a man standing in the plat, but a better plan is to arrange shoots leading
                    from large hoppers, so that the ore can be made to run in without any
                    shovelling. The skip is sometimes tilted completely over instead of being
                    emptied by a hinged door; this arrangement is in use in some of the German
                    mines, where the skip is made of wood, and is guided on each side by two pins or
                    rollers running between two conductors. When the skip has reached the surface
                    two catches are made to support the lower rollers, whilst the upper ones pass
                    through openings in the front guides, ahd the skip, turning upon the lower ones,
                    is tipped over and so emptied.</p>
                <p>The most satisfactory system of winding is by cages; there is less handling of
                    the mineral, and the hoisting proceeds at far greater speed. This system, which
                    is almost universal· in collieries, is employed also for working deposits of
                    other minerals, and, though <pb break="no"

                    in England, the managers are beginning to recognize the advantages of the cage
                    and equip their mines with more modern appliances than have hitherto been
                    customary. The cages used in the mines on the Comstock lode are very light and
                    simple in construction, as will be seen from fig. 86. The cage in fact is a mere
                    timber platform, 5 feet by 4, resting on iron bars <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and
                    supported by iron rods on each side. It is provided with a sheet-iron bonnet to
                    protect the men if they are inside, and also with safety catches <hi
                    rend="italic">t, t,</hi> which come into play if the rope breaks. The hand
                    levers <hi rend="italic">k, k</hi> at the ends of the cage raise up blocks which

                <p>The most important details concerning the use of cages, ropes, and other hoisting
                    appliances such as pulleys, pulley-frames, detaching hooks, and winding engines,
                    have already been set forth in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Coal,</hi> vol.
                    vi. p. 74; and it is therefore needless to repeat these particulars, especially
                    as the art of winding mineral cheaply, speedily, and safely has been carried to
                    a far greater pitch of perfection in collieries than in the majority of metal
                    mines. It is often convenient to fix winding engines underground for the purpose
                    of sinking shafts and winzes, and drive them by compressed air brought down in
                    pipes from the surface.</p>
                <p>The Koepe system of winding, which appears to be viewed with favour on the
                    Continent, consists in having what is practically an endless rope with one large
                    sheave over the shaft, in the place of the two drums. There are two cages, and
                    the rope below them acts as a counterbalance, so that the load is uniform
                    throughout</p>
                <p>The most novel hoisting apparat us is that of Μ. Blanchet <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Coal,</hi> vol. vi. p. 76), which has now been regularly at work in the
                    Hottinguer shaft at Épinac in France for the last six years. Μ. Blanchet’s
                    method consists in fixing in the shaft a large pipe in which is arranged a
                    piston; from this is suspended a cage carrying waggons. By exhausting the air
                    above the piston the load is gradually forced up by the atmospheric pressure
                    below it. The Hottinguer shaft is 660 yards deep, and the pipe is 5 feet 3
                    inches in diameter, made up of a succession of cylinders of sheet-iron about ⅛
                    inch thick and 4 feet 4 inches high, joined by flanges and bolts. The 485 rings
                    composing the long pipe weigh altogether 418 statute tons. The cage has nine
                    decks, and arrangements are made for unloading three at a time; each waggon
                    holds half a ton, so that the total useful load is 4⅜ tons. The speed of
                    hoisting is 20 feet per second. If two hoisting pipes are connected the dead
                    weights may be made to balance each other, and the power required is simply that
                    which is necessary to overcome the weight of the useful load. All the men prefer
                    the pneumatic hoist to the ordinary cage for descending and ascending the mine,
                    and are regularly lowered and raised by it. The advantages claimed by Μ.
                    Blanchet for this system are—(1) the possibility of hoisting from depths at
                    which rope-winding would no longer be practicable; (2) getting rid of the costly
                    ropes and dangers connected with ropewinding; (3) better utilization of the
                    engine power; (4) improvement of the ventilation and diminution of the amount of
                    fire-damp.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Drainage.—</hi> The mineral having been raised to the
                    surface, the task of the miner might appear to be at an end j but this is not
                    the case, for it is further necessary that he should keep his mine free from
                    water and foul air. These two indispensable operations of draining and
                    ventilating frequently require special appliances which add considerably to the
                    general cost of mining.</p>
                <p>In all cases where it is possible, endeavours should be made to keep the water
                    out of a mine, so as to save the expense of pumping it; and the method of
                    putting in a watertight lining <hi rend="italic">(tubbing)</hi> in a shaft has
                    been already described <hi rend="smallcaps">(Coal,</hi> vol. vi. p. 62). When
                    large streams of water happen to be intersected by underground workings, and
                    threaten to overpower the available pumping machinery, or when it is advisable
                    to save the expense of draining abandoned workings, the entry of this water into
                    the mine may often be prevented by stoppings, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >dams,</hi> constructed of timber or brickwork.</p>
                <p>In spite of all precautions, the miner generally has to contend with water which
                    percolates into the workings. Four methods of getting rid of this water are
                    available, viz., adits, siphons, winding machinery, and pumps.</p>
                <p>An adit, day-level, or sough is a nearly horizontal tunnel with one end opening
                    at the surface, allowing the water to drain away naturally. In hilly countries
                    mines are often worked entirely by adits, and even when a mine is deepened below
                    the drainage level the utility of the adit is still threefold :—it lessens the
                    quantity of water which tends to percolate into the lower workings; it lessens
                    the depths to which the water has to be pumped; and, by furnishing a certain
                    amount of fall, it enables water to be applied as power. On account of these
                    important advantages some very long and costly adits have been driven for the
                    purpose of aiding the miners in certain metalliferous districts.</p>
                <p>Thus in the Harz the Ernest Augustus adit (“Ernst August Stolln ”) has been
                    driven a distance of nearly 6⅛ miles into the Klausthal district. The total
                    length of the adit, including the branches, is no less than 14 miles. It
                    intersects many of the lodes at a depth of upwards of 400 yards from the
                    surface. The total cost of this adit is estimated at £85,500.</p>
                <p>Another long adit is the celebrated “Rothschönberger Stolln,” which unwaters some
                    of the most important mines at Freiberg in Saxony. The length of the main or
                    trunk adit is more than 8⅛ miles; the gradient of the greater part of it is only
                    1 ’ 18 inch in 100 yards. The branches of this adit among the mines are more
                    than 16 miles in length, so that the total length of the main adit with its
                    branches amounts to nearly 25 miles. Many of the mines are now drained naturally
                    to a depth of 250 to 300 yards. The cost of the main tunnel was £359,334, or
                    nearly £24 per yard, but this includes the cost of eight shafts, heavy expenses
                    for pumping from these shafts, the walling of the adit for ∣ mile, and all
                    general expenses. The length of time occupied in driving this adit was
                    thirty-three years. The “Kaiser Josef II. Erbstolln” in Hungary is another
                    remarkable mining tunnel, which was commenced in 1782, and completed in 1878 at
                    a total cost of 4,599,000 florins. It is 10^ miles in length, extending from the
                    valley of the river Gran to the town of Schemnitz, where it intersects the lodes
                    at depths varying from 300 to 600 yards according to the contour of the
                    surface.</p>
                <p>In Cornwall the Great County adit was driven for the purpose of relieving the
                    Gwennap mines of their water, and it was pushed on nearly to Redruth. This adit
                    differs from the great works undertaken in Germany by the fact that it commences
                    in the mining district, and, though the length of all the drivages amounts to
                    more than 30 miles, the water from the most distant mine does not run more than
                    about 6 miles before reaching daylight. The average depth is only 70 or 80 yards
                    from the surface. In fact this great adit, though a work of great utility when
                    the Gwennap district was in a flourishing condition, is merely a network of
                    comparatively shallow drivages, often along the lodes themselves, among the
                    mines, and therefore for boldness of execution cannot for one moment be compared
                    to the great Schemnitz, Freiberg, and Klausthal drainage tunnels which have just
                    been mentioned. The Blackett Level in Northumberland is an adit which has been
                    driven a distance of about 4f miles, and it will have to be extended about 2
                    miles further before reaching Alienheads. Its depth from the surface at this
                    plaoe will be about 200 yards.</p>
                <p>The main part of the Halkyn tunnel in Flintshire is 2 miles 1256 yards in length,
                    and the branch driven out to Rhosesmor mine intersected the vein at a distance
                    of 809 yards, making a total of about 3⅜ miles. The greatest depth from the
                    surface is 230 yards, and the average depth in Halkyn Mountain about <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n475/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0475-0458"/> 215 yards. The length and depth of this adit are
                    not remarkable; but the great quantity of water discharged is a point of
                    considerable interest and importance. It is estimated that this adit is now
                    discharging 15 million gallons or 66,000 tons of water in twenty-four hours,
                    although the outflow is purely natural, for no mines are pumping water into. it.
                    It is now easy to understand that the Rhosesmor mine, though provided with
                    powerful pumping machinery, was unable to cope with the springs it
                    encountered.</p>
                <p>In the United States the famous Sutro tunnel is an adit of which the main branch,
                    4 miles in length, reaches the great Comstock lode in Nevada at a depth of 1700
                    feet. The total cost of this tunnel, which λvas completed in nine years, is
                    estimated to have been $7,000,000. The quantity of water running out daily in
                    1879 was 12,000 tons, at a temperature of 123° Fahr, at the mouth of the tunnel.
                    All this water must otherwise have been pumped to the surface at a cost
                    estimated at $3000 a day. The obstacles to progress were very great: not only
                    was the heat extreme, but swelling ground was encountered which snapped the
                    strongest timber. Thanks, however, to the untiring energy of Mr Adolph Sutro,
                    the difficulties were at last successfully overcome, and this great work will
                    long remain as a monument to his foresight, skill, and patient pertinacity.</p>
                <p>The Atlantic-Pacific tunnel,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Mining and Scientific Press,</hi> San Francisco, 1882,
                    vol. xlv. p. 241.</p></note> which was commenced in 1880, will pierce the heart
                    of the Rocky Mountains under Grey’s Peak, Colorado. It is being driven from both
                    sides of the watershed, and will have a total length of 4f miles from end to
                    end.</p>
                <p>Siphons have been used for unwatering workings in special cases; but of course
                    they will not act unless the barrier over which the water is raised is very
                    decidedly less than 33 feet.</p>
                <p>When workings cannot be drained by tunnels or siphons it is necessary to raise
                    the water mechanically, either to the surface or at all events to an adit
                    through which it can flow away naturally. If the amount of water is not too
                    considerable, it is often convenient to use the winding machinery and draw up
                    the water in special buckets <hi rend="italic">(waterbarrels) or</hi> tanks. The
                    bucket may be tilted over on reaching the surface, or it may be emptied by a
                    valve at the bottom. This means of raising water is often adopted while sinking
                    shafts, when it may be desirable to wait till the whole or a portion of the
                    shaft is completed before putting in the final pumping machinery.</p>
                <p>The varieties of pumps used in mines are numerous. In small sinkings hand-pumps,
                    either direct-acting or rotary, may be applied; steam-jet pumps on the principle
                    of the Giflard injectors are also used; and pulsometers, though requiring a
                    large expenditure of steam, have the advantages of being quickly fixed, of
                    occupying little space, and of working with sandy or muddy water. They are
                    capable, therefore, of rendering great services in special cases. When we come
                    to the definitive machinery erected in large mines of considerable depth, we
                    find that the prevailing types of pumps are few. They may be classified as
                    follows :—(A) lifting and force pumps worked by rods in the shaft actuated by
                    wind, water, or steam power; (B) force-pumps at the bottom of the shaft worked
                    by steam, compressed air, or hydraulic pressure.</p>
                <p>A. In describing the first method we have to consider the motive power, the rods,
                    and the actual pumps themselves.</p>
                <p>Windmills have the disadvantage, which is often fatal, that the power is not
                    constant. By erecting an auxiliary steam-engine, which can be set to work if
                    wind fails, this evil is overcome; and at the Mona mines in Anglesea a windmill
                    pumps up water from a depth of 80 fathoms at the rate of upwards of 90 gallons
                    per minute. As the site of the mine is breezy, there is wind enough to work the

                <p>Water-power was for a long period the principal agent employed in draining mines,
                    and it is still of the greatest utility in many districts, reservoirs being
                    constructed to collect and store the rainfall. Some idea of the scale upon which
                    these works are conducted will be gathered from the following figures relating
                    to the Harz mines. In 1868 there were “sixty-seven reservoirs covering an area
                    of 604 acres, and having a storage capacity of 336,000,000 cubic feet.”<note

                    The total length of the various leats, races, and other water-courses, including
                    the six principal adits, is about 170 statute miles. The net power extracted is
                    reckoned at 1870 horse-power, but less than one-fourth of this is used for
                    pumping.</p>
                <p>Water-power is applied to pumping machinery by water-wheels, turbines, and rotary
                    or non-rotary water-pressure engines. Excepting the case of the latter, the
                    rotary motion has to be converted into a reciprocating motion by a crank; and
                    furthermore with turbines the speed must be reduced very considerably by
                    intermediate gearing.</p>
                <p>Overshot wheels are the commonest prime movers when pumps are worked by
                    water-power; water-wheels are frequently constructed 40 or 50 feet in diameter,
                    and at the Great Laxey mine, in the Isle of Man, one of the wheels is no less
                    than 72 feet 6 inches in diameter and 6 feet in the breast. The power is
                    conveyed from the waterwheel by a connecting rod to a bell-crank <hi
                    rend="italic">(bob)</hi> placed over the shaft; and when, owing to the contour
                    of the ground, the wheel has to be placed at a distance, it is connected to the
                    bob by the so-called <hi rend="italic">flat rods,</hi> made of wood, bars of
                    iron, or wire-rope, travelling backwards and forwards, and supported by pulleys
                    or oscillating upright beams.</p>
                <p>Water-pressure engines have the advantage of being able at once to utilize any
                    amount of fall, and those which are direct-acting can be applied immediately to
                    the main rod of the pumps.</p>
                <p>Steam, however, is the power used <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> in
                    draining mines; indeed the first applications of steam-power were made for this
                    purpose, and Watt’s great inventions owed their birth to the necessities of
                    mines which could no longer be drained by the waterpower at their command.</p>
                <p>The principal type of engine is that known as the Cornish engine, which is a
                    single-acting condensing beam engine working expansively. Its mode of action may
                    be briefly described as follows. The steam is let in at the top of the cylinder
                    and presses down the piston, which is connected with one end of a large beam,
                    whilst the main rod of the pumps is attached to the other. When the piston has
                    completed its course the equilibrium valve is opened by a cataract, and, the
                    pressure on both sides of the piston being now equal, the weight of the pump
                    rods, or rather the excess of their weight over that of the counterbalances,
                    causes them to drop and force up the water from the mine by means of the
                    plungers, which will be described immediately. Double-acting rotary engines
                    working the pumps by cranks may also be met with.</p>
                <p>The rod in the shaft, known as the <hi rend="italic">main rod</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">spear rod,</hi> is usually made of strong balks of timber butted
                    together and connected by <hi rend="italic">strapping plates</hi> fastened by
                    bolts. It serves to work either lifting-pumps or force-pumps, or both.</p>

                    pump standing on the H-piece. This has a valve which communicates with the <hi
                    rend="italic">windbore</hi> resting in the cistern. Above the H-piece comes the
                    <hi rend="italic">door-piece</hi> with another valve, and then a series of
                    pipes, generally of cast iron, but occasionally of wrought iron, constituting
                    the column. The upward motion of the plunger, which is attached to the main rod,
                    causes an inflow of water, which is forced into the column when the plunger
                    descends. It is usual to fix a drawing lift at the bottom of the shaft, which
                    raises the water into a first cistern, and thence a plunger forces it into a
                    second cistern some 60 yards higher up; and it is continually forced up from
                    cistern to cistern until it reaches the adit or the surface.</p>
                <p>There are numerous important matters which require special attention, such as the
                    valves, catches, balance-bobs, guiding arrangements for the rod in inclined
                    shafts, the V-bobs, fend-off bobs, and running loops, which have to be used when
                    there are bends in the shaft; but space will not permit of more than mere
                    mention of these details.</p>
                <p>Such then is the standard arrangement worked by steam or water power for pumping
                    from mines. The great advantage of the system consists in the employment of the
                    plunger, because it is simply necessary for the machine to raise a weight
                    slightly greater than that of the water, which is forced up afterwards by the
                    downstroke of the rods. Leaks are readily discovered, and the stuffingbox can be
                    easily screwed up as the packing wears; this is one great reason of the
                    superiority of the plunger compared with a piston working in a barrel.</p>
                <p>The modifications of this system relate more to the engines employed than to the
                    actual pumps themselves.</p>
                <p>The cylinder of the Cornish engine is sometimes reversed and stands over the
                    shaft, the main rod being attached directly to the piston. This type of engine,
                    known as the Bull engine in Cornwall, dispenses with the ponderous beam, but it
                    has the great disadvantage of obstructing the mouth of the shaft. The use of two
                    cylinders combined, as invented by Woolf, causes less strain upon the main rod
                    and pumps <hi rend="italic">(pit-work)</hi> and machinery generally, as the
                    initial velocity of the piston is smaller and the engine starts with less jerk.
                    The cylinders are placed side by side or one above the other.</p>
                <p>Kley, of Bonn, has constructed engines on the Woolf system with steam acting on
                    both sides of the pistons. He makes the excess of the weight of the rod over
                    that of the counterbalances sufficient to raise only half the weight of the
                    water and to overcome the friction; and then in the descending stroke the steam
                    acts on the top of the piston and so makes up for the insufficiency in force of
                    the rods. As the steam acts on both sides of the piston the same amount is
                    consumed, it is true, but a smaller cylinder will do the work, and the original
                    cost of the engine is lessened. The same engineer of late years has put up
                    several pumping engines in Belgium, Germany, and France of 30 to 560
                    horse-power, with a fly-wheel which serves simply to regulate the stroke of the
                    piston, so that the crank always stops before or after the dead point till the
                    cataract starts another stroke. The engines are double-acting, -with two
                    cylinders and beam. The advantage of working with the fly-wheel is that the main
                    rod and pumps are set in motion without the injurious jerk unavoidable with a
                    Cornish engine worked at a high rate of expansion.</p>
                <p>Μ. Guinotte, tne well-known Belgian engineer, also adopts a fly-wheel, and the
                    engines he has erected at Mariemont and elsewhere are single-acting rotary
                    engines with one cylinder. The peculiarity of the fly-wheel is that he can
                    weight it in any way he pleases; and he so overcomes the difficulty, which
                    occurs in other rotary machines, of its being impossible to work them below a
                    certain speed. His object has been to make the speed slow at the beginning and
                    end of a stroke, so as to avoid the injurious shocks to the valves and machinery
                    generally from sudden starts and stoppages. In order to make the main rod act by
                    traction only and not compression, which may be advisable with iron rods, the
                    plungers are sometimes reversed; whilst Kraft of Seraing has introduced the
                    Rittinger pump, which consists of a hollow moving plunger with a valve inside,
                    and a plunger case above it working over a hollow fixed plunger. By this
                    arrangement both the up and the down stroke of the engine cause water to be
                    forced up; and this pump is used with a double-acting rotary engine.</p>
                <p>B. We must now speak of the second class of pumps, viz., force- ≡ worked by
                    steam, water-power, or compressed air at the ι of the shaft.</p>
                <p>The steam pumps are of very various descriptions,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stephen Michell, <hi rend="italic">Mine
                    Drainage,</hi> London, 1881.</p></note> but they mostly consist of one or two
                    plungers, or rams, set in motion by a rotary or a non-rotary engine, which may
                    or may not work with expansion and condensation. The plunger or ram is generally
                    fixed directly on to the piston, and works in the same line, consequently the
                    power is transmitted to the plunger with the least possible loss. The water is
                    forced up the shaft in one long column. Engines and pumps of this kind are
                    easily kept in order; all the parts are readily accessible. The miner is able to
                    dispense with the heavy beam, the massive engine-house, the long main rod and
                    its connexions and bobs, the various cisterns and plungers, and instead he has a
                    compact and easily supervised machine and a simple line of pipes taking up but
                    little space in the shaft; the pump can therefore be erected and set to work
                    very quickly, and this is a matter of the utmost importance in emergencies. It
                    is true that these direct-acting steam-pumps, even when worked by a compound
                    engine, cause a greater consumption of coal than the Cornish engine; but, as a
                    set off, there is the economy in first cost, erection, and repairs which has led
                    to their adoption more especially in collieries. The steam is generated by
                    boilers underground, or is conveyed from the surface in well-jacketed pipes.</p>
                <p>If natural water-power is available water-pressure engines working the plunger
                    directly are often employed, and indeed such water-power may be created
                    artificially for use in workings where steam-power is objectionable on account
                    of the heat. There are other reasons too for employing water for transmitting
                    power; where the length of the rods is very great, and they have to be worked
                    quickly, there is a great liability to breakages; inorder to overcome these
                    difficulties at the mines on the Comstock lode, Mr Joseph Moore<note

                    steam-engine at the surface to work an hydraulic accumulator, and then by pipes
                    conveys the water under pressure to hydraulic engines working plungers. These
                    are fixed at 2400 feet from the surface, and force the water in one column, 813
                    feet high, to the level of the Sutro tunnel. The exhaust water is returned to
                    the surface in pipes and used over again. The pumps are now raising 1600 to 1700
                    gallons per minute.</p>
                <p>Where compressed air is being supplied to a mine for drilling and winding
                    purposes, it is often convenient to employ it, by means of direct-acting pumps,
                    such as are generally used with steam, for the drainage of small temporary
                    sinkings; and occasionally large pumps raising considerable quantities of water
                    are worked in this way.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Ventilation and Lighting.—</hi> The composition of the air
                    of the atmosphere is about one-fifth by volume of oxygen and four-fifths of
                    nitrogen, with a little carbonic acid gas; more exactly, the standard amount of
                    oxygen may be taken at 20 ’ 9 per cent., and that of the carbonic acid gas at
                    0Ό3 per cent. The atmosphere of mines is subject to various deteriorating
                    influences: not only do noxious gases escape from the rocks into the underground
                    excavations, but also the very agents employed in the execution of the work

                <p>When explosives are decomposed in this way they liberate nitric oxide and
                    carbonic oxide, and the analyses of MM. Sarrau and Vieille confirm the practical
                    experience of miners, who complain greatly of noxious fumes when, owing perhaps
                    to a bad detonator, a charge of dynamite or tonite fails to explode
                    properly.</p>
                <p>The air of mines is finally deteriorated by organic matter contained in the
                    exhalations of the men and animals employed and in the products of decaying
                    timber, by dust, and by the solid particles constituting the smoke of
                    explosives. It must be recollected also that the injury to the air is not
                    confined to the addition of the gases and substances just mentioned; but the
                    proportion of oxygen is diminished by the combustion of candles, by respiration,

                <p>He considers air with 20 ’ 9 per cent, oxygen as normal, and air with proportions
                    between that and 20’6 as impure; and where the percentage of oxygen descends
                    below 20’6 he calls the air exceedingly bad. According to these standards, only
                    10’67 per cent, of the samples showed the air to be normal or nearly so; 24 ’69
                    per cent, were decidedly impure; whilst 64 ’63 per cent, or nearly two-thirds of
                    the samples were exceedingly bad. The amount of oxygen in one specimen was as
                    low as 18’52 per cent., whilst the carbonic acid often exceeded 1 per cent, and
                    in several instances 2 per cent. It is evident that twenty years ago the
                    ventilation of British metal mines was anything but satisfactory, and even now
                    there is room for improvement.</p>
                <p>Having explained the reasons why the air of mines must be constantly renewed, we
                    must now point out how this desirable end is effected.</p>
                <p>Two systems are employed,—natural ventilation and artificial ventilation; but, as
                    both systems have been described <hi rend="smallcaps">(Coal,</hi> vol. vi. p.
                    70), little remains to be said here, especially as the ventilating machines in
                    metalliferous mines generally cannot for one moment be compared with the
                    powerful appliances employed in collieries. In veinmining there are generally
                    many more shafts than in collieries, and natural currents are set up which are
                    often considered sufficient for ventilating the mines; nevertheless, the
                    advanced workings, such as the ends, rises, and winzes,—in fact all workings in
                    the form of a <hi rend="italic">cul-de-sac,—</hi> are likely to require special
                    means of ventilation as soon as they proceed a little distance from the main
                    air-current.</p>
                <p>The means of ventilating a drift or heading are various. If a natural or
                    artificial draught exists at the mouth of the drift, it may be diverted by an
                    upright partition <hi rend="italic">(brattice),</hi> or an air-way may be
                    constructed along the roof or floor by a horizontal partition of planks <hi
                    rend="italic">(air-sollar)</hi> (fig. 89). In this way a sufficient supply is
                    secured at the end or fore-breast.</p>
                <p>The water-blast is another simple appliance; it is precisely the same as the
                    well-known tromp, and it blows a current of air through square pipes made of
                    boards, or better through cylindrical pipes of sheet zinc.</p>
                <p>The fall of water may be applied by Williams’s water-jet, shown in fig. 90. The
                    jet of water acts like an injector, and creates a powerful current.</p>
                <p>Small fans driven by boys, or better by small waterwheels or other machinery, are
                    frequently applied, and the <pb break="no"

                    an air-pump of very simple construction which is worked by the main rod of the
                    pumps, and can be arranged so as to exhaust the foul air or force in fresh
                    air.</p>
                <p>In working in blasting ground, boring-machines driven by compressed air are
                    becoming more and more largely used every day, and the exhaust air escaping from
                    the machines is invaluable for ventilation. At the same time, on account of
                    volley firing, the quantities of deleterious gases generated in a short space of
                    time are very considerable; and, in order to get rid of them speedily, the
                    compressed air may be utilized for working a Körting aspirator or the somewhat
                    similar ventilator of Mr Teague, a jet of compressed air turned into a
                    ventilating pipe, which creates an exhaust (fig. 92<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Ceol. Soc.
                    Cornwall,</hi> vol. x. p. 142.</p></note>). Naturally this ventilator is merely
                    brought into play at the time of blasting, and while the boring machinery is out
                    of use. When compressed air is being supplied on a large scale to a mine for
                    boring and winding machinery, it is often convenient to convey it by a small
                    gas-pipe to working places in which the ventilation is inadequate. Of course, in
                    one sense, it is very uneconomical to compress air to a pressure of 60 or 70 lb
                    to the square inch for ventilating purposes only; but, where compressing
                    machinery is always at work on the mine, it may be better to be a little
                    wasteful of cheap power at the surface than to go to the greater expense of
                    having a man or boy to work a fan underground.</p>
                <p>Mines are lighted by lamps, torches, candles, and electricity. The subject of
                    safety lamps for fiery mines has already been discussed (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Coal,</hi> vol. vi. p. 72), and consequently the question of
                    illuminating mines may be treated in a very summary manner.</p>
                <p>Lamps vary very much in shape and size. The Sicilian miner has a mere shallow cup
                    of unglazed pottery; the Saxon a small tin or brass lamp in a wooden box lined
                    with tinplate and open in front. In the Harz the miner prefers a heavy flat iron
                    lamp with a hook by which it is stuck into the timber or any crack in the rocks;
                    in France, northern Italy, and parts of Spain, the iron lamp is lenticular in
                    shape and also suspended by a hook. In Scotland, and parts of Germany and the
                    United States, a small tin lamp of the shape shown in fig. 93 is very common;
                    the hook enables it to be carried on the hat while climbing ladders, and to be
                    fixed up underground. Olive oil and rape oil are burnt in these lamps; petroleum
                    lamps are employed occasionally.</p>
                <p>The miners of England and Wales still cling to the tallow candle; and when
                    surrounded by a lump of clay it can easily and quickly be fixed in the working
                    place or carried upon the hat when climbing. Gas brought down from the surface
                    answers for illuminating large excavations, such as on-sétting places and
                    engine-rooms.</p>
                <p>Up to the present time the electric light has been but little used underground on
                    account of its want of portability, and the smallness of the spaces requiring
                    illumination. Very often a few men only are employed in each working place, and
                    consequently the expense incurred in fixing and shifting the lamps and
                    maintaining them alight would be out of proportion to the value of the work
                    executed. However, an incandescent electric lamp has been invented weighing only
                    10 lb, which gives the light of three candles for six hours, and it may be
                    reasonably expected that improvements will be made which will render the
                    electric light more available for underground purposes than it is at present.
                    When the area requiring illumination is large, an arcrlamp may be used with
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>Among the first successful applications of electric lighting to underground
                    excavations may be mentioned that of Μ. Blavier at the Angers slate
                    quarries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ. Blavier,
                    “I.’Éclairage électrique aux Ardoisières d’Angers, <hi rend="italic">Annales des

                    fixed two Seιτin lamps in one of the large underground chambers with an area of
                    2400 square yards, and he found that they gave light enough for all the men at
                    work. The total cost, reckoning everything, viz., coal, carbons, repairs,
                    labour, depreciation of plant, and interest on capital, is 50 francs per day;
                    the gas formerly in use cost 54 francs a day and gave much less light. It is
                    evident, however, that the arc lights can only be applied with advantage in
                    special cases where a large number of men are concentrated in one working area
                    which can be illuminated from one or two points.</p>
                <p>The large chambers in the salt mine of Maros-Ujvar in Hungary have been regularly
                    lighted up by electricity since 1880. The cost is somewhat greater than that of
                    the tallow, oil, or petroleum formerly in use; but, on the other hand, the
                    illumination is better, the men can do more work and are more easily supervised,
                    whilst the air of the mine is not deteriorated by the products of combustion of
                    the lamps.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    have to climb down and up by ladders, or are raised and lowered by machinery.
                    The means of access to and from workings may be classified as follows :—(1)
                    steps and slides; (2) ladders; (3) cages; (4) man-engines.</p>
                <p>If a lode or seam is inclined at an angle or 40° or 50° from the horizon, steps
                    may be cut in the floors of the deposit if it is firm enough, or wooden stairs
                    may be put in with a hand-rail. Even with higher dips steps may be arranged by
                    directing them in a line intermediate between the dip and the strike. In
                    speaking of conveyance underground, reference has already been made to the
                    practice of carrying sulphur ore in Sicily and slate in Germany up to the
                    surface by steps; and steps may be found in other foreign mines and occasionally
                    in Great Britain. They are much less fatiguing than ladders placed so flat that
                    part of the weight of the body rests upon the arms. In some of the Austrian salt
                    mines the men descend by wooden slides inclined at angles varying from 30° to
                    50°, flattening at the bottom to destroy the velocity gradually; the ascent is
                    effected by steps.</p>
                <p>Ladders are very largely used in metal mines all over the world, but they vary a
                    good deal in different countries. The ladder consists of two sides and a series
                    of rungs <hi rend="italic">(staves,</hi> Cornwall). The sides are usually made
                    of wood, and the rungs of wood or iron. The distance between the rungs is
                    important; 10 inches from centre to centre is sufficient, for climbing upon
                    ladders with the rungs 12 inches apart is decidedly more fatiguing. On the
                    Continent wooden rungs are commoner than iron ones, and oak is preferred.
                    Sometimes the wooden staves, instead of being round, are flat, so as to stand
                    more wear, and iron sides may be seen in places where dry rot is very bad.
                    Platforms should be fixed at short intervals, not exceeding 3 or 4 fathoms in
                    perpendicular shafts, so as to prevent falls from having fatal consequences.</p>
                <p>In many cases sufficient attention is not paid to the angle of inclination of the
                    ladders. A ladder is climbed with the least fatigue when the person uses his
                    arms simply to steady himself, and is not compelled to pull himself up by them,
                    as on a vertical ladder, or to support much of the weight of his body by them,
                    as happens with a very flat one. The best angle is about 20° from the vertical,
                    and in Belgium the authorities have very wisely decreed that no ladder shall be
                    inclined at an angle of less that 10° from the vertical. Furthermore, of the two
                    arrangements shown in fig. 94 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n479/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0479-0462"/> A is better than B, because it not only affords a
                    greater inclination for the ladders, but also renders it less likely that a man
                    will drop through the opening <hi rend="italic">(manhole)</hi> in the platform
                    <hi rend="italic">(sollar)</hi> if he loses his hold and falls. These may seem
                    trifling matters; but, leaving aside the question of safety, the economy derived
                    from fixing the ladders at the best inclination is by no means small. To make
                    this apparent we must recollect the depths to and from which men have to climb,
                    viz., 300, 400, and even 500 yards. It is important, therefore, to save every
                    unnecessary expenditure of energy, which, though trifling for one ladder,
                    becomes considerable when repeated a great number of times. When a mine has
                    reached a depth of 200 yards, and <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> when it
                    exceeds it, mechanical appliances should be introduced for raising and lowering
                    the men, because time and strength are wasted by climbing. Medical men also are
                    agreed that excessive ladder-climbing is injurious to the health of the miner.
                    Therefore, both upon hygienic and financial grounds, one of the first thoughts
                    in working a mine should be the conveyance of the men up and down the shafts by
                    machinery with the least possible fatigue.</p>
                <p>In collieries and other mines worked by perpendicular shafts, it has long been
                    customary to raise and lower the men by the ordinary winding machinery already
                    described. In the United Kingdom it is necessary that guides should be used if
                    the shaft exceeds 50 yards in depth; safetycatches and disengaging hooks <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Coal,</hi> vol. vi. p. 75) are frequently applied for the
                    purpose of preventing accidents. The simplicity of this method of ingress and
                    egress naturally renders it popular, and statistics prove that, where proper
                    precautions are used, it is exceedingly safe.</p>
                <p>The first man-engine was put up in the Harz in 1833, and nine years later a
                    similar machine was fixed in Tresavean mine in Cornwall. Since that time this
                    very useful means of conveying workmen up and down shafts has been resorted to
                    in other mining districts, and especially in Belgium and Westphalia.</p>
                <p>Two kinds of man-engine are in use, the double-rod machine and the single-rod
                    machine. The double-rod or original man-engine consists of two reciprocating
                    rods like the main rods of pumps, carrying small platforms upon which the men
                    stand. The stroke is from 4 to 16 feet, and the little platforms are so arranged
                    that they are always opposite each other at the beginning and end of each
                    stroke.</p>
                <p>Figs. 95 and 96 represent the rods in the two final positions. A man who wishes
                    to descend steps upon platform δ (fig. 95); the rod B goes down, and A goes up,
                    so that <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (fig. 96) is brought opposite <hi rend="italic"
                    >c.</hi> The man steps across from <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to c, and then the
                    rod A makes a down-stroke, B an up-stroke. Platform <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is
                    now opposite <hi rend="italic">d</hi> (fig. 95), and the man again steps across;
                    and thus, by constantly stepping from the rod as it completes its down-stroke,
                    the man is gradually conveyed to the bottom of the shaft. By reversing the
                    process, or, in other words, by stepping off on to the opposite platform as soon
                    as the rod has completed its upstroke, the man is raised to the surface, without
                    any fatigue beyond that of the very slight effort of stepping sideways. If each
                    rod makes four up and down strokes of 10 feet each per minute, the rate of
                    ascent or descent will be 80 feet per minute.</p>
                <p>The single-rod man-engine has one rod carrying steps, whilst fixed platforms are
                    arranged in the shaft so as to correspond exactly with them (fig. 97). If a man
                    wants to go down, he steps on to A when the up·stroke is completed; the rod goes
                    down and A is brought,down opposite to the fixed platform <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> on to which he steps off. He then waits on <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    until the rod has finished its up-stroke. B is brought opposite <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>; he steps on to B, the rod goes down and he is brought
                    opposite <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> where he steps off again and waits. By
                    reversing the operation he is gradually lifted to the top of the shaft. The
                    singlerod engine may be used, by men going up while others are going down,
                    provided that there is sufficient room upon the fixed platforms <hi
                    rend="italic">(sollars).</hi> The best plan is to have sollars right and left,
                    as shown in the figure, and then the ascending men step off to the left, for
                    instance, while the descending men take the right-hand sollars. The ascending
                    man steps on to the man-engine as soon as the descending man steps off, and so
                    the rod may be always carrying men up or down. The usual stroke in Cornwall is
                    12 feet, and there are from three to five or six strokes a minute. With five
                    strokes the men descend 10 fathoms a minute, or in other words a descent or
                    ascent of 300 fathoms occupies half an hour. The reciprocating motion is best
                    obtained from a crank, because in this case the speed is diminished gradually at
                    the dead points, and the danger of an accident in stepping off and on is thereby
                    diminished; man-engines, however, are sometimes driven by direct-acting
                    engines.</p>
                <p>Man-engine rods are constructed of wood or iron; and at Andreasberg in the Harz
                    each rod is replaced by two wire ropes. Like a pump rod the man-engine rod
                    requires proper balance bobs and catches, and for the safety of the men a handle
                    is provided at a convenient height above each step.</p>
                <p>The man-engine has one great advantage over the cage, which consists in the fact
                    that it can be safely applied in inclined and even crooked shafts; and it is for
                    this reason that man-engines have been adopted in many metal mines unprovided
                    with vertical shafts.</p>
                <p>Careful comparisons as regards safety of travelling have been made in Prussia
                    between ladders, man-engines, and cages. The average accidental death-rate is
                    shown by the accompanying table, which gives averages for a period of ten years,
                    1871 to 1880:—</p>

                    </row>
                </table>
                <p>The table shows that the cage is nearly as safe as ladders. In reality, if the
                    actual distance travelled were taken into account, the cage would appear to be
                    safer, because we may fairly assume that the mines in which men are hoisted by
                    cages are on the whole very much deeper than those in which men ascend and
                    descend by ladders. The man-engine appears to be decidedly more dangerous than
                    either the cage or ladders. Here again a distinction requires to be made between
                    the single-rod and the double-rod machines, and the Prussian statistics include
                    many of the latter. It will be readily understood that a fall in a naked shaft
                    with few fixed platforms is much more likely to be fatal than a fall in the
                    shaft of a single-rod man-engine which is closed with the exception of the
                    manhole at intervals of 12 feet. The Belgian <hi rend="italic">warocquères</hi>
                    are rendered safer than the Harz or Saxon man-engines by having a railing round
                    the back of each platform on the rod. Some of the double-rod machines are made
                    with large platforms so that two persons can stand on them, one going up and the
                    other going down, or both travelling in the same direction. The use of
                    double-rod man-engines has been entirely abandoned in the United Kingdom. The
                    death-rate from accidents on man-engines in Cornwall and Devon during the nine
                    years 1873 to 1881 was 0Ί7 per 1000 persons using them, whilst the annual
                    death-rate per 1000 persons using ladders was slightly higher, viz., 0’19. If
                    the actual distance travelled were taken into account, the scale would turn more
                    decidedly in favour of the man-engine.</p>
                <p>The cost of raising and lowering men by the man-engine is not great. At Dolcoath,
                    a tin mine in Cornwall approaching 400 fathoms in depth (see figs. 62, 63), it
                    is reckoned thatl⅜d. per man per day covers all expenses, including interest
                    upon the capital expended and depreciation of plant.</p>
                <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Dressing or Mechanical Preparation of Ores.—</hi> In a
                    large number of cases the mineral, as it is raised from the mine, is not ready
                    for sale. It usually requires to be subjected to mechanical processes whereby
                    the good ore is entirely or partly freed from valueless veinstone. These
                    processes, which in a few special instances are aided by calcination in
                    furnaces, are known as the dressing or mechanical preparation of the ores. As a
                    rule the valuable ore is specifically heavier than the veinstone, and most of
                    the separating processes are based upon the fact that the heavy particles of ore
                    will fall in water more quickly than the light particles of veinstone.</p>
                <p>The processes of mechanical preparation may be classified as follows :—(1)
                    washing and hand-sorting; (2) disintegration, or reduction in size; (3)
                    classification by size or by equivalence; (4) concentration.</p>
                <p>(1) Sometimes the ore coming from the mine requires simply to be freed from
                    adhering particles of clay in order <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n480/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0480-0463"/> to be rendered fit for sale, at other times the
                    washing is necessary as a preliminary process previous to sorting by hand. The
                    operation is performed either by raking the ore backwards and forwards upon a
                    grating under a stream of water, or in a box containing water, or, thirdly, by
                    means of an inclined revolving iron drum worked by hand or any other motive
                    power. The machines used for this purpose, known as washing trommels, are
                    revolving cylinders or truncated cones of sheet-iron provided with teeth inside.
                    The ore is fed in at one end, is subjected to the action of a stream of water,
                    and is discharged at the other end.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stuff, i.e.,</hi> the mixed ore, veinstone, and country
                    rock, having been cleansed, it is now possible to make a separation by hand.
                    Women and children are generally employed for this work, as their labour is
                    cheaper and their sight sharper than that of men. The stuff is spread out on a
                    table, and various classes are picked out according to the nature of the
                    products furnished by the mine. Thus in a lead mine we may have—(a) clean
                    galena, (δ) mixed ore, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> pieces consisting partly of
                    galena and partly of barren veinstone, (c) barren veinstone and country rock.
                    This is a most simple case; very frequently we have to deal with a vein
                    producing ores of two metals, especially in the case of lead and zinc, and then
                    the classification into various qualities becomes more complicated.</p>
                <p>(2) Reduction in size is necessary for two reasons. Even when an ore is
                    sufficiently clean for the smelter, the large lumps are often crushed by the
                    miner for the sake of obtaining a fair sample of the whole, or supplying a
                    product which is at once fit for the furnace. The chief reason, however, for
                    disintegration lies in the fact that the particles of ore are generally found
                    enclosed in or adhering to particles of barren veinstone.</p>
                <p>The disintegration is effected by hand or by machinery. Large blocks of ore and
                    veinstone are broken by men with large sledge hammers, and the reduction in size
                    is continued very often by women with smaller hammers. Sometimes the blow of the
                    hammer is directed so as to separate the good from the poorer parts, and
                    hand-picking accompanies this process, called <hi rend="italic">cobbing.</hi>
                    Ore may be crushed fine by a flat-headed hammer <hi rend="italic">{bucking
                    iron)</hi> on an iron plate.</p>
                <p>The machines used for reducing ores to smaller sizes are very numerous; here it
                    is impossible to do more than briefly call attention to those most commonly
                    used. These are stone-breakers, stamps, rolls, mills, and centrifugal
                    pulverizers.</p>
                <p>The stone-breaker, or rock-breaker, is a machine with two jaws, one of which is
                    made to approach the other, and so crack any stone which lies between them. The
                    best-known stone-breaker is the machine invented by Blake, which has rendered
                    inestimable services to the miner for the last twenty years, and the
                    introduction of which constituted a most important step in advance in the art of
                    ore-dressing. Its mode of action is very simple. When the shaft A (fig. 98)
                    revolves, an excentric raises the “pitman” B, and this, by means of the
                    toggle-plates C, C, causes the movable jaw D to approach the fixed jaw E by
                    about ∣ inch at the bottom. When the pitman descends the jaw is drawn back by an
                    india-rubber spring. The jaws are usually fluted, the ridges of one jaw being
                    opposite the grooves of the other, and they are so constructed that the wearing
                    parts are quickly and easily replaced.</p>
                <p>Mr Marsden of Leeds has lately introduced a pulverizer, constructed on the
                    principle of the stone-breaker, which will reduce large stones to the finest
                    powder in one operation. The moving jaw has an up-and-down as well as the old
                    backwards-and-forwards motion, and the stones are first cracked and then ground
                    by the double action.</p>
                <p>Stamps are pestles and mortars worked by machinery. The construction of the
                    modern California stamp mill with revolving heads is explained in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gold,</hi> vol. x. p. 747, and the description need not be
                    repeated. In Cornwall the older form with rectangular heads still prevails.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to give any correct average figures representing the work done
                    by a stamping mill, because this varies with the hardness of the stuff treated
                    and the fineness to which it must be reduced. However, it is usual in Cornwall
                    to reckon 1 ton of tinstuff and in California 1 to 1∣ ton of gold quartz stamped
                    per horse-power in twenty-four hours.</p>
                <p>Stamps are principally used in dressing the ores of gold, silver, and tin, but
                    are occasionally employed for those of copper and lead. The stamps described at
                    vol. x. p. 747 act simply by gravity. Another form, which has met with favour in
                    the Lake Superior district, is the direct-acting or Ball stamp, which works like
                    a steam hammer, the blow of the head being assisted by the pressure of steam. At
                    the Calumet and Hecla Mill, Lake Superior, each Ball stamp is capable of
                    crushing 130 tons in twenty-four hours. In a third kind of stamps, the heads are
                    lifted by a crank aηd the power of the up-stroke compresses a cushion of air
                    (pneumatic stamps) or a spring, storing up power which makes the down-stroke
                    strike a heavier blow.</p>
                <p>Revolving rolls were introduced in the west of England in the early part of the
                    present century to replace <hi rend="italic">bucking</hi> by hand. The machine,
                    now often known as the Cornish crusher, consists of two cast-iron or steel
                    cylinders which revolve towards each other, whilst at the same time they are
                    kept pressed together by levers or springs. The cylinders or rolls are generally
                    from 18 inches to 2 feet or 2 feet 8 inches in diameter and 12 to 22 inches
                    wide.</p>
                <p>Stone mills constructed like flour mills are employed in some countries for
                    reducing ores to powder; and the <hi rend="italic">arrastra,</hi> which consists
                    of heavy stones dragged round upon a stone bed, has rendered good service in
                    grinding and amalgamating gold and silver ores, in spite of its being slow and
                    cumbersome. Edge-runners (Chilian mills) also deserve mention.</p>
                <p>Iron mills, known as <hi rend="italic">pans,</hi> with grinding surfaces made of
                    chilled cast-iron and arranged so that they can be quickly and easily replaced
                    when worn out, are greatly in vogue in the United States for the treatment of
                    ores of gold and silver; the ore delivered to them is already finely divided,
                    and they are intended, not only still further to reduce the size of the
                    particles, but also and more especially to effect the amalgamation of the
                    precious metals with quicksilver. The pulverizers used in Cornwall for grinding
                    grains of tin ore with a little waste still adhering to them are also iron
                    mills.</p>
                <p>The centrifugal pulverizers are machines by which the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n481/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0481-0464"/> pieces of ore are thrown with great velocity
                    against bars or arms, or against each other, and so reduced to powder; in other
                    machines iron balls or iron rollers are whirled by centrifugal force against an
                    iron casing and grind any mineral contained inside it. These pulverizers are
                    much less used than stone-breakers, stamps, and rolls for the disintegration of
                    metallic ores.</p>
                <p>(3) Classification of a crushed ore into sizes is absolutely necessary in some
                    cases and advisable in others, because the subsequent concentration is dependent
                    upon the fall of the particles in water, as will be presently explained.
                    Classification by size is effected by sieves. Hand sieves and flat sieves placed
                    one above the other have been superseded at most dressing establishments by
                    cylindrical or conical revolving screens known as trommels. These screens are
                    made of wire web or of perforated sheets of metal, and they are often arranged
                    so as to discharge one into the other, so that the ore from a crusher can
                    quickly be separated into classes of various sizes.</p>
                <p>With sizes of less than 1 millimetre (- <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ⅛ inch)
                    trommels are no longer employed, and recourse is had to the so-called separators
                    or classifiers. These are boxes in the shape of inverted cones or pyramids into
                    which the finely crushed ore is brought by means of a current of water; a jet of
                    clean water is often made to rise up in the bottom; the larger and the
                    specifically heavier particles fall and are discharged with a stream of water at
                    or near the bottom, whilst the smaller and specifically lighter particles flow
                    away at the top. The separators do not effect a true classification by size;
                    they merely cause a division by <hi rend="italic">equivalence,</hi> a term which
                    will be explained immediately.</p>
                <p>(4) We now have to deal with the enriching of the ore, or the concentration of
                    the valuable particles into as small a bulk as is economically advantageous. The
                    concentration is generally brought about by the fall of the particles in water.
                    Occasionally the fall in air is utilized; mercury is employed as a collecting
                    agent in the case of gold and silver, and in a few instances magnetism can be
                    applied.</p>
                <p>The concentration in water depends upon the difference in specific gravity of the
                    valuable ore and the waste veinstone or rock. A piece of galena with a specific
                    gravity of 7 ’ 5 sinks to the bottom more quickly than a similar piece of
                    quartz, the density of which is only 2 ’ 6. Nevertheless a large piece of quartz
                    may fall to the bottom as quickly as a small piece of galena. Particles which
                    have equal velocities of fall, though differing in size and specific gravity,
                    are said to be <hi rend="italic">equal-falling,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >equivalent.</hi> P. von Kittinger shows that a sphere of quartz of ∣ inch in
                    diameter would sink in water exactly as quickly as a sphere of galena of <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ inch in diameter, and these two particles are
                    therefore equal-falling. Consequently, before we can separate properly by water
                    it is necessary to classify the particles by size, so that equivalence shall not
                    prevent a separation or lessen its sharpness. It is nevertheless true that in
                    the early part of the fall of equivalent grains the influence of the specific
                    gravity preponderates, and the denser particles take the lead; therefore, by a
                    frequent repetition of very small falls, particles which have not been closely
                    sized may still be separated.</p>
                <p>The principal machine for concentrating particles of sizes ranging between 1 inch
                    and <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ inch is the jig or jigger. The hand jigger is
                    merely a round sieve which is charged with the crushed ore and then moved up and
                    down in a tub full of water. The particles gradually arrange themselves in
                    layers, the heaviest on the bottom and the lightest at the top. On lifting out
                    the sieve the light waste can be skimmed off with a scraper, leaving the
                    concentrated product below ready for the smelter or for further treatment.
                    Similar sieves worked by machinery were for a long time employed in dressing
                    establishments, but the introduction of the improved continuous jiggers has led
                    to their abandonment in all works of any importance. The continuous jigger is
                    one of the most useful dressing machines of the present day.</p>
                <p>It consists of a box or hutch divided by a partial partition into two
                    compartments; in one is fixed a flat sieve <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (fig. 99),
                    which carries the ore, and in the other a piston <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is
                    made to work up and down by means of an excentric. The hutch being full of
                    water, the movement of the piston causes the water to rise up and fall down
                    through the ore, lifting it and letting it fall repeatedly. The effect of these
                    frequent lifts and falls is to cause a separation of the previously sized ore
                    into layers of rich mineral at the bottom, light waste at the top, and particles
                    of ore mixed with waste in the middle.</p>
                <p>The great value of these jiggers is the continuous discharge of the products
                    without stoppages for their removal. Several methods are in vogue, viz., the end
                    discharge, the central discharge, and the discharge through the meshes of the
                    sieve. With the first, the enriched product lying at the bottom of the sieve
                    passes out through openings at the end of the jigger, and the amount escaping is
                    governed by an adjustable cap or shutter, by which the size of the openings can
                    be increased or diminished at pleasure; the middle product can be discharged by
                    openings placed a little higher up, whilst the waste is washed over the top of
                    the end of the jigger at each pulsation. Very often a first sieve simply
                    separates a concentrated product and discharges the poorer product into a second
                    sieve, where a similar separation is effected. With the central discharge, a
                    pipe is brought up through the bottom of the sieve, and the size of the opening
                    for the escape of the concentrated ore is regulated by a cylindrical cap which
                    can be raised or lowered by a screw. The discharge through the sieve is
                    especially adapted for the finer products from the crusher, though it is also
                    used in some cases for grains up to ∣ inch in diameter. The mesh of the sieve is
                    chosen so that the particles under treatment will just pass through, but above
                    the sieve a layer of clean ore is placed which prevents anything but the heavier
                    particles from being discharged. The pulsations of the water, as before, cause a
                    separation into layers, and the heavy rich particles find their way through the
                    bed and drop into the hutch, whence they can be drawn off through a hole at
                    pleasure. The poorer part passes over a simple sill at the end of the sieve, or
                    to a second sieve if necessary. Three or four sieves are occasionally arranged
                    in a row in one machine.</p>
                <p>Fig. 100 is a section through the two sieves of a Harz sand jig. The pistons act
                    in the manner explained by fig. 99.</p>
                <p>The smaller sizes are concentrated by a variety of machines. The action of many
                    of them is based upon the behaviour of particles carried down an inclined plane
                    by a thin stream of water. If the gradient of the plane and the strength of the
                    thin current are properly arranged, the denser particles will be deposited and
                    the specifically lighter ones washed away, although they may be <hi
                    rend="italic">equal-falling</hi> if allowed to settle in deep water.</p>

                <p>The principal machines for concentrating fine sands and slimes are the frame,
                    rotating frame, percussion frame, side-blow percussion frame, revolving belt and
                    Frue vanner, the hand buddle, the round buddle, and the keeve.</p>
                <p>The frame is simply an inclined wooden table upon which a thin deposit is formed
                    by the sheet of ore-and-waste-bearitιg water which is made to flow over it
                    gently. The stream is then stopped and the deposit washed off by hand or
                    automatically, and collected in pits for subsequent retreatment by similar
                    appliances if necessary.</p>
                <p>The rotating frame is a round table with a very flat convex conical surface; the
                    ore for suspension flows on at one part of the centre and forms a thin deposit
                    which is richest at the top and poorest at the bottom, and this deposit is
                    washed off so as to form two classes by means of jets of water, under which the
                    table passes as it turns round. Concave rotating tables, fed at the
                    circumference, are also employed.</p>
                <p>The percussion frame, the <hi rend="italic">Stossheerd</hi> of the Germans, is a
                    table suspended by four chains which receives a succession of blows from a cam
                    in the direction of the stream flowing over it; after each blow it bumps against
                    a piece of timber before receiving the next blow. These bumps cause the ore to
                    settle, and after a thick deposit is formed it is dug off with the shovel, the
                    upper end being richer than the middle or the tail.</p>
                <p>Rittinger’s side-blow percussion frame is a suspended rectangular table ABCD
                    (fig. 101), receiving blows and bumps on the side and not on the end. A stream
                    of orey water S is fed on at the corner A; clean water W is supplied by the
                    other head-boards H, H, H; and the table is pushed out by cams in the direction
                    of the arrow, and is driven back by a spring so that the cross-piece E strikes
                    against a bumping-block K. The light particles travel down the table much faster
                    than the heavy ones, and take a comparatively straight course; whereas the heavy
                    and richer particles remain on the table, subject to the influence of the
                    side-blows, for a much longer time, and travelling along a curved path reach the
                    bottom at F. The middle class is discharged at G and the poor waste at K. The
                    exact degree of richness of the products can be regulated by altering the
                    pointers, strips of wood which can be turned so as to divide the stream of ore
                    and waste where thought most desirable. The great advantage of this machine over
                    the old percussion frame is its continuous action.</p>
                <p>The Frue vanner (fig. 102) may be looked upon as an improved form of Brunton’s
                    simple revolving belt. It is an endless band of indiarubber cloth, flanged on
                    each side, which revolves slowly in the direction of the arrows, whilst at the
                    same time it is shaken sideways by a crank motion. The orey water is fed on at
                    A, clean water at B. The natural path of the particles is down the inclined
                    belt, but the specifically heavier ones settle upon it and are carried upwards.
                    Those that can resist the action of the stream of clean water at B go over the
                    end and are washed off as the belt passes through the tank. The poor stuff falls
                    into the waste launder. The degree of concentration can be regulated by the
                    slope and speed of the belt and the strength of the streams of ore and water.
                    The Frue vanner has the disadvantage that it makes only two classes, rich and
                    poor, without any intermediate product.</p>
                <p>The hand buddle is a rectangular wooden box with a sloping bottom. A stream of
                    fine ore and waste suspended in water is fed in at the upper end and gradually
                    forms a deposit on the bed of the buddle. A boy with a broom keeps the top of
                    the sediment smooth, so as to ensure regularity of action. After a thick deposit
                    has accumulated, it is dug out in sections which decrease in richness from the
                    upper end <hi rend="italic">{head)</hi> to the lower end <hi rend="italic"
                    >(tail).</hi></p>
                <p>Round buddles, like rotating frames, are of two kinds, convex and concave. The
                    convex round buddle (figs. 103<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    cone, or head, of varying size in the centre, and a bottom sloping towards the
                    circumference. The orey stream A falling over this head runs down gently,
                    depositing the heaviest particles near the top, the lighter ones further down,
                    whilst the lightest of all flow away at C. The surface of the sediment is kept
                    even by revolving finishes D. This machine may be compared to a number of hand
                    buddles arranged radially round a centre. The deposit that is formed is dug out
                    in rings of varying richness</p>
                <p>The concave buddle is a circular pit with the bottom sloping towards the centre.
                    The stream of ore is fed all round the circumference, and runs inwards to the
                    middle, where the lightest particles escape. The rich head is of course near the
                    circumference.</p>
                <p>The keeve is a large tub in which the fine stuff is stirred with water and then
                    is allowed to settle from a state of suspension while blows are being struck on
                    the side of the tub. The deposit is afterwards scraped out in layers which
                    increase in richness as they approach the bottom.</p>
                <p>The series of processes employed in dressing an ore varies, not only according to
                    the nature of the particular mineral to be concentrated, but also according to
                    the size of its particles and the nature of the other minerals with which it is
                    associated.</p>
                <p>With gold the reduction in size is usually effected by stone-breakers and stamps,
                    and much of the metal is then caught by mercury; what escapes is concentrated
                    with its accompanying pyrites by inclined tables covered with blankets, or by
                    buddles, and the concentrate is treated by amalgamation or chlorination. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gold,</hi> vol. x. p. 746.</p>
                <p>In the case of silver the ore is frequently pulverized by stamps, and the
                    resulting <hi rend="italic">pulp</hi> amalgamated in pans or barrels. The ore
                    may also be concentrated by any of the various machines described, and delivered
                    to the smelter. Many of the ores of silver are sent to the smelting works
                    without any concentration by water, as this would cause a serious loss.</p>
                <p>Lead ore is generally crushed by rolls, often after a preliminary reduction in
                    size by the stone-breaker. The crushed ore is classified by revolving screens
                    down to the size of 1 mm., and the resulting grains concentrated by jigging; <hi
                    rend="italic">dredge, or</hi> grains of ore and matrix, must be recrushed,
                    sized, and jigged. The finer sizes are classified by pyramidal boxes and
                    concentrated by frames, rotating tables, and buddles.</p>
                <p>Zinc ore is dressed in the same way as lead ore; and, as galena and zinc-blende
                    are frequently intimately associated together, it is necessary to separate them
                    by the use of the jig, buddle, and frame.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n483/mode/1up"

                <p>Tin-bearing rock is crushed by the stone-breaker and then stamped fine. The
                    resulting sand and slime may be concentrated by the repeated use of the round
                    buddle, with the keeve for a final cleaning; but often the sand only is enriched
                    by the buddle, whilst the very finest particles, constituting an almost
                    impalpable mud <hi rend="italic">(slime)</hi> when mixed with water, are treated
                    by frames. When much pyrites is present it is necessary to make a preliminary
                    concentration and roast the enriched product <hi rend="italic">(witts)</hi> in a
                    furnace. The calcination converts the heavy iron and arsenical pyrites into a
                    light oxide which can be got rid of with the rest of the waste by buddling and
                    framing. The final product from the keeve is clean enough to approach pure
                    cassiterite in the percentage of metal. Alluvial tin ore is concentrated in <hi
                    rend="italic">sluice-boxes,</hi> and sometimes by jiggers, after a preliminary
                    treatment in a <hi rend="italic">puddling-machine</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Gold,</hi> vol. X. p. 745) if there are balls of clay which have to be broken
                    up. When the alluvial ore occurs as a hard conglomerate <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cement),</hi> it has to be stamped.</p>
                <p>Copper ores are treated by crushing by rolls and sometimes stamps, sizing by
                    trommels, and then jigging and buddling; but, as some of the ores are very
                    friable and easily carried away by water, hand-picking is employed to a greater
                    extent than with lead and tin ore, and the enrichment by water is not carried so
                    far on account of the inevitable loss that would ensue. The amount of
                    concentration depends upon the distance from the smelting works, and the
                    mine-owner has to calculate whether it is best to get a low price for a large
                    quantity of ore, after paying the carriage, or a higher price for a smaller lot
                    <hi rend="italic">(parcel)</hi> when due allowance has been made for the cost of
                    dressing and loss sustained in that process. Thus, for instance, in Cornwall,
                    the ore containing copper pyrites is dressed so as to contain only from 5 to 8
                    or 9 per cent, of metal, because it can easily be conveyed to Swansea by sea,
                    and because further reduction in bulk would cause greater loss in value than the
                    saving of freight.</p>
                <p>The loss in dressing is very considerable. P. von Rittinger estimates it at from
                    30 to 50 per cent., and stubborn facts bear out his conclusions. Heaps of refuse
                    from dressing floors are frequently worked over again with profit; and in the
                    year 1881 no less than 909 tons of “black tin” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    concentrated tin ore fit for the smelter), worth £35,283, were extracted from
                    the muddy water allowed to flow away from the dressing floors of some of the
                    principal Cornish tin mines.</p>
                <p>The fall in air has been employed instead of the fall in water for concentrating
                    purposes, and several ingenious air-jigs have been constructed and worked upon
                    this principle.</p>
                <p>In exceptional cases magnetic attraction may be utilized. Magnetic iron can be
                    separated in this way, and the magnetic process is applied for treating mixed
                    blende and chalybite, the specific gravities of which are too close to render
                    concentration by water practicable. The mixed ore is calcined, and the chalybite
                    is thus converted into magnetic iron, which can be extracted by a magnetic
                    separator, leaving saleable blende.</p>
                <p>Before concluding this part of the subject we will briefly enumerate the
                    principal improvements that have been made in metal-mining during the last
                    quarter of a century. They are as follows :—diamond-drill for prospecting;
                    machine drills for driving, sinking, and stoping; use of compressed air for
                    winding underground; stronger explosives, especially the nitro-glycerin
                    compounds dynamite and blasting gelatin; increased use of steel for various
                    purposes; Blake’s stone-breaker and continuous jiggers; extended application of
                    hydraulic mining; larger employment of electricity both for blasting purposes
                    and for signalling by telegraph and telephone. It may be reasonably hoped that
                    ere long electricity will render increased services to the miner for lighting
                    the workings and for the transmission of power.</p>

                    belong to the crown. The crown, however, does not claim gold and silver
                    extracted from the ores of the baser metals. The ownership of the minerals can
                    be, and often is, severed from that of the surface, the latter being sold whilst
                    the mineral rights are reserved by the original owner. Local customs, now
                    regulated by Acts of Parliament, are still in force in Derbyshire (High Peak
                    Mining Customs and Mineral Courts Act, 1851, 14 &amp; 15 Vict. c. 94, and the
                    Derbyshire Mining Customs and Mineral Courts Act, 1852, 15 &amp; 16 Vict. c. 43)
                    and in the Forest of Dean (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 43, and 24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 40).
                    The Stannaries Act (32 &amp; 33 Vict. c. 19) regulates the commercial dealings
                    of mining companies in Cornwall and Devon, and provides for their
                    liquidation.</p>
                <p>The working of mines in the United Kingdom is controlled by five Acts of
                    Parliament, viz., “The Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1872” (35 &amp; 36 Vict. c.
                    76), “The Metalliferous Mines Regulation Acts, 1872 and 1877” (35 &amp; 36 Vict.
                    c. 77, and 38 &amp; 39 Viet c. 39), “The Stratified Ironstone Mines (Gunpowder)
                    Act, 1881” (44 &amp; 45 Viet, c. 26), and “The Slate Mines (Gunpowder) Act,
                    1882” (45 Vict. c. 3). The last three Acts simply refer to the annual returns,
                    and exemptions from certain restrictions concerning ≠he use of gunpowder.</p>
                <p>The Coal Mines Regulation Act applies to mines of coal, stratified ironstone,
                    shale, and fire-clay. The Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act applies to all
                    mines not included under the Coal Mines Act, and therefore controls not only
                    workings for lead, tin, copper, and iron, commonly known as mines, but also the
                    salt-mines, and underground quarries worked for stone, slate, or other earthy
                    minerals. The principal provisions of the Coal Mines Regulation Act have been
                    set forth at vol. vi. p. 78; those of the Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act are
                    similar, but less strict owing to the almost complete absence of fire-damp. One
                    important difference is that the manager of a mine under the Metalliferous Act
                    need not hold any certificate of competency or service.</p>
                <p>Other Acts of Parliament are the “Explosives Act, 1875” (38 Vict. c. 17),
                    regulating the manner in which explosives are stored; the “Elementary Education
                    Acts, 1876 and 1880” (38 &amp; 39 Viet, c. 79, and 43 &amp; 44 Vict. c. 23),
                    regulating the employment of children; the “Factory and Workshop Act, 1878” (41
                    Vict. c. 16), which applies to the dressing floors of mines under the
                    Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act.</p>
                <p>The statute of Elizabeth (43 Eliz. c. 2) which was passed for raising money for
                    the relief of the poor mentions coal mines, but omits other mines; these have
                    been made subject to poor-rates by “The Rating Act, 1874” (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c.
                    54). The “Employers’ Liability Act, 1880” (43 &amp; 44 Vict. c. 42), extends and
                    regulates the liability of employers to make compensation for personal injuries
                    suffered by workmen in their service. Finally, if, as sometimes happens, works
                    are put up at a mine for roasting copper ores with common salt in order to
                    extract the metal by the wet way, the provisions of the “Alkali, &amp;c., Works
                    Regulation Act, 1881” (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. 37), must be attended to.</p>
                <p>It is thus very evident that the laws affecting mines have received most
                    important additions during the last few years.</p>
                <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Accidents in Mines.—</hi> Mining is one of the occupations
                    that may decidedly be called hazardous. This fact has been thoroughly impressed
                    upon the public mind by explosions of fire-damp in collieries; but, though
                    accidents of this kind are appalling, owing to the number of victims who perish
                    at one time, fire-damp is by no means the worst enemy with which the miner has
                    to contend. Falls of roof and sides both in collieries and metal mines are far
                    more fatal in their results. With the risks attending the collier’s calling we
                    need not deal, as statistics upon <pb break="no"

                    employed <hi rend="italic">underground</hi> in metalliferous mines is 2'37 per
                    1000. During the ten years 1873-1882 the corresponding mortality at mines under
                    the Coal Mines Act was 2’57, showing a difference of only 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 20 per 1000 in favour of the metal miner; and when we
                    take the well-known metalliferous district of Cornwall and Devon we find a
                    death-rate for the ten years mentioned of 2 ’ 63 per 1000, which therefore
                    exceeds that of coal mines.</p>
                <p>Reference to the table shows that more than one-third of the deaths were caused
                    by falls of ground. The actual percentages of the deaths are as follows:—falls
                    of ground 35’5, in shafts 26’2, miscellaneous 25 1, on surface 13Ί. The
                    accidents in shafts are due to falls from ladders, cages, and man-engines, ropes
                    and chains breaking, overwinding, and other causes, whilst the miscellaneous
                    accidents include numerous fatalities in connexion with blasting operations. The
                    surface accidents are mostly caused by persons becoming entangled in machinery,
                    and there have been several fatal boiler explosions.</p>
                <p>In spite, however, of all the dangers to which miners are exposed, they are less
                    likely to be the victims of accident than railway servants, among whom the rate
                    of fatal accidents varies from 2’5 per 1000 on passenger traffic lines to 3 <hi

                    1867 to 1881 have been:—coal mines 2’952, lignite mines 2’474, metal mines Γ446,
                    other mines 1’693, all the mines together 2’476. In making any comparison
                    between these figures and those we have given for Great Britain, it is necessary
                    to recollect that the mines under the Coal Mines Act include some workings which
                    in Prussia would be classed as metalliferous, and that British mines under the
                    Metalliferous Act include underground stone-quarries.</p>
                <p>Before concluding the subject of accidents, it is necessary to point out that
                    successful efforts have been made of late years to mitigate their results. In
                    the first place, persons equipped with the Fleuss breathing apparatus can now
                    enter mines after explosions, in spite of the noxious and irrespirable gases,
                    and save lives which would otherwise be sacrificed.<note anchored="true"

                    by means of the instruction afforded by classes established by the St John
                    Ambulance Association, miners are learning how best to render first aid to the
                    injured before the arrival of a medical man, and there is no doubt that many
                    valuable lives have been lost in times past for want of this knowledge. Thirdly,
                    a vast amount of good has been done by the establishment of Miners’ Permanent
                    Relief Societies in different districts, which afford aid to persons disabled by
                    accidents and to the dependent relatives of those who have unfortunately lost
                    their lives by any mining fatality.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Belgium.—</hi> Belgium is rich in coal, the output in 1881
                    being no less than 16,873,951 metric tons, valued at 163,704,242 francs. Though
                    it produces iron ores, it is largely dependent upon other countries, and
                    especially the grand-duchy of Luxemburg, for supplies for its blast furnaces.
                    The principal lead mine is that of Bleiberg, and the calamine deposits in the
                    neutral territory of Moresnet have long been worked with success by the
                    celebrated Vieille Montagne Company, which also owns zinc mines in Belgium,
                    Germany, Sweden, Sardinia, and Algeria.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Russia.</hi> —In a vast empire like Russia it is not surprising
                    that there should be valuable deposits of a great variety of minerals. Among the
                    most important are the auriferous alluvia of the Ural mountains and Siberia,
                    which in 1880 yielded 115,940 troy K&gt; of gold, worth more than 5 millions
                    sterling. Platinum is found associated with the gold-bearing sands of the Urals;
                    the output in 1880 was 7895 troy lb. Zinc ore is largely worked in Poland.
                    Import ant supplies of chromic iron ore are derived from the Urals, amounting in
                    1880 to more than 8000 tons. The metallic copper produced in 1880 was about 3100
                    tons, and the oil wells of Baku yielded in that year 346,000 tons of petroleum.
                    Russia also possesses mines of iron ore, manganese, lead, silver, coal, and
                    lignite. A little tin ore is furnished by Finland.</p>

                <p>The cupreous pyrites, often known as sulphur ore, is obtained from the province
                    of Huelva, where vast deposits occur over a belt of country nearly 100 miles
                    long by 20 miles wide. The Rio Tinto mines are the largest in the district, and
                    are worked on a gigantic scale. The company employs upwards of 10,000 hands, or
                    more persons than are engaged in all the Cleveland iron mines, and the output is
                    upwards of a million tons per annum. About one-quarter of this, containing 3∣
                    per cent, of copper, is exported, mainly for the manufacture of sulphuric acid
                    and subsequent treatment for copper and silver, whilst theremaining
                    three-quarters, with 2⅜ to 2⅜ per cent, of copper, are treated on the spot. The
                    ore contains rather less than 1 oz. of silver to the ton, and a few grains of
                    gold. These are profitably extracted from the burnt ore by Claudet’s process,

                    is close to the Spanish frontier. It is estimated that the workings had yielded

                    times has been the re-working of the Laurium mines, which are situated in the
                    southern extremity of Attica; and an account of them written by Cordelia
                    furnishes many curious details concerning the methods of mining, washing, and
                    smelting employed by the ancients. The workings for lead and silver appear to
                    have been carried on with the greatest vigour between 600 B. c. and the
                    Peloponnesian War, and were finally abandoned in the 1st century of the
                    Christian era. Huge piles of slag which had accumulated from the old smelting
                    works were found to be well worth being re-worked for silver and lead, and
                    operations were commenced in 1864. Five years later the old heaps of mine refuse
                    began to be treated, and at last in 1875 a French company resumed working the
                    mine. A Greek company employing some 3000 persons is now producing annually from
                    the old mine heaps no less than 8000 to 9000 tons of pig lead, yielding 45 oz.

                    of 36,664 tons (metric) of roasted calamine, with 40 to 60 per cent, of zinc, in
                    addition to lead ore and mixed ores. Cordelia calculates that during the three
                    hundred years the Laurium mines were worked by the ancients the total amount of
                    lead produced was 2,100,000 tons, with 22⅜ million troy tt&gt;of silver. Besides
                    this the ancients left behind two million tons of lead slags containing on an
                    average 10 67 per cent, of lead, 109 million tons of mine refuse with 1 ⅛ to 18
                    per cent, of lead, and excavations to the extent of 51 million cubic yards with
                    lead ore still in sight. They did not touch the calamine deposits.<note

                    remarkable mineral deposits of Africa at the present time are the diamond mines.
                    The first diamonds were obtained from recent gravel in the bed of the Vaal
                    river, and it was afterwards discovered that the precious stones could be
                    obtained from the so-called dry diggings. The most important of these, the
                    Colesberg Kopje, now known as the Kimberley mine, produced in 1881 diamonds
                    weighing 900,000 carats, worth £1,575,000. Three other neighbouring mines are
                    Old De Beer’s, which yielded 300,000 carats in 1881, worth £600,000, Du Toit’s
                    Pan, and Bulfontein. The value of the diamonds raised in South Africa since 1870

                    existence of traces of mining on a very extensive scale. No doubt in early days
                    India did supply what then appeared to be very large quantities of metals, and a
                    country that produces gold and precious stones is apt to be endowed by the
                    popular mind with boundless riches. The actual amounts of mineral raised in
                    India at the present day are comparatively small. Gold exists over considerable

                <p>“The statistics of other useful minerals and metals show an equally marvellous
                    advance during the past thirty years. The production of pig iron, which in 1852
                    was 541,000 net tons, in 1861 was 653,000 tons, and in 1871 was 1,708,000 tons.
                    Ten years later, in 1881, we produced no less than 4,144,000 tons, an increase
                    in thirty years of nearly 800 per cent.</p>
                <p>“Lead, which appears at 14,400 tons in 1852, varied but little from that figure
                    until the construction of railroads into the argentiferous lead-mining districts
                    of the west about 1870. Eureka, Nevada, Utah, and more recently Colorado, with
                    its Leadville bonanzas, rapidly raised the production from 18,000 tons in 1871
                    to 47,000 tons in 1873, 75,000 tons in 1877, and 105.000 tons in 1881.</p>
                <p>"Our production of copper steadily increased from 1000 tons in 1852 to 31,000
                    tons in 1881,—the enormous output of that unrivalled mine Calumet and Hecla
                    steadying the production and neutralizing the fluctuations of the lesser
                    mines.</p>
                <p>“Quicksilver has shown wide fluctuations, due more to trade combinations than to
                    the condition of the mines. In 1852 the output amounted to 20,000 flasks; <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n487/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0487-0470"/> but it went as low as 10,000 flasks in 18β0, and
                    rose to 53,000 flasks five years later; from this it declined to 15,000 flasks
                    in 1875, though in the following year it grew to 75,000 flasks. Last year we
                    produced 59,000 flasks. “Gold is the only metal in which our production has been
                    declining. In 1852 it amounted to $60,000,000; but, with some fluctuations, it
                    lias now declined to less than $32,000,000 annually. “The production of silver,
                    on the contrary, has largely increased. Commencing in 1859 with $100,000, it has
                    now attained $45,000,000. In 1877 only were these figures exceeded, and then
                    only by about $1,000,000. “The production of petroleum, that great American
                    industry, has grown with wonderful rapidity. In 1859 it commenced with only 3000
                    barrels, and, after an almost uniform increase, it attained last year the
                    enormous figures of 27,000,000 barrels. Scientific investigation has recently
                    raised a note of warning in this industry, asserting the limited area of
                    oil-producing territory and its approaching exhaustion.”</p>

                    Nevada, with 236,468 oz. of gold, of which only about 1 per cent, came from
                    placer mines; then Dakota, 159,920 oz. of gold, nearly entirely produced by deep

                <p>It is useless within the limits of this article to attempt to convey an adequate
                    idea of the enormous mineral resources of the United States. We can merely very
                    briefly allude to some of the principal deposits, which are of commercial value
                    on account of their magnitude, of scientific interest owing to their mode of
                    occurrence, and of technical importance as having led to the introduction of
                    considerable improvements in the arts of mining, milling, and dressing.</p>
                <p>Among these may be mentioned the coal and anthracite mines and oil wells of
                    Pennsylvania, the gold and quicksilver mines of California, the silver mines of
                    Nevada, the lead and silver mines of Colorado, and the copper mines of Lake
                    Superior. The articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Coal</hi> (vol. vi. p. 60) and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gold</hi> (vol. x. p. 743) may be referred to for information
                    concerning the occurrence of these minerals and the method of extracting gold by
                    hydraulic mining and improved stamping machinery.</p>
                <p>Quicksilver in the form of native mercury and cinnabar occurs in considerable
                    abundance in California, and much of it is found in connexion with serpentine,
                    either in the serpentine itself or in sandstone near its junction with
                    serpentine. The most important mines are those of New Almaden in the southern
                    part of the State near San Jose. The deposit at Sulphur Bank in Lake County is
                    of much geological interest. It consists of native sulphur, gypsum, and cinnabar
                    in a decomposed andesitic lava close to an extinct geyser from which boiling
                    water still issues. The top of the bank was worked open-cast for sulphur, and
                    then for sulphur and cinnabar, and now underground mining is carried on in
                    stratified sandstone and shale impregnated with cinnabar and underlying the
                    lava.</p>
                <p>Some of the most marvellous silver mines in the world are those upon the Comstock
                    lode in Nevada. A horizontal section of part of this great vein is shown on
                    Plate IV., copied from the excellent and well-known report of Mr J. D.
                    Hague.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    south, and the dip about 43° to the east. “The vein matter of the Comstock
                    consists of crushed and decomposed country rock, clay, and quartz.” “Up to
                    January 1, 1880, the Comstock had yielded in twenty years about $325,000,000
                    worth of bullion. The total length of shafts and galleries is about 250 miles.
                    The number of men employed in the mines in January 1880 was 2800, earning
                    average wages of $4 a day. At the same date 340 men were at work in the
                    amalgamating mills.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>

                    the water to be 153°, that of the air 126°; whilst the water in the Yellow

                <p>During the last few years the Comstock lode has been falling off in
                    productiveness. In 1876 the total yield of the Comstock lode was $38,572,984
                    (gold, $18,002,906; silver, $20,570,078). During the census year ending May 31,
                    1880, the product of the whole Comstock district, including outlying veins, was
                    $6,922,330 (gold, $3,109,156; silver, $3,813,174), showing a decline of
                    $31,650,654, or 82'06 per cent., since 1876.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Though the extraction of silver from its ores may be regarded as the business of
                    the metallurgist rather than of the miner, we must not forget to mention that it
                    is to the necessities of the treatment of the Nevada ores that we owe the system
                    of pan amalgamation first developed in that State and practised since in
                    Colorado.</p>
                <p>Another district in Nevada which cannot be passed over in silence is that which
                    contains the Eureka and Richmond mines, which are celebrated, not only for the
                    silver they have produced, but also for the important trial in which the issue
                    hinged upon the definition of the term vein or lode (p. 441). The bullion
                    produced in the Eureka district from ore raised and treated during the census
                    year ended May 31, 1880, was—gold, 62,893 oz.; and silver, 2,037,666 oz.; worth
                    altogether $3,934,621.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The history of Leadville in Colorado seems like a romance when we read of the
                    rapid development of the mines, the creation of a large and important town, the
                    erection of smelting works and the building of railways, under very adverse

                    geological section across the district (Plate IV. ).</p>
                <p>The principal deposits of the region are found at or near the junction of the
                    porphyry with the Blue limestone, which is the lowest member of the
                    Carboniferous formation. This bed is about 150 or 200 feet thick, and consists
                    of dark blue dolomitic limestone. At the top there are concretions of black
                    chert. The porphyry occurs in intrusive sheets which generally follow the
                    bedding, and almost invariably a white porphyry is found overlying the Blue
                    limestone. This porphyry is of Secondary age; it is a white homogeneous-looking
                    rock, composed of quartz and felspar of even granular texture, in which the
                    porphyritic ingredients, which are accidental rather than essential, are small
                    rectangular crystals of white felspar, occasional double pyramids of quartz, and
                    fresh hexagonal plates of biotite or black mica. Along the plane of contact with
                    the porphyry the limestone has been transformed, by a process of gradual
                    replacement, into a vein consisting of argentiferous galena, cerussite, and
                    cerargyrite mixed with the hydrous oxides of iron and manganese, chert, granular
                    cavernous quartz, clay, heavy spar, and ’ ‘ Chinese talc,” a silicate and
                    sulphate of alumina. The vein seems to have been formed by aqueous solutions,
                    which took up their contents from the neighbouring eruptive rocks and brought
                    about the alteration of the limestone as they percolated downwards through it.
                    In Carbonate Hill, a gradual passage may be observed from dolomite into earthy
                    oxides of iron and manganese. The masses of workable ore are extremely irregular
                    in shape, size, and distribution. They are often 30 to 40 feet thick vertically,
                    and occasionally 80 feet, but only over a small area. The rich ore bodies are
                    commonest in the upper part of the ore-bearing stratum. At Fryer Hill the Blue
                    limestone is almost entirely replaced by vein material.</p>
                <p>In the census year ended May 31, 1880, Lake County, Colorado, which includes the
                    Leadville district, produced 28,226 gross tons of lead, with 3830 oz. of gold
                    and 8,853,946 oz. of silver, of a total value of $13,032,464.<note

                <p>The copper-producing districts are those of Ontonagon, Keweenaw County, and
                    Portage Lake. The last-named contains the famous Calumet and Hecla mine, which
                    alone produced 15,837 tons of copper in 1880, or about half the entire output of
                    the United States. The deposit from whence this vast amount of copper was
                    obtained is a bed of conglomerate, generally called a vein, dipping about 38°
                    northwest. It has been worked for a depth of 2250 feet on the incline. In 1875

                    It is highly probable that the existence of this gold was known to the Indians,
                    who reported it to Sir Walter Raleigh, and so led him to undertake his
                    unfortunate expedition in search of “El Dorado.” French Guiana contains workable
                    deposits of gold, and yielded 72,168 oz. in 1880.</p>
                <p>The chain of the Andes forms a long belt of mineral-producing country. Beginning

                    states is about 200,000 oz. Colombia has mines of rock salt, yielding 19,000
                    tons a year, and the emerald mine at Muzo has long been famous. Peru is renowned
                    for its silver mines; the best-known are those of Cerro de Pasco, situated at an
                    elevation of 14,000 feet above the sea-level. Passing into Bolivia, we must
                    notice the silver mines of Potosi, the wealth of which is proverbial. Chili is
                    best known as the principal copper-producing country of South America; but its
                    silver mines are not unimportant, and beds of nitrate of soda are largely
                    wrought.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable gold mines of Brazil lie in the province of Minas Geraes,
                    whilst diamonds are obtained in that of Matto Grosso. In the Argentine Republic
                    gold, silver, and copper mines are worked, especially in the provinces on the
                    eastern flanks of the Andes.</p>
                <p>The total annual output of the precious metal in South America is estimated to be
                    upwards of 300,000 oz. of gold, and 2,000,000 oz. of silver. In 1877 Chili
                    exported 35,128 metric tons of metallic copper, in addition to ore and

                    gold fields was 204,388 oz. in 1880, in addition to what was carried by private
                    hands. Tin ore was first worked in 1872 near the border of the colony with New
                    South Wales, and large quantities of stream tin have been obtained from very
                    shallow alluvial diggings near Stanthorpe. Like gold, the tin ore is not
