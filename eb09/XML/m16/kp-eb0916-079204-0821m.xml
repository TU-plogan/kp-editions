                    and an heiress to immense property, she appeared to be very early destined to a
                    splendid marriage. It was perhaps the greatest misfortune of her life that
                    “Mademoiselle ”'(as her courtesy title went) was encouraged or thought herself
                    encouraged to look forward to the throne of France as the result of a marriage
                    with Louis XIV., who was, however, eleven years her junior. Ill-luck, or her own
                    wilfulness, frustrated numerous plans for marrying her to various persons of
                    more or less exalted station, including Charles II. of England, then Prince of
                    Wales. She was just of age when the Fronde broke out, and, attributing as she
                    did her disappointments to Mazarin, she sympathized with it not a little. It was
                    not, however, till the new or second Fronde that she displayed in a very curious
                    fashion a temper and courage as masculine and adventurous as those of her father
                    Gaston had always been effeminate and timid. She not only took nominal command
                    of one of the armies on the princes’ side, but she literally and in her own
                    person took Orleans by escalade, crossing the river, breaking a gate, and
                    mounting the walls with the applause of the populace of the city, but in face of
                    the refusal of the authorities to admit her. No good result, however, came to
                    her party from this extraordinary act, and she had to retreat to Paris, where
                    she practically commanded the Bastille and the adjoining part of the walls. On
                    the 2d of July (1652) the battle of the Faubourg Saint Antoine, between the
                    Frondeurs under Condé and the royal troops under Turenne, took place, and the
                    former, being beaten, found themselves in an awkward situation, between their
                    conquerors and the walls of a city, which, though not exactly hostile to them,
                    was not nominally on their side, and had closed its gates against them.
                    Mademoiselle saved them by giving orders not merely for the gates under her
                    control to be opened but for the cannon of the Bastille to fire on the
                    royalists, which was done. Her own residence (and indeed her property) was the
                    Luxembourg, and here she found herself during the riots which followed the
                    battle; but in the heat of the <hi rend="italic">émeute</hi> she installed
                    herself in the hôtel de ville, and played the part of mediatrix between the
                    opposed parties. Her political importance lasted exactly six months, and did her
                    little good, for it created a lifelong prejudice against her in the mind of her
                    cousin, Louis XIV., who never forgave opposition to his sovereign power. Nor had
                    she any support to look for from her pusillanimous father, who hastened to make
                    terms for himself,—a matter the less difficult that his known faithlessness had
                    prevented the chiefs of the Fronde from engaging him at all deeply in their
                    schemes. Mademoiselle, on the other hand, was for some years in disgrace, and
                    resided on her estates. It was not till 1657 that she reappeared at court, but,
                    though projects for marrying her were once more set on foot, she was now past
                    her first youth. Her incurable self-will, moreover, still stood in her way, and
                    suitor after suitor was rejected for reasons good or bad. She was nearly forty,
                    and had already corresponded seriously with Madame de Motteville on the project
                    of establishing a ladies’ society “sans mariage et sans amour,” when a young
                    Gascon gentleman named Puyguilhem, afterwards celebrated as Μ. de Lauzun,
                    attracted her attention. It was some years before the affair came to a crisis,
                    but at last, in 1670, Mademoiselle solemnly demanded the king’s permission to
                    marry Lauzun. Madame de Sévigné’s letter on this occasion is one of the most
                    famous of her collection. Louis, who liked Lauzun, and who had been educated by
                    Mazarin in the idea that Mademoiselle ought not to be allowed to xarry her vast
                    estates and royal blood to any one who was himself of the blood-royal, or even
                    to any foreign prince, gave his consent, but it was not immediately acted on.
                    The pride of the other members of the royal family, and the spite of the king’s
                    brother, Monsieur, who had, after the death of Henrietta of England, made offers
                    to his cousin, prevailed with Louis to rescind his permission. Not long
                    afterwards Lauzun, for another cause, was imprisoned in Pignerol, and it was
                    years before Mademoiselle was able to buy his release from the king by settling
                    no small portion of her estates on Louis’s bastards. The elderly lovers (for in
                    1681, when Lauzun was released, he was nearly fifty, and Mademoiselle was
                    fifty-four) were then secretly married, if indeed they had not gone through the
                    ceremony ten years previously. But Lauzun, a coarse and brutal adventurer,
                    tyrannized over his wife, and her spirit, which was yet unbroken, at length got
                    the better of her passion. It is said that on one occasion he addressed her
                    thus, “Louise d’Orléans, tire-moi mes bottes,” and that she at once and finally
                    separated from him. She lived, however, for some years after he had achieved his
                    last adventure (that of assisting the family of James II. to escape from
                    England, and attempting to defend their cause in Ireland), gave herself to
                    religious duties, and finished her <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> which extend
                    to within seven years of her death (9th April 1693), and which she had begun
                    when she was in disgrace thirty years earlier. These <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi> (Amsterdam, 1729) are of very considerable merit and interest,
                    though, or perhaps because, they are extremely egotistical and often extremely
                    desultory. Mademoiselle writes without art, but with the hereditary ability of
                    her family, and the strongly personal view which she takes of public events is
                    rather an advantage than a disadvantage. They are to be found in the great
                    collection of Michaud and Poujoulat, and have been frequently edited apart. <hi
