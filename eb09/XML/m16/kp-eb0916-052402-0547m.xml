                <p><label type="entry">MISSOURI</label>, a Central State of the American Union,
                    lying almost midway between the Atlantic and the Rocky Mountains, British
                    America and the Gulf of Mexico. Its eastern boundary is the Mississippi,
                    separating it from Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee. North and south its
                    boundaries with Iowa and Arkansas respectively are mainly coincident with the
                    parallels of 40° 30' and 36° 30' N. lat.; but a small peninsula between the
                    Mississippi and St François rivers stretches 34 miles farther south between
                    Arkansas and Tennessee. The western border, with Nebraska, Kansas, and the
                    Indian Territory, is nearly coincident with the course of the Missouri to the
                    junction of that stream with the Kansas, and then follows the meridian of 17°
                    40' W. of Washington (94° 43' W. of Greenwich). The area of the State is 65,350
                    square miles, the extreme length from north to south 282 miles, the extreme
                    width 348 miles. Missouri is divided into a northern and southern portion by the
                    Missouri river, flowing 400 miles in a generally easterly direction from its
                    junction with the Kansas to the point 12 miles above St Louis where it unites
                    wnth the Mississippi. Northern Missouri has a surface broken and hilly, but not
                    mountainous. It is mainly prairie land, well watered by streams, and fit for
                    agriculture; but there is a good deal of timber in the eastern parts, especially
                    along the bold bluffs of the two great rivers. Southern Missouri is almost
                    equally divided between timber land in the east and prairie in the west. In its
                    south-western portion rises the table-land of the Ozark hills (highest point
                    1600 feet above the sea). The Osage, the Gasconade, and other streams flow
                    northward and eastward into the Missouri. The south-eastern lowlands form an
                    undulating country, readily drained after rain, with fertile ridges generally
                    running north and south, occasional abrupt isolated hills, forests of oak,
                    hickory, elm, maple, ash, locust, willow, persimmon, pecan, chestnut, and cherry
                    trees, and in the lowest parts swamps and morasses. High rocky bluffs extend
                    along the banks of the Mississippi from the mouth of the Meramec river to Ste
                    Genevieve, rising sometimes precipitously to the height of 350 feet above the
                    water, and low bottom lands with many lakes and lagoons extend from Ste
                    Genevieve to the Arkansas border. The south-east corner of the State is 275 feet
                    above the sea, the north-east corner 445 feet, and the north-west corner 1000
                    feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of Missouri, lying as it does far
                    from the ocean and unprotected by mountain ranges, is one of extremes in heat
                    and cold, moisture and drought. The Ozark range is high enough to influence the
                    climate locally, but not to affect that of the whole State. The mean summer
                    temperature for the ten years 1870-80 ranged from 75° in the north-west of the
                    State to 78° ’ 5 in the south-east; but the thermometer has been known to rise
                    to 104°. The winter temperature averaged 33° ’ 87 for the whole State, varying
                    from 28°'5 in the north-west to 39° <hi rend="italic">'5</hi> in the south-east.
                    In some winters the temperature hardly falls to zero; in others 20° below zero
                    have been registered. The Mississippi at St Louis freezes over once in four or
                    five years; but this is partly caused by the accumulations of floating ice
                    coming down from the north. The river has closed as early as the first week in
                    December, and, again, has remained open until the last week in February. It is
                    in cold seasons sometimes passable for the heaviest teams. The Missouri river is
                    often closed during the whole winter. The mean annual temperature of the State
                    varies from 53° to 58°. The climate is, on the whole, dry <hi rend="italic">;
                    for,</hi> in spite of the abundant rains, especially in the spring, evaporation
                    is so rapid that the atmosphere is rarely overloaded with moisture. April is the
                    driest month. The greatest amount of rain falls in the south-eastern part of the
                    State. An unusual amount of fair weather, prevailing clearness of sky, general
                    salubrity of soil and climate, are chief among the natural advantages of this
                    great State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The stratified rocks of
                    Missouri belong to the following divisions :—Quaternary, Tertiary,
                    Carboniferous, Devonian, Silurian, and Archaean. The Quaternary system comprises
                    the drift, 155 feet thick; the bluff, 200 feet above the drift; then the bottom
                    prairie, 35 feet thick · and on the surface the alluvium, 30 feet in thickness.
                    Clays with strata of sands, marls, and humus form the alluvial bottoms of the
                    two great rivers of the State, and make up a soil deep, light, and incomparably
                    rich. Beneath the alluvium is found the bottom prairie, made up also of sands,
                    clays, and vegetable moulds. This formation is found only in the bottom lands of
                    the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and more abundantly in those of the former.
                    Numerous and well-preserved organic remains are found in the bottom prairie, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n550/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0550-0525"/> including the shells found in great quantities in
                    the bluff and remains of the mastodon and many trees and plants. Below this
                    formation, resting upon the drift, is the bluff. This rests upon the ridges and
                    river bluffs, and thus is topographically higher, although geologically lower,
                    than the bottom prairie. It is composed chiefly of a grey siliceous marl,
                    coloured sometimes to a deep brown or red by the stains of oxide of iron. This
                    formation extends along the bluffs of the Missouri from Fort Union to its mouth,
                    and is found capping those of the Mississippi from Dubuque to the mouth of the
                    Ohio. It is sometimes 200 feet thick; at St Joseph it is 140, at Booneville 100,
                    at St Louis 50, in Marion county only 30 feet. This formation has interesting
                    fossils <hi rend="italic">(Elephas primigenius,</hi> &lt;fcc.). The drift, the
                    lowest of the Quaternary system, appears in the altered drift, the boulder
                    formation, made up largely of the igneous and metamorphic rocks, with rocks from
                    the Palaeozoic strata upon which the others rest. Large boulders, five or six
                    feet in diameter, are found, usually of granite or metamorphic sandstone; no
                    fossils except a few logs in the altered drift have been found in this
                    formation. The Tertiary formation in Missouri is composed of clays, shales, iron
                    ores, sandstone, and sand, and extends along the bluffs and bottoms of the
                    south-east part of the State. Iron ore is found in this formation in great
                    abundance; sand of the best quality for glass-making and clays for pottery and
                    stoneware also abound. Below the Tertiary bed are found rocks which strongly
                    resemble Cretaceous beds found in other places in the United States. These
                    strata are in such a state of irregularity and disturbance as to indicate the
                    occurrence of some great movements after their deposition and before the
                    formation of the Tertiary strata. The Upper Carboniferous system, or coal
                    measures, made up of sandstone, limestone, marl, coal, and iron ores, covers an
                    area of more than 23,000 square miles in Missouri, occupying the western and
                    northern portions of the State. The supply of bituminous and cannel coals found
                    here would seem to be well-nigh inexhaustible. In the Lower Carboniferous rock
                    are found many varieties of limestone and sandstone. Among these are the Upper
                    Archimedes Limestone, 200 feet; Ferruginous Sandstone, 195 feet; Middle
                    Archimedes Limestone, 50 feet; St Louis Limestone, 250 feet. The Devonian system
                    is represented by limestone in Marion, Ralls, Pike, Callaway, Saline, and Ste
                    Genevieve counties, among which occur the Chouteau Limestone, 85 feet;
                    Lithographic Limestone, 125 feet; Onondaga Limestone, 100 feet. Of the Upper
                    Silurian series are the following formations:—Lower Helderberg, 350 feet;
                    Niagara Group, 200 feet; Cape Girardeau Limestone, 60 feet. Prominent among the
                    Lower Silurian formations are the Trenton Limestone, 360 feet; the Black River
                    and Bird’s Eye Limestone; and the Magnesian series. The last-named series is
                    valuable both in a scientific and an economic sense. It covers much of the
                    southern and south-eastern portions of the State, and in it are found vast
                    deposits of lead, zinc, copper, cobalt, iron ores, and marble. The Archaean
                    rocks occur below the Silurian deposits, and contain siliceous and other slates
                    in which no fossils are found. The porphyry rocks of this formation also contain
                    iron ores.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coal.—</hi> The exposed coal in Missouri includes upper,
                    middle, and lower measures. In the first are about 4 feet of coal, and the area
                    of exposure is about 8400 square miles. The middle coal measures contain about 7
                    feet of coal, and cover an exposed area of about 2000 square miles. The lower
                    measures have five workable seams, varying from 18 inches in thickness to 4 A
                    feet, and also some thin seams of only a few inches. In 1880 556,304 bushels of
                    bituminous coal were raised in thirty-five counties of Missouri, the value at
                    the pit mouth being $1,060,225. $642,772 were paid in wages to 2599 persons. The
                    Missouri coal mines are easily worked.</p>
                <p>Aon.—The iron ores are red haematite, red oxide, specular iron, brown haematite
                    or limonite, and clay ironstone. Manganiferous and siliceous specular ores occur
                    in the porphyries of the Archaean rocks, and in the granites. The greatest
                    exposure of specular iron yet discovered is Iron Mountain, the purest mass or
                    body of iron ore known. Analysis shows it to contain from 65 to 69 per cent, of
                    metallic iron. The ore of Shepherd Mountain is not so rich as that of Iron
                    Mountain, but is uniform in character, free from sulphur and phosphoric acid and
                    on the whole superior to any other yet developed in Missouri. Pilot Knob ore
                    gives 53 to 60 per cent, metallic iron, and has few deleterious substances. It
                    is fine-grained, light bluish grey in colour. The ore of the Scotia iron banks
                    and Iron Ridge are much alike in appearance and character, being specular
                    boulders imbedded in soft red haematite. In some of these boulders are cavities
                    in which the ore has taken botryoidal form, and upon these peroxide of iron
                    crystallizations are so formed that a gorgeous show of prismatic colours is
                    presented. The above are the chief deposits of iron ores, but limonites are
                    found mostly in the southern parts of the State. The counties of Ste Genevieve,
                    Madison, St François, Capo Girardeau, Bollinger, Wayne, Stoddard, Washington,
                    Reynolds, Shannon, Carter, and Ripley have the greatest exposures of these ores,
                    although they are found in many others. The supply of iron ores is, indeed,
                    practically inexhaustible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lead.—</hi> Second only to iron among the metals of Missouri is
                    the vast deposit of lead found in the southern parts of the State. The great
                    disseminated lead region occupies about one-half of the northern portion of
                    Madison, and about as much of St François county. It is in the magnesian
                    limestone that the largest quantities have been found. In Franklin county galena
                    is found in abundance in ferruginous clay and coarse gravel. In the great
                    mammoth mine in Washington county is a succession of caves in which millions of
                    pounds of lead were found adhering to the sides and roofs. The central lead
                    district of the State comprises the counties of Cole, Cooper, Moniteau, Morgan,
                    Miller, Benton, Maries, Camden, and Osage; the southern lead region the counties
                    of Pulaski, Laclede, Texas, Wright, Webster, Douglass, Ozark, and Christian. The
                    western lead district includes the counties of Hickory, Dallas, Polk, St Clair,
                    Cedar, and Dade; the south-western the counties of Jasper, Newton, Lawrence,
                    Stone, Barry, and Μ‘Donald. The two counties Jasper and Newton produce fully
                    one-half of the pig lead of Missouri. The lead mines of Granby are among the
                    best-known in the State, and millions of pounds of lead have been taken from
                    these lands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Copper</hi> deposits have been found in several counties,
                    chiefly in the south-western part of the State. <hi rend="italic">Zinc</hi> is
                    found, in the shape of sulphuret and also silicate of zinc, in nearly all the
                    lead mines in south-western Missouri. It has often occurred in such masses as
                    seriously to hinder mining operations, and until very recent years, when
                    railroad facilities have given this ore a market, it was thrown aside as
                    worthless. It is now an important and profitable adjunct of the lead mines of
                    Missouri. <hi rend="italic">Cobalt</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nickel</hi> are
                    found at Mine La Motte and in a few other places. <hi rend="italic">Silver</hi>
                    is found in small quantities in lead mines in Madison county, combined with the
                    lead.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Clays</hi> for the manufacture of ordinary brick for building
                    purposes and for fire-brick exist in quantities beyond computation, and kaolin
                    has been found in a few places. <hi rend="italic">Marble of</hi> various shades
                    and qualities abounds in Missouri, and is an important item in its mineral
                    wealth. <hi rend="italic">Limestones</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sandstones</hi>
                    suitable for building purposes are found in many parts of the State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Indian corn, wheat, oats, and tobacco are
                    the staple products; but cotton, hemp, and flax are also raised to some extent
                    in the southern counties. The average yield of wheat to the acre is 30 bushels,
                    and that return is often far exceeded. No flour is of a higher quality or more
                    in demand in foreign as well as home markets than that made from Missouri wheat.
                    Indian corn is especially used in fattening live stock. Blue grass, timothy,
                    red-top, and red and white clover grow luxuriantly, and favour stock-raising. In
                    some parts of the State pasturage can be had all the year round, and the
                    cheapness of corn makes the raising of pork, in particular, a very profitable
                    business. All varieties of fruit can be very successfully cultivated. The more
                    tender fruits, such as apricots, nectarines, figs, and many choice kinds of
                    grapes, grow here as well as the more northern fruits—the apple, the pear, the
                    plum, and the cherry. Apples and peaches do well in all parts of the State. Six
                    native varieties of grapes are found in luxuriant growth, and many cultivated
                    varieties have been successfully introduced. No State, not even California, can
                    hope ultimately to rival Missouri in the production of both red and λvhite
                    wines. Sheep-raising has proved remunerative in the southern counties chiefly,
                    where the mild climate, the fine grasses, and the abundance of good water are
                    especially favourable to this branch of agricultural industry. There are in
                    Missouri, in round numbers, 10,000,000 acres of improved and 13,000,000 of
                    unimproved land, including 9,000,000 acres of woodland. The cash value of the
                    farms is estimated at $90,000,000. In 1880 there were on the farms in the State
                    667,776 horses, 192,027 mules and asses, 9020 oxen, 661,405 cows, 1,410,507
                    other cattle, 1,411,298 sheep, and 4,553,123 swine. Missouri is the fourth
                    maize-producing State of the Union; it supplies more wine than any State except
                    California, and is a rival of Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland in the

                    central part of the State, bordering upon the Missouri river. No State raises so
                    many mules, asses, and hogs. The production of cereals in 1880 was—corn,
                    202,485,723 bushels; wheat, 24,966,627 bushels; rye, 535,426bushels; oats,
                    20,670,958bushels; barley, 123,031 bushels; buckwheat, 57,640 bushels. The
                    production of tobacco for the same year was 12,015,657 tt&gt; from 15,521 acres,
                    valued at $600,256. Three-fourths of this amount was raised in Chariton, Marion,
                    Randolph, Howard, Callaway, and Saline counties.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wild Animals.—</hi> Red-deer are found in every part of the
                    State, especially in the thinly-settled and mountainous districts. Venison,
                    indeed, in its season, is as cheap as good beef in the markets of St Louis. Wild
                    turkeys are numerous in the swampy and mountainous districts, and are found in
                    all parts of the State. Prairie chickens, or pinnated grouse, are found in the
                    prairie portion of Missouri, and are shipped in great numbers to Eastern
                    markets. In all parts of Missouri are found the quail or Virginia partridge,
                    thousands of barrels of which are shipped from the State each season. The
                    rabbit, a species of hare, is so common as to be considered a pest. The grey
                    squirrel and the red fox-squirrel are also found in large numbers all over the
                    State. Black bass, perch, catfish, buffalo fish, suckers, and pike are the
                    leading varieties of native fish.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> In 1880 Missouri had about 20,000.
                    manufacturing establishments, in which a capital of about $125,000,000
                    was-employed. The products of these establishments were valued at upwards of
                    $300,000,000. The leading manufacturing counties outside of the city of St Louis
                    are Jackson, Buchanan, St Charles, Marion, Franklin, Greene, Cape Girardeau,
                    Platte, Boone, and Lafayette; but more than three-fourths of the manufactures
                    are produced at St Louis, which is the fourth manufacturing city of the Union.
                    The chief manufacture is that of flour, which employs about 900 mills, and is
                    rapidly increasing. Twenty-four mills made in St Louis, in 1880, 2,142,949
                    barrels of flour, having a daily output of more than 11,000 barrels. St Louis
                    millers and dealers sentin 1880 to Europe and South America 619,103 barrels of
                    flour; and at the world’s fairs at Paris, Vienna, and Philadelphia, Missouri
                    flour received the first award. The iron industry, which stands second in
                    importance, is yet only in its infancy, and St Louis seems destined to be one of
                    the great centres of iron and steel manufacture. The amount of iron made in
                    Missouri in 1880, in twenty-two establishments employing 3139 hands, was 125,758
                    tons. St Louis made the same year 102,664 tons of pig-iron, steel, and rolled
                    iron and blooms. The yearly values of a number of other industries are estimated
                    as follows:—meat packing, $20,000,000; lumber, $10,000,000; bags and bagging,
                    $7,000,000; saddlery, $7,000,000; oil, $6,000,000; printing and publishing,
                    $5,500,000; furniture, $5,000,000; carriages and waggons, $4,500,000; marble and
                    stone, $4,000,000; tin, copper, and sheet-iron, $4,000,000; agricultural
                    implements, $2,000,000. The manufacture of glass and glass-ware is carried on to
                    a considerable extent, especially in St Louis. At Crystal City, on the
                    Mississippi, 30 miles below St Louis, is a very large deposit of sand suitable
                    for the manufacture of plate-glass, and a company has been organized and is now
                    in successful operation, with a capital of $1,000,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> The extensive commerce of Missouri centres at
                    St Louis, between which city and the ports on the Mississippi and Missouri
                    rivers steamboats are constantly plying. Railroad transportation has, in recent
                    years, furnished superior and cheaper facilities for much of the trade which
                    formerly depended upon the rivers. The trade in cotton especially has been
                    greatly increased in Missouri since 1870 by the use of railroad transportation,
                    which has made St Louis one of the great cotton centres of the United States.
                    Extensive cotton presses were built in St Louis in that year, and the receipts
                    of cotton from the more southern States has increased rapidly—from 12,264 bales
                    in 1869-70 to 457,563 bales in 1879-80. Railroad connexions have made the
                    interior portions of Arkansas and Texas more accessible to St Louis than to the
                    southern ports of shipment, and the trade with the south-west, with the Indians,
                    and with Mexico is constantly increasing. In 1870 St Louis was made by Act of
                    Congress a port of entry to which foreign merchandise could be brought in bond.
                    The value of the direct imports for the year ending 30th June 1882 was
                    $1,934,342.</p>

                <p>In 1880 the foreign-born residents numbered 211,578, or 9’7 per cent., of whom
                    109,974 were Germans and Scandinavians; there were also 145,046 of African
                    descent. The early settlers of the State were French, and their descendants are
                    still found in St Louis and Ste Genevieve and a few other smaller towns. Many
                    Germans have recently settled in all parts of the State, while English, Irish,
                    Scotch, and Swedes have also made Missouri their home in considerable numbers.
                    The native American population is mostly descended from immigrants from the
                    States of Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. During recent years
                    there has been a large accession to the population from the eastern and
                    north-western States.</p>
                <p>St Louis, the chief city of the Mississippi valley, situated upon the Mississippi
                    river about 12 miles below the mouth of the Missouri, has a population of
                    350,518; Kansas City, a thriving town on the western border, situated on the
                    banks of the Missouri, has 55,785; St Joseph, in the north-west, has 32,431;
                    Hannibal, in the north-east, has 11,074; and Jefferson City (the State capital),
                    in the centre, has 5271.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> Missouri has a public school system of
                    education first adopted in 1839. There are district schools, elementary and
                    ungraded; city schools, graded, with high school courses; four normal schools,
                    and a State university. Free public schools for white and coloured children
                    between the ages of six and twenty years are required by law for every district
                    in the State. Besides these public institutions supported by the State there are
                    many private schools and colleges for both sexes. Chief among these are the St
                    Louis University, an institution managed by the Jesuits; the College of
                    Christian Brothers, also under the control of the Roman Catholics; and
                    Washington University, a non-sectarian endowed school, which has property
                    estimated at $1,000,000, and more than 1300 students. The Baptists have a
                    college at Liberty called William Jewell College; the Congregationalists one at
                    Springfield called Drury College; and the Methodists and Presbyterians several

                    Catholics, and in the river towns may be found to-day a large number of that

                    96,270 members and 918 churches; the Protestant Episcopal Church, 25,000 members
                    and 65 church buildings; the Presbyterians, with their various branches, 34,628
                    members and 706 churches.</p>

                    two years, on the Wednesday after the first day of January next after the
                    election of the members thereof. Members of the legislature are paid a sum not
                    to exceed $5 a day for the first seventy days of the session, and after that not
                    to exceed $1 a day for the remainder of the session. They are also allowed
                    mileage. The executive department consists of a governor, a lieutenant-governor,
                    a secretary of state, a State auditor, State treasurer, an attorney-general, and
                    a superintendent of public instruction; these are all elected by the people. The
                    supreme executive power is vested in the governor, who is chosen for four years,
                    as also are the other members of this department. The governor has a qualified
                    veto upon the acts of the legislature, and such other powers as are common to
                    that officer in the several States. The judicial power of the State is lodged in
                    a supreme court, the St Louis court of appeals, circuit courts, criminal courts,
                    probate courts, and municipal courts. All judicial officers are elected by the
                    people. Judges of the supreme court are elected for ten years, those of the St
                    Louis court of appeals for twelve years, those of the circuit courts for six
                    years. Executive and judicial officers are liable to impeachment by the house of
                    representatives. All impeachment cases are tried by the senate.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> On the 9th April 1682, the French voyager and
                    discoverer La Salle took possession of the country of Louisiana in the name of
                    the king of France. Its limits were quite indefinite, and included the present
                    territory of Missouri (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Louisiana).</hi> The first
                    settlements of Missouri were made in Ste Genevieve and' at New Bourbon, but
                    uncertainty exists as to the exact date. By some the year is fixed at 1763; by
                    others, and by many traditions, as early as 1735. St Louis was settled by Pierre
                    Laclede Liguest, a native of France. The site was chosen in 1763, and in
                    February 1764 Auguste Chouteau went at the order of Liguest to the spot
                    previously selected, and built a small village. For a long time the settlements
                    were confined to the neighbourhood of the river. On the 31st of October 1803 the
                    Congress of the United States passed an Act by which the president was
                    authorized to take possession of the territory according to the treaty of Paris,
                    and the formal transfer of Lower Louisiana was made on 20th December <pb

                    two portions. The northern part, commonly called Upper Louisiana, was taken
                    jκ&gt;ssession of in March 1804. In June 1812 Missouri was organized as a
                    Territory, with a governor and general assembly. The first governor (1813-1820)
                    was William Clarke. In 1818 Missouri applied for admission to the Union as a
                    State. Two years of bitter controversy followed, which convulsed the country and
                    threatened the dissolution of the Union. This controversy followed a resolution
                    introduced into Congress which had in view an anti-slavery restriction upon the
                    admission of Missouri to the Union. This was at last settled by the adoption of
                    the “Missouri compromise,” which forbade slavery in all that portion of the
                    Louisiana purchase lying north of 36° 30' except in Missouri, and on 19th July
                    1820 Missouri was admitted to the Union. A convention to frame a constitution
                    had already been called, and the constitution then adopted remained without
                    material change until 1865. The first general assembly under the constitution
                    met in St Louis in September 1820, and Alexander Μ‘Nair was chosen governor in
                    August. The seat of government was fixed at St Charles in 1820, and removed to
                    Jefferson City, the present State capital, in 1826. The first census of the
                    State was taken in 1821, when the number of inhabitants was found to be 70,647,
                    of whom 11,254 were slaves. In the Black Hawk war in 1832, the Florida war in
                    1837, and the Mexican war in 1846 Missouri volunteer troops did their share of
                    the work. In the troubles in Kansas, and the bitter discussion upon the question
                    of slavery, Missouri was deeply involved. A strong feeling in favour of
                    secession showed itself in many parts of the State. Governor Jackson, in his
                    inaugural address on the 4th of January 1861, said that Missouri must stand by
                    the slaveholding States, whatever might be their course. The election of a
                    majority of Union men, however, as delegates to a convention called to consider
                    the affairs of the nation, showed that public sentiment was hostile to
                    secession, and the convention adjourned without committing the State to the
                    secession party. United States troops were soon gathered at St Louis, and forces
                    were also sent to Jefferson City, and to Rolla. Governor Jackson fled from the
                    capital, and summoned all the State troops to meet him at Booneville. General
                    Lyon defeated these troops, 17th June 1861, and soon most of the State was under
                    the control of the United States forces. The State convention was reassembled.
                    This body declared vacant the offices of governor, lieutenant-governor, and
                    secretary of state, and filled them by appointment. The seats of the members of
                    the legislature were also declared vacant. Governor Jackson soon issued a
                    proclamation declaring the State out of the Union, and Confederate forces were
                    assembled in large numbers in the south-western part of the State. General Lyon
                    was killed at the battle of Wilson’s Creek near Springfield, and General
                    Fremont, commanding the department of the west, decreed martial law throughout
                    the State. For a year matters were favourable to the Confederates, and at the
                    opening of 1862 their troops held nearly half the State; but in February a
                    Federal force under General Curtis drove General Price into Arkansas. He
                    returned in 1864, and overran a large part of the State, but was finally forced
                    to retreat, and but little further trouble arose in Missouri during the war.
                    Missouri furnished to the United States army during the war 108,773 troops. In
                    1865 a new constitution was adopted by the people. In 1869 the XV. Amendment to
                    the United States constitution was adopted by a large majority. In 1875 still
                    another State constitution was drawn up by a convention called for that purpose,
                    and ratified by the people, and is now the fundamental law of the State. (Μ. S.
