                <p><label type="entry">MOBILE</label>, a city and port of entry of the United
                    States, the capital of Mobile county, and, though not the capital, the largest
                    city of Alabama, lies 140 miles east of New Orleans, on a sandy plain on the
                    west bank of Mobile river, one of the arms of the Alabama. The municipal
                    boundary includes an area about 6 miles long by 2 or 3 in breadth; but,
                    excluding the suburban villas scattered about the nearer hills, the portion
                    occupied by the buildings of the city proper is not more than a mile square. In
                    the matter of paving and shade the streets are generally good, and Government
                    Street especially, with its fine oak trees and gardens, forms an attractive
                    promenade. Besides the spacious granite building erected in 1859 to accommodate
                    the Custom-House, the Post Office, and the United States courts, the principal
                    edifices are the Roman Catholic cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (1833),
                    Christ Church (Episcopal) (1837), the City Hospital (1830), the United States
                    Marine Hospital (1836), the Providence Infirmary, the conjoint market-house and
                    municipal buildings, Barton Academy (occupied by the high schools), and the
                    Alabama Medical College (founded in 1859). About 6 miles out, at Spring Hill, is
                    the Jesuit College of St Joseph, established by Bishop Portier in 1832. As a
                    commercial centre Mobile is in some respects very favourably situated. It is the
                    only port of Alabama; the estuary on which it stands is the outlet for several
                    navigable rivers; and it is the seaward terminus of the Mobile and Ohio
                    railroad, the Mobile and Montgomery, and the Grand Trunk. But, on the other
                    hand, it lies 25 miles from the coast; the lagoon-like bay cut off from the Gulf
                    of Mexico by the narrow isthmus of Mobile Point is extremely shallow; and in
                    1879 no vessel drawing more than 13 feet could load and unload in the harbour
                    with safety. Since 1827, it is true, various works have been undertaken to
                    improve the approaches: the Choctaw Pass and the Dog River Bar, which had
                    formerly a depth of little more than 5 and 8 feet respectively, were deepened to
                    17 feet by 1882; but Mobile will not take rank as a satisfactory ocean port till
                    the scheme (now in operation) for constructing a wide channel more than 20 feet
                    deep right through the bay has been fully carried out. The cost of the necessary
                    works being beyond the power both of the city and State, Congress has granted
                    .$270,000 for the purpose of widening the channel to 200 feet, and deepening it
                    to 23 feet. A private company, established in 1876, has built a breakwater in
                    the bay, and greatly increased the safety of the harbour. For the years between
                    1855 and 1859 the average value of exports and imports was respectively <pb

                <p>In cotton, which forms the staple export, the falling off is particularly
                    noticeable, 632,308 bales being the average for 1855 to 1859, and 365,945,
                    392,319, and 265,040 bales the quantities for 1879, 1880, and 1881, A great deal
                    of what comes to the Mobile market is sent to New Orleans for shipment, partly
                    that it may obtain a higher price as “Orleans” cotton. Lumber shingles,
                    turpentine and rosin, fish and oysters, and coal, are also important items, but
                    do not make in the aggregate so much as half the value of the cotton. Among the
                    local industrial establishments are several spinning-mills, breweries,
                    cooperages, shipbuilding yards, foundries, and sash and door works. The market
                    gardeners of the outskirts produce a large quantity of cabbages, potatoes,
                    watermelons, tomatoes, &amp;c., to supply the cities of the western and northern
                    States (value in 1879, §112,520; 1880, $174,483; 1881, $159,706; 1882, $367,194;
                    1883, estimated $700,000). Though in 1820 it had no more than 2672 inhabitants,
                    Mobile had 31,255 in 1880; the figures for the intermediate decades being 3194
                    (1830), 12,672 (1840), 20,515 (1850), 29,258 (1860), and 32,034 (1870).</p>
                <p>Founded as a fort by Lemoyne d’Iberville (de Bienville) in 1702, Mobile continued
                    to be the capital of the colony of Louisiana till 1723, when this rank was
                    transferred to New Orleans. The site selected by Lemoyne was probably about 20
                    miles above the present position, which was first occupied after the floods of
                    1711. By the Treaty of Paris, 1763, Mobile and part of Louisiana were ceded to
                    Britain; but in 1780 the fort (now Fort Charlotte) was captured by the Spanish
                    general Galvez, and in 1783 it was recognized as Spanish along with other
                    British possessions on the Gulf of Mexico. General Wilkinson, ex-governor of
                    Louisiana, recovered the town for Louisiana in 1813, and in 1819, though its
                    population did not exceed 2500, it was incorporated as a city. In 1864-65 Mobile
                    and the neighbourhood was the scene of important military and naval engagements.
                    The Confederates had surrounded the city by three lines of defensive works, but
                    the defeat of their fleet by Admiral Farragut, and the capture of Fort Morgan,
                    Spanish Fort, and Fort Blakelly, led to its immediate evacuation. As a municipal
                    corporation, Mobile had got into such financial difficulties by 1879 that its
                    city charter was repealed, and a board of commissioners established for the
                    liquidation of its debt of $2,497,856.</p>
