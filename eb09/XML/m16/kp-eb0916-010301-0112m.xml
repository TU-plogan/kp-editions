                    Graecia situated on the Gulf of Tarentum, near the mouth of the river Bradanus,
                    and distant about 24 miles from Tarentum and 14 from Heraclea. It was founded by
                    an Achaean colony about 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> though various
                    traditions existed which assigned it an earlier origin. But according to the
                    only historical account it was a joint foundation from Sybaris and Crotona, to
                    which, as usual in similar cases, was joined a body of fresh settlers from the
                    mother country, under the command of a leader named Leucippus. The object of its
                    establishment was without doubt to strengthen the Achaean element in Magna
                    Graecia, as opposed to the increasing power of the Tarentines, but at the same
                    time to occupy a territory which was remarkable for its fertility. It was to
                    this cause that Metapontum owed the great prosperity to which it attained at an
                    early period, and appears to have continued to enjoy for several centuries,
                    though it never assumed a prominent place in history. It was, however, one of
                    the cities that played a conspicuous part in the political troubles arising from
                    the introduction of the Pythagorean principles into the cities of Magna Graecia,
                    and it was there that the philosopher himself ended his days. His tomb was still
                    shown there in the time of Cicero.</p>
                <p>At the time of the Athenian expedition to Sicily (415 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) Metapontum appears to have been an opulent and powerful city, whose
                    alliance was courted by the Athenians; but they contented themselves with a very
                    trifling support. In 332 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> at the time of the
                    expedition of Alexander, king of Epirus, into Italy, it was one of the first
                    cities to espouse his cause, and enter into an alliance with him; and they
                    appear to have in like manner lent an active support to Pyrrhus at a later
                    period. Down to this time, therefore, Metapontum seems to have retained its
                    position as one of the principal cities of Magna Graecia, and there is no
                    evidence of its having suffered materially from the establishment of the
                    Lucanians in its immediate neighbourhood. Nor have we any account of the precise
                    period at which it passed under the dominion of Rome, or the conditions under
                    which it became subject to the great republic. But it was the Second Punic War
                    which gave the fatal blow to its prosperity. After the battle of Cannae in 216
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it was among the first cities in the south of
                    Italy to declare in favour of Hannibal, and after the fall of Tarentum in 212
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it not only received a Carthaginian garrison, but
                    became for some years the headquarters of Hannibal. Hence, when the defeat of
                    Hasdrubal at the Metaurus (207 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> compelled him to
                    abandon this part of Italy, and withdraw into the fastnesses of Bruttium, the
                    whole mass of the inhabitants of Metapontum abandoned their city, and followed
                    him in his retreat.</p>
                <p>From this time Metapontum sunk into a poor and inconsiderable town; though it was
                    still existing as such in the days of Cicero, it soon fell into complete decay,
                    and Pausanias tells us that in his time nothing remained of it but a theatre and
                    the circuit of the walls. All remains of these have since disappeared, but the
                    site is still marked by the ruins of a temple, which occupy a slight elevation
                    on the right bank of the river Bradanus, about 2 miles from its mouth. The
                    surrounding plain, so celebrated in ancient times for its fertility, is now
                    desolated by malaria, and almost uninhabited; and the remains of the city
                    itself, between the site of the temple and the sea, are in great part buried in
                    the alluvial deposits of the neighbouring rivers.</p>
                <p>Some excavations were carried on upon the spot by the Due de Luynes in 1858, and
                    the results of his researches were published by him in a special work <hi
