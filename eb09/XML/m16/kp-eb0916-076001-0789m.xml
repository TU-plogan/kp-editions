                <p><label type="entry">MONROE, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label> (1758-1831),
                    fifth president of the United States, was born 28th April 1758, in the county of
                    Westmoreland, Virginia. According to the family tradition, their ancestors are
                    traced back to a family of Scottish cavaliers descended from Hector Monroe, an
                    officer of Charles I. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary war, James Monroe was
                    a student at the College of William and Mary, but left his studies in 1776 to
                    join the continental army. He took part as lieutenant in the New Jersey campaign
                    of that year, and was wounded at the battle of Trenton. The next year he served
                    with the rank of captain on the staff of General William Alexander (“Lord
                    Stirling”), but, thus being out of the line of promotion, he soon found himself
                    without military employment. In 1780 he began the study of the law under the
                    direction of J efferson, then governor of Virginia. His intimacy with Jefferson
                    at this time had probably a controlling influence upon his subsequent political
                    career. He continued through all vicissitudes to possess the friendship and
                    support of both Jefferson and Madison.</p>
                <p>In 1782 Monroe was in the State legislature, and from 1783 to 1786 was a member
                    of Congress. On retiring from Congress he entered upon the practice of the law
                    at Fredericksburg, and was again elected to the legislature. In the Virginia
                    convention of 1788 for the ratification of the constitution, he was among the
                    opponents of that instrument; but his course was approved by the legislature of
                    his State, who elected him United States senator in 1790 to fill the vacancy
                    caused by the death of William Grayson. As senator he was a decided opponent of
                    the Federalist administration. Nevertheless he was selected by Washington in
                    1794 as minister to France in place of Gouverneur Morris, a Federalist, recalled
                    upon the request of the French Government. Being of the party who sympathized
                    with the revolutionary struggle in France, it was expected that his appointment
                    would be flattering to the Government of that country, and would also conciliate
                    the French party at home. The Government of the National Convention received
                    Monroe with open signs of favour, and on his part he expressed his own and his
                    country’s sympathy with the French Republic with so much enthusiasm that
                    Washington deemed his language not in keeping with the neutral policy which the
                    administration had recently proclaimed. At about the same time John Jay had
                    negotiated a treaty of amity and commerce with England which gave great umbrage
                    to France. It was alleged that the earlier treaty of 1778 with France was
                    violated by the stipulations of the Jay treaty; and the Directory seemed
                    disposed to make of this a <hi rend="italic">casus belli.</hi> In this emergency
                    it was believed by Washington and his advisers that Monroe failed to represent
                    properly the policy of the Government, and he was therefore recalled in 1796. In
                    justification of his diplomatic conduct, he published the next year his <hi
                    rend="italic">View,</hi> a pamphlet of 500 pages. In 1799 he became governor of
                    Virginia, and was twice re-elected. In the meantime the Republican party had
                    come into power, with Jefferson as president, and Monroe was again called upon
                    to fill an important diplomatic station. He was commissioned on 10th January
                    1803 to act with Livingston, resident minister at Paris, in negotiating the
                    purchase of New Orleans and the territory embracing the mouth of the
                    Mississippi, which formed a part of the province of Louisiana, recently ceded by
                    Spain to France. In view of the anticipated renewal of hostilities between
                    England and France in 1803, Napoleon was anxious, for a consideration, to part
                    with his new acquisition, which in the event of a war with England he would
                    probably lose by conquest. The American commissioners met therefore with little
                    difficulty in the accomplishment of their object. But, in the absence of
                    instructions, they assumed the responsibility of negotiating the purchase not
                    only of New Orleans but of the entire territory of Louisiana—an event that is
                    hardly second in importance to any in the history of the country. Monroe was
                    next commissioned as minister to England, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n790/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0790-0761"/> to succeed Rufus King, who had resigned. In 1804
                    he undertook a mission to Madrid, with the object of negotiating the purchase of
                    the Floridas; but in this he was unsuccessful, and returned to London in 1805.
                    The next year he was joined in a commission with William Pinkney to negotiate a
                    treaty with England to take the place of the Jay treaty, which expired in that
                    year. Lords Auckland and Howick having been appointed on the part of England, a
                    treaty was concluded on the last day of the year, which was perhaps more
                    favourable to the United States than the Jay treaty; but, like the latter, it
                    contained no provision against the impressment of American seamen. For this
                    reason President Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification,
                    but sent it back for revision. In the meantime Canning had become foreign
                    secretary in place of Fox, and refused to reopen the negotiation. Monroe
                    returned to the United States in 1807, and, as in the case of his first French
                    mission, he drew up a defence of his diplomatic conduct in England. In 1808
                    certain disaffected Republicans attempted to put Monroe forward as the candidate
                    for the presidency, but as Virginia declared in favour of Madison Monroe
                    withdrew his name. In 1810 he was again in the legislature of his native State,
                    and the next year its governor. But in this year he was called from the state to
                    the national councils, superseding Robert Smith as secretary of state in
                    Madison’s cabinet, and took an active part in precipitating the war against
                    England in 1812. On the retirement of Armstrong, after the capture of Washington
                    in 1814, Monroe assumed the duties of the war department in addition to those of
                    the state department, and by his energy and decision infused something of vigour
                    into the conduct of the war. He was elected president in 1816, and was
                    re-elected in 1820 without opposition. The period of his administration
                    (1817-25) has been called “the era of good feeling,” for the reason that the
                    party issues of the past were mostly dead, and new issues had not yet arisen. In
                    the formation of his cabinet Monroe showed the soundness of his judgment,
                    selecting for the leading positions J. Q. Adams, J. C. Calhoun, W. H. Crawford,
                    and William Wirt. With these able advisers he devoted himself to the economic
                    development of the country, which had been so long retardèd by foreign
                    complications. As president, moreover, he was able to accomplish in 1819 the
                    acquisition of the Floridas, which as minister to Spain he had failed to do in
                    1804, and to define the boundary of Louisiana, which he had been the agent in
                    purchasing in 1803. But Monroe is best known to later generations as the author
                    of the so-called “Monroe doctrine,” a declaration inserted in his seventh annual
                    message, 2d December 1823. It was the formulation of the sentiment, then
                    beginning to prevail, that America was for Americans. One of the principles of
                    the neutral policy of the country, which had been established with much
                    difficulty, had been that the United States would not interfere in European
                    politics; and now this policy was held to include the converse as a necessary
                    corollary—that is, that Europe should not interfere in American politics,
                    whether in North America or South America. The occasion of proclaiming this
                    doctrine was the rumoured intervention of the Holy Alliance to aid Spain in the
                    reconquest of her American colonies. President Monroe believed that such a
                    policy entered upon by the allied continental powers of Europe would be
                    dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States; he therefore declared
                    that “we would not view any intervention for the purpose of oppressing them (the
                    Spanish American states) or controlling in any manner their destiny, by any
                    European power, in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly
                    disposition towards the United States.” This declaration, together with the
                    known hostility of England to such a project, was sufficient to prevent further
                    action on the part of the Alliance.</p>
                <p>On the expiration of his presidential term Monroe retired to Oak Hill, his
                    residence in London county, Virginia; but at the time of his death, 4th July
                    1831, he was residing in New York. He was married about 1786, and left two
                    daughters. He was a man of spotless character; and, though not possessing
                    ability of the first order, he ranks high as a wise and prudent statesman. His
