                    company of his master at the siege of Azoff. He formed one of the suite of Peter
                    during his travels, and worked with him at Saardam and Deptford. Throughout his
                    wars with the Swedes, Menshikoff was the companion of the czar, and greatly
                    distinguished himself. For his gallantry at the battle of the Neva, on the 7th
                    of May (o.s.) 1703, he received the order of St Andrew. In 1704 he was made
                    general, and at the request of the czar created a prince of the Holy Roman
                    Empire. His house on the Vasilii-Ostroff was magnificent; there ambassadors were
                    received, and banquets were given gorgeous with gold and silver plate.
                    Unfortunately there is a dark side to the picture, and the favourite was guilty
                    of extortion to such an extent as to bring him under his master’s censure. On
                    the death of Peter the position of Menshikoff became very perilous; his
                    successes had raised about him a host of enemies eager for his downfall. The
                    Golitzins, Dolgoroukis, and all those who formed what may be called the Old
                    Russian party, wished to proclaim the son of Alexis emperor. Those, however,
                    whose aggrandizement was bound up with Peter’s reforms—Menshikoff, Apraksin,
                    Bontourlin, Goloff kin, and others—were in favour of giving the crown to Peter’s
                    widow, who accordingly ascended the throne as Catherine I. During her reign the
                    influence of Menshikoff was unbounded, and he virtually governed the country;
                    but the empress died in 1727, after a reign of two years. She had made a will,
                    no doubt at the instigation of the favourite, to the effect that Peter, her
                    grandson, was to be czar under the guardianship of Menshikoff, whose daughter
                    Mary was to be married to the youthful sovereign. Under pretence of taking care
                    of the young czar, Menshikoff caused him to be removed to his house and
                    surrounded him with his creatures. He was now at the height of his power;
                    foreign ambassadors remarked that even the great Peter himself was never feared
                    so much. The young czar, however, showed no affection for Mary Menshikoff, and
                    the girl was equally apathetic towards her betrothed, being in love with a
                    member of the family of Sapieha at the time her father had forced her into the
                    engagement. The Dolgoroukis used the aversion of the young prince to his <hi
                    rend="italic">fiancee</hi> as a means of creating dislike to the father. A chain
                    of events was gradually leading to the downfall of the favourite. He was soon
                    refused admittance to the summer palace, whither the young czar had retired.
                    Next he was arrested, and so overpowered was he at his disgrace that he had an
                    apoplectic stroke. In vain did he address letters both to the emperor and his
                    sister. Shortly after, by order of the czar, the fallen magnate departed from St
                    Petersburg, but more like a nobleman retiring to his estate than a culprit going
                    into exile. The people regarded him with dislike, and most of them rejoiced over
                    his fall. On his way a courier arrived with orders to take the czar’s ring of
                    betrothal from his daughter Mary and give her back her own, which had been worn
                    by Peter ∏. Menshikoff was not permitted to pass through Moscow, but was
                    conducted to Oranienburg, in the government of Riazan, and there placed under
                    strict surveillance. Soon afterwards the whole family was banished to Siberia,
                    and arrived at Berezoff towards the end of 1727. Menshikoff’s wife died on the
                    journey, and was buried near Kazan. On the arrival of the prisoners they were
                    lodged in a wooden house, consisting of four rooms. But Menshikoff did not long
                    endure the horrors of exile in this inclement region. According to Mannstein, he
                    died (November 12, o.s., 1729) of an apoplectic stroke, because there was no one
                    at Berezoff, as he himself remarked, who understood how to open a vein. The
                    young czar ordered the release from exile of the two remaining children of
                    Menshikoff,—his daughter Mary had died at Berezoff in the same year as her
                    father,—and restored some of their property to them.</p>
