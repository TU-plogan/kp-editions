                    here be added a brief summary of what has been handed down about him. His origin
                    and the history of his childhood can be read in Exod. i., ii. (comp vi. 16 <hi

                    modified in the Jewish Midrash, particularly as we find it in Josephus and

                    her the father of two sons, Gershom and Eliezer (Exod. ii. 21 <hi rend="italic"

                    bondage. With much reluctance he at last accepted this vocation, and, already
                    expected by his brother Aaron and the elders, returned to his people.<note

                    Aaron with him as his interpreter, being himself no orator, but a man of counsel
                    and action, and appeared before Pharaoh to demand of the king in Jehovah’s name
                    permission for the people to go with flocks and herds into the wilderness to
                    celebrate there a festival (the spring festival of the Passover) in honour of
                    their God. Jehovah gave emphasis to the demand by great signs and wonders,—the
                    plagues of Egypt, which have their explanation for the most part in evils to
                    which Egypt is periodically liable, but are treated by Israelite tradition as
                    the weapons of Jehovah in his ever-intensifying conflict with the king and the
                    gods of Egypt. At length, by the slaying of the first-born, the stubbornness of
                    Pharaoh was broken, so that he consented to, and even urged, the departure of
                    the Hebrews. By and by, however, he changed his mind, and, setting out in
                    pursuit of the Hebrews, overtook them at the Red Sea; but Jehovah fought for
                    them, and annihilated Pharaoh’s chariots and all his host. In order to present
                    themselves in proper festal array at the celebration for the sake of which they
                    were going into the wilderness, the Hebrew women had borrowed dresses and
                    ornaments from those of Egypt; the Egyptians could now only blame themselves and
                    their hostile conduct if those articles were not returned.<note anchored="true"

                <p>By the miracle wrought at the Red Sea Moses was pointed out to the Hebrews as the
                    man of God, to whom accordingly they now committed the task of caring for their
                    outward life as well as their spiritual guidance. He led them first to Sinai,
                    where the law was revealed and the worship in connexion with the ark of the
                    covenant instituted. When he had communed face to face with the Godhead for
                    forty days on the holy mountain, the skin of his face shone so that he had to
                    wear a veil (hence the horns, properly rays, on his forehead). Driven from Sinai
                    in consequence of their worship of the golden calf, the Israelites removed to
                    Kadesh with the view of entériner</p>
                <p>Palestine. But this plan was defeated by their unbelief and faintheartedness,
                    and, as a punishment, they were compelled to sojourn forty years in the
                    wilderness of Kadesh (Paran, Sin). It was here and now that the people went to
                    school with Moses; here, at the sanctuary of the camp, he declared law and
                    judgment; and here, according to the view of the oldest tradition, the
                    foundations of the Torah were laid (Exod. xviii.). The region of Kadesh was also
                    the scene of almost all the miracles and other circumstances we read about
                    Moses. Here he showed himself to be at once the father and mother of the people,
                    their judge, priest, and seer. It was not till towards the very close of his
                    life that he led the Israelites from Kadesh into northern Moab, which he wrested
                    from the Amorite king, Sihon of Heshbon. Here he died on Mount Pisgah or Nebo,
                    after taking leave of the people in the great legislative address of
                    Deuteronomy. According to Deuteronomy xxxiv. 6, he “was buried in a valley in
                    the land of Moab, . . . but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.”<note

                    ben Nun, but the real heirs to his position and influence were the priests at
                    the sanctuary of the ark of the covenant. Of his personal character the Bible
                    tells us nothing (for IJV in Numb. xii. 3 means only “heavily burdened”); but
                    later Judaism is all the more at liberty on this account to expatiate upon it
                    (see especially Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> iv. 8, 49).</p>
                <p>Such in brief <hi rend="italic">résumé</hi> are the accounts of Moses given in

                            Hexateuch, however, he is almost never mentioned.</p></note> and the
                    Midrash. In addition to these we have also the statements of Hellenistic
                    writers, preserved chiefly in the <hi rend="italic">Contra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Apionem</hi> of Josephus. These are all of an Egyptian complexion, and
                    probably embody no ancient and independent tradition, but, in all that relates
                    to the Hebrews, where they do not rest upon pure conjecture, merely go back upon
                    obscure rumours of Jewish origin and dress them up after the manner of the
                    Midrash—only in a contrary sense, with hatred and not with love—and then seek to
                    fit them as well as may be into the Egyptian history and chronology as known
                    from other sources. The great number of new proper names of places and persons
                    which occur in the writings of Manetho and his like cannot be urged against this
                    view, for the Midrash also is full of them. The very name Osarsiph, given to
                    Moses himself, moreover, suggests a suspicion of dependence on the Asaphsuph,
                    “mixed multitude” of Numb. xi. 4 (comp. Exod. xii. 38); what is said in these
                    places is known to have played a great part in the rise of the idle Egyptian
                    tales about the origin of the Jews and of their lawgiver.</p>
