                    Beaune, and then in their college at Lyons,—where, at sixteen, the year after he
                    had been learning physics, he was made a teacher of it. Returning to Beaune for
                    a vacation, he made, on a large scale, a plan of the town, inventing the methods
                    of observation and constructing the necessary instruments; the plan was
                    presented to the town, and preserved in their library. An officer of engineers
                    seeing it wrote to recommend Monge to the commandant of the military school at
                    Mézières, and he was received as draftsman and pupil in the practical school
                    attached to that institution; the school itself was of too aristocratic a
                    character to allow of his admission to it. His manual skill was duly
                    appreciated: “I was a thousand times tempted,” he said long afterwards, “to tear
                    up my drawings in disgust at the esteem in which they were held, as if I had
                    been good for nothing better.” An opportunity, however, presented itself: being
                    required to work out from data supplied to him the “défilement” of a proposed
                    fortress (an operation then only performed by a long arithmetical process),
                    Monge, substituting for this a geometrical method, obtained the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n766/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0766-0739"/> result so quickly that the commandant at first
                    refused to receive it—the time necessary for the work had not been taken; but
                    upon examination the value of the discovery was recognized, and the method was
                    adopted. And Monge, continuing his researches, arrived at that general method of
                    the application of geometry to the arts of construction which is now called
                    descriptive geometry. But such was the system in France before the Revolution
                    that the officers instructed in the method were strictly forbidden to
                    communicate it even to those engaged in other branches of the public service;
                    and it was not until many years afterwards that an account of it was published.
                    The method consists, as is well known, in the use of the two halves of a sheet
                    of paper to represent say the planes of <hi rend="italic">xy</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">xz</hi> at right angles to each other, and the consequent
                    representation of points, lines, and figures in space by means of their plan and
                    elevation, placed in a determinate relative position.</p>
                <p>In 1768 Monge became professor of mathematics, and in 1771 professor of physics,
                    at Mézières; in 1778 he married Madame Horbon, a young widow whom he had
                    previously defended in a very spirited manner from an unfounded charge; in 1780
                    he was appointed to a chair of hydraulics at the Lyceum in Paris (held by him
                    together with his appointments at Mézières), and was received as a member of the
                    Academy; his intimate friendship with Berthollet began at this time. In 1783,
                    quitting Mézières, he was, on the death of Bezout, appointed examiner of naval
                    candidates. Although pressed by the minister to prepare for them a complete
                    course of mathematics, he declined to do so, on the ground that it would deprive
                    Madame Bezout of her only income, arising from the sale of the works of her late
                    husband; he wrote, however (1786), his <hi rend="italic">Traité élémentaire de
                    la Statique.</hi></p>
                <p>Monge contributed (1770-1790) to the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of the
                    Academy of Turin, the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Savants</hi><hi rend="italic">Étrangers</hi> of the Academy of Paris, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of the same Academy, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annales de Chimie,</hi> various mathematical and physical papers. Among these
                    may be noticed the memoir “Sur la théorie des déblais et des remblais” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mém. de V Acad. de Paris,</hi> 1781), which, while giving a
                    remarkably elegant investigation in regard to the problem of earthwork referred
                    to in the title, establishes in connexion with it his capital discovery of the
                    curves of curvature of a surface. Euler, in his paper on curvature in the Berlin
                    <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> for 1760, had considered, not the normals of the
                    surface, but the normals of the plane sections through a particular normal, so
                    that the question of the intersection of successive normals of the surface had
                    never presented itself to him. Monge’s memoir just referred to gives the
                    ordinary differential equation of the curves of curvature, and establishes the
                    general theory in a very satisfactory manner; but the application to the
                    interesting particular case of the ellipsoid was first made by him in a later
                    paper in 1795. A memoir in the volume for 1783 relates to the production of
                    water by the combustion of hydrogen; but Monge’s results in this matter had been
                    anticipated by Watts and Cavendish.</p>
                <p>In 1792, on the creation by the Legislative Assembly of an executive council,
                    Monge accepted the office of minister of the marine, but retained it only until
                    April 1793. When the Committee of Public Safety made an appeal to the savants to
                    assist in producing the <hi rend="italic">matériel</hi> required for the defence
                    of the republic, he applied himself wholly to these operations, and
                    distinguished himself by his indefatigable activity therein; he wrote at this
                    time his <hi rend="italic">Description de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">art</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de fabriquer</hi><hi rend="italic">les canons,</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Avis aux ouvriers en fer sur la fabrication de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Vader.</hi> He took a very active part in the measures for the
                    establishment of the Normal School (which existed only during the first four
                    months of the year 1795), and of the School for Public Works, afterwards the
                    Polytechnic School, and was at each of them professor for descriptive geometry;
                    his methods in that science were first published in the form in which the
                    shorthand writers took down his lessons given at the Normal School in 1795, and
                    again in 1798-99. In 1796 Monge was sent into Italy with Berthollet and some
                    artists to receive the pictures and statues levied from several Italian towns,
                    and made there the acquaintance of General Bonaparte. Two years afterwards he
                    was sent to Rome on a political mission, which terminated in the establishment,
                    under Massena, of the shortlived Roman republic; and he thence joined the
                    expedition to Egypt, taking part with his friend Berthollet as well in various
                    operations of the war as in the scientific labours of the Egyptian Institute of
                    Sciences and Arts; they accompanied Bonaparte to Syria, and returned with him in
                    1798 to France. Monge was appointed president of the Egyptian commission, and he
                    resumed his connexion with the Polytechnic School. His later mathematical papers
                    are published (1794-1816) in the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Correspondance</hi> of the Polytechnic School. On the formation of
                    the Senate he was appointed a member of that body, with an ample provision and
                    the title of count of Pelusium; but on the fall of Napoleon he was deprived of
                    all his honours, and even excluded from the list of members of the reconstituted
                    Institute. He died at Paris on the 28th July 1818.</p>
