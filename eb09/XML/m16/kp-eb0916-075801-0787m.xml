                    Heraclius to win back for the church and the empire the excommunicated and
                    persecuted Monophysites or Eutychians of Egypt and Syria. It seems to have been
                    while in Armenia in 622 that, in an interview with Paul, the head of the
                    Severians (Monophysites) there, he first broached the doctrine of the <hi

                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the doctrine that the divine and human natures, while
                    quite distinct in His one person, had but one activity and operation.<note

                    historians, it was Paul who introduced the doctrine; but this statement seems to

                    >Conciliengescħ.</hi>, iii. p. 124 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> (1877), who also

                    writings of the PseudoDionysius Areopagita.</p></note> At a somewhat later date
                    he wrote to Arcadius of Cyprus, commanding that “two energies” should not be
                    spoken of; and in 626, while in Lazistan (Colchis), he had a meeting with the
                    metropolitan, Cyrus of Phasis, during which this command was discussed, and
                    Cyrus was at last bidden seek further instruction on the subject from Sergius,
                    patriarch of Constantinople, a strong upholder of the <hi rend="italic">μία</hi>
                    ∈v∈pγeια, and the emperor’s counsellor with regard to it. So well did he profit
                    by the teaching he received in this quarter that, in 630 or 631, Cyrus was
                    appointed to the vacant patriarchate of Alexandria, and in 633 succeeded in
                    reconciling the Severians of his province on the basis of <hi rend="italic"
                    >μία</hi><hi rend="italic">θeavδpικη</hi><hi rend="italic">èvépyeca</hi> (one
                    divine-human energy). He was, however, opposed by Sophronius, a monk from
                    Palestine, who, after vainly appealing to Cyrus, actually went to Constantinople
                    to remonstrate with Sergius himself. Shortly afterwards Sergius wrote to Pope
                    Honorius, and received a friendly reply. Sophronius, however, who meanwhile had
                    been made patriarch of Jerusalem (634), refused to be silenced, and in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistola</hi><hi rend="italic">Synodica</hi> strongly insisted on
                    the “two energies.” So intense did the controversy now become that at last,
                    towards the end of 638, Heraclius published his <hi rend="italic">Ecthesis,</hi>
                    or Exposition of the Faith, which prohibited the use of the phrase “one energy,”
                    because of its disquieting effects on some minds, as seeming to militate against
                    the doctrine of the two natures; while, on the other hand, the expression “two
                    energies” was interdicted because it seemed to imply that Christ had two wills.
                    That Christ had but one will was declared to be the only orthodox doctrine, and
                    all the faithful were enjoined to hold and teach it without addition or
                    deduction. The document was not acceptable, however, to Popes Severinus and John
                    IV., the immediate successors of Honorius; and Maximus, the confessor, succeeded
                    in stirring up such violent opposition in North Africa and Italy that, in 648,
                    Constans II. judged it expedient to withdraw his grandfather’s offensive edict,
                    and to substitute for it his own <hi rend="italic">Typus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(τύπος</hi><hi rend="italic">πepι</hi> τriστeωs), forbidding all discussion of
                    the questions of the duality or singleness of either the energy or the will of
                    Christ. The scheme of doctrine of the first four general councils, in all its
                    vagueness as to these points, was to be maintained; so far as the controversy
                    had gone, the disputants on either side were to be held free from censure, but
                    to resume it would involve penal consequences. The reply of the Western Church
                    was promptly given in the unambiguously dyothelite decrees of the Lateran synod
                    held by Martin I. in 649; but the cruel persecutions to which both Martin and
                    Maximus were exposed, and finally succumbed, secured for the imperial <hi
                    rend="italic">Typus</hi> the assent at least of silence. With the accession of
                    Constantine Pogonatus in 668 the controversy once more revived, and the new
                    emperor resolved to summon a general council. It met at Constantinople in 680,
                    having been preceded in 679 by a brilliant synod under Pope Agatho at Rome,
                    where it had been agreed to depart in nothing from the decrees of the Lateran
                    synod. At Constantinople the condemnation of the monothelite heresy was explicit
                    and complete, Pope Honorius being anathematized by name along with the others
                    who had supported it. Beyond the limits of the empire, monothelism survived for
                    some centuries in Lebanon among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Maronites</hi>
                    (&lt;z-t&gt;.), who did not abjure their heresies until 1182.</p>
