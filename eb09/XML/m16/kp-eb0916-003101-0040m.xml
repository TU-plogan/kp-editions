                    merchants and no trade existed till the influence of the Greek colonies on the
                    coast introduced Greek customs into the cities of the land. All the usages and
                    terminology of trade, and all the religious ceremonies connected with it, were
                    borrowed by the Romans from the Greeks. It was no doubt under the rule of the
                    Tarquins, when the prosperity of the state and its intercourse with the outer
                    world were so much increased, that merchants began to ply their trade in Rome.
                    Doubtless the merchants practised their religious ceremonies from the first, but
                    their god Mercurius was not officially recognized by the state till the year 495
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Rome frequently suffered from scarcity of corn
                    during the unsettled times that followed the expulsion of the Tarquins. Various
                    religious innovations were made to propitiate the gods; in 496 the Greek worship
                    of Demeter, Dionysus, and Persephone was established in the city (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Liber),</hi> and in 495 the Greek god <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hermes</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> was introduced into Rome under the
                    Italian name of Mercurius (Livy, ii. 21, 27). Preller thinks that at the same
                    time the trade in corn was regulated by law, and a regular college of merchants
                    was instituted. This <hi rend="italic">collegium</hi> was under the protection
                    of the god; their annual festival was on the Ides of May, on which day the
                    temple of the god had been dedicated at the southern end of the <hi
                    rend="italic">circus</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus,</hi> near the Aven tine; and
                    the members were called <hi rend="italic">mercuriales</hi> as well as <hi
                    rend="italic">mercatores.</hi> The Ides of May was chosen as the feast of
                    Mercury, obviously because Maia was the mother of Hermes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> of Mercury (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Maia);</hi> and she was
                    worshipped along with her son by the <hi rend="italic">mercuriales</hi> on this
                    day. According to Preller, this religious foundation had a political object; it
                    established on a legitimate and sure basis the trade between Rome and the Greek
                    colonies of the coast, whereas formerly this trade had been exposed to the
                    capricious interference of the Government officials for the year. Like all
                    borrowed religions in Rome, it must have retained the rites and the terminology
                    of its Greek original (Festus, p. 257). Mercury became the god, not only of the
                    <hi rend="italic">mercatores</hi> and of the corn trade, but of buying and
                    selling in general; and it appears that, at least in the streets where shops
                    were common, little chapels and images of the god were erected. There was a
                    spring dedicated to Mercury between his temple and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Porta</hi><hi rend="italic">Capena</hi>; every shopman drew water from this
                    spring on the Ides of May, and sprinkled it with a laurel twig over his head and
                    over his goods, at the same time entreating Mercury to remove from his head and
                    his goods the guilt of all his deceits (Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Fasti,</hi> v.
                    673 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">).</hi> The art of the Roman tradesman was evidently like that of
                    an Oriental tradesman in modern times, and the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >mercurialis</hi> was popularly used as equivalent to “cheat.” In the Latin
                    poets Mercury is often gifted with some of the manifold characters of the Greek
                    Hermes, but this finer conception seems to have had no real existence in Roman
                    religion.</p>
                <p>Roman statuettes of bronze, in which Mercury is represented, like the Greek
                    Hermes, standing holding the caduceus in the one hand and a purse in the other,
                    are exceedingly common. The caduceus must have been introduced as a symbol of
                    Mercury at a very early time, for it is found on Italian coins as early as the
                    4th century before Christ, and we learn that several were kept as sacred objects
                    in the <hi rend="italic">adytum</hi> of the sanctuary at Lavinium (Dion. Hal.,
                    i. 67). But its foreign origin is shown by the fact that, although it was a sign
                    of peace, it was never borne by the <hi rend="italic">fetiales,</hi> the old
                    Italian heralds. The very name is derived from the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >κ∙ηpυκeιov.</hi> Preller’s view <hi rend="italic">(Röm.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Myth.)</hi> that <hi rend="italic">mercuriales</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mercatores</hi> are the same guild is a tempting one, but its truth is very
                    doubtful. Mommsen thinks that <hi rend="italic">mercuriales</hi> were a purely
                    local guild, viz., the <hi rend="italic">pagani</hi> of the Circus valley.</p>
