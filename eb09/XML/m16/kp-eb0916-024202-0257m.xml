                    sun, was measured by directing an arm furnished with fine “sights” (in the sense
                    of the “sights” of a rifle) first upon one of the objects and then upon the
                    other, or by employing an instrument having two arms each furnished with a pair
                    of sights, and directing one pair of sights upon one object and the second pair
                    upon the other. The angle through which the arm was moved, or, in the latter
                    case, the angle between the two arms, was read off upon a finely graduated arc.
                    With such means no very high accuracy was possible. Archimedes concluded from
                    his measurements that the sun’s diameter was greater than 27' and less than 32';
                    and even Tycho Brahe was so misled by his measures of the apparent diameters of
                    the sun and moon as to conclude that a total eclipse of the sun was
                    impossible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Grant, <hi

                <p>The invention of the telescope at once extended the possibilities of accuracy in
                    astronomical measurements. The planets were shown to have visible disks, and to
                    be attended by satellites whose distance and position angle relative to the
                    planet it was desirable to measure. It became, in fact, essential to invent a
                    “micrometer” for measuring the small angles which were thus for the first time
                    rendered sensible. There is now no doubt that William Gascoigne, a young
                    gentleman of Yorkshire, was the first inventor of the micrometer. Crabtree, a
                    friend of his, taking a journey to Yorkshire in 1639 to see Gascoigne, writes
                    thus to his friend Horrocks. “The first thing Mr Gascoigne showed me was a large
                    telescope amplified and adorned with inventions of his own, whereby he can take
                    the diameters of the sun and moon, or any small angle in the heavens or upon the
                    earth, most exactly through the glass, to a second.” The micrometer so mentioned
                    fell into the possession of Mr Richard Townley of Lancashire, who exhibited it
                    at the meeting of the Royal Society held on the 25th July 1667.</p>
                <p>The principle of Gascoigne’s micrometer is that two pointers, having parallel
                    edges at right angles to the measuring screw, are moved in opposite directions
                    symmetrically with and at right angles to the axis of the telescope. The
                    micrometer is at zero when the two edges are brought exactly together. The edges
                    are then separated till they are tangent to the opposite limbs of the disk of
                    the planet to be measured, or till they respectively bisect two stars, the angle
                    between which is to be determined. The symmetrical separation of the edges is
                    produced and measured by a single screw; the fractions of a revolution of the
                    screw are obtained by an index attached to one end of the screw, reading on a
                    dial divided into 100 equal parts. The whole arrangement is elegant and
                    ingenious. A steel cylinder (about the thickness of a goose-quill), which forms
                    the micrometer screw, has two threads cut upon it, one-half being cut with a
                    thread double the pitch of the other. This screw is mounted on an oblong box
                    which carries one of the measuring edges; the other edge is moved by the coarser
                    part of the screw relatively to the edge attached to the box, whilst the box
                    itself is moved relatively to the axis of the telescope by the finer screw. This
                    produces an opening and closing of the edges symmetrically with respect to the
                    telescope axis. Flamsteed, in the first volume of the <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    Coelestis,</hi> has inserted a series of measurements made by Gascoigne
                    extending from 1638 to 1643. These include the mutual distances of some of the
                    stars in the Pleiades, a few observations of the apparent diameter of the sun,
                    others of the distance of the moon from neighbouring stars, and a great number
                    of measurements of the diameter of the moon. Dr Bevis <hi rend="italic">(Phil.
                    Trans.,</hi> 1773, p. 190) also gives results of measurements by Gascoigne of

                    slip of metal, of variable breadth, at the focus of the telescope, and observed
                    at what part it exactly covered the object under examination; knowing the focal
                    length of the telescope and the width of the slip at the point observed, he
                    thence deduced the apparent angular breadth of the object. The Marquis Malvasia
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides</hi> (Bologna, 1662) describes a micrometer
                    of his own invention. At the focus of his telescope he placed fine silver wires
                    at right angles to each other, which, by their intersection, formed a network of
                    small squares. The mutual distances of the intersecting wires he determined by
                    counting, with the aid of a pendulum clock, the number of seconds required by an
                    equatorial star to pass from web to web, while the telescope was adjusted so
                    that the star ran parallel to the wires at right angles to those under

                    the diameter of the sun and moon made by himself, and this communication led to
                    the letters of Mr Townley and Dr Bevis above referred to. The micrometer of
                    Auzout and Picard was provided with silk fibres or silver wires instead of the
                    edges of Gascoigne, but one of the silk fibres remained fixed while the other
                    was moved by a screw. It is beyond doubt that Huygens independently discovered
                    that an object placed in the common focus of the two lenses of a Kepler
                    telescope appears as distinct and well-defined as the image of a distant body;
                    and the micrometers of Malvasia, Auzout, and Picard are the natural developments
                    of this discovery. Gascoigne was killed at the battle of Marston Moor on the 2d
                    July 1644, in the twenty-fourth year of his age, and his untimely death was
                    doubtless the cause that delayed the publication of a discovery which
                    anticipated, by twenty years, the combined work of Huygens, Malvaison, Auzout,
                    and Picard in the same direction.</p>
                <p>As the powers of the telescope were gradually developed, it was found that the
                    finest hairs or filaments of silk, or the thinnest silver wires that could be
                    drawn, were much too thick for the refined purposes of the astronomer, as they
                    entirely obliterated the image of a star in the more powerful telescopes. To

                <p>Before astronomical telescopes were mounted parallactically, the measurement of
                    position angles was seldom attempted. Indeed, in those days, the difficulties
                    attached to such measures, and to the measurement of distances with the filar
                    micrometer, were exceedingly great, and must have taxed to the utmost the skill
                    and patience of the observer. For, on account of the diurnal motion, the
                    direction of the axis of the telescope when directed to a star is always
                    changing, so that, to follow a star with an altazimuth mounting, the observer
                    requires to move continuously the two handles which give slow motion in altitude
                    and azimuth.</p>
                <p>Sir William Herschel was the first astronomer who measured position angles; the
                    instrument he employed is described in <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi>
                    1781, vol. lxxi. p. 500. It was used by him in his earliest observations of
                    double stars (1779-83); but, even in his matchless hands, the measurements were
                    comparatively crude, because of the difficulties he had to encounter from the
                    Want of a parallactic mounting. In the case of close double stars he estimated
                    the distance in terms of the disk of the components. For the measurement of
                    wider stars he invented his lamp-micrometer, in which the components of a double
                    star observed with the right eye were made to coincide with two lucid points
                    placed 10 feet from the left eye. The distance of the lucid points was the
                    tangent of the magnified angles subtended by the stars to a radius of 10 feet.
                    This angle, therefore, divided by the magnifying power of the telescope gives
                    the real angular distance of the centres of a double star. With a power of 460
                    the scale was a quarter of an inch for every second.</p>

                    universal; the methods of illumination were improved; and micrometers with

                    Sir William Herschel’s discovery of the binary character of double stars, gave
                    an impulse to micrometric research which has continued unabated to the present
                    time. A still further facility was given to the use of the filar micrometer by
                    the introduction of clockwork, which caused the telescope automatically to

                <p>The modern filar micrometer has now assumed forms of five types.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Type A.—</hi> Micrometers in which there are two webs, each
                    movable by a fine screw with a divided head. This is the usual English form of
                    filar micrometer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Type B.—</hi> Micrometers in which one web is movable by means
                    of a fine screw with a divided head, and the other by a screw without a divided
                    head. The latter screw, in ordinary use, is only employed to change the
                    coincidence-reading of the two webs, for eliminating the errors of the
                    micrometer screw. This is the ordinary German form of micrometer as originally
                    made by Fraunhofer and since by Merz, and employed by the Struves and other
                    principal Continental astronomers down to the present day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Type C.—</hi> A similar form of micrometer to B, except that
                    the coincidence-point cannot be changed,—there being no second screw to alter
                    the position of the fixed web.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Type D.—</hi> A micrometer somewhat similar in general
                    construction to form B, except that, in addition to means of changing the zero
                    point, there is a screw head by which a fine movement can be given to the whole
                    micrometer box, in the direction of the axis of the micrometer screw. This is
                    the modern form of micrometer as constructed by Repsold.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Type E.—</hi> Micrometers fitted with two eye-pieces for
                    measuring angles larger than the field of view of an ordinary eye-piece.</p>
                <p>The micrometer of type A is due to Troughton; it is represented in figs. 1, 2, 3.
                    Fig. 1 is a horizontal section in the direction of the axis of the telescope.
                    The eye-piece <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> consists of two planoconvex lenses <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b,</hi> of nearly the same focal length, and with the two <pb

                    at a distance apart less than the focal length of <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> so
                    that the wires of the micrometer, which must be distinctly seen, are beyond
                    δ.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is known as
                    Ramsden’s cje-piece; it «as made originally by him.</p></note> The eye-piece
                    slides into the tube <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> which screws into the brass ring
                    <hi rend="italic">ef,</hi> through two openings in which the oblong frame,
                    containing the micrometer slides, passes. These slides are shown in fig. 2, and
                    consist of brass forks <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">I,</hi>
                    into which the ends of the screws <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> are rigidly fitted. The slides are accurately fitted so as to have no
                    sensible lateral shake, but yet so as to move easily in the direction of the
                    greatest length of the micrometer box. Motion is communicated to the forks by
                    female screws tapped in the heads <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> acting on the screws o and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> respectively. Two
                    pins <hi rend="italic">q, r,</hi> with spiral springs coiled round them, pass
                    loosely through holes in the forks <hi rend="italic">k, I,</hi> and keep the
                    bearings of the heads <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    firmly pressed against the ends of the micrometer box. Thus the smallest
                    rotation of either head communicates to the corresponding slide motion, which,
                    if the screws are accurate, is proportional to the amount through which the head
                    is turned. Each head is graduated into 100 equal parts on the drums <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> and v, so that, by estimation, the reading can easily be
                    carried to τ⅛&lt;yth of a revolution. The total number of revolutions is read
                    off by a scale attached to the side of the box, but not seen in the figure.</p>
                <p>Two spider webs are stretched across the forks, one (Z) being cemented in a fine
                    groove cut in the inner fork <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> the other (s) in a
                    similar groove cut in the outer fork <hi rend="italic">I.</hi> These grooves are
                    simultaneously cut <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> by the maker, with the aid of
                    an engine capable of ruling fine straight lines, so that the webs when
                    accurately laid in the grooves are perfectly parallel. A wire <hi rend="italic"
                    >st</hi> is stretched across the centre of the field, perpendicular to the
                    parallel wires. Each movable web must pass the other without coming in contact
                    with .t or the fixed wire, and without rubbing on any part of the brasswork.
                    Should either fault occur (technically called “fiddling”) it is fatal to
                    accurate measurement. One of the most essential points in a good micrometer is
                    that all the webs shall be so nearly in the same plane as to be well in focus
                    together under the highest powers used, and at the same time absolutely free
                    from “fiddling.” For measuring position angles a brass circle <hi rend="italic"
                    >gh</hi> (fig. 3), fixed to the telescope by the screw <hi rend="italic">i,</hi>
                    has rack teeth on its circumference that receive the teeth of an endless screw
                    <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> which, being fixed by the arms <hi rend="italic"
                    >xx</hi> to the oblong box <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> gives the latter a motion
                    of rotation round the axis of the telescope; an index upon this box points out
                    on the graduated circle <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> the angular rotation of the
                    instrument.</p>
                <p>The English micrometer still retains the essential features of Troughton’s
                    original construction above described. The later English artists have somewhat
                    changed the mode of communicating motion to the slides, by attaching the screws
                    permanently to the micrometer head and tapping each micrometer screw into its
                    slide. Instead of making the shoulder of the screw a flat bearing surface, they
                    have given the screw a spherical bearing resting in a hollow cone (fig. 4)
                    attached to the end of the box. The French artists still retain Troughton’s
                    form. Simms (Troughton’s successor) and Cooke (of York), for symmetry and more
                    effectual elimination of “the loss of time” (called by the Germans “todter
                    Gang,” and sometimes in English “back-lash”), have provided two pins with spiral
                    springs, like <hi rend="italic">q</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (fig. 2),
                    one on each side of the screw which moves each slide.</p>
                <p>Grubb of Dublin, with the intention of avoiding the variation of pressure exerted
                    by the spiral springs when the slide is at different distances from the head of
                    the screw, has adopted the following plan. Where the screw enters the slide he
                    has a nut <hi rend="italic">n</hi> attached to a strong spring <hi rend="italic"
                    >pp</hi> (fig. 5), the pressure of which exerts a constant tension in the axis
                    of the screw, tending to bring the threads into close contact, in opposite
                    directions, with their bearings in the nut <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and the
                    slide <hi rend="italic">q.</hi> The pressure of this spring is regulated by the
                    screws <hi rend="italic">s, s,</hi> tapped into the thickened ends of the
                    springs. For maintaining the spherical shoulder of the screw in close and
                    constant pressure on its conical bearing he has attached a conical bearing to
                    the spring <hi rend="italic">p'p'</hi> (fig. 6). The pressure of this on the
                    upper part of the spherical shoulder is regulated by the screws <hi
                    rend="italic">s', s',</hi> passing through elongated holes in the spring <hi
                    rend="italic">p'p',</hi> and tapped into the end of the box.</p>
                <p>The screws of micrometers are generally made with 50 or 100 threads to the inch.
                    Troughton’s method of reading the number of whole revolutions by a silver scale
                    is inconvenient, because <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> ⅜^th or even <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ⅛th of an inch is too small a quantity to read easily
                    with the naked, eye, especially with the faint illumination that it is desirable
                    to use when measuring faint objects. Different methods, including the “comb”
                    (see below) and various kinds of “counters,” have been introduced with more or
                    less success; but recently the Repsolds of Hamburg have contrived a plan at once
                    so simple and so efficient that it will be unnecessary to describe those methods
                    which this plan is certain to supersede (see below, type D). Grubb has
                    introduced a modification in the form of the slides with a view to avoid the
                    friction of one slide against the other. On the inner side of the brass plate
                    which forms the bottom of the box <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the side
                    opposite to the eye-piece) four V-shaped furrows are placed (fig. 7); and at
                    each end of the slides are projections (fig. 8, end view) which fit into these
                    furrows. The slides are kept down in their places by springs attached to them,
                    which press upon the inner side of the lid of the box.</p>
                <p>Troughton’s mode of giving rotation to the position circle is now abandoned. A
                    much quicker motion in position angle than can be obtained without slow motion
                    is often desirable, since, in observing very close double stars, the uncertainty
                    of each pointing may amount to several degrees in the most accurate
                    measurements. The plan of a pinion working in a toothed wheel is often employed,
                    but that also is too slow. Most modern micrometers are now fitted with a clamp
                    and slow motion screw (see fig. 9, type B). This permits observation of position
                    angles of veιy close objects by simple rotation of the box with the hand; while
                    the slow motion, after clamping, permits the more delicate movements that are
                    required in measuring the position angle of objects farther apart.</p>
                <p>The Cookes and Grubb have for years almost invariably transferred the position
                    circle from the micrometer to the telescope tube. The whole eye-end with its
                    focussing arrangements rotates, and its rotation can be measured by a circle
                    attached to the butt end of the tube. There is considerable convenience in this
                    arrangement. One position circle only is required for all the micrometers that
                    may be employed with the instrument; and the orientation of reticulated
                    diaphragms, or the adjustment of the direction of the slit of a spectroscope,
                    may also be accomplished by the same means. But, after a very extended
                    experience of all the various types of existing mountings, the present writer
                    does not hesitate to express a decided preference for a position circle attached
                    to the micrometer and a rigid attachment of the eye-end to the telescope
                    tube,—having never seen an eye-end attached to a position circle on the butt end
                    of the telescope-tube in which, after the wear and tear of a few years, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n260/mode/1up"

                    This is a fatal fault, especially in those delicate observations of difference
                    of declination which have latterly formed so prominent a feature in refined
                    micrometric research. On the other hand, in some good old micrometers at the
                    Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, that are fitted with attached position
                    circles, there is no trace of shake or wear after fifty years of work.</p>

                    “fixed web” is attached, <hi rend="italic">s'</hi> that of a screw which moves

                    are tubes attached to a larger tube N; the latter fits loosely on a strong
                    hollow cylinder which terminates in the screw V. By this screw the whole
                    apparatus is attached to the telescope. The nozzles of small lamps are inserted
                    in the tubes I., I., for illuminating the webs in a dark field; the light from
                    these lamps is admitted through apertures in the strong hollow cylinder above
                    mentioned (for illumination, see below). In this micrometer the three slides
                    moved by S, s, and <hi rend="italic">s'</hi> are simple dovetails. The lowest of
                    these slides reposes upon a foundation-plate <hi rend="italic">pp,</hi> into one
                    end of which the screw s is tapped. In the middle of this slide a stiffly
                    fitting brass disk is inserted, to which a small turn-table motion may be
                    communicated by an attached arm, acted on by two fine opposing screws accessible
                    to the astronomer; and by their means the “fixed wire” may be rendered strictly
                    parallel with the movable wire.</p>
                <p>The micrometer screw is mounted on the slide which carries the movable web. Fig.

                    sake of clearness. The screw S has a shoulder at <hi rend="italic">κ,</hi>
                    carefully fitted and ground to a bearing so as to work sweetly in a hole in the
                    very strong spring <hi rend="italic">σσ;</hi> the other extremity of the screw

                    on the flat surface of an agate <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which is imbedded in
                    the end of the slide, and kept firmly in its place by the brass piece <hi

                    θ</hi> sufficient pressure may be left upon <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> to slightly

                    preventing easy action of the screw. The screw passes at the same time through
                    the bush B (shown in plan and elevation, fig. 10) attached to <hi rend="italic"
                    >pp</hi> (fig. 9); and there is a fine saw cut, which can be narrowed by the
                    small screw τ, to close the bush upon the micrometer screw with a view of
                    preventing “loss of time.” The spider web ω is cemented on the further side of

                    come sufficiently close to the webs. The eye-piece was originally moved by a
                    pinion working in a rack <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (fig. 9); but the screw <hi
                    rend="italic">s’</hi> applied by Simms was found by Maclear to be more
                    convenient for the purpose. Beyond this, and the graduation of the edge of the
                    circle with more strongly cut divisions than those originally engraved on the
                    face of the circle, the instrument remains and is figured in its original form.
                    Pistor and Martius (Berlin) have also made excellent instruments of the above
                    type. There is a celebrated micrometer of their make, with which, in the hands
                    of Brunnow at Dunsink (Dublin), some of the most perfect and refined
                    investigations ever made in practical astronomy have been executed. In this
                    micrometer the screw <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is mounted on its own slide and
                    has a divided head precisely like the screw S (fig. 9). The plate <hi
                    rend="italic">pp</hi> is elongated towards <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> and the
                    corresponding bush B is attached to this elongation. The screw √ is shifted to
                    another part of the eye-piece slide, so that it does not interfere with the
                    increased diameter of the screw <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> Fraunhofer’s
                    micrometer in this form belongs to type A, but is quoted under type B for
                    convenience of description.</p>
                <p>It is not necessary to give a figure representing type C. Such micrometers have
                    been generally constructed on Troughton’s type (figs. 1, 2, 3) with the omission
                    of one of the screws, and with one or more of the modifications described in
                    detail under type <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some have also been made similar
                    otherwise to the Fraunhofer construction, by omitting the screw s with its
                    corresponding slide an&lt;l attaching the fixed wire to a circular plate in <hi
                    rend="italic">pp.</hi></p>
                <p>Good instruments have been made on type C by Clark (Cambridge, Massachusetts), by
                    Steinheil (Munich), and by the great French artists Secretan, Froment, Brunner,
                    Eichens; and good work has been done with them. But it is necessary that the
                    errors of the screw should be very carefully determined, since, in type C, such
                    errors cannot be eliminated by employing different parts of the screw to measure
                    the same angle. There is a noteworthy description of micrometer that forms a
                    link between types C and D, of which the most famous example (by Clark) is
                    attached to the great Washington telescope. It is essentially a micrometer of
                    type C, with a slide (or fork) and a screw of the English form of construction.
                    But the instrument is provided with a screw as at <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (fig.
                    9), which, instead of changing the position of the fixed wire, moves the whole
                    micrometer box in the direction of the axis of the measuring screw. Thus the
                    fixed wire can be set exactly on one star by the screw s while the other star is
                    immediately afterwards bisected by the movable wire, and that without disturbing
                    the reading for coincidence of the wires. No one, unless he has previously
                    worked without such an arrangement, can fully appreciate the advantage of
                    bringing up a star to bisection by the fixed wire by moving the micrometer box
                    with a delicate screw-motion, instead of having to change the direction of the
                    axis of a huge telescope for the same purpose. When it is further remembered
                    that the earlier telescopes were not provided with the modern slow motions in
                    right ascension, and that the Struves, in their gigantic labours among the
                    double stars, used to complete their bisections on the fixed wire by a pressure
                    of the finger on the side of the tube, one is puzzled whether most to wonder at
                    the poor adaptation of means to ends or the marvellous patience and skill which,
                    with such means, led to such results.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Jate Professor Watson used to say. quaintly and with
                    trιι∣⅛, “After all, the best part of the micrometer is the man at the small
                    end!”</p></note> It should be added that Dawes practically adopted a
                    modification of Clark’s micrometer by using a slipping piece, and bolting one of
                    the heads of his micrometer <hi rend="italic">{Mem. R. A. S.,</hi> vol. xxxv. p.
                    139). His slipping piece gave motion to the micrometer by two slides, one in
                    right ascension the other in declination, so that “either of the webs can be
                    placed upon either of the components of a double star with ease and
                    certainty.”</p>
                <p>All micrometers used, in conjunction with a microscope, for reading the divisions
                    of transit circles, heliometer scales, &amp;c., are of the type C. The reading
                    micrometer-is shown in fig. 11. C is the objective, D the micrometer box, E the
                    graduated head of the screw, G the milled head by which the screw <hi
                    rend="italic">cc</hi> is turned, A an eyepiece sliding in a tube B, <hi
                    rend="italic">aa</hi> (fig. 12) the slide, and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> the spiral springs. The focal length of the objective and
                    the distance between the optical centre of the lens and the webs are so arranged
                    that images of the divisions are formed in the plane of the webs, and the pitch
                    of the screw is such that one division of the scale corresponds with some whole
                    number of revolutions of the screw.</p>
                <p>There is what is technically called a “comb” inserted in the micrometer box at
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> (fig. 12),—its upper surface being nearly in the plane
                    of the wires. This comb does not move with reference to the box, and serves to
                    indicate the whole revolution of which a fraction is read on the head. In fig.
                    12 a division is represented bisected by cross webs, and five revolutions of the
                    screw correspond with one division of the scale. In all modern reading
                    micrometers the cross webs of fig. 12 are replaced by parallel webs embracing
                    the division <pb break="no"

                    the tube and the distance of C from the scale are omitted in the figure. These
                    appliances are required if the “run” has to be accurately adjusted. By “run” is
                    meant the difference between the intended whole number of screw-revolutions and
                    the actual measure of the space between two adjacent divisions of the scale in
                    turns of the screw divided by the number of intended revolutions. In delicate
                    researches two divisions of the scale should always be read, not merely for
                    increased accuracy but to obtain the corrections for “run” from the observations
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>Fig. 14 represents an important type of reading micrometer by the Repsolds. Here
                    the web-frame is mounted on the screw itself. The limiting plane of motion is at
                    <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> where the end of the micrometer screw bears upon the
                    hardened, flattened end of the screw s, and is kept in bearing against this
                    plane by the spiral spring <hi rend="italic">q.</hi> Rotation of the wire-frame
                    is prevented by the small stud <hi rend="italic">m</hi> which passes through the
                    web-frame and projects slightly on both sides of it, just barely touching the
                    inner surfaces of the top and bottom of the micrometer box. The web-frame thus
                    rests solely on the screw and on the point <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and
                    therefore follows it absolutely and accurately.</p>
                <p>The comparative merits of the various micrometers are discussed by Lord Lindsay
                    and Mr Gill <hi rend="italic">(D</hi><hi rend="italic">unecht</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pzιblications,</hi> vol. ii. pp. 53-55, 1877). If the screw of the
                    Repsold micrometer is bent, so that, for example, the end of the frame next the
                    screw-head is raised and that next the end <hi rend="italic">p</hi> lowered, a
                    twist will be given to the webframe, and the centre of the wire will be moved
                    nearer to the micrometer head than it should be, while the reverse effect will
                    follow when the head has been turned through 180°. The effect of a similar error
                    on the other micrometers described would be of a much less amount. They are,
                    however, liable to errors of another character. If, as in Troughton’s original
                    micrometer, the shoulder is square, the hole in the end of the box may be left
                    sufficiently wide to allow for a small error in the parallelism of the
                    screw-matrix with the motion of the slide, but the smallest bend in the screw
                    causes the shoulder no longer to bear flat, but to ride on its edge, thus
                    introducing an extremely uncertain form of error. If the shoulder is spherical,
                    fitting into a hollow cone on the end of the box, as in the micrometers of
                    Simms, Cooke, and Grubb, an almost inconceivable accuracy of construction is
                    implied in drilling the matrix of the screw in the slide so that its axis and
                    that of the cone shall be in the same straight line, and both parallel to the
                    motion of a point in the slide. Any departure from perfect accuracy in this
                    respect has the effect of bringing different portions of the spherical shoulder
                    to bear on different parts of the cone for different revolutions, and introduces
                    errors of a character by no means easy to deal with. In addition to these
                    objections there always is the greater objection of employing as a delicate
                    contact-measuring surface one that is exposed where oil is used. Dust and oil
                    will arrange themselves in layers of variable and uncertain thickness and defeat
                    all attempts to secure absolutely consistent results. In Repsold’s micrometer
                    the <hi rend="italic">point d'appzιi</hi> is a small hardened and polished
                    bearing, requiring little lubrication, and perfectly protected from dust; the
                    errors of the screw (some of them exaggerated, certainly) are faithfully
                    reproduced, and consequently determinable, and beyond this the work to be done
                    by the screw is reduced to a minimum,—no slidefriction having to be overcome. If
                    we are to regard as the most perfect instrument, “not that which has absolutely
                    the smallest errors, but that which reproduces its errors with the most perfect
                    consistency,” undoubtedly Repsold’s form of micrometer is best.</p>
                <p>In order to avoid the exaggeration of the screw-errors produced by the
                    non-symmetrical position of the screw in Repsold’s micrometer, Stone, in
                    December 1879, exhibited at the Royal Astronomical Society, and described <hi
                    rend="italic">(Monthly Notices,</hi> p. 270), a modification of Repsold’s
                    instrument. But, both in his statement of the comparative merits of the
                    Troughton and Repsold micrometers and in the new form which he figures, Stone
                    overlooks a strong point in the Repsold form, and in that proposed by Lord
                    Lindsay and Gill three years previously,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Dunecht Publications,</hi> vol. ii.,

                    of the slide, and the elimination of all error or strain that may occur from a
                    want of parallelism in the axis of the matrix and the motion of the slide. The
                    Lindsay-Gill micrometer will be better understood from the following
                    description. In fig. 15 Ss is the micrometer screw; its cylindrical axis is

                <p>The web-frame is narrower and thinner than the breadth and height of the interior
                    of the box, and is only prevented from rotating by the delicate touch of the

                    top and bottom of the box. It appears that a frame so mounted fulfils all
                    theoretical conditions of accuracy. It is perfectly free to follow the motion of
                    the screw and accurately to reproduce its errors, notwithstanding any reasonable
                    faults of workmanship; and no permissible shake or fouling of the bearing at <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> can produce sensible error in the distance between the
                    bearing surface of the agate plane and the spider webs. The motion is produced
                    with the minimum of friction; and the “feel” of the screw is therefore as
                    delicate and perfect as it is possible to make it.</p>
                <p>The micrometer of type D shown in fig. 16 has recently been made by the Repsolds
                    for the Cape Observatory. As this instrument combines all their most recent

                    would therefore take place, were it not for the micrometer screw. This screw

                    box. Such rotation can obviously be controlled within limits that need not be
                    further considered. But freedom of rotation in the plane of the paper</p>
                <p>(fig. 17) is only prevented by good fitting of the holes <hi rend="italic">β',

                    here will have the effect of changing the reading for coincidence of the movable
                    with the fixed web in reverse positions of the micrometer. With the Cape
                    micrometer a systematic difference has been found in the coincidence point for
                    head above and head below amounting to 0" ’ 14. This corresponds, in the Cape
                    instrument, with an excess of the diameters of the holes over those of the
                    cylinders of about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ⅛
                    <hi rend="subscript"> πr</hi> th of an inch,—a quantity so small as to imply
                    good workmanship, though it involves a systematic error which is very much
                    larger than the probable error of a single determination of the coincidence
                    point. The obvious remedy is to make all measures on opposite sides of the fixed
                    web before reversing in position angle,—a precaution, however, which no careful
                    observer λvould neglect. In measuring differences of declination, where the
                    stars are brought up by the diurnal motion, this precaution cannot be adopted,
                    because it is necessary always to bisect the preceding star with the fixed web.
                    But in ∆δ measures index error can always be .eliminated by bisecting both stars
                    with the same web (or different webs of known interval fixed on the same frame),
                    and not employing the fixed web at all. Had the spring <hi rend="italic">q</hi>
                    been placed as in fig. 14, and the cylinders <hi rend="italic">β</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> been made to bear like the pivots of a transit on segmental
                    bearings in the frame at <hi rend="italic">β'</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >y',</hi> it is probable that the difference in coincidence points would not
                    have existed. Such a modification appears advisable, unless this construction,
                    by leaving the end <hi rend="italic">m</hi> less free, should make the “feel” of
                    the screw less sweet and perfect. The discordance in zero when known to exist is
                    really of no consequence, because the observations can be so arranged as to
                    eliminate it.</p>
                <p>The box is mounted on a strong hollow steel cylinder CC (fig. 17) by holes <hi
                    rend="italic">η,</hi><hi rend="italic">θ</hi> in the ends of the box, which fit
                    the cylinder closely and smoothly. The cylinder is rigidly fixed in the studs C,
                    C, and these are attached to the foundation plate <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> The
                    cylinder contains towards η a sliding rod, and towards <hi rend="italic">θ</hi>
                    a compressed spiral spring. There is thus a thrust outwards of the spring upon
                    the hollow cap W (attached outside the box), and a thrust of the rod upon the
                    end of the screw s. The position of the box relative to the plate∕, in the
                    direction of measurement, depends therefore on the distance between the end of
                    the screw <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and the fixed stud C. A screwing in of s thus
                    causes the box to move to the left, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi>
                    Rotation of the box round CC is prevented by downward pressure of the spring Z
                    on a projection attached to the side of the box. The amount of tlιis pressure is
                    regulated by the screw z ’.</p>
                <p>The short screw whose divided milled head is <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> shifts the
                    zero of the micrometer by pushing, without turning, the short sliding rod whose
                    flat end forms the poinZ <hi rend="italic">d'appui</hi> of the micrometer screw
                    at (’. The pitch of the screw &lt;r is the same as that of the measuring screw
                    (50 threads to the inch), and its motion can be limited by a stop to half a
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>The five fixed webs are attached to the table ττ, which is secured to the bottom
                    of the box by the screws <hi rend="italic">ρ.</hi> The three movable webs are
                    attached to the projections λλ on the frame αα. The plane surfaces ττ and λλ are
                    composed of a bronze of very close texture, which appears capable of receiving a
                    finish having almost the truth and polish of an optical surface. It seems also
                    to take a very clean V cut, as the webs can be laid in their furrows with an
                    astonishing ease and precision. These furrows have apparently been cut <hi
                    rend="italic">in situ</hi> with a very accurate engine; for not the slightest
                    departure from parallelism can be detected in any of the movable webs relative
                    to the fixed webs. Extraordinary care has evidently been bestowed in adjusting
                    the parallelism and distance of the planes τ and λ, so that the movable wires
                    shall almost, but not quite, touch the surface τ. The varnish to fix the webs is
                    applied, not on the surface τ as is usual, but on a bevel for the purpose,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The marks of varnish so
                    applied will be seen in</p></note> the position of the webs depending on their
                    tension to keep them in their furrows. The result is that no trace of “fiddling”
                    exists, and the movable and fixed webs come sharply together in focus with the
                    highest powers. Under such powers the webs can be brought into apparent contact
                    with such precision and delicacy that the uncertainty of measurement seems to
                    lie as much in the estimation of the fraction of the division of the head as in
                    the accuracy of the contact. It is a convenient feature in Repsold’s micrometer
                    that the webs are very near the inner surface of the top of the box, so that the
                    eye is not brought inconveniently close to the plate when high powers are
                    used.</p>
                <p>Micrometers of the type E have been invented by Alvan Clark and Grubb. Clark’s
                    micrometer was exhibited at the June meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society
                    in 1859 <hi rend="italic">{Monthly Notices R. A. S.,</hi> vol. xix.). It is
                    capable of measuring angles up to about one degree. It is “furnished with two
                    eye-pieces, composed of small single lenses, mounted in separate frames, which
                    slide in a groove and can be separated to the required distance. A frame
                    carrying two parallel spider lines, each mounted separately with its own
                    micrometer screw, slides in a dovetailed groove in front of the eye-pieces; and
                    by a free motion in this frame each web can be brought opposite its own
                    eye-lens. In using this micrometer, the first step is to set the
                    position-vernier to the approximate position of the objects to be measured. Then
                    the eye-lenses are separated till each is opposite its own object. The frame
                    containing the webs and their micrometer screws is then slid into its place; and
                    the webs, having been separated nearly to their proper distance by their free
                    motion in the frame, are placed precisely on the objects by their fine screws,
                    the observer’s eye being carried rapidly from one eye-lens to the other a few
                    times, till he is satisfied of the bisection of each of the objects by its own
                    web. The frame is then removed for reading off the measure by means of an
                    achromatic microscope, on the stage of which it is placed.” The advantages which
                    Clark claims are these :—</p>
                <p>“1. Distances can be observed with great accuracy up to about one degree, and the
                    angles of position also.</p>
                <p>“2. The webs, being in the same plane, are perfectly free from parallax, and are
                    both equally distinct, however high the magnifying power may be.</p>
                <p>“3. The webs are also free from distortion and from colour.</p>
                <p>“4. A different magnifying power may be used on each of the objects,—which may be
                    advantageous in comparing a faint comet with a star.”</p>
                <p>It appears to us that the method of removing a slide in order to measure the
                    interval between the webs is liable to objection, not only because of the risk
                    to the webs, but because the taking of measurements of such a different
                    character with a different instrument is inconvenient and troublesome. It is
                    true that the intervals between the webs could be measured by an assistant, and
                    two or more different slides be employed to save time; but astronomers will
                    probably generally prefer the method introduced by Grubb described below. It is
                    understood that Clark has since improved this instrument by an ingenious
                    arrangement of prisms, which permits both webs, even though separated one degree
                    in a large telescope, to be seen in the same eye-piece. The arrangement is not
                    described, and is said to be, as yet, somewhat troublesome to arrange previous
                    to measurement, though when arranged it gives very good results.</p>

                    in perspective in fig. 18 :—“A plate of glass about 2⅜ inches square is ruled
                    with twenty-one lines in one direction <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛-th inch
                    apart, and two lines in the other direction 2 inches apart. The extreme lines of
                    the set therefore form a perfect square of 2 inches. These lines are ruled with
                    exceeding accuracy and care, but provision is left for ascertaining any errors
                    that remain either as to distance or want of perfect squareness. Along one side
                    of the square is mounted a micrometer frame in the ordinary way, actuated by a
                    screw of one hundred threads to the inch. This micrometer frame carries eleven
                    lines corresponding exact ly to each alternat, line in the glas; reticule, so
                    that when the first spider line is made coincident with the first diamond line
                    on the glass the last spider line will be coincident with the last line on the
                    glass, and each of the spider lines will be coincident with all the odd numbers
                    of diamond lines, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21. Over this glass plate
                    is placed a brass cap in which two eye-pieces are mounted, one sliding in a
                    groove at right angles to the other,—so that, while one has its journey
                    backwards and forwards on the horizontal line, the other has its journey on the
                    vertical line, according to how the cap is placed, for this cap is capable of
                    rotation to meet various circumstances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“How to Use the Instrument. —</hi> 1. The two stars are brought
                    on the horizontal line, and the distance measured from centre to centre along
                    that line. This distance is measured by counting the number of spaces on the
                    glass, adding the residue as measured by the micrometer screw. Thus the screw is
                    never used for larger measures than τ⅛th inch, and therefore errors of screw and
                    temperature errors are much reduced. In bisecting, one star is brought into the
                    field of one eye-piece, and a bisection is made with one of the diamond lines by
                    moving the micrometer by one or other of its slipping piece screws. Then the
                    other eye-piece is moved till the second star is seen, and a bisection is made
                    with the nearest spider line by moving the micrometer head. Then the eye can be
                    moved back to the first eye-piece, and the bisection checked, and again back to
                    the other eye-piece. When it is seen that both are satisfactory the measure can
                    be read off. 2. The micrometer is turned round till the horizontal line becomes
                    parallel to the path of apparent motion of the star. This is easily found by
                    stopping the clock and allowing the star to run along the horizontal wire. Now
                    the other star will be found to cross the vertical line somewhere, while the
                    first star is on the horizontal line. This second star is then bisected on the
                    vertical line, while the first star is bisected by one of the spider lines; thus
                    the difference in right ascension is found. We then have two sides of a
                    right-angled triangle and of course all the elements are known.</p>

                    square.”</p>
                <p>This instrument has great advantage over Clark’s in ease of adjustment and use,
                    and has done good work at the University Observatory, Oxford <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Mem. R. A. S.,</hi> vol. xlvii. pp. 5-12). Professor Pritchard claims too much
                    when he estimates its work as equal in accuracy with that of the heliometer—at
                    least the published results do not confirm such a view. But it is a very
                    valuable instrument for measuring objects too faint for the limited aperture of
                    most heliometers, and which at the same time are farther apart than the field of
                    view of an ordinary eye-piece.</p>
                <p>The accuracy of the duplex micrometer would be very greatly increased if Clark’s
                    idea (above mentioned) of viewing both widely separated webs in one eye-piece of
                    high power could be reduced to a convenient practical form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Method of Webbing the Filar Micrometer.</hi></p>
                <p>The webbing of a micrometer is a process that should be familiar to all practical
                    astronomers. English opticians usually proceed as follows. A spider (the variety
                    is marked by a cross on the back, and is found in English gardens about decayed
                    wood) is caught, and placed on a wire fork. The insect immediately attaches a
                    web to the wire and begins to lower itself by a web to the ground. This web is
                    wound up on the fork till ten or twelve turns, separated by a convenient space,
                    have been secured. A brush with varnish is then passed along the prongs; the
                    webs are thus securely fixed to the fork. The parallel prongs of the fork must
                    be sufficiently far apart to allow the web-frame of the micrometer to pass
                    between them. The frame to be webbed is placed on a flat dull black surface
                    between the prongs of the fork, the latter being carefully arranged so that one
                    of the webs lies nearly in the furrow ruled in the frame for its reception. As
                    the web-frame is generally thicker than the fork, the web will now be stretched
                    across the former, with a certain amount of tension, and is brought into the
                    furrow with a finely pointed piece of soft wood. If the surface of the frame is
                    well polished, and the furrows sharply cut, without “burr,” the web should leap
                    sharply and decidedly into its place. Each end of the web is then secured by a
                    drop of shellac varnish, which should be allowed to harden thoroughly before the
                    frame is touched. The webs can be very readily so handled against a black
                    background, with the aid of a hand lens of 2 or 3 inches focus. In experienced
                    hands this method gives good results, but the following, which is generally
                    followed on the Continent, is preferable.</p>
                <p>A web, about 2 inches longer than the width of the frame, is unwound from a
                    cocoon,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It îs asserted
                    that webs from cocoons are more elastic, better shaped, and more durable than
                    those obtained during an effort of the insect to escape. The best webs we have
                    seen were from a cocoon obtained in Holland, but we have been unable to
                    ascertain the name of the variety of spider.</p><p>Argelander used to apply two
                    drops of varnish at each end of bis webs. He first fixed each extremity by a
                    drop of shellac varnish, and after that had dried he applied a drop of copal
                    varnish nearer the centre of the frame; the latter took a long time to harden,

                    lead are attached to its extremities by beeswax. One end of the web, with its
                    attached lead, is laid on a piece of cork floating in a tumbler of water; the
                    other end is allowed to hang down in the water, where it becomes thoroughly
                    saturated and untwisted. It is then laid across the fork, and dropped into its
                    furrows in the manner above described, the little lead weights exerting a
                    definite tension. Varnish <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> is immediately applied
                    to secure the webs, and the frame is not touched till it is dry.</p>
                <p>The bevel-edge of the web-frame introduced by Repsold (type D) offers great
                    facilities for accurate webbing, and should be employed in all future
                    micrometers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Illumination of Micrometers.</hi></p>
                <p>When micrometer observations are made by night it is necessary to have some mode
                    of rendering the webs visible,—either by rays of light at right angles to the
                    axis illuminating the webs, or by rays nearly coincident with the axis of the
                    telescope. In the former case we get bright webs in a dark field, in the latter
                    dark webs on a bright field.</p>
                <p>In the older telescopes bright web illumination is produced by small lamps with
                    nozzles that enter the tubes I., I. (fig. 9). The illumination is regulated in
                    colour and intensity by wedges of coloured or darkened glass passing through
                    slides in the nozzles. But it is inconvenient to have lamps so near the
                    observer’s eye, and it is at least very difficult to obtain a perfectly dark
                    field when the wires are illuminated in this way.</p>
                <p>The Clarks, in their micrometer of the great Washington telescope, have made the
                    end of box T (fig. 15) transparent, and light is thrown on the webs from a lamp
                    held by an assistant. Holden has very recently applied a lamp ingeniously hung
                    so as to preserve its verticality and the constant direction of its light in a
                    similar way, adding a plain silvered mirror inside the box and opposite the
                    lamp, so as to illuminate the webs symmetrically. In the Clarks’ and Holden’s
                    methods it is only the webs at right angles to the screw that are
                    illuminated.</p>
                <p>For illumination of the field, in very old telescopes, light was thrown on a
                    small ivory reflector fixed outside the object-glass in the axis of the
                    telescope by an arm fitting on the cell of the lens. This involved the aid of an
                    assistant to direct lamplight on the ivory reflector, or the very frequent
                    change of a lamp support. Afterwards the light from an attached lamp was
                    introduced through a hole in the telescope-tube and thrown upon an elliptical
                    plane (generally dull-gilt) having its centre part cut away sufficiently to
                    avoid interruption of the cone of rays from the object-glass. Many ingenious
                    modes of suspending the lamp have been invented for the purpose of securing a
                    constant direction of its light coupled with verticality of the lamp. One of the
                    best of these, due to Cooke, is shown in fig. 19. I. is the lamp, P a prism to
                    reflect <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n264/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0264-0249"/> its light into the tube, D a disk to regulate the
                    quantity of light, B a disk with glasses to regulate the colour of the light, S
                    a spring to clamp the disks, C the counterpoise of the lamp, G a poise to
                    preserve the horizontally of the axis CL. But astronomers owe to the genius of
                    Grubb the introduction of a more efficient and convenient system, viz., the
                    performance of all necessary illumination of an astronomical telescope by a
                    single lamp, and the perfect control of the illumination of the field or webs,
                    and the regulation of these as to intensity or colour by simple motions from the
                    eye-end. It is impossible to speak too highly of Grubb’s efforts in this
                    direction; he has broken the ground in this department of astronomical
                    engineering, and rendered the working of so huge an instrument as the Vienna
                    telescope of 27 inches aperture not only convenient, but easier for a single
                    observer than that of a very small telescope of the older constructions.</p>
                <p>But in the illumination of the field wires and scales of a micrometer Grubb’s
                    original method has recently been surpassed by one which is due to the Repsolds.
                    We shall therefore describe the latter.</p>
                <p>Fig. 20 represents the eye-end of a telescope. The reader will recognize the
                    micrometer (figs. 16 and 17) previously described. I. is a paraffin lamp fitting
                    by a bayonet joint into a copper cover c. This effectually defends its glass
                    chimney against accident, and protects the lamp from wind. The simple means by
                    which this lamp is made to preserve its verticali ty in all positions of the
                    telescope is evident from the figure. By this lamp alone the bright wire or
                    bright field illumination is given at pleasure, and with any desired intensity,
                    simply by movement of the small pin <hi rend="italic">p.</hi></p>
                <p>The position circle and the head of the micrometer are also illuminated, as well
                    as the declination circle, by the same lamp. AB is a cylindrical box, ending in
                    a truncated cone towards A. It is shown, mid-section, in a plane passing through
                    the telescope axis, in fig. 21, where all details unnecessary to the explanation
                    of the illumination are omitted, and proportion of parts is sacrificed to
                    clearness. P is a prism (fig. 21) that rotates with the lamp and reflects its
                    light into AB. The flame of the lamp is in the focus of the lens <hi
                    rend="italic">ll,</hi> so that the rays become parallel after passing through
                    it. There is a sliding motion to perfect this adjustment. There is a
                    well-polished flat annular reflector of speculum metal <hi rend="italic">rr</hi>
                    (fig. 21), which reflects light upon the double mirror Μ (fig. 20), whence it is
                    diverted to the two opposite points on the declination circle that are read by
                    micrometer microscopes from the eye-end (the latter are omitted for sake of
                    clearness).</p>
                <p>The little handle at <hi rend="italic">p'</hi> and the dotted lines <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">z</hi> represent an iris-diaphragm,
                    very ingeniously constructed, mounted on a plate of transparent glass. There is
                    a flat ring of brass, carrying four pins, which is turned by the handle <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> in a plane at right angles to
                    Pn. These pins work in spiral slots cut in four slides. Thus rotation of the
                    ring causes the four slides to approach or recede from a centre. When the handle
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> ’ is in the middle of its range, the slides together
                    form a disk as large as the hole in the diaphragm <hi rend="italic">dd,</hi> and
                    thus prevent all light from entering the telescope tube. When <hi rend="italic"
                    >p'</hi> is pushed to one side of its range the slides move outwards leaving a
                    square opening in the centre so that the light falls on the prism <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> whence it is diverted to a silvered reflector cemented on
                    the middle of the inner surface of the object-glass, and is then reflected back
                    along the axis of the telescope to illuminate the field at «. When <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi> is
                    pushed to the other side of its range the slides approach and overlap at the
                    centre, excluding light from <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and allowing it to fall
                    upon the reflector <hi rend="italic">s</hi> instead. From <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi> the light is thrown upon the webs <hi rend="italic">ω, ω</hi> by
                    reflexion from a white papier mache surface laid on the inside of a thin hollow
                    brass truncated cone <hi rend="italic">xx.</hi> The edge of this cone forms the
                    circle seen within ττ in fig. 17. All stray light is prevented by the
                    light-guard tube <hi rend="italic">mm,</hi> which is attached to and moves with
                    the rotating part of the micrometer. The result is to produce a symmetrical
                    illumination of the whole system of webs in a perfectly dark field. It is also
                    obvious that by placing <hi rend="italic">p'</hi> at an intermediate position
                    between the centre and the extremes of its range any desired modification of
                    bright wire or bright field illumination can be obtained at pleasure.</p>
                <p>The light falling on the papier mâché hollow cone is intercepted at three points
                    by prisms, one of which <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> is shown in section. These
                    prisms are inserted in the cylinder which carries the foundation plate of the
                    micrometer box and rotate with it. Two of them divert light upon the reflectors
                    (seen from different points of view in figs. 16, 17, 20). The third prism after
                    two reflexions (figs. 16, 20) illuminates the micrometer head. The whole
                    arrangement is in the highest degree elegant, and we have found it most simple
                    and convenient in practice. The screen C (figs. 20 and 21)—made of thin copper
                    and attached to AB—effectually protects the observer’s eye from stray light from
                    the lamp.</p>
                <p>It has been found essential, in bright field illumination, when the highest
                    accuracy is desired, to have the illuminating rays parallel with the telescope
                    axis.</p>
                <p>In the best telescopes of the future some plan like that of Repsold’s, above
                    described, will doubtless be adopted. It is probable also that with the
                    introduction of condensers, in conjunction with the incandescent carbon light in
                    vacuum, electricity will ultimately supersede the oil or paraffin lamp in
                    illuminating astronomical instruments. A small “Swan lamp” can be placed
                    anywhere, is unaffected by wind, and gives off comparatively little heat. These
                    are most valuable qualities for the purpose in question.</p>
                <p>The astronomer-royal (Mr Christie) has recently used luminous paint to render the
                    measuring pointer of the Greenwich spectroscope visible at night. This paint,
                    after exposure during the day to sunlight, shines at night with a dull
                    phosphorescence sufficient to make the micrometer pointer, to which it is
                    applied, faintly visible, and, it is stated, with very satisfactory results.</p>

                <p>The discovery of the method of making measures by double images is stated to have
                    been first suggested by Roemer about 1678. But no such suggestion occurs in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Basis</hi><hi rend="italic">Astronomiae</hi> of Horre-bow
                    (Copenhagen, 1735), which contains the only works of Roemer that remain to us.
                    It would appear that to Savary is due the first invention of a micrometer for
                    measurement by double image. His heliometer (described in a paper communicated
                    to the Royal Society in 1743, and printed, along with a letter from Short, in
                    <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1753,p. 156) was constructed by cutting
                    from a complete lens <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> the equal portions <hi
                    rend="italic">aghc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">acfe</hi> (fig. 22). The segments
                    <hi rend="italic">gbh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">efd</hi> so formed were then
                    attached to the end of a tube having an internal diameter represented by the
                    dotted circle (fig. 23). The width of each of the portions <hi rend="italic"
                    >aghc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">acfe</hi> cut away from the lens was made
                    slightly greater than the focal length of lens × tangent of sun's greatest
                    diameter. Thus at the focus two images of the sun were formed nearly in contact
                    as in fig. 24. The small interval between the adjacent limbs was then measured
                    with a wire micrometer.</p>
                <p>Savary also describes another form of heliometer, on the same principle, in which
                    the segments <hi rend="italic">aghc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">acfe</hi> are
                    utilized by cementing their edges <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ef</hi> together (fig. 25), and covering all except the portion
                    indicated by the unshaded circle. Savary expresses preference for this second
                    plan, and makes the pertinent remark that in both these models “the rays of red
                    light in the two solar images will be next to each other, which will ∙&lt;∙nder
                    the sun’s disk more easy to be observed than the violet ones.” This <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n265/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0265-0250"/> he mentions “because the glasses in these two
                    sorts are somewhat prismatical, but mostly those of the first model, which could
                    therefore bear no great charge” (magnifying power).</p>
                <p>A third model proposed by Savary consists of two complete lenses of equal focal
                    length, mounted in cylinders side by side, and attached to a strong brass plate
                    (fig. 26). Here, in order to fulfil the purposes of the previous models, the
                    distance of the centres of the lenses from each other should only slightly
                    exceed the tangent of sun’s diameter × focal length of lenses. Savary dwells on
                    the difficulty both of procuring lenses sufficiently equal in focus and of
                    accurately adjusting and centring them.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">Acad, de Paris,</hi> 1748,
                    Bouguer describes an instrument which he calls a heliometer. Lalande in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Astronomie</hi> (vol. ii. p. 639) mentions such a heliometer which
                    had been in his possession from the year 1753, and of which he gives a
                    representation on Plate XXVIII., fig. 186, of the same volume. Bouguer’s
                    heliometer was in fact similar to that of Savary’s third model, with the
                    important difference that, instead of both object-glasses being fixed, one of
                    them is movable by a screw provided with a divided head. No auxiliary filar
                    micrometer was required, as in Savary’s heliometer, to measure the interval
                    between the limbs of two adjacent images of the sun, it being only necessary to
                    turn the screw with the divided head to change the distance between the
                    object-glasses till the two images of the sun are in contact as in fig. 27. The
                    differences of the readings of the screw, when converted into arc, afford the
                    means of measuring the variations of the sun’s apparent diameter.</p>
                <p>On the 4th April 1754 Dollond communicated a paper to the Royal Society of London
                    <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> vol. xlviii. p. 551) in which he shows
                    that a micrometer can be much more easily constructed by dividing a single
                    object-glass through its axis than by the employment of two object-glasses. He
                    points out—(1) that a telescope with an objectglass so divided still produces a
                    single image of any object to which it may be directed, provided that the
                    optical centres of the segments are in coincidence <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    provided the segments retain the same relative positions to each other as before
                    the glass was cut); (2) that if the segments are separated in any direction two
                    images of the object viewed will be produced; (3) that the most convenient
                    direction of separation for micrometric purposes is to slide these straight
                    edges one along the other as the figure on the margin (fig. 28) represents them:
                    “for thus they may be moved without suffering any false light to come in between
                    them; and by this way of removing them the distance between their centres may be
                    very conveniently measured, viz., by having a vernier’s division fixed to the
                    brass work that holds one segment, so as to slide along a scale on the plate to
                    which the other part of the glass is fitted.”</p>
                <p>Dollond then points out three different types in which a glass so divided and
                    mounted may be used as a micrometer :—</p>
                <p>“1. It may be fixed at the end of a tube, of a suitable length to its focal
                    distance, as an object-glass,— the other end of the tube having an eye-glass
                    fitted as usual in astronomical telescopes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“2.</hi> It may be applied to the end of a tube much shorter
                    than its focal distance, by having another convex glass within the tube, to
                    shorten the focal distance of that which is cut in two.</p>
                <p>“3. It may be applied to the open end of a reflecting telescope, either of the
                    Newtonian or the Cassegrain construction.”</p>
                <p>Dollond adds his opinion that the third type is “much the best and most
                    convenient of the three”; yet it is the first type that has survived the test of
                    time and experience, and which is in fact the modern heliometer</p>
                <p>Fig. 29 illustrates Dollond’s divided object-glass heliometer of the third type.
                    A is the end of the reflecting telescope, upon which the adapter B is fitted. B
                    carries a wheel (not seen in the figure) formed of a ring racked at the outer
                    edge, and fixed to the brass plate CO, so that a pinion moved by the handle D
                    may turn it into any position. Two plates F, G, with the attached semi-lenses,
                    move in slides fixed to the plate CC, —simultaneous motion, in contrary
                    directions, being communicated to them by turning the handle E, which drives a
                    concealed pinion that works in the two racks seen in the highest part of the
                    figure. The amount of separation of the semi-lenses is measured by a scale 5
                    inches long, subdivided to ⅛th of an inch, and read by a vernier on the plate F
                    to ^⅞ιyth of an inch. In practical use this micrometer has never given
                    satisfactory results (see Mosotti in the <hi rend="italic">Efemeride</hi> of
                    Milan for 1821). It must be remembered, however, that when Dollond gave
                    preference to this type he had not invented the achromatic object-glass; his
                    preference was fully justified under these circumstances. So far as we know no
                    heliometer with a divided achromatic object-glass was ever made by the elder
                    Dollond on the principle of his first type. His son, however, made what he
                    called an object-glass micrometer, which was a great improvement on the elder
                    Dollond’s second type.</p>
                <p>In the older construction the brass mountings of the semi-lenses obstructed the
                    light entering the telescope in proportion to their separation, and the images
                    were so coloured as to prevent the use of any but very low powers. In the later
                    construction the movable segments are formed from a negative achromatic lens of
                    much larger aperture than the object-glass of the telescope with which the
                    micrometer is employed; and, for convenience in mounting, the segments <hi
                    rend="italic">gbh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">edf</hi> (fig. 22) are removed. In
                    the fine example of this instrument at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope,
                    the movable lenses consist of segments of the shape <hi rend="italic">gach</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">eacf</hi> (fig. 22) cut from a complete negative
                    achromatic combination of 8∣ inches aperture and about 41- feet focal length,
                    composed of a double concave flint lens and a double convex crown. This is
                    applied to an excellent achromatic telescope of 3⅜ inches aperture and 42 inches
                    focal length. The instrument is represented in fig. 30; the same letters
                    indicate the analogous parts of fig. 29. The frame CO, moved by teeth on its
                    outer edge, carries one of the halves G of the lens, and a similar frame with
                    teeth carries the other half F. A scale 8⅛ inches long is fastened like an
                    edge-bar to the frame of the segment G, and each inch is subdivided into twenty
                    parts, which are read off by a vernier to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> √ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> cτ</hi> th of an inch, and, by estimation, this can easily be
                    carried to ^∏∏rth or ^⅛⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> th of an inch. The two
                    movable frames are imbedded in a fixed plate HH, screwed to the adapter B,
                    having a circular hole in its middle equal to the diameter of the object-glass.
                    The slide of the segment G is moved by turning the milled head to the right of
                    A, and the other segment F by means of a rack and pinion on the opposite side,
                    the latter being turned from the eye-end by a handle not seen in the figure. A
                    screw is provided for clamping the slide of the segment G, as it is intended
                    that only the segment F shall be moved in making the final bisection. There is
                    an index attached to the slide of G, reading on a rough scale engraved on the
                    plate H, which is obviously intended for setting the optical centre of the
                    segment G approximately as far from the optical axis of the telescope on one
                    side as the optical centre of the segment F will be on the other side during the
                    intended measurement. This arrangement not only permits the measurement of
                    angles twice as great as would be possible if one segment were fixed, but is
                    also important in increasing the symmetry of the measures. The vernier is placed
                    at one end of the scale when the optical centres of the segments are in
                    coincidence, and is provided with screws at I, which are intended for adjusting
                    the zero of the scale. The younger Dollond has in this model retrograded, in
                    some respects, from the admirable example of his father, who, as shown in fig.
                    29, not only gave the lenses automatic opposite motion symmetrically with
                    respect to the axis of the telescope, but seems also to have provided for entire
                    elimination of index error by making it possible to observe all angles on
                    opposite sides of zero—a precaution possible in the later form only when very
                    small angles are measured. Rotation of the micrometer in position angle is
                    provided for as in the earlier form, but the instrument is not furnished with a
                    position circle.</p>
                <p>With one of these instruments of somewhat smaller dimensions (telescope 2⅜ inches
                    aperture and 3⅜ feet focus) Triesnecker made a series of measurements at the
                    observatory of Vienna which has been recently reduced by Dr Schur of Strasburg

                    of a measure on one night was ± 0"∙44. Jupiter was measured on eleven nights in
                    the months of June and July 1794; from these measures Schur derives the values

                    xix. 102). From a series of measures of the angle between Jupiter’s satellites
                    and the planet, made in June and July 1794 and in August and September 1795,
                    Schur finds the mass of Jupiter — <hi rend="subscript

                    value of the mass derived from modern researches. The probable errors for the
                    measures of one night are ±O"'577, ±0"'889, ±0"∙542, ±1"O96, for Satellites I.,
                    II., III., and IV. respectively. It is probable that Triesnecker deduced the
                    index error from his measures of the diameter of Jupiter, as, in 1794, the
                    measures of diameter are made on the same nights with those of the measures of
                    distance of the satellites, and it is possible that measures of diameter may
                    have been made in 1795 but not published.</p>
                <p>Considering the accuracy of these measures (an accuracy far surpassing that of
                    any contemporary observations), it is somewhat surprising that this form of
                    micrometer was never systematically used in any sustained or important
                    astronomical researches, although a number of instruments of the kind were made
                    by Dollond. Probably the last example of its employment is an observation of the
                    transit of Mercury (November 4, 1868) by Mr Mann, at the Royal Observatory, Cape
                    of Good Hope <hi rend="italic">{Monthly Notices R. A. S.,</hi> vol. xxix. p.
                    197-209). The most important part, however, which this type of instrument seems
                    to have played in the history of astronomy arises from the fact that one of them
                    was in the possession of Bessel at Königsberg during the time when his new
                    observatory there was being built. In 1812 Bessel measured with it the angle
                    between the components of the double star 61 Cygni and observed the great comet
                    of 1811. He also observed the eclipse of the sun on May 4, 1818. In the
                    discussion of these observations <hi rend="italic">{Königsberger Beobacht.,</hi>
                    Abth. 5, p. iv) he found that the index error of the scale changed
                    systematically in different position angles by quantities which were independent
                    of the direction of gravity relative to the position angle under measurement,
                    but which depended solely on the direction of the measured position angle
                    relative to a fixed radius of the object-glass. Bessel attributed this to
                    non-homogeneity in the object-glass, and determined with great care the
                    necessary corrections. But he was so delighted with the general performance of
                    the instrument, with the sharpness of the images, and the possibilities which a
                    kindred construction offered for the measurement of considerable angles with
                    micrometric accuracy, that he resolved, when he should have the choice of a new
                    telescope for the observatory, to secure some form of heliometer.</p>
                <p>Nor is it difficult to imagine the probable course of reasoning which led Bessel
                    to select the model of his new heliometer. Why, he might ask, should he not
                    select the simple form of Dollond’s first type? Given the achromatic
                    object-glass, why should not it be divided? This construction would give all the
                    advantage of the younger Dollond’s object-glass micrometer and more than its
                    sharpness of definition, without liability to the systematic errors which may be
                    due to want of homogeneity of the object-glass; for the lenses will not be
                    turned with respect to each other, but, in measurement, will always have the
                    same relation in position angle to the line joining the objects under
                    observation. It is true that the scale will require to be capable of being read
                    with much greater accuracy than <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> √&lt; <hi

                    focus, would correspond with 2" of arc. But, after all, this is no practical
                    difficulty,—for screws can be used to separate the lenses, and, by these screws,
                    as in a Gascoigne micrometer, the separation of the lenses can be measured; or
                    we can have scales for this purpose, read by microscopes, like the

                    instruments. In 1824 the great Königsberg heliometer was commenced, and it was
                    completed in 1829.</p>
                <p>To sum up briefly the history of the heliometer. The first application of the
                    divided object-glass and the employment of double images in astronomical
                    measures is due to Savary in 1743. To Bouguer in 1748 is due the true conception
                    of measurement by double image without the auxiliary aid of a filar micrometer,
                    viz., by changing the distance between two object-glasses of equal focus. To
                    Dollond in 1754 we owe the combination of Savary’s idea of the divided
                    object-glass with Bouguer’s method of measurement, and the construction of the
                    first really practical heliometers. To Fraunhofer, some time not long previous
                    to 1820, is due, so far as we can ascertain, the construction of the first
                    heliometer with an achromatic divided object-glass, <hi rend="italic">i.c.,</hi>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Double-Image Micrometers with Divided Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>Various micrometers have been invented besides the heliometer for measuring by
                    double image. Ramsden’s dioptric micrometer consists of a divided lens placed in
                    the conjugate focus of the innermost lens of the erecting eye-tube of a
                    terrestrial telescope. The inventor claimed that it would supersede the
                    heliometer, but it has never done anything for astronomy. Dollond claims the
                    independent invention and first construction of asimilar instrument(Pearson's
                    <hi rend="italic">Practical Astronomy,</hi> vol. ii. p. 182). Of these and
                    kindred instruments only two types have proved of practical value. Amici of
                    Modena <hi rend="italic">{Mem. Soc. Ital.,</hi> xvii. (1815) pp. 344-359)
                    describes a micrometer in which a negative lens is introduced between the
                    eye-piece and the object-glass. This lens is divided and mounted like a
                    heliometer object-glass; the separation of the lenses produces the required
                    double image, and is measured by a screw. Dawes has very successfully used this
                    micrometer in conjunction with a filar micrometer, and finds that the precision
                    of the measures is in this way greatly increased <hi rend="italic">{Monthly

                    round images, instead of the elongated images which are otherwise inevitable
                    when the rays pass through a divided lens of which the optical centres are not
                    in coincidence, viz., “the introduction of a diaphragm having two circular
                    apertures touching each other in a point coinciding with the line of collimation
                    of the telescope, and the diameter of each aperture <hi rend="italic">exactly

                    lose a certain amount of light, we see no reason wΙιy they may not readily be
                    made slightly less. Dawes found the best method for the purpose in question was
                    to limit the aperture of the object-glass by a diaphragm having a double
                    circular aperture, placing the line joining the centres of the circles
                    approximately in the position angle under measurement. Dawes successfully
                    employed the double circular aperture also with Amici’s micrometer. The present
                    writer has successfully used a similar plan in measuring position angles of α

                    essentially the same in principle as Amici’s micrometer, except that the divided

                    SteinheiΓs description, in which he states that the images have not all
                    desirable precision,—a fault perhaps inevitable in all micrometers with divided

                    still more favourable. This particular instrument has historical interest,
                    having led Struve to some of those criticisms of the Pulkowa heliometer which
                    ultimately bore such valuable fruit (see below).</p>
                <p>Ramsden <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> vol. xix. p. 419) has suggested the
                    division of the small speculum of a Cassegrain telescope and the production of
                    double image by micrometric rotation of the semispecula in the plane passing
                    through their axis. Brewster <hi rend="italic">(Ency. Brit.,</hi> 8th ed., vol.
                    xiv. p. 749) proposes a plan on a like principle, by dividing the plane mirror
                    of a Newtonian telescope. Again, in an ocular heliometer by Steinheil double
                    image is similarly produced by a divided prism of total reflexion placed in
                    parallel rays. But practically these last three methods are failures. In the
                    last the field is full of false light, and it is not possible to give
                    sufficiently minute and steady separation to the images; and there are of
                    necessity a collimator, two prisms of total reflexion, and a small telescope
                    through which the rays must pass; consequently there is great loss of light.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Micrometers Depending on Double Refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>To the Abbé Rochon <hi rend="italic">(Jour, de Phys.,</hi> liii., 1801, pp.
                    169-198) is due the happy idea of applying the two images formed by double
                    refraction to the construction of a micrometer. He fell upon a most ingenious
                    plan of doubling the amount of double refraction of a prism by using two prisms
                    of rock-crystal, so cut out of the solid as to give each the same quantity of
                    double refraction, and yet to double the quantity in the effect produced. The
                    combination so formed is known as Rochon’s prism. Such a prism he placed between
                    the object-glass and eye-piece of a telescope. The separation of the images
                    increases as the prism is approached to the objectglass, and diminishes as it is
                    approached towards the eye-piece.</p>
                <p>Arago <hi rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi> xxiv., 1847, pp. 400-402) found
                    that in Rochon’s micrometer, when the prism was approached close to the
                    eye-piece for the measurement of very small angles, the smallest imperfections
                    in the crystal or its surfaces were inconveniently magnified. He therefore
                    selected for any particular measurement such a Rochon prism as when fixed
                    between the eye and the eye-piece <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> where a sunshade
                    is usually placed) would, combined with the normal eye-piece employed, bring the
                    images about to be measured nearly in contact. He then altered the magnifying
                    power by sliding the field lens of the eye-piece (which was fitted with a
                    slipping tube for the purpose) along the eye-tube, till the images were brought
                    into contact. By a scale attached to the sliding tube the magnifying power of
                    the eye-piece was deduced, and this combined with the angle of the prism
                    employed gave the angle measured. If <hi rend="italic">p"</hi> is the refracting
                    angle of the prism, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the magnifying power of the
                    eye-piece, then <hi rend="italic">p"∕n</hi> will be the distance observed. Arago
                    made many measures of the diameters of the planets with such a micrometer.</p>
                <p>Dollond <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1821, pp. 101-103) describes a
                    doubleimage micrometer of his own invention in which a sphere of rock-crystal is
                    substituted for the eye-lens of an ordinary eye-piece. 1 n this installment

                    shall be parallel to that motion. The angle of rotation is measured on the

                    The measures can be made on both sides of zero for eliminating index error.
                    There are considerable difficulties of construction, but these have been
                    successfully overcome by Dollond; and in the hands of Dawes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mem. R. A. S.,</hi> xxxv. p. 144 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> such instruments
                    have done valuable service. They are liable to the objection that their
                    employment is limited to the measurement of very small angles, viz., 13" or 14"
                    when the magnifying power is 100, and varying inversely as the power. Yet the
                    beautiful images which these micrometers give permit the measurement of very
                    difficult objects as a check on measures with the parallel-wire micrometer.</p>

                    mounting is shown in the figure, as it resembles in every respect the usual
                    Fraunhofer mounting. An adapter <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is fixed on a
                    telescopetube, made of wood, in Fraunhofer’s usual fashion. To this adapter is
                    attached a flat circular flange <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> The slides carrying
                    the segments of the divided object-glass are mounted on a plate, which is fitted
                    and ground to rotate smoothly on the flange <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> Rotation
                    is communicated by a pinion, turned by the handle <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    (concealed in the figure), which works in teeth cut on the edge of the flange
                    <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> The counterpoise <hi rend="italic">w</hi> balances the

                    serve to measure the separation of the segments. These screws are turned from
                    the eye-end by bevelled wheels and pinions, the latter connected with the
                    handles <hi rend="italic">a', b'.</hi> The reading micrometers <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> /also serve to measure, independently, the separation of the segments,
                    by scales attached to the slides; such measurements can be employed as a check
                    on those made by the screws. The measurement of position angles is provided for
                    by a graduated circle attached to the head. There is also a position circle,
                    attached at <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to the eye-end, provided with a slide to
                    move the eye-piece radially from the axis of the telescope, and with a
                    micrometer to measure the distance of an object from that axis. The ring which
                    carries the supports of the handles <hi rend="italic">a', b', c</hi> is capable
                    of a certain amount of rotation on the tube. The weight of the handles and their
                    supports is balanced by the counterpoise <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> This ring is
                    necessary in order to allow the rods to follow the micrometer heads when the
                    position angle is changed. Complete rotation of the head is obviously impossible
                    because of the interference of the declination axis with the rods, and
                    therefore, in some angles, objects cannot be measured in two positions of the
                    circle. The object-glass has an aperture of 6⅛ inches, and 102 inches focal
                    length.</p>
                <p>There are three methods in which this heliometer can be used.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First Method.—</hi> One of the segments is fixed in the axis of
                    the telescope, and the eye-piece is also placed in the axis. Measures are made
                    with the moving segment displaced alternately on opposite sides of the fixed
                    segment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second Method.—</hi> One segment is fixed, and the measures are
                    made as in the first method, excepting that the eye-piece is placed
                    symmetrically with respect to the images under measurement. For this purpose the
                    position angle of the eye-piece micrometer is set to that of the head, and the
                    eye-piece is displaced from the axis of the tube (in the direction of the
                    movable segment) by an amount equal to half the angle under measurement.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Third Method.—</hi> The eye-piece is fixed in the axis, and the
                    segments are symmetrically displaced from the axis each by an amount equal to
                    half the angle measured.</p>
                <p>Of these methods Bessel generally employed the first because of its simplicity,
                    notwithstanding that it involved a resetting of the right ascension and
                    declination of the axis of the tube with each reversal of the segments. The
                    chief objections to the method are that, as one star is in the axis of the
                    telescope and the other displaced from it, the images are not both in focus of
                    the eye-piece,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    distances of the optical centres of the segments from the eye-piece are in this
                    method as 1: secant of the angle under measurement. In Bessel’s heliometer this
                    would amount to a difference of⅜⅞ <hi rend="subscript"> li</hi> th of an inch
                    when an angle of 1* is measured. For two degrees the difference would amount to
                    nearly ⅛th of an inch. Bessel confined his measures to distances considerably
                    less than 1°.</p></note> and the rays from the two stars do not make the same
                    angle with the optical axis of each segment. Thus the two images under
                    measurement are not defined with equal sharpness and symmetry. The second method
                    is free from the objection of non-coincidence in focus of the images, but is
                    more troublesome in practice from the necessity for frequent readjustment of the
                    position of the eye-piece. The third method is the most symmetrical of all, both
                    in observation and reduction; but it was not employed by Bessel, on the ground
                    that it involved the determination of the errors of two screws instead of one.
                    On the other hand it is not necessary to reset the telescope after each reversal
                    of the segments.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In

                <p>When Bessel ordered the Königsberg heliometer, he was anxious to have the
                    segments made to move in cylindrical slides, of which the radius should be equal
                    to the focal length of the object-glass. Fraunhofer, however, did not execute
                    this wish, on the ground that the mechanical difficulties were too great.</p>
                <p>Wichmann states <hi rend="italic">(Konigsb. Beobach.,</hi> xxx. p. 4) that Bessel
                    had indicated, by notes in his handbooks, the following points which should be
                    kept in mind in the construction of future heliometers:— (1) The segments should
                    move in cylindrical slides;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This most important improvement would permit any two stars under measurement
                    each to be viewed in the optical axis of each segment. The optical centres of
                    the segments would also remain at the same distance from tire eye piece at all
                    angles of separation. Thus, in measuring the largest as well as the smallest
                    angles, the images of both stars would be equally symmetrical and equally well
                    in focus. Modern heliometers made with cylindrical slides measure angles over
                    two degrees, the images remaining as sharp and perfect as when the smallest
                    angles are measured.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> x</hi> (2) the screw

                    simultaneous equal and opposite movement;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Steinheil applied such motion to a double-image micrometer
                    made for Struve, This instrument suggested to Struve the above-mentioned idea of
                    employing a similar motion for the heliometer.</p></note> and (2) to make the
                    tube of brass instead of wood; to attach the heliometer head firmly to this
                    tube; to place the eye-piece permanently in the axis of the telescope; and to
                    fix a strong cradle on the end of the declination axis, in which the tube, with
                    the attached head and eye-piece, could rotate on its axis.</p>
                <p>Both suggestions are important. The first is originally the idea of Dollond (fig.
                    29); its advantages were overlooked by his son (description of fig. 30), and it
                    seems to have been quite forgotten till resuggested by Struve. But the method is
                    not available if the separation is to be measured by screws; it is found, in
                    that case, that the direction of the final motion of turning of the screw must
                    always be such as to produce motion of the segment against gravity, otherwise
                    the ‘ ‘ loss of time” is apt to be variable. Thus the simple connexion of the
                    two screws by cog-wheels to give them automatic opposite motion is not an
                    available method unless the separation of the segments is independently measured
                    by scales.</p>
                <p>Struve’s second suggestion has been adopted in nearly all succeeding heliometers.
                    It permits complete rotation of the tube and measurement of all angles in
                    reversed positions of the circle; the handles that move the slides can be
                    brought down to the eye-end, inside the tube, and consequently made to rotate
                    with it; and the position circle may be placed at the end of the cradle next the
                    eyeend where it is convenient of access. Struve also points out that by
                    attaching a fine scale to the focussing slide of the eye-piece, and knowing the
                    coefficient of expansion of the brass tube, the means would be provided for
                    determining the absolute change of the focal length of the object-glass at any
                    time by the simple process of focussing on a double star. This, with a knowledge
                    of the temperature of the screw or scale and its coefficient of expansion, would
                    enable the change of screw value to be determined at any instant. Or, if we
                    suppose the temperature of the instrument to be the same in all its parts, the
                    changed scale value becomes simply a function of the reading of the focal
                    scale.</p>
                <p>It is probable that the Bonn heliometer was in course of construction before
                    these suggestions of Struve were published or discussed, since its construction
                    resembles that of the Königsberg and Pulkowa instruments. Its dimensions are
                    similar to those of the former instrument. Bessel, having been consulted by the
                    celebrated statesman Sir Robert Peel, on behalf of the Radcliffe trustees, as to
                    what instrument, added to the Radcliffe Observatory, would probably most promote
                    the advancement of astronomy, strongly advised the selection of a heliometer.
                    The order for the instrument was given to the Repsolds in 1840, but “various
                    circumstances, for which the makers are not responsible, contributed to delay
                    the completion of the instrument, which was not delivered before the winter of
                    1848.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Manuel Johnson,

                    completed in the end of the same year. This splendid instrument has a superb
                    object-glass of 7⅜ inches aperture and 126 inches focal length. The makers
                    availed themselves of Bessel’s suggestion to make the segments move in
                    cylindrical slides, and of Struve’s to have the head attached to a brass tube;
                    the eye-piece is set permanently in the axis, and the whole rotates in a cradle
                    attached to the declination axis. They provided a splendid, rigidly mounted,
                    equatorial stand, fitted with every luxury in the way of slow motion, and scales
                    for measuring the displacement of the segments were read by powerful micrometers

                    was rendered incandescent by a voltaic current; a small Swan light and condenser
                    would probably now be found more satisfactory.</p></note> It is somewhat curious
                    that, though Struve’s second suggestion was adopted, his first was overlooked by
                    the makers. But it is still more curious that it was not afterwards carried out,
                    for the communication of automatic symmetrical motion to both segments only
                    involves a simple alteration previously described. But, as it came from the
                    hands of the makers in 1849, the Oxford heliometer was incomparably the most
                    powerful and perfect instrument in the world for the highest order of
                    micrometric research. It so remained, unrivalled in every respect, till 1873; it
                    remains still, optically, the most powerful heliometer in the world; and, with a
                    few alterations, it might almost rival the most recent instruments in practical
                    convenience and accuracy. These alterations, all of which could be made without
                    great difficulty, are the following :—</p>
                <p>(a) Beyond the automatic symmetrical motion above-described, the instrument
                    should be fitted with means for adjusting the screens from the eye-end (see
                    footnote <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> in last column).</p>
                <p>(δ) The arrangement of the scales should be changed. At present both scales are
                    read separately by separate micrometers, each relative to a separate fiducial
                    line. What the observer requires is the difference of the readings of the two
                    scales, and this can obviously be most quickly and accurately obtained if the
                    edges of the two scales are brought together, and both are read, relatively to
                    each other, by the same micrometer.</p>
                <p>(c) The unsatisfactory motion in position angle should be replaced by the action
                    of a pinion (attached to the cradle) in the teeth of a λvheel (attached to the
                    tube).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This has been
                    recently carried out by Stone, the present Radcliffe observer on Gill’s
                    suggestion.</p></note><hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> The position circle should be
                    read by telescopes or microscopes attached to the cradle, and accessible from
                    the eye-end.</p>
                <p>(e) It would add greatly to the rapidity of work and the ease of the observer if
                    a small declination circle were attached to the crosshead, capable of being read
                    from the eye-end.</p>
                <p>As the transit of Venus of 1874 approached, preparations were set on foot by the
                    German Government in good time; a commission of the most celebrated astronomers
                    was appointed, and it was resolved that the heliometer should be the instrument
                    chiefly relied on. The four long-neglected small heliometers made by Fraunhofer
                    were brought into requisition. Fundamental alterations were made upon
                    them:—their wooden tubes were replaced by tubes of metal; means of measuring the
                    focal point were provided; symmetrical motion was given to the slides; scales on
                    each slide were provided instead of screws for measuring the separation of the
                    segments, and both scales were read by the same micrometer microscope; a
                    metallic thermometer was added to determine the temperature of the scales. These
                    small instruments have since done admirable work in the hands of Schur, Hartwig,
                    Kustner, and Elkin.</p>
                <p>The Russian Government ordered three new heliometers (each of 4 inches aperture
                    and 5 feet focal length) from the Repsolds, and the design for their
                    construction was superintended by Struve, Auwers, and Winnecke, the last-named
                    making the necessary experiments at Carlsruhe. Fig. 34 represents the type of
                    instrument which re-</p>

                    unclamp in declination, lower and read off the head, and then restore the
                    telescope to its former declination reading, the clockwork meanwhile following
                    the stars in right ascension. The setting of both lenses symmetrically would,
                    under such circumstances, be very tedious.</p>

                    reads from the eye-end.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>These four Repsold heliometers proved to be excellent instruments, easy and
                    convenient in use, and yielding results of very high accuracy in measuring
                    distances. Their slow motion in position angle, however, was not all that could
                    be desired. When small movements were communicated to the handle <hi

                    acting on a small toothed wheel clamped to the rod connected with the driving
                    pinion, there was apt to be a torsion of the rod rather than an immediate
                    action. Thus the slow motion would take place by jerks instead of with the
                    necessary smoothness and certainty. When the heliometer part of Lord Lindsay’s
                    heliometer was ac quired by Gill in 1879, he changed the manner of imparting the
                    motion in question. A square toothed racked wheel was applied to the tube at <hi
                    rend="italic">τ</hi> (fig. 34). This wheel is acted on by a tangent screw whose
                    bearings are attached to the cradle; the screw is turned by means of a handle
                    supported by bearings attached to the cradle, and coming within convenient reach
                    of the observer’s hand. The tube turns smoothly in the racked wheel, or can be
                    clamped to it at the will of the observer. This alteration and the new
                    equatorial mounting have been admirably made by Grubb; the result is completely
                    successful. The instrument so altered has been in constant use at the Cape
                    Observatory since March 1881 in determining the parallax of the more interesting
                    southern stars.</p>
                <p>Still more recently the Repsolds have completed a new heliometer for Yale
                    College, New Haven, United States. The object-glass is of 6 inches aperture and
                    98 inches focal length. The mounting, the tube, objectivecell, slides, &amp;c.,
                    are all of steel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    primary object was to have the object-glass mounted in steel cells, which more
                    nearly correspond in expansion with glass. It became then desirable to make the
                    head of steel for sake of uniformity of material, and the advantages of steel in
                    lightness and rigidity for the tube then became evident.</p></note> The

                    older forms. A great advance in accuracy was, no doubt, made when the screw was

                    use of photography to record the readings of astronomical circles, and since his
                    day “Swan lights” and “sensitive dry plates” seems to have brought his
                    suggestion within the range of practice. A special microscope, fitted with an
                    aplanatic photographic objective and a well-contrived carrier, might be made
                    automatically to expose a different part of a narrow dry plate, by mere pressure
                    or turning of a button after each bisection. Each plate might easily record the
                    sixteen bisections which constitute a complete measure of two pairs of stars (as
                    in a parallax determination). As it is only necessary to photograph two
                    divisions of each scale, the photographic enlargement of these divisions need
                    only be limited by the sensitiveness of the plates and the power of the
                    illumination to produce a picture in a conveniently short space of time. Tire
                    plates employed at night could be conveniently developed the following day and
                    measured with a special apparatus at any convenient time and with almost any
                    desired accuracy. Were such a system reduced to practice it would at least
                    double, perhaps treble, an observer’s possible output of work.</p>
                <p>Gill has introduced a powerful auxiliary to the accuracy of heliometer measures
                    in the shape of a reversing prism placed in front of the eye-piece, between the
                    latter and the observer’s eye. If measures are made by placing the image of a
                    star in the centre of the disk of a planet, the observer may have a tendency to
                    do so systematically in error from some acquired habit or from natural
                    astigmatism of the eye. But by rotating the prism 90° the image is presented
                    entirely reversed to the eye, so that in the mean of measures made in two such
                    positions personal error is eliminated. Similarly the prism may be used for the
                    study and elimination of personal errors depending on the angle made by a double
                    star with the vertical. The best plan of mounting such a prism has been found to
                    be the following. Z', Z <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (fig. 37) are the eye
                    lens and field lens respectively of a Merz positive eye-piece. In this
                    construction the lenses are much closer together and the diaphragm for the eye
                    is much farther from the lenses than in Ramsden’s eye-piece. The prism <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> is fitted accurately into brass slides (care has to be
                    taken in the construction to place the prism so that an object in the centre of
                    the field will so remain when the eye-piece is rotated in its adapter). There is
                    a collar, clamped by the screw at S, which is so adjusted that the eye-piece is
                    in focus when pushed home, in its adapter, to this collar. The prism and
                    eye-piece are then rotated together in the adapter.</p>

                    Motion.</hi></p>
                <p>Advantage is often taken of the diurnal motion to measure the relative positions
                    of stars. The varieties of reticules and scales that have been employed are far
                    too numerous even for mention in detail. The following are the means and methods
                    by which most work has been done, and they are typical of all the others. In the
                    focus of his meridian telescope Lacaille had a brass diaphragm in which was cut
                    a hole, having parallel, sharp, straight edges of the shape shown in fig. 38.
                    The longer diagonal of the rhomboid so formed was at right angles, and the
                    shorter parallel, to the diurnal motion. The method of observation consisted in
                    noting the instant of ingress and egress of each star which presented itself.
                    The mean of the times thus noted for each star gave the time of its transit over
                    the imaginary line <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> whilst the difference between the
                    instant of ingress and that of egress (converted into arc by the known
                    approximate declination) gave the length of the chord traversed by the star
                    parallel to the imaginary line <hi rend="italic">cd.</hi> Hence (the dimensions
                    of the rhomboid being known) the difference of the star’s declination from the
                    line <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> became known (the observer was of course careful
                    to note whether the star passed to north or south of <hi rend="italic">cd).</hi>
                    Thus every star that crossed the field was observed, all their right ascensions
                    were referred to the clock-time of passing <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and all
                    their declinations to that of <hi rend="italic">cd;</hi> hence their mutual
                    differences of right ascension and declination were known. In this way, in the
                    short space of ten months, Lacaille observed nearly ten thousand stars at the
                    Cape of Good Hope in the years 1751-52.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    glass, the straight edge of which (truly ground) crosses the centre of the field
                    of view at right angles to the diurnal motion of the stars. Differences of right
                    ascension were directly observed at this edge, whilst differences of declination
                    were noted by strong dark lines drawn at right angles to the edge at each 10' of
                    arc. A telescope of 3 inches aperture with a magnifying power of 10 diameters
                    commanded a field of 3° 20' in declination. One observer was placed at the
                    telescope, another at the clock. The telescope observer marked the instant when
                    the star touched the glass edge, by calling sharply the word “eight” or “nine,”
                    &amp;c., which also indicated the magnitude; the same observer also noted and
                    recorded the reading of the declination scale (where the star crossed it),
                    without removing his eye from the telescope. The clock observer wrote down the
                    magnitude called out by the telescope observer, and the instant by the clock
                    when the word was given. The two records were then compared after the
                    observations of the night were over. In this way Schönfeld and Krueger
                    (Argelander’s assistants) observed and catalogued about three hundred thousand
                    stars. The probable error of an observation is about ±0 ’ 7 sec. in right

                <p>There is an ingenious mode of registering differences of declination that has
                    been in use at the Berlin Observatory since 1879, and is described by Dr Knarre

                    The instrument is called a declinograph. It has a web moved in declination by a
                    quick-acting screw; the same screw carries a travelling pricker or point. The
                    observer having bisected a star by the wire has simply to compress an
                    india-rubber ball connected by a flexible tube with a thin metal box made on the
                    principle of the vacuum chamber of an aneroid barometer. The expansion of this
                    box so produced brings a sheet of paper in contact with two prickers, one the
                    movable pricker before mentioned, the other a fixed pricker. The action of the
                    vacuum box also automatically shifts the paper (a long roll) by a small quantity
                    at each observation, so that successive observations are recorded in regular
                    order. To obtain the observed differences of declination it is then only
                    necessary to measure with a glass scale (divided for the special telescope to
                    10") the distance of each record of the moving pricker from the fixed pricker.
                    It is found, with this declinograph on the Berlin equatorial, that the observed
                    declinations have only a probable error of ±0" <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9.
                    It is obvious that by using a chronograph in conjunction with this instrument
                    both right ascensions and declinations could be recorded with great accuracy and
                    rapidity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Micrometers.</hi></p>
                <p>Clausen in 1841 <hi rend="italic">(Ast. Nach.,</hi> No. 414) proposed a form of
                    micrometer consisting of a divided plate of parallel glass placed within the
                    cone of rays from the object-glass at right angles to the telescope axis. One
                    half of this plane remains fixed, the other half is movable. When the
                    inclination of the movable half with respect to the axis of the telescope is
                    changed by rotation about an axis at right angles to the plane of division, two
                    images are produced. The amount of separation is very small, and depends on the
                    thickness of the glass, the index of refraction, and the focal length of the
                    telescope. Secchi <hi rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi> xli., 1855, p. 906)
                    gives an account of some experiments with a similar micrometer; and Porro <hi
                    rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi> xli. p. 1058) claims the original invention
                    and construction of such a micrometer in 1842. Clausen, however, has undoubted
                    priority. Helmholtz in his “Ophthalmometer” has employed Clausen’s principle,
                    but arranges the plates so that both move symmetrically in opposite directions
                    with respect to the telescope axis. Should Clausen’s micrometer be employed as
                    an astronomical instrument it would be well to adopt the improvement of
                    Helmholtz.</p>
                <p>Burton and Grubb <hi rend="italic">(Monthly Notices,</hi> vol. xli. p. 59), after
                    calling attention to Lamont’s paper <hi rend="italic">(Jahrbuch der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">K. S. b.</hi><hi rend="italic">München,</hi> p. 187) and Littrow’s
                    paper <hi rend="italic">(Proc, of Vienna Acad, of Sciences,</hi> vol. xx. p.
                    253) on a like subject, proceed to describe a most ingenious form of “Ghost
                    Micrometer,” in which the <hi rend="italic">image</hi> of a fine line or lines
                    ruled in (or rather cut through) a silver film deposited on glass is formed at
                    the common focus of an object-glass and eye-piece of a telescope. A faint light
                    being thrown on the outside of the silvered plate, there appear bright lines in
                    the field of view. We have not had an opportunity of testing this, nor Grubb’s
                    more recent models; but, should it be found possible to produce such images
                    satisfactorily, without distortion and with an apparatus convenient and rigid in
                    form, such micrometers will probably supersede the filar micrometer. Their
                    absolute freedom from diffraction, the perfect control of the illumination and
                    thickness of the lines, and the accuracy with which it will be possible to
                    construct scales for zone observations will be important features of the new
                    method.</p>
