                    (1761-1809), the only English general who has gained lasting fame by the conduct
                    of a retreat, was the son of Dr Moore (the subject of the preceding notice), and
                    was born at Glasgow on 13th November 1761. It was his appointment as tutor to
                    the young duke of Hamilton which procured for John Moore educational advantages
                    by which he profited so much as to be called in after life the most cultivated
                    officer in the army. It was then the fashion for young noblemen to travel from
                    court to court, and Moore accompanied his father and the duke to all the chief
                    capitals in Europe, until he was suddenly ordered in 1777 to join the 51st
                    regiment, in which he had been appointed an ensign. He learned his drill at
                    Minorca, and in 1779 was appointed lieutenant and paymaster in a new regiment
                    recently raised by the duke of Hamilton, with which he served in America till
                    the peace of 1783. In 1784 Moore, though but twenty-three years of age, was
                    returned by the duke of Hamilton as member of parliament for the united boroughs
                    of Selkirk, Peebles, and Linlithgow. In parliament he does not seem to have
                    opened his mouth, though he always voted with the Government; but he made some
                    useful friends, notably the duke of York and Pitt. In 1788 he was promoted to a
                    majority in the 51st regiment, and in 1790 he became lieutenantcolonel and
                    resigned his seat in parliament. He soon got his regiment in fine order, and in
                    1792 sailed with it for the Mediterranean. He was too late to assist at Toulon,
                    but was engaged throughout the operations in Corsica, and especially
                    distinguished himself at the taking of Calvi. After the expulsion of the French,
                    Moore became very intimate with Paoli and many of the leading Corsican patriots,
                    which intimacy was so obnoxious to Sir Gilbert Elliot, the viceroy, that Moore
                    was ordered to leave the island in fortyeight hours. Sir Gilbert’s hasty conduct
                    by no means met with approval in London, and Moore was gazetted
                    brigadier-general, and ordered to proceed with his brigade to the West Indies.
                    In April 1796 he reached Barbados, and at once became the right hand of Sir
                    Ralph Abercromby, the commander-in-chief. The first enterprise was the
                    reconquest of the island of St Lucia, which was completely occupied by an agent
                    of Victor Hugues with a mixed force of Caribs, negroes, and Frenchmen. The key
                    of the island was a fortified and almost impregnable height called the Morne
                    Fortuné, which was at last stormed, though with great loss, by the valour of
                    brigadier-generals Moore and Hope, who were to be comrades on a yet more
                    memorable field. After this success, Sir Ralph left the island, and appointed
                    Moore governor and commander-in-chief. A difficult post he found his government,
                    owing to the swarms of Caribs and negroes in the woods; but just as he was on
                    the point of triumphing he fell ill of yellow fever, and was ordered home. In
                    1798 he was well and again eager to be on active service, and he accompanied his
                    friend Abercromby over to Ireland, where he received the command of the Bandon
                    district. In the Irish rebellion of 1798 <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> he
                    distinguished himself by his activity in saving Wexford from destruction after
                    the battle of Vinegar Hill. His services were in universal request, and
                    Abercromby insisted upon his serving with him in the expedition to the Helder in
                    1799, where he did creditably all that was creditably done in that ill-managed
                    expedition. On his return from Holland he was made colonel of the 5 2d regiment,
                    and in 1800 accompanied Abercromby to the Mediterranean as major-general.</p>
                <p>Throughout the Egyptian expedition he commanded the reserve, and especially
                    distinguished himself at the battle of Alexandria, when he was wounded in three
                    places, and behaved with such distinction that he was recognized universally as
                    the greatest English general, now that Abercromby was gone. The short interval
                    of the peace of Amiens did not injure Moore’s prospects, and in 1803 he was
                    appointed commandant of the camp at Shorncliffe. Here he proved his greatness as
                    an organizer, for it was at this time that he organized those light regiments
                    which were to form the reserve in his own campaign and the light division in the
                    Peninsular War. While at Shorncliffe he renewed his intimacy with Pitt, who was
                    then residing at Walmer Castle, and who on his return to office made Moore a
                    knight of the Bath, and consulted him on every military project. Fox, when he
                    succeeded to office, showed the same appreciation of Moore, and in May 1806
                    appointed him second-in-command to his brother, General Fox, who was ordered
                    with a strong force to Sicily to supersede Sir John Stuart. Moore won but little
                    credit at this time, for there was none to gain, but employed his time,
                    according to Napier, in falling in love with Miss Fox, to whom, however, he
                    never proposed, fearing to be accepted for his position and not for himself. In
                    1807 he was able to escape from the intrigues of the Sicilian court, and was
                    ordered to Portugal, which he reached too late to make any defence of Lisbon,
                    already in the possession of the French. He then went home, and had four months’
                    rest, the last he ever had. In May 1808 he was ordered with a force of 11,000
                    men to Sweden to assist the king against the united forces of France and Russia.
                    The mad conduct of the Swedish king, however, who even went so far as to declare
                    Sir John Moore under arrest when he refused to acquiesce in his plans, ruined
                    any chance of successful co-operation, and the English general made his escape
                    and returned to England. He was at once ordered to proceed with his division to
                    Portugal, where Sir Arthur Wellesley had already landed · but the appointment of
                    Dalrymple and Burrard to the chief commands was even more of a slight on Moore
                    as a general of European experience than on Wellesley, whose laurels had
                    hitherto been won in India. He regarded himself as personally insulted by the
                    ministers, and especially by Lord Castlereagh, but deemed it his duty to go
                    where he was ordered. He met his reward <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> when, after
                    the excitement caused by the Convention of Cintra, Dalrymple and Burrard went
                    home, he was left in command of the largest English army since the commencement
                    of the war. Wellesley had appreciated him, and in an interesting letter
                    (published in the <hi rend="italic">Wellington Despatches')</hi> had expressed
                    his desire to use his own great political influence to reconcile him to the
                    ministers and the ministers to him.</p>
                <p>Now began the glorious three months on which Moore’s reputation as a soldier and
                    a statesman must rest. The Spaniards, flushed with their former success at
                    Baylen, regarded Napoleon, who had in person crossed the Pyrenees, as another
                    Dupont, and loudly summoned Moore to a share in their coming victories. Moore
                    knew better what was the value of Napoleon’s genius, but he had been commanded
                    to assist the Spaniards, and therefore gave the order to advance. His army
                    marched in four distinct divisions, and on 13th November 1808 he concentrated at
                    Salamanca<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n834/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0834-0805"/>, where he waited to see what would happen. He
                    heard that a subsidiary force under Sir David Baird had arrived at Corunna, and
                    ordered it up to join him. At Salamanca he remained a whole month watching the
                    triumphant successes of Napoleon and his lieutenants, and learning how little
                    Spanish reports or Spanish valour were to be relied on. Though irritated by the
                    menaces and abuse of Frere, the English minister to the junta, he waited till
                    the 13th December, hearing daily of Spanish defeats, and then he determined to
                    draw off upon his own small force the weight of Napoleon’s power, and thus give
                    Andalucia the winter in which to organize an army and prepare for another
                    Baylen. With this intention he advanced through Toro and Mayorga, where Baird
                    joined him, to Sahagun. He judged rightly that Napoleon would never advance into
                    Andalucia and leave the English behind him, but that he would turn all his power
                    against them. Having once drawn Napoleon’s attention to himself, he began his
                    famous retreat and fell back quickly, fighting every day and invariably with
                    success. He now could test the military spirit he had taught at Shorncliffe, for
                    the reserve under Sir Edward Paget consisted entirely of his own light
                    regiments. To detail each step of the retreat and every skirmish would be but to
                    rewrite Napier; suffice it to say that, with great loss of life and material,
                    Moore reached Corunna on 12th January 1809. But the fleet to take the army home
                    was not there; and the English would have to fight Soult, whose army was even
                    more weakened and demoralized than Moore’s, before they could embark. It was on
                    16th January that Moore fought his last battle; he fell early in the day, and
                    knew at once that his wound was mortal. His last hours were cheered with the
                    knowledge of victory, but were spent in recommending his old friends, such as
                    Graham and Colborne, to the notice of the Government. Sir H. Hardinge’s
                    description of these hours is in its way inimitable, and in it must be studied
                    how a modern Bayard should die in battle, every thought being for others, none
                    for himself.</p>
                <p>It may be possible in the face of his heroic death to exaggerate Moore’s actual
                    military services, but his influence on the British army cannot be overrated.
                    The true military spirit of discipline and of valour, both in officers and men,
                    had become nearly extinct during the American war. Abercromby, who looked back
                    to the traditions of Minden, was the first to attempt to revive it, and his work
                    was carried on by Moore. The formation of the light regiments at Shorncliffe was
                    the answer to the new French tactics, and it was left to Wellington to show the
                    success of the experiment. Moore’s powers as a statesman are shown in his
                    despatches written at Salamanca, and he had the truest gift of a great man, that
                    of judging men. It may be noticed that, while Wellington perpetually grumbled at
                    the bad qualities of his officers and formed no school, Moore’s name is
                    associated with the career of all who made their mark. Among generals, Hope,
                    Graham, Sir E. Paget, Hill, and Craufurd, all felt and submitted to his
                    ascendency, and of younger officers it was ever the proud boast of the Napiers,
                    Colborne, the Beckwiths, and Barnard that they were the pupils of Moore, not of
                    Wellington. Nay more, he inspired an historian. The description of Moore’s
                    retreat in Napier is perhaps the finest piece of military history in the English
                    language, not only because the author was present, but because his heart was
                    with the leader of that retreat; and, if Napier felt towards Wellington as the
                    soldiers of the tenth legion felt towards Caesar, he felt towards Moore the
                    personal love and devotion of a cavalier towards Montrose.</p>
