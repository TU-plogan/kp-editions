                    rises only 12 feet above sea-level, and which probably has given its name to the
                    town <hi rend="italic">(Mitte</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">der

                    Mitau is surrounded by a canal occupying the place of former fortifications.
                    Another canal was dug through the town to provide it with water; but this now
                    receives the sewage, and water is brought in cars from a distance of 3 miles.
                    Though so near Riga, Mitau has quite a different character. It has regular broad
                    streets, bordered with the low pretty mansions of the German nobility who reside
                    at the capital of Courland either to enjoy the social amusements for which Mitau
                    is renowned or to provide education to their children. Mitau is well provided
                    with educational institutions. A gymnasium occupies a former palace of the dukes
                    of Courland, and has a rich library; and there are about forty other schools.
                    The town is also the seat of a society of art and literature, of a natural
                    history society, which has a good local museum, and of the Lettish Literary
                    Society. The old castle of the dukes of Courland, which has witnessed so many
                    conflicts, was destroyed by the Duke Biron, who erected in its place a spacious
                    palace, now occupied by the governor and the courts. Mitau has 22,200
                    inhabitants, mainly Germans, but including also Jews (about 6000), Letts (5000),
                    and Russians. Manufactures are few, those <pb break="no"

                    most important. The river Aa brings Mitau in connexion with the trade of Riga,
                    small vessels carrying goods to the amount of about £150,000 a year.</p>
                <p>Mitau is supposed to have been founded in 1266 by the grandmaster Conrad Mandern.
                    It has often changed its rulers. In 1345, when it was plundered by Lithuanians,
                    it was already an important town. In 1561 it became the residence of the dukes
                    of Oourland. During the 17th century it was thrice taken by the Swedes. Russia
                    annexed it with Courland in 1795. At the beginning of this century it was the
                    residence of the count of Provence (afterwards Louis XVIII. ). In 1812 it was
                    taken by Napoleon I.</p>
