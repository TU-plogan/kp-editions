                    who himself had been a disciple of Plato and Aristotle, and he was the intimate
                    friend and admirer of Epicurus; but he also enjoyed the more distinguished
                    patronage of Demetrius Phalereus (who was likewise a pupil of Theophrastus), and
                    of Ptolemy the son of Lagus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In allusion to this Pliny writes (A <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">II.,</hi> vii. 30, § 111), “Magnum et Menandro in
                    comico socco testimonium regum Aegypti et Macedoniae contigit classe et per
                    legatos petito; majus ex ipso, regiae fortunae praelata litterarum conscientia.”
                    This seems to say that Menander had been invited to the courts of Alexander and
                    Ptolemy, as Euripides had been to that of Archelaus, king .of Macedonia, but had
                    preferred to write comedies for the Attic stage.</p></note> His principal rival
                    in the art was Philemon, who appears to have been more popular with the
                    multitude, and for that reason probably more successful. It is said that out of
                    a hundred comedies Menander gained the prize with but eight. All the extant
                    plays of Terence, with the exception of the <hi rend="italic">Phormio,</hi> are
                    avowedly taken from Menander; but some of them appear to have been adaptations
                    and combinations of more than one plot, although Terence himself says in the
                    prologue to the <hi rend="italic">Adelphi</hi> (11) that he copied the Greek
                    model closely, “verbum de verbo expressum extulit.” Julius Caesar called Terence

                    gave to the Old Comedy the place which is held by the “leading articles” of a
                    modern newspaper. “The stock characters were such as the stern or weak father,
                    the son whose follies are seconded by a slave or a hungry parasite, the
                    pettifogger, active in stirring up law suits, and the gasconading soldier of
                    fortune.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Professor

                    These and cognate subjects, which formed the stock-in-trade of Menander’s plays,
                    are summed up in two well-known lines of Ovid—</p>
                <p>“Dum.fallax servus, durus pater, improba lena Vivet, dum meretrix blanda,
                    Menandros erit.”</p>
                <p>It is a good remark of Dr Wagner’s<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ut sup.,</hi> p. 7.</p></note> that the
                    last-mentioned of these, the <hi rend="italic">meretrix blanda</hi> (which
                    probably refers especially to the <hi rend="italic">Thais),</hi> “holds the most
                    important and conspicuous part in the New Attic Comedy, while married ladies are
                    continually represented as the plague and bore of their husbands’ lives.”
                    Intrigues with these, generally through the medium of a clever confidential
                    slave, are for the most part the very point or pivot on which the plot
                    turns.</p>
                <p>The more literary Romans greatly admired Menander as a poet. Pliny (A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> xxx. 1, § 7) speaks of
                    him as “Menander litterarum subtilitati sine aemulo genitus.” Propertius,
                    contemplating a visit to Athens,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">El.,</hi> iv. 21 27.</p></note>
                    anticipates the pleasure of reading Menander in his native city—</p>
                <p>“Persequar aut studium linguae, Demosthenis arma, Libaboque tuos, scite Menandre,
                    sales.”</p>
                <p>He elsewhere speaks of him as “mundus Menander,” neat, terse, and urbane; and his
                    skill in depicting the character of a fascinating Thais is alluded to here and
                    in ii. 6, 3 :—</p>
                <p>“Turba Menandreae fuerat nec Thaidos olim Tanta, in qua populus lusit
                    Erichthonius.”</p>
                <p>Of this comedy, the <hi rend="italic">Thais,</hi> Professor Mahaffy remarks<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    Class. Gr. Lit.</hi>, i. p. 488.</p></note> that perhaps it was the most
                    brilliant of Menander’s plays, “the manners and characters of the personage
                    being painted with thorough experience as well as genius.” Nevertheless, only
                    five verses of this play have been preserved to us, one of which is that quoted
                    by St Paul (1 Cor. xv. 33), “Evil communications corrupt good manners.” The same
                    critic, in praising Menander’s style as the purest model of the New Attic,
                    observes that a remarkable feature of the New Comedy was “its utter avoidance of
                    rhetoric” (p. 489). The influence which this art had on Euripides is well known.
                    Sophocles was not wholly exempt from a kind of rhetorical pedantry, and the
                    speeches in Thucydides are so many exercises of the author in that art. But, as
                    rhetoric pertained essentially to public life, it was likely to have a much less
                    scope in scenes borrowed almost solely from social and domestic experiences.</p>
                <p>Menander, however, did not neglect the other branch of a liberal Attic
                    education,—philosophy. A follower and a friend of Epicurus, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">summum bonum</hi> was the greatest amount of enjoyment to be got
                    out of life, he carried out in practice what he advocated by precept; for he was
                    essentially the well-to-do gentleman,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Pliny calls Menander “diligentissimus luxuriae interpres,” Λ

                    and moved in the upper circles of Athenian society. “The philosophers of the
                    day” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the schools and universities in our modern
                    systems of teaching) “were still,” says Professor Mahaffy,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hist. Class. Gr. Lit.,</hi>
                    i. p. 480.</p></note> viz., even during the period of the New Comedy, “the
                    constant butt of the dramatists.” He adds that, “what is still stranger,
                    political attacks on living personages, not excepting Alexander the Great, were
                    freely and boldly made.”</p>
                <p>On the whole, our estimate of the spirit and object of Menander must be formed
                    rather from his imitator and copyist Terence than from the fragments which
                    remain, about 2400 verses in all, as collected by Meineke in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Fragmenta Comicorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Graecorum.</hi> For, as
                    Professor Mahaffy well observes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Wd,, p. 480.</p></note> the extracts made by Àthenaeus, our
                    principal authority, have reference chiefly to “the archaeology of cooks and
                    cookery,” while Stobaeus was a collector of <hi rend="italic">γvωμaι</hi> or
                    wise maxims,—“a most unfortunate and worthless kind of citation.” It follows
                    that no sound conclusions as to dramatic genius, or of the knowledge of human
                    nature, can be drawn from detached verses preserved without the least reference
                    to these particular points. The extraordinary popularity of Menander must have
                    been due to literary merit, if not to great originality. Mr Mahaffy observes on
                    this<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ibid.,</hi> p. 487.</p></note> that “there is so much of a calm gentlemanly
                    morality about his fragments, he is so excellent a teacher of the ordinary
                    world-wisdom—resignation, good temper, moderation, friendliness—that we can well
                    understand this popularity. Copies of his plays continued long in existence, and
                    were certainly known to Suidas and Eustathius as late as the 11th and 12th
                    centuries, if they did not survive to a yet later period.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid:,'γ.</hi>
                    490.</p></note></p>
                <p>In respect of language, Menander occupies the same position in poetry which his
                    contemporary Demosthenes does in prose. In both the New Attic is elaborated with
                    great finish, and with much greater grammatical precision than we find in
                    writers of the Old Attic, such as Sophocles and Thucydides. A considerable
                    addition to the vocabulary of every-day life had now been made, as was indeed
                    inevitable from the versatile character of the language and the genius of the
                    people who used it. Many new verb-forms, especially the perfect active,<note

                    characteristic innovation of the style of Plato. The earlier prose was in its
                    general vocabulary to a considerable extent poetical, and such a concurrence of
                    short syllables as in the Platonic <hi rend="italic"

                    ill-suited even to choral metre. The Old Comedy was worked by men of real
                    genius, who “were indeed giants, while the men of Menander’s day only showed how
                    strong and thorough was the culture which in art and literature outlived the
                    decadence of the nation.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Mahaffy, <hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> p. 490.</p></note></p>
                <p>In all, we have, as collected by Meineke, 1045 fragments of Menander, of which
                    515 can be referred to known plays, the titles of those quoted from amounting to
                    ninety, and including the Terentian <hi rend="italic">Andria,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Adelphi,</hi><hi rend="italic">Eunuchus, Heautontimorumenos.</hi>
                    These fragments contain about 1650 verses or parts of verses, not including a
                    considerable number of words quoted expressly as from Menander by the old
                    lexicographers. Besides all these there are not fewer than 758 xnonostich verses
                    separately preserved in MSS., though some of these are met with in the other and
                    longer fragments. Many of the fragments are obscure, some corrupt; and they have
                    been a fertile field for critical acumen from the time of Bentley. Not
                    unfrequently we come upon the shrewd or original remark of an observer. Thus
                    (frag. 7) “A poor man has no relations, for no one acknowledges him, lest he
                    should beg.” Frag. 145, “Everything that takes place is brought about by law,
                    necessity, or fashion.” 237, “The gods do not save men through any human means
                    (prayer or sacrifices); if they did, the human would have more power than the
                    divine.” 275, “Poverty is the most easily cured of all evils; any friend can do
                    it by merely putting his hand in his pocket.” 397, ’ ‘ A poor man who lives in a
                    large town makes himself more wretched than he need; for he cannot help
                    comparing with his own the luxurious lives of the rich.” 435, “No man realizes
                    the extent of a sin when he commits it; it is afterwards that he sees it.” 460,
                    “A man is convinced not so much by what is said as by the manner of saying it.”
                    474, “There is one thing only that hides vulgarity, villainy, and every other
                    fault,—wealth. Everything but that is carped at and criticized.” 517, “People
                    who have no merit of their own generally boast of their birth and their
                    ancestors. But every living man has ancestors, or he would not be a living man.”
                    578, “Wealth acts on a man as wind does on a ship,—it often forces him out of
                    his proper course.” 663, “Many a young lady says a great deal in her own favour
                    by saying nothing at all.” 688, “A man who abuses his own father is practising
                    blasphemy against the gods.” In fact, Menander is characteristically a
                    sententious writer, like Euripides, with whom in the general style of his
                    writings, though not, of course, in his somewhat loose and irregular
                    versification, he is sometimes compared. (F. A. P. )</p>
