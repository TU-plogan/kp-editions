                <p><label type="entry">MINIATURE</label> is a term which by common usage has come to
                    be applied to two different branches of painting.</p>
                <p>Derived from the Latin word <hi rend="italic">minium,</hi> the red pigment used
                    in the primitive decoration of MSS., in the first place it is the technical word
                    employed to describe a painting in a MS.; and, from the fact of such pictures
                    being executed on a reduced scale, it has its secondary and modern signification
                    of a small, or miniature, portrait. In the latter sense it belongs to the
                    general subject of painting. Here it is proposed to trace the development of the
                    miniature in MSS. of the different schools of Europe.</p>
                <p>The rise of the art of <hi rend="smallcaps">Illumination,</hi> in which the
                    miniature plays so important ∙a part, has been described under that heading; and
                    something has been said in that place about the earliest extant specimens of
                    miniature painting. Unfortunately we cannot with any certainty reach farther
                    back than the 4th century for the most ancient of them; and all remaining
                    examples between that period and the 7th century in Greek and Latin MSS. can be
                    counted on the fingers. The two famous codices of Virgil in the Vatican Library
                    stand pre-eminent as the most ancient Latin MSS. decorated with paintings. The
                    miniatures in the first of them, the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Romanus,</hi> are large and roughly yet boldly executed paintings,
                    which have no pretension to beauty, and are simply illustrations; but they are
                    as old as the 4th century, and are of the highest value in enabling us to
                    appreciate the debased style to which classical art had descended, and which no
                    doubt was more largely employed than we might think. The second MS., the <hi
                    rend="italic">Schedae</hi><hi rend="italic">Vatican«,</hi> which may also be
                    assigned to the 4th century, is far more artistic and retains a good deal of the
                    grace of classic art. Of the same kind, but of rather later date, are the
                    fragments of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> in the Ambrosian Library at Milan,
                    the miniatures of which are generally of excellent design. Next comes the
                    Dioscorides of the Imperial Library at Vienna, with its semiclassical
                    portrait-miniatures executed at the beginning of the 6th century. Of a rather
                    later period are the paintings which illustrate the Greek MS. of Genesis in the
                    same library. A far finer and older MS. of the same book of the Pentateuch once
                    existed in the Cottonian Library, but was almost totally destroyed by fire. The
                    few fragments of the miniatures which once filled this volume, and which were of
                    the 5th century, are sufficient to show what excellent work could be done in the
                    capital of the eastern empire, from whence the MSS. most probably came. The late
                    interesting discovery of an illustrated MS. of the Gospels in Greek, of the
                    latter part of the 6th century, at Rossano in southern Italy, adds another
                    number to our scanty list of early volumes of this class, which is closed by the
                    Latin Pentateuch in the library of the earl of Ashburnham. This last MS.,
                    however, is not older than the 7th century. It was executed in Italy, and is
                    adorned with many large miniatures, not of high artistic merit, but of great
                    interest for the history of painting and of costume.</p>
                <p>Coeval with the MSS. which have just been enumerated are the beautiful mosaics
                    and wall-paintings which are seen at Rome, Ravenna, and in other parts of Italy,
                    serving as standards of comparison and carrying on the history of art where MSS.
                    fail us. The strong and ever-increasing Byzantine element which appears in these
                    works prepares us to find the predominance of the same influence when we again
                    pick up the broken thread of the history of miniature painting. We may then, at
                    this point, turn for a moment to the east of Europe and state briefly what
                    remains of Greek art in MSS. Of Greek miniatures there are still many fine
                    examples extant, but, excepting those which have been noticed above, there are
                    few which are earlier than the 11th century. At this period the miniature
                    appears in the set form which it retained for tlΛ next two or three hundred
                    years; and the connexion between its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n455/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0455-0438"/> style and that of the mosaics is too evident for
                    us to be at a loss to explain the course of development. The figure drawing is
                    delicate, but rather exaggerated in length; the colours are brilliant; and the
                    whole effect is heightened by glittering backgrounds of gold. In some few
                    instances, however, the Greek artist breaks away from conventionalism, and,
                    especially when pourtraying the divine features of the Saviour or some subject
                    which deeply stirs his feelings, he surprises us with the noble dignity with
                    which he invests his figures. Minuteness also caught the fancy of these
                    Byzantine miniaturists; and there still remain MSS., such as Psalters and
                    saints’ lives, adorned throughout with delicate little drawings of great
                    symmetry and beauty. The ornamentation which was employed in Greek MSS. in the
                    period of which we are speaking, either as frames for miniatures or as borders
                    or head-pieces, is designed evidently after Eastern types, and has more than an
                    accidental likeness to the patterns which are seen in the tapestries r,nd
                    prayer-carpets of Persia. After the 13th century decadence sets in, and we need
                    not follow the course of Byzantine art in MSS. farther than to notice that
                    immediately from it sprang such national styles as those of Russia, Bulgaria,
                    and modern Greece.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in the West, under the fostering care of Charlemagne, arose a great
                    school of decoration in MSS., which at the close of the 8th and beginning of the
                    9th century were multiplied and enriched with all the splendour that colours and
                    gilding could give to them. But the books thus ornamented were almost always
                    copies of the Gospels, or Bibles, or church service books, which afforded little
                    scope for invention. Hence among the miniatures of this period we have an
                    endless repetition of portraits of the evangelists, drawn, for the most part, in
                    a lifeless way after Byzantine traditions, and degenerating, as time passes,
                    into positive ugliness. The few miniatures of other descriptions, such as
                    Biblical illustrations, show no great merit, and a half-barbaric splendour was
                    generally preferred to artistic effect. But an exception must be made in regard
                    to the style of drawing found in the MS. known, on account of its present
                    resting-place, as the Utrecht Psalter. This volume is filled from beginning to
                    end with delicately drawn pen illustrations, designed and executed with a
                    facility which, compared with the mechanical and clumsy drawing of other
                    Continental MSS. of the period, is astonishing. And these drawings are of
                    particular interest for us, as they are of the style which was adopted in
                    England and which gives to Anglo-Saxon art its distinctive aspect. Executed
                    about the year 800 or early in the 9th century, and probably in the north of
                    France, the volume was soon brought to England, where, however, MSS. of the same
                    kind, it may be assumed, had long before been introduced. The light “fluttering”
                    outlines of th’e drapery and other details of the drawings seem to suggest that
                    the original models were derived directly from Roman life, and perhaps partly
                    copied from sculpture; but those models must have gone through many
                    modifications before passing into the style of the drawings of the Psalter. That
                    the MS. was copied from an older one there can be scarcely a doubt; and it is
                    not impossible that the original archetype may date back some centuries earlier.
                    May not MSS. which St Augustine and his successors brought from Rome have
                    contained drawings of the same kind? This style of drawing was, at all events,
                    adopted and became nationalized in England; but it had there a rival in the
                    Irish school of ornamentation, introduced from the north of the island. The
                    early civilization of Ireland placed her in the van of art development in these
                    islands. The wonderfully intricate interlaced designs which render Irish MSS. of
                    the 7th and 8th centuries such marvels of exact workmanship derive their origin,
                    in all probability, from the metal-work of earlier ages. But, apart from
                    ornamentation, the Irish miniatures of saints and evangelists are extraordinary
                    and grotesque instances of purely mechanical drawing, which cause us to wonder
                    how the same eyes and hands which assisted in the creation of such beautiful
                    specimens of pure ornament could tolerate such caricatures of the human shape.
                    The explanation is perhaps to be found in superstitious regard for tradition.
                    This style of art was carried by the monks to Iona and thence to Lindisfarne,
                    where was founded the school which produced, in the 8th and 9th centuries, the
                    richly ornamented codices of Durham. While, then, Byzantine models were copied
                    on the Continent, the free drawing introduced from the south and the intricate
                    ornamentation brought in from the north were practised in England; but the free
                    drawing, with its accompanying decoration copied from foliage, and gradually
                    developing into beautiful borders harmoniously coloured, gained the day, and
                    lasted down to the time of the Norman Conquest. The one great fault of this
                    latter style of drawing strikes the eye at the first glance. This is the
                    inordinate length of limb with which the human figures are endowed. But this
                    blemish is forgotten when one comes to appreciate the many points of merit in
                    the designs.</p>
                <p>In Italy, after a long period of inactivity, two very different styles of
                    decoration of MSS. sprang into existence. The first of these was that of the
                    Lombardie school, which is distinguished by intricate patterns and bright
                    colouring. The large initial letters which are found in the MSS. of the 11th and
                    12 th centuries, the best period of this style, are often a perfect maze of
                    interlaced bands and animal forms, and are extremely handsome and effective.
                    Figure drawing, however, seems to have been but little practised by the
                    Lombardie artists, but such as there is appears on a broad scale and well
                    executed. In the collections of Monte Cassino are some of the best examples of
                    this school. In the second style which developed in Italy the Byzantine
                    influence is at first most marked. Indeed, among its early specimens of the 13th
                    century are some which might pass for the work of Greek artists. But the genius
                    of the Italians soon assimilated the foreign element, and produced a national
                    school which spread throughout the peninsula and afterwards extended its
                    influence to southern France and Spain. It is, however, remarkable that in a
                    country which produced such fine pictures and wall-paintings at an early date
                    there is comparatively little miniature painting in contemporary MSS. A curious
                    and early instance of this kind of art occurs in a MS. in the British Museum,
                    written and ornamented with a series of miniatures at Winchester, in the 12 th
                    century, in which are two paintings which are purely Italian and of more than
                    ordinary excellence.</p>
                <p>In the majority of the extant Italian miniatures of the 14th century the
                    influence of the great artists of the Florentine school is manifest. The
                    peculiar treatment of flesh tints, painted in body colour over a foundation of
                    olive-green, and the peculiar vermilion and other colours which need be but once
                    seen to be ever afterwards recognized as belonging to this school, are
                    constantly present. The figures are generally rather shortened and the drapery
                    carried in straight folds, very different characteristics from the swaying
                    figures and flowing drapery of the English and French artists of the same
                    period. The ornamentation which accompanied this style of miniature generally
                    consists of heavy scrolls and foliated or feather-like pendants from the initial
                    letters, with spots of gold set here and there in the border. There are also
                    extant some examples of a most beautiful kind of ornamentation which appears to
                    have originated in central Italy, and which seems to partake of the qualities of
                    both the styles of Italian art of which we have been speaking, combining <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n456/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0456-0439"/> the drawing of the Florentine school with a
                    lighter colouring which may have been suggested by the Lombardie.</p>
                <p>Of native Spanish miniature art little can be said. In the Visigothic MSS. of the
                    early Middle Ages there is no ornament beyond roughly coloured initial letters
                    and some barbaric figure drawing. A little later, however, we get some
                    indication of national peculiarities in the MSS. of the 10th, 11 th, and 12th
                    centuries. Here there appear miniatures, stiff and rude in their drawing, but
                    exhibiting the unmistakable Spanish predilection for sombre colours, —dusky reds
                    and yellows and even black entering largely into the compositions.</p>
                <p>The materials at our disposal of the 10th, 11 th, and 12th centuries show the
                    gradual development in France and western Germany of a fine free-hand drawing
                    which was encouraged by the proportionately increasing size of books. Both in
                    outline and colour the fully developed miniatures of the 12th century are on a
                    grand scale; and initial letters formed of scrolls and interlacings assume the
                    same proportions. The figure drawing of this time is frequently of great
                    excellence, the limbs being well-proportioned; care is also bestowed upon the
                    arrangement of the drapery, which is made to follow the shape and, as it were,
                    to cling to the body.</p>
                <p>But the great revulsion from the broad effects and bold grandeur of the 12th
                    century to the exact details and careful finish of the 13th century is nowhere
                    more striking than in miniature painting in MSS. With the opening of the new
                    period we enter on a new world of ideas. Large books generally disappear to give
                    place to smaller ones; minute writing supersedes the large hand; and miniatures
                    appear in circumscribed spaces in the interior of initial letters. The
                    combination of the miniature with the initial brings it into close connexion
                    with the ornamental border, which develops <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi>
                    with the growth of the miniature and by degrees assumes the same national and
                    distinctive characteristics. Burnished gold was now also freely used, tending to
                    give the miniature a more decorative character than formerly. In England,
                    northern France, and the Netherlands the style of miniature painting of this
                    period was much the same in character; and it is often difficult to decide from
                    which of these countries a MS. is derived. English work, however, may be often
                    distinguished by its lighter colouring, while deeper and more brilliant hues and
                    a peculiar reddish or copper tinge in the gold marks French origin. The drawing
                    of the Flemish artists was scarcely so good, the outlines being frequently heavy
                    and the colours rather dull. Of the Rhenish or Cologne school examples are more
                    scarce; but they generally show greater contrasts in the colours, which, though
                    brilliant, are not so pleasing. As the century advanced, and particularly at its
                    close, national distinctions became more defined. English artists paid more
                    attention to graceful drawing and depended less upon colour. In some of their
                    best productions they are satisfied with slightly tinting the figures, finding
                    room in the backgrounds for display of brilliant colours and gilding. In France
                    the drawing, though exact, is hardly so graceful, and colour plays a more
                    important part. From the 13th to the middle of the 15th century great decorative
                    effect is obtained by the introduction of diapered or other highly ornamented
                    backgrounds. Of landscape, properly so called, there is but little, a
                    conventional hill or tree being often taken as sufficient indication. Borders
                    begin in the 13th century in the form of simple pendants from the initial
                    letters, terminating in simple buds or cusps. But once arrived fairly in the
                    14th century, a rapid development in all parts of the decoration of MSS. takes
                    place. There is greater freedom in the drawing; the borders begin to throw out
                    branches and the bud expands into leaf. This is the best period of English
                    miniature painting, many of the fine MSS. of this century which are preserved in
                    the public libraries bearing witness to the skill and delicate touch of native
                    artists. In France the decoration of MSS. received a great impetus from the
                    patronage of King John and Charles V., of whose famous libraries many handsome
                    volumes are still to be seen; and later in the century the duke of Berri carried
                    on the same good work.</p>
                <p>With regard to miniature art in Germany there are so few examples to guide us
                    that little can be said. Most of them are rough in both drawing and colouring;
                    and in the few remaining specimens of really good work foreign influence is
                    distinctly seen. In the west the art of France and Flanders, and in the south
                    that of Italy, are predominant. Perhaps the finest MS. of this southern style to
                    be seen in England is a Psalter belonging to Lord Ashburnham, which was probably
                    executed in the 14th century at Prague, and is full of miniatures which in
                    drawing and colouring follow the Italian school.</p>
                <p>When we enter the 15th century we find great changes in both the great English
                    and French schools. In England the graceful drawing of the previous century has
                    disappeared. At first, however, some beautiful examples of purely native work
                    were produced, and still remain to excite our admiration. Probably the most
                    perfect of these MSS. are the Sherborne Missal belonging to the duke of
                    Northumberland, and a very beautiful volume, a Book of Hours, in the library of
                    Lord Ashburnham. The care bestowed upon the modelling of the features is
                    particularly noticeable in English work of this period. In decoration the border
                    of the 14th century had by this time grown to a solid frame surrounding the
                    page; but now another form of most effective ornament was also used, consisting
                    of twisted featherlike scrolls brightly coloured and gilt. As the century
                    advanced native English work died out, and French and then Flemish influence
                    stepped in.</p>
                <p>In France immense activity was shown all through the 15th century in the
                    illumination and illustration of books of all kinds, sacred and profane; and it
                    is in the MSS. of that country, and, a little later, in those of the Low
                    Countries, that we can most exactly watch the transition from mediaeval to
                    modern painting. Early in the century there were executed in France some of the
                    most famous MSS. which have descended to us. In these the colouring is most
                    brilliant, the figure drawing fairly exact; and the landscape begins to develop.
                    The border has grown from the branching pendant to a framework of golden sprays
                    or of conventional and realistic leafage and flowers. Towards the middle of the
                    century the diaper disappears for ever, and the landscape is a recognized part
                    of the miniature; but perspective is still at fault, and the mystery of the
                    horizon is not solved until the century is well advanced. And now Flemish art,
                    which had long lain dormant, sprang into rivalry with its French sister, under
                    the stimulus given to it by the Van Eycks, and the struggle was carried on, but
                    unequally, through the rest of the century. French art gradually deteriorates;
                    the miniatures become flat and hard; nor are these defects compensated for by
                    the meretricious practice of heightening the colours by profusely touching them
                    with gold. The Flemish artists, on the other hand, went on improving in depth
                    and softness of colouring, and brought miniature painting to rare perfection.
                    The borders also which they introduced gave scope for the study of natural
                    objects. Flowers, insects, birds, and jewels were painted in detached groups on
                    a solid framework of colour surrounding the page.</p>
                <p>But if, as the 15th century drew to its close, the Flemings had outstripped their
                    French rivals, they had now more powerful antagonists to contend with. The
                    Italians had been advancing with rapid strides towards the glories of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0457-0440"/> the Renaissance. Early in the century there arose
                    a taste for older models. As, for their writing and afterwards for their
                    printing, they went back to the 11th and 12th centuries for their standards, so
                    they adopted again the interlacing designs of the Lombardie school for their
                    ornament, and produced beautiful borders of twining patterns relieved by colour;
                    or they took natural objects for their models, and painted borders of delicate
                    flowers made still more brilliant with clustering stars of gold. Later, they
                    drew from the ancient classical designs inspiration for the wonderful borders of
                    arabesques, medallions, griffins, human forms, antique objects, &lt;fcc., which
                    they brought to such perfection early in the next century. Their miniatures rose
                    to the rank of exquisitely finished pictures, and were executed by some of the
                    best artists working under the patronage of such great houses as those of Sforza
                    and Medici.</p>
                <p>Here then, having advanced to the threshold of the domain of modern painting, we
                    leave these two great schools of miniaturists in possession of the west of
                    Europe. The Flemings had the wider field; they were wanderers from home; and
                    their works are scattered through many lands, from England in the north to Spain
                    in the south. But Italian art had greater inherent strength, and will always
                    hold the first rank. To instance a few of the more famous MSS. of this closing
                    period of miniature painting: the Breviary of Isabella the Catholic, in the
                    British Museum, is a masterpiece of Flemish art produced in Spain; the Grimani
                    Breviary at Venice is another fine example of the same school. Some beautiful
                    Italian miniatures (executed for Leo X. and others) were in the collection
                    lately sold by the duke of Hamilton. The earl of Ashburnham possesses a most
                    delicately illuminated Book of Hours written for Lorenzo dei Medici by the
                    famous scribe Sinibaldo in 1485, as well as a MS. to which Perugino and his
                    contemporaries contributed paintings. And in one MS., a Book of Hours belonging
                    to Mr Malcolm of Poltalloch, are gathered some of the best miniatures of both
                    schools, viz., a series of exquisite paintings by Milanese artists supplemented
                    by later ones of the finest Flemish type. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. μ.
