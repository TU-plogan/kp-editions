                    Greek sophists and philosophers, and are repeatedly referred to by Plato and
                    Aristotle. In later times the invention was ascribed to the poet Simonides,<note

                    perhaps for no other reason than that the strength of his memory was famous.
                    Cicero, who attaches considerable importance to the art, but more to the
                    principle of order as the best help to memory, speaks of Carneades (or perhaps
                    Charmades) of Athens and Metrodorus of Scepsis as distinguished examples of the
                    use of well-ordered images to aid the memory. The latter is said by Pliny to

                        auditum.</hi> The Romans valued such helps as giving facility in public
                    speaking. The method used is described by the author of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rhet.</hi><hi rend="italic">ad Heren.,</hi> iii. 16- 24; see also
                    Quintilian <hi rend="italic">(Inst. Or.,</hi> x. 1, 2), whose account is,
                    however, somewhat incomplete and obscure. In his time the art had almost ceased
                    to be practised. The Greek and Roman system of mnemonics was founded on the use
                    of mental places and signs or pictures. The thing to be remembered was localized
                    in the imagination, and associated with a symbol which concretely represented
                    what it was desired to retain in the memory, special care being taken that the
                    symbols should be as vivid, pleasing, and impressive as possible. The most usual
                    method was to choose a large house, of which the apartments, walls, windows,
                    statues, furniture, &lt;fcc., were severally associated with certain names,
                    phrases, events, or ideas, by means of symbolic pictures; and to recall these it
                    was only necessary to search over the apartments of the house, till the
                    particular place was discovered where they had been deposited by the
                    imagination. As the things to be remembered increased, new houses could be
                    built, each set apart to a certain class of ideas or events, and these houses
                    were again constructed into a mnemonic town. In accordance with this system, if
                    it were desired to fix an historic date in the memory, it was localized in an
                    imaginary town divided into a certain number of districts, each with ten houses,
                    each house with ten rooms, and each room with a hundred quadrates or
                    memory-places, partly on the floor, partly on the four walls, partly on the
                    roof. Thus, if it were desired to fix in the memory the date of the invention of
                    printing (1436), an imaginary book, or some other symbol of printing, would be
                    placed in the thirty-sixth quadrate or memory-place of the fourth room of the
                    first house of the historic district of the town. The success of the method
                    depended largely on the power of the imagination to give the different houses,
                    rooms, Arc., characteristic varieties of aspect, and we may suppose that it was
                    the effort to frame suitable images and places, giving an adventitious interest
                    to dry details, that constituted the real advantage of the system. Except that
                    the rules of mnemonics are referred to by Martianus Capella, nothing further is
                    known regarding the practice of the art until the 13th century, when the system
                    of the Romans was revived and a good many treatises were published on the
                    subject. Among the voluminous writings of Roger Bacon is a tractate <hi
                        rend="italic">De Arte Memorativa,</hi> which exists in MS. at Oxford.
                    Raymond Lully devoted special attention to mnemonics in connexion with his <hi
                        rend="italic">ars</hi><hi rend="italic">generalis.</hi> The first important
                    modification of the method of the Romans was that invented by Conrad Celtes, a
                    German poet, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Epitoma</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >in</hi><hi rend="italic">utramque Ciceronis rhetoricam</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">cum arte memorativa nova</hi> (1492), instead of places made
                    use of the letters of the alphabet. About the end of the 15th century Petrus de
                    Ravenna awakened such astonishment in Italy by his mnemonic feats that he was
                    believed by many to be a necromancer. His <hi rend="italic">Phoenix
                        Artis</hi><hi rend="italic">Mémorisé,</hi> published at Venice in 1491 in
                    four volumes, went through as many as nine editions, the seventh appearing at
                    Cologne in 1608. An impression equally great was produced about the end of the
                    16th century by Lambert Schenkel, who taught mnemonics in France, Italy, and
                    Germany, and, although he was denounced as a sorcerer by the university of
                    Louvain, published in 1593 his tractate <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Memoria</hi> at Douai with the sanction of that celebrated
                    theological faculty. The most complete account of his system is given in two
                    works by his pupil Martin Sommer, published at Venice in 1619. Giordano Bruno,

                <p>About the middle of the 17th century Winckelmann made known what he called the
                    “most fertile secret” in mnemonics, namely the use of letters with figures so as
                    to express numbers by words; and the philosopher Leibnitz adopted an alphabet
                    very similar to that of Winckelmann in connexion with his scheme for a form of
                    writing common to all languages. Winckelmann’s method was modified and
                    supplemented in regard to many details by Richard Grey, who published a <hi
                        rend="italic">Memoria</hi><hi rend="italic">Technica</hi> in 1730. The
                    principal part of Grey’s method is briefly this: “To remember anything in
                    history, chronology, geography, &amp;c., a word is formed, the beginning whereof
                    being the first syllable or syllables of the thing sought, does, by frequent
                    repetition, of course draw’ after it the latter part, which is so contrived as
                    to give the answer. Thus, in history, the Deluge happened in the year before
                    Christ two thousand three hundred forty-eight; this is signified by the word
                    Deleted, Del standing for Deluge and <hi rend="italic">etok</hi> for 2348.” To
                    assist in retaining the mnemonical words in the memory they were formed into
                    memorial lines. The vowel or consonant which Grey connected with a particular
                    figure was chosen arbitrarily; but in 1806 Feinaigle, a monk from Salem near
                    Constance, began in Paris to expound a system of mnemonics, one feature of which
                    was to represent the numerical figures by letters chosen on account of some
                    similarity to the figure to be represented or some accidental connexion with it.
                    This alphabet was supplemented by a complicated system of localities and signs,
                    with the aim of expressing, by a more vivid and impressive symbol, ideas which
                    for want of this are apt to pass from the memory, and of establishing between
                    ideas of the same group an intimate relation, so that the mention of the one
                    would suggest the other. Feinaigle, who published a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Notice</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">mnémoniqiie</hi> at Paris in 1806, came to England in 1811,
                    and in the following year published <hi rend="italic">The New Art of
                        Memory.</hi> A simplified form of Feinaigle’s method was published in 1823
                    by Aimé Paris, and the use of symbolic pictures was revived in connexion with
                    the latter by a Pole, Jazwinsky, of whose system an account was published by J.
                    Bern, under the title <hi rend="italic">Expos^</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Général</hi><hi rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Méthode
                        Mnémonique</hi><hi rend="italic">Polonaise,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >perfectionnée à</hi><hi rend="italic">Paris,</hi> Paris, 1839. Various
                    other modifications of the systems of Feinaigle and Aimé Paris were advocated by
                    subsequent mnemonists, among them being the Phrenotyping or Brain-Printing
                    method of Beniowsky, the Phreno-Mnemo-techny of Gouraud, and the Mnemotechnik of
                    Carl Otto, a Dane. The more complicated mnemonic systems have fallen almost into
                    complete disuse; but methods founded chiefly on the laws of association have
                    been taught with some success in Germany by, among others, Kothe, who is the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der Mnemonik,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Katechismus der Gedächtnisskunst,</hi> both of which have gone through
                    several editions; and in England by Dr. Edward Pick, whose <hi rend="italic"
                        >Memory and the Rational Means of Improving it</hi> has also obtained a wide
                    circulation. In certain cases mnemonical devices may be found of considerable
                    service; but all systems which have aimed at completeness have been found rather
                    to puzzle than aid the memory. The fullest history of mnemonics is that given by
                    J. C. F. von Aretin in his <hi rend="italic">Systematische Anleitung zur Theorie
                        und Praxis der Mnemonik,</hi> 1810.</p>
