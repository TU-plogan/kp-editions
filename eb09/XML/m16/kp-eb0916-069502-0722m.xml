                    the original reading, and has been changed to soften the enormity ascribed to
                    the ancient Hebrews. The phrase “to give one’s seed to Moloch,” Lev. XX. 2 <hi

                    common in Semitic heathenism, and at least the idea of such sacrifices was not
                    unknown to Israel in early times (Isaac, Jephthah’s daughter), though in the
                    sunny days of the nation, when religion was a joyous thing, there is no reason
                    to think that they were actually practised.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In Hosea xiii. 2 the interpretation “they that sacrifice
                    men” is improbable, and 2 Kings xvii. 17 and Lev. xviii., xx. are of too late
                    date to prove the immolation of children to Moloch in old Israel. The “ban”
                    (DID), which was a religious execution of criminals or enemies, was common to
                    Israel with its heathen neighbours (stone of Mesha), but lacked the distinctive
                    character of a sacrifice in which the victim is the food of the deity, convej
                    <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ed to him through fire.</p></note> It was
                    otherwise in the neighbouring nations, and in particular we learn from 2 Kings
                    iii. 27 that the piacular sacrifice of his son and heir was the last offering
                    which the king of Moab made to deliver his country. Even the Hebrew historian
                    ascribes to this act the effect of rousing divine indignation against the
                    invading host of Israel; it is not, therefore, surprising that under the
                    miseries brought on Palestine by the westward march of the Assyrian power, when
                    the old gladness of Israel’s faith was swallowed up in a crushing sense of
                    divine anger, the idea of the sacrifice of one’s own son, as the most powerful
                    of atoning rites, should have taken hold of those kings of Judah (Ahaz and
                    Manasseh, 2 Kings xvi. 3, xxi. ’ 6) who were otherwise prone, in their
                    hopelessness of help from the old religion (Isa. vii. 12), to seek to strange
                    peoples and their rites. Ahaz’s sacrifice of his son (which indeed rests on a
                    somewhat late authority) must have been an isolated act of despair; human
                    sacrifices are not among the corruptions of the popular religion spoken of by
                    Isaiah and Micah. But in the 7th century, when the old worship had sustained
                    rude shocks, and all religion was transformed into servile fear (Micah vi. 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi> belongs to this period; see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Micah),</hi> the example of Manasseh spread to his people; and Jeremiah and
                    Ezekiel make frequent and indignant reference to the “high places” for the
                    sacrifice of children by their parents which rose beneath the very walls of the
                    temple from the gloomy ravine of Hinnom or Tophet<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The etymology of the word Tophet is obscure;
                    its meaning appears from <hi rend="italic">tophtch,</hi> “pyre,” Isa. xxx.
                    33.</p></note> (Jer. vii. 31, xix., xxxii. 35; Ezek. xvi. 20, xxiii. 37). It is
                    with these sacrifices that the name of “the Moloch” is always connected;
                    sometimes “the Baal” (lord) appears as a synonym. At the same time, the horrid
                    ritual was so closely associated with Jehovah worship (Ezek. xxiii. 39) that
                    Jeremiah more than once finds it necessary to protest that it is not of
                    Jehovah’s institution (vii. 31, xix. 5). So too it is the idea of sacrificing
                    the firstborn to Jehovah that is discussed and rejected in Micah vi. It is
                    indeed plain that such a sacrifice—for we have here to do, not with human
                    victims in general, but with the sacrifice of the dearest earthly thing—could
                    only be paid to the supreme deity; and Manasseh and his people never ceased to
                    acknowledge Jehovah as the God of Israel, though they sought to make their
                    worship more efficacious by the adoption of foreign rites. Thus the way in which
                    Jeremiah, and after him the legislation of Leviticus and the author of Kings,
                    seem to mark out the Moloch or Baal as a false god, distinct from Jehovah, is
                    precisely parallel to the way in which Hosea speaks of the golden calves or
                    Baalim. In each case the people thought themselves to be worshipping Jehovah
                    under the title of Moloch or Baal; but the prophet refuses to admit that this is
                    so, because the worship itself is of heathenish origin and character. “The
                    Moloch,” in fact, like “the Baal,” is not the proper name of a deity, but a
                    honorific title, as appears from the use of the article with it. According to
                    the Hebrew consonants, it might simply be read “the king,” which is a common
                    appellation for the supreme deity of a Semitic state or tribe.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare the Tyrian Melkart
                    (king of the city) and the two names compounded with <hi rend="italic"
                    >melek,</hi> “king,” in 2 Kings xvii. 31. These latter cases are specially
                    instructive, because Adrammelech and Anna-melech were also worshipped by the
                    sacrifice of children.</p></note> And so the LXX., except in 2 Kings xxiii. 10,
                    and perhaps Jer. xxxii. 35, actually treat the name as an appellative ( ‘ ‘
                    ruler,” ‘ ‘ rulers ”). The traditional pronunciation, which goes back as far as
                    the LXX. version of Kings (Μολόχ), appears to mean “the kingship ”—an unsuitable
                    sense, which lends probability to the conjecture that the old form was simply
                    “the king,” and that the later Jews gave it the vowels of Γ)E⅛, the contemptuous
                    name for Baal (G. Hoffman in <hi rend="italic">Z.f. AT.W.,</hi> 1883, p.
                    124).</p>
                <p>From these arguments it would appear that the rise of Moloch worship does not
                    imply the introduction into the religion of Judah of an altogether new deity,
                    but only a heathenish development of Jehovah worship, in the familiar fashion of
                    religious syncretism, and under that sense of the inadequacy of the old popular
                    ritual to divert the wrath of the Godhead which was inspired by the calamities
                    of the nation in the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and led to more
                    than one new development of atoning ritual. The key to the phenomenon is to be
                    found in Micah vi., not in any vein of mythological speculation as to the forces
                    of nature, such as is supposed in Movers’s theory that Moloch represents the
                    fiery destructive power of the sun. Moloch, in fact, in the Old Testament has no
                    more to do with fire than any other deity. The children offered to him were not
                    burned alive; they were slain and burned like any other holocaust (Ezek. <hi
                    rend="italic">ut supra</hi>; Isa. Ivii. 5); their blood was shed at the
                    sanctuary (Jer. xix. 4; Ps. cvi. 38). Thus the late Rabbinical picture of the
                    calf-headed brazen image of Moloch within which children were burned alive is
                    pure fable, and with it falls the favourite comparison between Moloch and the
                    Carthaginian idol from whose brazen arms children were rolled into an abyss of
                    fire, and whom Diodorus (xix. 14) naturally identifies with the child-eater
                    Kronos, thus leading many moderns to make Moloch the planet Saturn. On the other
                    hand, the Massoretic text of 1 Kings xi. 7 makes Moloch (without the article)
                    the name of the god of the Ammonites, elsewhere called Milcom or Malcam. But in
                    this place the LXX. translators certainly found the longer form ED⅛ in their
                    MSS. (as the Hebrew still reads in verse 33), while it is plain from 2 Kings
                    xxiii. 10, 13 that the worship of Milcom at the shrine set up by Solomon was
                    distinct from the much later Moloch worship of Tophet. In the usual printed text
                    of the LXX., indeed, this distinction is not made in 2 Kings xxiii.; but this is
                    an error of the Roman edition, the Vatican MS. really reading MOΛXOA in verse
                    13.</p>
