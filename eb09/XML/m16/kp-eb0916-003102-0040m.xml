                <p><label type="entry">MERCURY</label>, in chemistry, is a metal (symbol Hg) which
                    is easily distinguished from all others by its being liquid at even the lowest
                    temperatures naturally occurring in moderate climates. To this exceptional
                    property it owes the synonyms of <hi rend="italic">quicksilver</hi> in English
                    (with the Germans <hi rend="italic">quecksilber</hi> is the only recognized
                    name) and of <hi rend="italic">hydrargyrum</hi> (from υδωp, water, and άργυρο?,
                    silver) inGraeco-Latin.</p>

                <p>This metal does not appear to have been known to the ancient Jews, nor is it
                    mentioned by the earlier Greek writers. Theophrastus (about 300 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> mentions it as a derivative of cinnabar. With the
                    alchemists it was a substance of great consequence. Being ignorant of its
                    susceptibility of freezing into a compact solid, they did not recognize it as a
                    true metal, and yet, on the authority of Geber, they held that mercury (meaning
                    the predominating element in this metal) enters into the composition of all
                    metals, and is the very cause of their metalhcity. When, about the beginning of
                    the 16 th century, chemistry and scientific medicine came to merge into one,
                    this same mysterious element of “mercury” played a great part in the theories of
                    pathology; and the metal, in the free as in certain combined states, came to be
                    looked upon as a powerful medicinal agent, which position, on purely empirical
                    grounds, it continues to hold to the present day.</p>
                <p>Mercury occurs in nature chiefly in the form of a red sulphide, HgS, called
                    cinnabar, which, as a rule, is accompanied by more or less of the reguline
                    metal,—the latter being probably derived from the former by some secondary
                    reaction. The most important mercury mines in Europe are those of Almaden in
                    Spain and of Idria in Illyria; these until lately furnished the bulk of the
                    mercury of commerce, but they are now almost eclipsed by the rich deposits of
                    New Almaden in California. Considerable quantities of mercury are said to be
                    produced in China and in Japan; minor deposits are being worked in the Bavarian
                    Palatinate, in Hungary, Transylvania, Bohemia, and Peru. At Almaden the ore
                    forms mighty veins traversing micaceous schists of the older transition period;
                    in Illyria it is disseminated in beds of bituminous schists or compact limestone
                    of more recent date.</p>
                <p>Chemically speaking, the extraction of mercury from its ores is a simple matter.
                    Metallic mercury is easily volatilized, and separated from the gangue, at
                    temperatures far below redness, and cinnabar at a red heat is readily reduced to
                    the metallic state by the action of iron or lime or atmospheric oxygen, the
                    sulphur being eliminated, in the first case as sulphide of iron, in the second
                    as sulphide and sulphate of calcium, in the third as sulphurous acid gas. To the
                    chemical mind a close iron retort would suggest itself as the proper kind of
                    apparatus for carrying out these operations, but this idea is acted upon only in
                    a few small establishments,—for instance, in that of Zweibrücken in the
                    Palatinate, where lime is used as a decomposing agent. In all the large works
                    the decomposition of the cinnabar is effected by the direct exposure of the ore
                    to the oxidizing flame of a furnace, and the mercury vapour, which of course
                    gets diffused through an immense mass of combustion gases, is sought to be
                    recovered in more or less imperfect condensers.</p>
                <p>At Almaden this roasting distillation is effected in prismatic furnaces, which,
                    by a second upper (brick) grating are divided into two flats, the lower one
                    serving for the generation of a wood fire, while the upper accommodates the ore,
                    which is introduced through an opening in the dome-shaped roof. To avoid an
                    excessive dilution of the mercury vapour with combustion gases, part of these
                    are led out laterally into a chimney and the rest allowed to strike up through
                    the heap of ore. The large mass of metalliferous vapour produced passes out
                    through a system of pipes inserted laterally into the dome and so arranged that
                    they follow first a descending and then an ascending plane, to lead ultimately
                    into a condensation chamber which communicates in its turn with a chimney. The
                    pipes are formed each of a large number of elongated pear-shaped earthenware
                    adapters (called <hi rend="italic">aludels),</hi> which are telescoped into one
                    another as in the case of the iodine-distillation apparatus, the joints being
                    luted with clay. The lowest row of aludels, which lie in the line of
                    intersection of the two inclined planes, are pierced with holes below, so that
                    what arrives as liquid mercury there runs out into a gutter leading to a
                    reservoir. What of mercury vapour remains uncondensed in the aludels passes into
                    the chamber, the intention being to have it condensed there; in reality a large
                    proportion of the mercury passes out through the chimney (and through the
                    numerous leaks in the aludels) into the atmosphere to poison the surrounding
                    vegetation and the workmen. Similar furnaces to the Almaden ones are used in
                    Idria and at New Almaden; only the condensation apparatus are a little less
                    imperfect. But in all three places the loss of metal is very considerable; at
                    New Almaden it is said to amount to close upon 40 per cent.</p>
                <p>The mercury obtained is purified mechanically by straining it through dense linen
                    bags, and then sent out into commerce in leather bags, or in wrought-iron
                    bottles provided with screw plugs, each holding about 75 lb avoirdupois.</p>
                <p>According to Balling’s <hi rend="italic">Metallurgische Chemie</hi> (Bonn, 1882),
                    the production of mercury in the years named was as follows :—</p>

                <p>Assuming the amount to be the same from year to year, this gives a total of 3587
                    tons.</p>
                <p>The price of the metal is subject to immense fluctuations; it generally ranges
                    from 2s. to 7s. 6d. a pound avoirdupois.</p>
                <p>Commercial mercury, as a rule, is very pure chemically, so that it needs only to
                    be forced through chamois leather to become fit for all ordinary applications;
                    but the metal, having the power of dissolving most ordinary other metals, is
                    very liable to get contaminated with these in the laboratory or workshop, and
                    requires then to be purified. For this purpose a great many chemical methods
                    have been proposed, which, however, all come to this, that the base admixtures
                    are sought to be removed by treatment with nitric acid, oil of vitriol, or other
                    agents which act preferably on the impurities. The best of these methods is that
                    of Brühl, who shakes the metal with a solution of 5 grammes of bichromate of
                    potash and a few cubic centimetres of sulphuric acid in one litre of water,
                    until the red chromate of mercury, first produced, has disappeared, and its
                    place been taken by green chromic sulphates. The supernatant liquor and chromic
                    scum are washed away by a powerful jet of water, and the clean metal is dried
                    and filtered through a perforated paper filter. The only really exhaustive
                    method is redistillation out of a glass apparatus. Unfortunately the operation
                    is difficult of execution, as mercury “bumps” badly on boiling; but this can be
                    avoided by distilling the metal in a <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> vacuum. An
                    ingenious apparatus for this purpose, in which the distilled metal itself is
                    made to keep up the vacuum, was constructed lately by Leonhard Weber. A U-tube,
                    the limbs of which are longer than the height of the barometer, is filled with
                    pure mercury, and inverted, the one limb being made to dip into a vessel with
                    pure, the other into another containing the impure, mercury. This second limb is
                    inflated above so that the meniscus is about the middle of the bulb. This bulb
                    is heated, and the consequence is that the metal there distils over into the
                    first limb to add to the supply of pure metal, the impure rising up in the
                    second by itself to maintain a constant level. Dewar has modified the apparatus
                    so that there is no need of a supply of pure metal to start with. Absolutely
                    pure mercury does not at all adhere to any surface which does not consist of a
                    metal soluble in mercury. Hence the least quantity of it, when placed on a sheet
                    of paper, forms a neatly rounded-off globule, which retains its form on being
                    rolled about, and, when subdivided, breaks up into a number of equally perfect
                    globules. The presence in it of the minutest trace of lead or tin causes it to
                    “draw tails.” A very impure metal may adhere even to glass, and in a glass
                    vessel, instead of the normal convex, form an irregular flat meniscus.</p>

                    greater than that of water, and is proved (by Herwig) to be perfectly constant
                    from 40° to 160° C. Its vapour density (air of the same temperature and pressure
                    = 1) is 6'976 (Dumas), or 100'93 for hydrogen = 1. Hence its molecular weight (H
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2) is 201'86. The atomic weight, by chemical
                    methods, was found = 200 ’ 0 (Erdmann and Marchand); hence mercury-vapour
                    molecules consist of single atoms. Mercury does not appreciably absorb any
                    chemically inert gas.</p>
                <p>Mercury is in constant requisition in the laboratory. It is used for the
                    collecting and measuring of gases, in the construction of thermometers,
                    barometers, and manometers, for the determination of the capacity of vessels,
                    and many other purposes. In medicine it serves for the preparation of mercurial
                    ointment and of “hydrargyrum cum creta” (the chief component of “blue pills ”);
                    both are obtained by diligently triturating the metal with certain proportions
                    of grease and chalk respectively until it is “deadened,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> subdivided into invisibly small globules (see below).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alloys.—</hi> Mercury readily unites directly with all metals
                    (except iron and platinum) into what are called amalgams. In some cases the
                    union takes place with considerable evolution of heat and large modification of
                    the mean properties of the components. Thus, for instance, sodium when rubbed up
                    with mercury unites with it with deflagration and formation of an alloy which,
                    if it contains more than 2 per cent, of sodium, is hard and brittle, although
                    sodium is as soft as wax and mercury a liquid. Liquid amalgams of gold and
                    silver are employed for gilding and silvering objects of copper, bronze, or
                    other base metal. The amalgam is spread out on the surface of the object by
                    means of a brush, and the mercury then driven off by the application of heat,
                    when a polishable, firmly adhering film of the noble metal remains. Copper
                    amalgam containing from 25 to 33 per cent, of the solid metal, when worked in a
                    mortar at 100° C., becomes highly plastic, but on standing in the cold for ten
                    or twelve hours becomes hard and crystalline. Hence it is used for the stuffing
                    of teeth. A certain amalgam of cadmium is similarly employed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Oxides.—</hi> There are two oxides of mercury, namely, an
                    oxide, Hg <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, called mercurous, and another, HgO,
                    called mercuric oxide. The latter can be produced directly by keeping the metal
                    for a long time in air at a temperature somewhat below its boiling point, when
                    the oxide is gradually formed as a red powdery solid. This solid has long been
                    known as “red precipitate,” or as <hi rend="italic">mercurius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">praecipitatus</hi><hi rend="italic">per se.</hi> Priestley made
                    the important discovery that the “precipitate” when heated to dull redness is
                    reduced to metal, with evolution of what has since been known as oxygen gas; but
                    it was reserved for Lavoisier to correctly interpret this experiment, and thus
                    to establish our present views on the constitution of atmospheric air. The oxide
                    is easily prepared by heating any nitrate of the metal as long as nitrous fumes
                    are seen to go off (when it remains as a scaly mass, black when hot, red after
                    cooling), or else by precipitating the solution of a mercuric salt with excess
                    of caustic potash or soda, when it comes down as an amorphous yellow
                    precipitate, which is free of combined water. Mercurous oxide, a black solid,
                    can be obtained only indirectly, by the decomposition of mercurous salts with
                    fixed caustic alkalies. Both oxides are insoluble in water, but dissolve in
                    certain, and combine with all, aqueous acids with formation of mercury salts and
                    elimination of water. Thus, for instance,</p>

                    with formation of a yellow insoluble basic salt, which has long been known as

                <p><hi rend="italic">The Chlorides. —</hi> These are both extensively used medicinal
                    agents. The mercuric salt, HgCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, known in medicine
                    as corrosive sublimate, is prepared by mixing the sulphate intimately with
                    common salt, and subjecting the mixture to sublimation, a little binoxide of
                    manganese being added to oxidize the mercurous salt, which is generally present
                    as an impurity. The process is conducted in a glass flask buried in a hot
                    sand-bath. When the decomposition is accomplished, the sand is removed from the
                    upper half of the flask and the temperature raised so that the chloride HgCl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> produced sublimes up and condenses in the upper part as
                    a “sublimate.” The salt, as thus produced, forms compact crystalline crusts,
                    which, when heated, melt into a limpid liquid before volatilizing. It is soluble
                    in water, 100 parts of which at 10°, 20°, 100° dissolve 6'57, 7'39, 54 parts of
                    salt. Corrosive sublimate dissolves in 3 parts of alcohol and in 4 parts of
                    ether. This salt, on account of its solubility in water, is a deadly poison.
                    Mercurous chloride, Hg <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, better known as “calomel” (from <hi rend="italic">κaλos,</hi> fair, and

                    corrosive sublimate with the proper proportion of metallic mercury (HgCl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>: Hg) or mercuric sulphate with salt and mercury in the

                    Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is thus obtained in the form of white, opaque,
                    crystalline crusts, which, when heated, volatilize, without previously melting,
                    into a mixture of HgCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and Hg vapour, which, on
                    cooling, recombine into calomel. For medicinal purposes the sublimate is reduced
                    to an impalpable powder, washed with water to remove any corrosive sublimate
                    that may be present, and dried. Being insoluble in water, it acts far less
                    violently on the organism than mercuric chloride does. Its action, no doubt, is
                    due to its very gradual conversion in the stomach into mercury and corrosive
                    sublimate. Finely divided calomel can be produced, without trouble, by the
                    precipitation of a solution of mercurous nitrate with hydrochloric acid or
                    common salt; but this preparation is liable to be contaminated with mercurous
                    nitrate, and, even when pure, has been found to act far more violently than
                    ordinary calomel does. Hence its use is not tolerated by the pharmacopoeias.
                    According to Wöhler a mercurous chloride, more nearly equivalent to the sublimed
                    article, is producible by heating corrosive sublimate solution with sulphurous

                    precipitating corrosive sublimate solution with its exact equivalent of iodide
                    of potassium. In the first case the salt is obtained in yellow crystals, which,
                    on the slightest touch with a solid body, assume and then permanently retain a
                    rich scarlet colour. The precipitation process at once yields the scarlet salt.
                    The salt is insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol and in iodide of

                    exists in two modifications, of which one is amorphous and has a black colour,
                    while the other is crystalline and red. The black one is obtained by
                    precipitation of solutions of mercuric salts with excess of sulphuretted
                    hydrogen, or by direct synthesis. The right proportions of mercury and flowers
                    of sulphur are rubbed together in a mortar until the whole is converted into a
                    jet-black uniform powder. This preparation (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sethiops</hi><hi rend="italic">mineralis</hi> of the pharmaceutist), however,
                    is apt to be contaminated with uncombined sulphur and mercury. Application of a
                    gentle heat causes exhaustive combination. The red sulphide, HgS, occurs in
                    nature as cinnabar, and can be produced artificially from the black. The
                    artificial preparation, known as vermilion, is highly valued as the most
                    brilliant, stable, and innocuous of all mineral red pigments. Vermilion can be
                    produced from the black sulphide in two ways, viz., first by sublimation, and
                    secondly by treatment of it with fixed alkaline sulphide solution. According to
                    Brunner, 100 parts of mercury are mixed intimately with 38 parts of flowers of
                    sulphur, and the aethiops is digested, with constant agitation, in a solution of
                    25 parts of potash in 150 parts of water at 45° C. (the water lost by

                    preparation has come up to its maximum of fire and brilliancy, which takes a
                    good many hours. Purely sublimed vermilion has a comparatively dull colour, and
                    must be manipulated with alkaline sulphide solution to give it the necessary
                    fire. The action of the alkaline sulphide consists probably in this, that it
                    dissolves successive instalments of the amorphous preparation and redeposits

                    (3), and is obtained by boiling it with sal-ammoniac solution. Its composition

                <p><hi rend="italic">Analysis.—</hi> Any ordinary solid mercury compound, when
                    heated in a sublimation tube with carbonate of soda, yields a sublimate of
                    metallic mercury, which, if necessary, needs only to be scraped together with a
                    wooden spill to unite into visible globules. From any mercury-salt solution the
                    metal is precipitated by digestion with a piece of bright copper-foil. The
                    precipitated mercury forms a coating on the copper, which becomes silvery on
                    being rubbed with blotting paper. When the quicksilvered copper is heated in a
                    sublimation tube, it reassumes its red colour with formation of a sublimate of
                    mercury.</p>
                <p>Solutions of mercurous salts with hydrochloric acid give a white precipitate of
                    calomel, which, after filtration, is easily identified by its becoming jet-black
                    on treatment with ammonia. From mercuric solutions hydrochloric acid
                    precipitates nothing; but stannous chloride, in its twofold capacity as a
                    chloride and a reducing agent, yields a precipitate of calomel. On addition of
                    an excess of reagent the precipitate becomes grey through conversion into finely
                    divided quicksilver. Sulphuretted hydrogen, when added very gradually to an acid
                    mercuric solution, gives at first an almost white precipitate, which, on
                    addition of more and more reagent, assumes successively a yellow, orange, and at
                    last jet-black colour. The black precipitate is HgS, which is identified by its
                    great heaviness, and by its being insoluble in boiling nitric and in boiling
                    hydrochloric acid. A mixture of the two (aqua regia) dissolves it as chloride.

                <p><hi rend="italic">Therapeutics of Mercury.</hi></p>
                <p>The use of mercury as a therapeutic agent is of comparatively recent date. To the
                    Greeks and Romans its value was unknown, and the Arabian physicians only used it
                    for skin affections. It was not till the middle of the 16th century that the
                    special properties of mercury were fully appreciated, but since that time the
                    metal has continued to hold a high though fluctuating value as a medicine. At
                    first the metal in a finely divided state or in vapour was used; but very soon
                    its various compounds were found to be endowed with powers even greater than
                    those of the metal itself, and with the discovery of new compounds the number of
                    mercurial medicines has largely increased.</p>
                <p>The preparations now in use may be thus classified. (1) Of the preparations
                    containing metallic mercury the chief members are blue pill (pilula hydrargyri),
                    grey powder (hydrargyrum cum creta), and blue ointment (unguentum hydrargyri).
                    The first consists of mercury, liquorice root, and confection of roses, the
                    second of mercury and chalk, the third of mercury, suet, and lard. The power of
                    the three preparations seems to depend on the fine state of subdivision of the
                    mercury they contain; mercury in its ordinary liquid state seems devoid of
                    medicinal properties. It is thought by some that the fine subdivision of the
                    metal leads to the formation of a little oxide, and that the efficacy of the
                    preparations in part depends on this. (2) Three oxides of mercury are employed
                    in medicine,—the red, from which is made red precipitate ointment (unguentum
                    hydrargyri oxydi rubri), the yellow, an allotropic form of the red, and the
                    black oxide. The yellow and black oxides suspended in lime water form
                    respectively yellow and black wash (lotio flava and lotio nigra). (3) The
                    chlorides of mercury form a very important group: calomel (hydrargyri
                    subchloridum) is a white heavy powder; corrosive sublimate (hydrargyri
                    perchloridum) is a heavy crystalline substance. (4) Two iodides are used
                    medicinally; they are known from their colour as the green and red iodides. (5)
                    Nitrate of mercury enters into the composition of a powerful caustic known as
                    the acid nitrate of mercury. It is also the active principle of citrine ointment
                    (unguentum hydrargyri nitratis). (6) In this class only ammoniated mercury and
                    its ointment commonly known as white precipitate ointment, are contained. Of the
                    many compounds not included in the above classification the oleate and
                    albuminate are the most important.</p>
                <p>Mercurial preparations are largely employed as external applications. Several of
                    them are potent agents for the destruction of the lower forms of animal life,
                    and hence are employed to destroy parasites having their habitat in skin, hair,
                    and clothing. The white and red precipitate ointments are specially effective in
                    the destruction of pediculi, and blue ointment is occasionally used for the same
                    purpose. Corrosive sublimate is, however, the most energetic of the mercurial
                    parasiticides, and recent observations seem to show that it is superior to
                    almost all other substances as a germ destroyer. It is sometimes used to get rid
                    of ringworm. It should be remembered that corrosive sublimate is a powerful
                    irritant to the skin, and also an active poison.</p>
                <p>Acid nitrate of mercury is a caustic, and by it warts and small growths are
                    sometimes removed; it is also one of the caustics occasionally applied to
                    prevent the spread of lupus.</p>
                <p>In skin diseases mercurial preparations are largely used, especially in some
                    forms of eczema. A few grains of the red oxide or of ammoniated mercury in an
                    ounce of zinc ointment are often found of great service in this ailment; citrine
                    ointment is also useful.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n44/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0044-0035"/>
                <p>Calomel ointment is not irritating, but rather tends to soothe. It is therefore
                    sometimes applied to irritable rashes; in pruritus ani it is of special value.
                    Mercurial preparations are not usually found of benefit in scaly eruptions. In
                    acne a weak solution of corrosive sublimate is often most effective.</p>
                <p>Preparations of mercury are often used to heal ulcers, especially those of
                    syphilitic origin. Black wash is one of the commonest applications for this
                    purpose. The red oxide ointment is at times employed to stimulate indolent
                    ulcers, and it is capable of removing exuberant granulations (proud flesh),
                    which sometimes retard the healing of wounds.</p>
                <p>Mercury is largely used externally to promote the absorption of inflammatory
                    products, especially in the neighbourhood of joints. The blue ointment is
                    frequently employed for this purpose, more rarely a plaster containing mercury
                    or a mercurial liniment. For effecting the absorption of goitre (Derbyshire
                    neck) the ointment of the red iodide is often relied on, especially in India,
                    where it is customary to expose the patient’s neck to the sun after rubbing it
                    with the ointment. In enlargements of the liver and spleen the application of
                    mercurial ointment sometimes seems to promote reduction in size.</p>
                <p>Taken internally in continued doses, mercury produces a peculiar effect known as
                    salivation. First a metallic taste is experienced; this is followed by soreness
                    of the gums, an undue flow of saliva, and foetor of the breath. Further
                    administration of the drug may increase greatly the salivary flow, and also lead
                    to swelling of the tongue, ulceration of the mouth, and even disease of the
                    jaw-bone. At the same time the blood becomes impoverished, and feverishness with
                    loss of flesh occurs. A single large dose—rarely too a single small dose—may
                    produce some of the above symptoms. They may also follow the inhalation of the
                    metal or its compounds, or their absorption through the skin. The long-continued
                    inhalation of the vapour of mercury acts likewise on the nervous system, causing
                    a peculiar kind of trembling. Mercurial tremor is sometimes seen in
                    looking-glass makers, often in those who work in quicksilver mines.</p>
                <p>Internally mercury is chiefly given for two purposes—(1) to check inflammation
                    and cause the absorption of the products it gives rise to, and (2) to antagonize
                    the syphilitic virus and remove the evils it causes. Some years ago the belief
                    in the power of mercury to control inflammation was almost universal, and it was
                    largely administered in almost all inflammatory affections, but of late it has
                    been much less used, both because it seems doubtful whether it has really the
                    power it was once supposed to have and because of the possibility of evil
                    results from its continued use. In peritonitis and iritis it is still often
                    employed, small doses of calomel being given. Not unfrequently too it is
                    administered in pericarditis and hepatitis, but in pneumonia, pleurisy, and most
                    other inflammatory affections its use is now discarded by many physicians. As an
                    antidote to the syphilitic poison it is still held in high esteem, though
                    opinions vary much as to the extent of its power. There can be little doubt
                    that, given in an early stage of the disorder, it minimizes the secondary
                    symptoms; but it cannot be relied on to prevent their occurrence. It aids in
                    removing the secondary symptoms, and tends to the avoidance of tertiary
                    manifestations, which nevertheless sometimes occur even when mercury has been
                    freely given. The custom of giving mercury till profuse salivation is
                    established has long been abandoned; the aim now is so to give it as to prevent
                    salivation occurring; for this purpose blue pill, calomel, and corrosive
                    sublimate are given in very small doses, but if the gums become tender the dose
                    is decreased or the administration stopped.</p>
                <p>Mercurial treatment is sometimes carried out by rubbing the blue ointment into
                    the skin, sometimes by exposing the patient to the fumes of calomel; syphilitic
                    eruptions are often treated by such fumigation. More rarely mercury is
                    introduced by injecting the albuminate or some other preparation under the skin
                    or by means of suppositories. In children grey powder is generally used when
                    mercurial treatment is required. Children bear mercury well.</p>
                <p>Blue pill, calomel, and grey powder are often used as purgatives, and a power of
                    promoting the secretion of bile is attributed to them. Experimentally it has not
                    been proved that they stimulate the liver functions, but there is good reason
                    for believing that they promote the expulsion of bile from the body. Grey powder
                    is especially valued as a mild and efficient aperient for children, and is often
                    given in the early stage of diarrhoea to expel the irritating contents of the
                    bowel.</p>
                <p>The use of calomel in tropical dysentery, once very prevalent, has within the
                    last few years been abandoned. (D. J. I.. )</p>
