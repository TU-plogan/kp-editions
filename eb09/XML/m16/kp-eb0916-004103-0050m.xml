                <p>The oasis of Merv lies in the midst of a desert, in about 37° 30' N. lat. and 62°
                    E. long. It is about 250 miles from Herat, 170 from Charjui on the Oxus, 360
                    from Khiva, and 175 from Gawars, the nearest point in the newly acquired (1881)
                    Russian territory of Akhal.</p>

                    extends across the Asiatic continent from the Caspian to China, and forms the

                    of Iran. In bye-gone epochs their banks have, under powerful rulers, been
                    studded with populous and flourishing cities, which bore the name of “Sovereign
                    of the Universe” <hi rend="italic">(Merv Shah-irjehan),</hi> and vied for fame
                    with “Balkh, the Mother of cities”; of late times, with weakness or absence of
                    government, those same banks have become choked with fallen battlements and
                    ruins, the home of the snake and the jackal.</p>
                <p>Merv has soared to prosperity or fallen to decay according to her political
                    status at the moment, and history, which repeats itself, may yet have to sing
                    her praises in the future as it has done in the past. All that human life in the
                    desert requires is there,—water in abundance, and a soil unsurpassed for
                    fertility. Good government is alone wanting to turn those natural gifts to full
                    account.</p>
                <p>The present inhabitants of the district are Turcomans of the Tekke tribe, who,
                    like the other tribes inhabiting Turcomania, enjoyed until the approach of the
                    Russians virtual independence, and acknowledged allegiance to no one,—a pastoral
                    people who eked out a miserable existence by the trade of passing caravans, and
                    in bad times pillaged the neighbouring and equally barbarous states, to whose
                    reprisals they were in turn subjected.</p>
                <p>From the year 1869, the date of the establishment of the Russian military
                    settlement at Krasnovodsk on the east shore of the Caspian, the wave of Russian
                    conquest has gradually swept eastwards along the northern frontier of Persia
                    until it has for the moment stopped at the outermost border of the Akhal
                    Turcoman country, which was incorporated in 1881 by Russia as the result of the
                    defeat of that tribe at Geok Tepe. Among the districts still farther east, to
                    which the Russians give the name of Eastern Turcomania, is that of the Merv
                    Tekke Turcomans, kinsmen of the Akhal Tekkes, the most recent of Russia’s
                    subjects. The district of the Merv Tekkes may be taken to be that included
                    between the lower Murghab below Yulutan, where the river enters the plain, and
                    the Persian frontier from Sarakhs to Gawars.</p>
                <p>A reference to the map will show the strategical importance of this district,
                    situated at the point of meeting of two lines, of which one is the strategic
                    line of Russian advance on Herat from Krasnovodsk to Sarakhs, and the other the
                    strategic line of advance on the same place from Tashkend through Bokhara. The
                    capital of the district is, moreover, the crossing-point of the Herat-Khiva and
                    Meshed-Bokhara trade routes.</p>
                <p>Consequently this district, a solitary oasis in a vast desert, guarantees to its
                    possessor the command of an important avenue between north and south, and, in
                    the event of its falling into Russian hands, will give that power in addition a
                    valuable link in the chain of connexion between her recent acquisitions on the
                    Persian frontier and those in Turkestan, the forging of which has been
                    persistently advocated by Russian writers for years past. One of these, Colonel
                    Veniukoff, frankly admits that it is the political results—“the consolidation of
                    friendly relations with the Turcomans ”—and not commercial interests merely,
                    that are primarily looked to, and openly states that the forward movement in
                    Central Asia “cannot end otherwise than by the annexation to Russia of the whole
                    of Turan.”</p>
                <p>Whether by design or by the force of circumstances, the recommendations of those
                    writers have been translated into facts, and Russia with her advanced post at
                    Askabad is now within 400 miles of Herat, which Sir Henry Rawlinson designates
                    as the key of India. The occupation of the Merv Tekke country would bring Russia
                    to within 250 miles of Herat. From Askabad she is in connexion with the Caspian
                    by a good line of communication, part of which from the sea to Kl·izil Arvat) is
                    by rail; and hence facilities are offered for bringing up not only the resources
                    of the Caucasus but of the whole of European Russia. While Russian troops are
                    within 400 miles of Herat, the British troops at Quetta are more than 500 miles
                    from Herat.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Concurrently
                    with the consolidation of her position in Turcomania, Russia has of late been
                    showing less military activity on the side of her Turkestan district. It is
                    probable that her recent explorations at the sources of the Oxus have
                    demonstrated the impracticability of directing any offensive movement against
                    India from that side. Hence the line of strategical advance has been shifted
                    from Tashkend to Tiflis.</p></note></p>
                <p>These remarks serve to explain the very natural suspicion with which Great
                    Britain has regarded the occupation one after another of important strategical
                    points along that route by which alone Russia can strike at India,—the same line
                    by which Napoleon meditated a Russo-French invasion in the early part of this
                    century.</p>
                <p>In the matter of Merv and the neighbouring Turcoman districts diplomacy has not
                    been idle. As early as 1869, when an interchange of opinions was taking place
                    between the Russian and British Governments with respect to the demarcation of a
                    neutral zone between the two empires, Great Britain objected to the Russian
                    proposal that this zone should be Afghanistan, “because of the near approach to
                    India that would be thereby afforded to Russian troops from the direction of the
                    Kara-kum, the home of the Turcomans, of which Merv is the central point.” In the
                    following year a Russian diplomatist remarked to the British ambassador at St
                    Petersburg, when discussing the Afghan frontier, that great care would be
                    required in tracing a line from Khoja Saleh on the Oxus to the south, as Merv
                    and the country of the Turcomans were becoming “commercially important.” About
                    the same time Russia intimated that, if the amir of Afghanistan claimed to
                    exercise sovereignty over the Tekkes, his pretensions could not be recognized.
                    After the Russian campaign against Khiva in 1873, and the subsequent operations
                    against the Turcomans, the English foreign secretary early in 1874 called
                    attention “to the fears expressed by the amir of Afghanistan as to the
                    complications in which he might become involved with Russia were the result of a
                    Russian expedition against Merv to be to drive the Turcomans to take refuge in
                    the province of Badghees in Herat.” In reply to this communication Prince
                    Gortschakoff repeated the assurance that the imperial Government “had no
                    intention of sending any expedition against the Turcomans, or of occupying
                    Merv.” In 1875 the operations of General Lomakin on the northern frontier of
                    Persia led to representations being made by the British ambassador at the court
                    of St Petersburg. To these Russia replied that the czar had no intention of
                    extending his frontiers on the side of Bokhara or on the side of Krasnovodsk.
                    Notwithstanding the oft-repeated assurances to the contrary, large annexations
                    have been since made in Turcomania by the Russians, and these proceedings,
                    clearly indicating the persistent prosecution of a concerted plan, have
                    naturally tended to disturb the harmonious relations which should subsist
                    between the two great civilizing powers of the East.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Settlements and Inhabited Centres.—</hi> Of towns or even
                    villages, fixed centres of habitation, there are none, according to Mr
                    O’Donovan, the latest European traveller to Merv. The present political and
                    military capital of Merv is Koushid Khan Kala, a fort which serves rather as a
                    place of refuge against sudden attacks than as a habitation. It is situated on
                    the east bank of the most westerly branch of the Murghab, about 25 miles below
                    the dam at Porsa Kala. In form it is oblong, measuring If miles long by I mile
                    broad, is constructed entirely of earth, revetted on the exterior slope with
                    sun-dried brick; the ramparts are 40 feet high, and are 60 feet at the base. The
                    fort is built in a loop of the river, which protects it on two sides; between it
                    and the river is an “obah,” or nomad village of huts and tents, some thousand in
                    number, disposed in rows, but there is no town or settlement.</p>
                <p>Twenty-five miles east of Koushid Khan Kala lie the ruins of the Greek city of
                    Antiochia Margiana, showing traces of a high civilization. According to Strabo
                    (xi. 2) the Merv oasis at this period was surrounded with a wall measuring 1500
                    stadia (185 miles). Mr O’Donovan found the trace of the fort of Iskander to have
                    been quadrangular, with a length of side of 900 yards. This was probably the
                    fort built by Alexander, about 328 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> on his return
                    from <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n52/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0052-0043"/> Sogdiana after the capture of Bessus. The city
                    was destroyed in 666 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> by the Arabs, who built a
                    new one, afterwards known as Sultan Sanjar, about 1000 yards away, and occupying
                    an area, according to Mr O’Donovan, of about 600 yards square. The towers are
                    still extant, and inside can be seen the ruins of a most elaborate tomb, in
                    which the supposed bones of Sultan Sanjar are enshrined. It has always been a
                    place of pilgrimage for the faithful. Not far to the south-west lies the site of
                    the last city of Merv, that which existed up to a hundred years ago, when it was
                    laid waste by the Bokharians. It bears the name of its gallant defender Bairam
                    Ali.</p>
                <p>These three ruins are all that remain of that which flourished of yore as
                    “sovereign of the universe.”</p>
                <p>At the time of the visit of Burnes, Abbott, Shakespear, and Taylour Thomson,
                    about the fourth decade of the century, Merv was under the jurisdiction of
                    Khiva, and the administrative centre was at Porsa Kala, where the dam is
                    situated. This place is now also a waste of mud ruins, uninhabited.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> The Heri-rud (or Tejend, as the river is named
                    below Sarakhs) runs a course of some 280 miles within Afghan borders. On
                    reaching the Persian frontier it turns north and forces a channel through the
                    mountain chain near Sarakhs. Beyond Sarakhs the river is Turcoman on both banks,
                    runs close to the Khelat mountains, and in the latitude of Askabad loses itself
                    in the marshes formed by the spring floods. It is probably the Ochus of ancient
                    geography, which watered Nissa, once the capital of Parthia, and joined the Oxus
                    just before the latter river disembogued into the Caspian (Rennell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Herodotus').</hi> The Tejend is fordable at all points below
                    Sarakhs except in the early spring after the melting of the snows. On the road
                    from Meneh to Merv the river is sluggish, 50 yards wide and <hi rend="italic">4
                    feet</hi> deep in February. The river-bed is sunk 12 to 15 feet below the level
                    of the surrounding country, and has immense quantities of drift wood on its
                    banks; trees and luxuriant herbage clothe the immediate borders. At midsummer
                    the river runs nearly dry, and does not reach Sarakhs. The Kashaf-rud, which
                    flows near Meshed, is one of its chief affluents.</p>
                <p>The Murghab takes its rise in the northern slopes of the Paropamisus, and runs
                    parallel to the Heri-rud at a distance of 70 miles from it. On this river lies
                    the plain or oasis of Merv, irrigated by means of an elaborate system of dams
                    and canals cut from the main river. Beyond the limits of the oasis the Murghab
                    “hides its streams in the sand,” like the Tejend. The river at Porsa Kala (near
                    the principal dam) is 80 yards wide, at Koushid Khan Kala 30 to 40 yards wide.
                    In summer it is much swollen by the melting of the snows, and its stream is then
                    barely fordable. The water is yellow in colour from suspended matter.</p>
                <p>Formerly a great deal of the country, now a waste, between the two rivers was
                    also cultivated by the agency of water derived from canals cut from the Tejend.
                    These canals extended to Kucha Kum in the desert, rendering the journey between
                    the two rivers much easier than in the present day. From the Murghab was also
                    cut, among others, the Kara-i-ab canal, which ran for a distance of 40 miles
                    towards the Tejend. Recent explorers affirm that there is no reason why these
                    canals should not be again filled from those rivers, when the intervening
                    country, “an argillaceous expanse” (O’Donovan), would become culturable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> Merv is surrounded on all sides by desert.
                    On the north, west, and east this desert is sandy and arid; water is exceedingly
                    scarce, the wells being sometimes 60 or 70 miles apart, and easily choked. To
                    the south of Merv, between the rivers Murghab and Tejend, there are traces of
                    past cultivation, of irrigating canals, and of considerable settlements. Between
                    the Tejend and Askabad the road lies through a populous well-cultivated country
                    (Persian territory) by way of Kahka and Lutfabad.</p>
                <p>There are no roads in Merv,—nothing but mere tracks. Many wide and deep
                    irrigating canals have to be crossed; bridges are few and bad. The inhabitants

                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The Turcomans, according to Sir Henry
                    Kawlinson and others, are descendants of the Ghùz or Komani, a race of Turks who
                    migrated westward from their homes in the Altai before the Christian era, and
                    penetrated even to the Danube. From subsequent intermixture with Persian and
                    Caucasian peoples, they exhibit variations from the true Tartar type. According
                    to Baron de Bode the Turcoman closely resembles both in appearance and in speech
                    the Nogai Tartar and the Tartar of Kasan on the Volga.</p>
                <p>They are an independent race, as wild and free as their native desert, brave and
                    very impatient of control—“Wild warriors in stormy freedom bred” (Moore). They
                    have a very evil reputation for brigandage and murder, so much so that the
                    Bokharians and Khivans have a proverb—“If you meet a viper and a Mervi, commence
                    by killing the Mervi and then despatch the viper.” Of late years a change for
                    the better has taken place, and recent travellers among them state that the
                    Mervis show an inclination to lead a more settled life and to establish an
                    elementary form of government (Medjliss), and that it is no longer accounted an
                    honour among them to kill their neighbours. Opium smoking and arrack drinking
                    are apparently widespread vices (O’Donovan); at the same time they are described
                    as clever and intelligent.</p>
                <p>The Merv Tekkes (like the Akhal Tekkes) are classed in two great divisions—the
                    Toktamish and the Otamish. Each of these divisions consists of two clans, and
                    each clan is subdivided into families. The two clans of the Toktamish are called
                    Beg and Wakil; those of the Otamish, Suchmuz and Bukshi. The clans of Beg and
                    Wakil are the most powerful, and occupy that part of the oasis which lies on the
                    right or east bank of the Murghab. The Suchmuz and Bukshi have their tents on
                    the left or west bank.</p>
                <p>There is no machinery of government, and no taxes are levied. Whatever government
                    there be is of a patriarchal nature. Each family has a <hi rend="italic"
                    >ketkhoda</hi> (patriarch), who represents the family in matters of policy, but
                    can only act in accordance with the wishes of the clan. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >aksaJcals,</hi> or grey beards, are also useful in settling intertribal
                    disputes, but they are tolerated only so long as they do not act in opposition
                    to the tribesmen. For external affairs and in time of war the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ketkhodas</hi> exercise a certain amount of power. The authority of <hi
                    rend="italic">ketkhodas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aksakals</hi> is, however,
                    overriden by the laws of custom or usage <hi rend="italic">(deb)</hi> and the
                    less respected laws of religion. The injunctions of deb are paramount. It
                    sanctions the <hi rend="italic">alaman,</hi> or plundering raid, and in general
                    regulates the Turcoman’s daily life; its prescriptions are more binding than
                    those of the Koran.</p>
                <p>The Tekkes marry young. The father purchases for his twelveyear-old son a
                    child-wife for 500 to 2000 krans (£20 to £80). A young widow cf twenty-five is
                    much more valuable, but a woman over forty is not worth the price of a camel. On
                    the conclusion of the bargain, the priest reads a prayer from the Koran, and the
                    marriage becomes valid.</p>
                <p>The dress of the men consists of a long tunic of coarse crimson silk reaching
                    below the knees, with a white sash through which is stuck a dagger; an outer
                    robe of brown camel-hair cloth, a huge sheepskin hat, trousers and slippers or
                    amber-coloured knee-boots, complete the costume. The women are exceedingly fond
                    of trinkets, rings, and amulets, which accompany their movements with a sound as
                    it were of bells. Their dress consists of the same red silk robe as the men
                    wear, with a sash round the waist, and high-heeled boots, red or yellow.</p>
                <p>The religion is Suni Mohammedan; their language Jagatai or Oriental Turk.</p>
                <p>The numbers of Merv Tekkes on the Murghab and Tejend are variously estimated, but
                    may be stated approximately at 40,000 tents, including 5000 tents of the Salor
                    tribe. These 40,000 tents represent a population of 200,000 to 250,000 souls.
                    The Salors and Sariks at Yulutan and Panjdeh, higher up the Murghab, are given
                    at 11,000 tents, or some 60,000 souls.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Products, Arts, and Manufactures.—</hi> The country in all
                    times has been renowned throughout the East for its fertility. Strabo tells us
                    “that it was not uncommon to meet with a vine whose stock could hardly be
                    clasped by two men with outstretched arms, while <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n53/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0053-0044"/> clusters of grapes might be gathered, two cubits
                    in length.” The Arab traveller Ibn Haukal, writing in the 10th century, remarks
                    that “the fruits of Merv are finer than those of any other place, and one cannot
                    see in any other city such palaces with groves and streams and gardens.” A local
                    proverb says, “Sow a grain to reap a hundred.” All cereals and many fruits grow
                    in great abundance.</p>
                <p>The Turcomans possess a famous breed of horses,—not prepossessing in appearance,
                    being somewhat leggy and long in the back and neck, but capable of accomplishing
                    long distances—50 or 60 miles—for several days in succession, and with very
                    little food. Their great peculiarity appears to be their hairlessness; the coat
                    is very fine, the mane and tail very scanty. This breed of horses, as well as
                    the wealth of the Merv Tekkes in camels and flocks, is fast disappearing.</p>
                <p>The Turcomans are noted as excellent workers in silver and as armourers, and
                    their carpets are superior to Persian. They also make felts and a rough cloth of
                    sheep’s wool.</p>
                <p>One of the chief occupations of the male sex is the repair of the dams and the
                    clearing of the canals, upon the efficiency of which their existence is
                    dependent. The services of a large number of workmen are always held in
                    readiness for the purpose. In 1878 the unusual mass of water in the Murghab
                    carried away the dam, and the drying up of some of the canals nearly led to a
                    failure of the crops.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The position of Merv, in the midst of sandy
                    deserts in the heart of Asia, makes the climate in the heat of summer most
                    oppressive. The least wind raises clouds of fine sand and dust, which fill the
                    air, render it so opaque as to obscure the noonday sun, and make respiration
                    difficult. In winter the climate is very fine. Snow falls rarely, and melts at
                    once.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The name Merv, or some similar form, occurs at a
                    very early period in the history of the Aryan race. Under Mouru we find it
                    mentioned with Bakhdi (Balkh) in the geography of the Zend Avesta (<hi
                    rend="italic">Vendidad,</hi> fargand i., ed. Spiegel), which dates probably from
                    a period anterior to the conquest of Bactria by the Assyrians, and therefore at
                    least one thousand two hundred years before the Christian era. Under the name of
                    Margu it occurs in the cuneiform inscriptions of Darius Hystaspis, where it is
                    referred to as forming part of one of the satrapies of the ancient Persian
                    empire <hi rend="italic">(Inscriptiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Behistani,</hi>
                    ed. Kossowicz). It afterwards became a province (Μαργ«ανή) of the Graeco-Syrian,
                    Parthian, and Persian kingdoms. Ou the Margus—the Epardus of Arrian and now the
                    Murghab —stood the capital of the district, Antiochia Margiana, so called after
                    Antiochus Soter, who rebuilt the city founded by Alexander the Great. About the
                    5th century, during the dynasty of the Sasanids, Merv was the seat of a
                    Christian archbishopric of the Nestorian Church. In the middle of the 7th
                    century the flood of Arab conquest swept over the mountains of Persia to the
                    deserts of Central Asia. Merv was occupied 666 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> by
                    the lieutenants of the caliph Othman, and was constituted the capital of
                    Khorasan. From this city as their base the Arabs, under Kuteibe bin Muslim,
                    early in the 8th century brought under subjection Balkh, Bokhara, Ferghana, and
                    Kashgaria, and penetrated into China as far as the province of Kan-su. In the
                    latter part of the 8th century Merv became obnoxious to Islam as the centre of
                    heretical propaganda preached by Mokannah (Haschern ben Hakem), the “veiled
                    prophet of Khorasan,” who claimed to be the incarnation of the Deity. In 874
                    Arab rule in Central Asia came to an end. During their dominion Merv, like
                    Samarkand and Bokhara, became one of the great schools of science, and the
                    celebrated historian Yakut studied in its libraries. About 1037 the Seljukian
                    Turks crossed the Oxus from the north and raised Toghrul Beg, grandson of
                    Seljuk, to the throne of Persia, founding the Seljukian dynasty, with its
                    capital at Nishapur. A younger brother of Toghrul, Daoud, took possession of
                    Merv and Herat. Toghrul was succeeded by the renowned Alp Arslan (the great
                    lion), whose sway was so vast that, according to tradition, no fewer than twelve
                    hundred kings, princes, and sons of kings and princes did homage before his
                    throne. Alp Arslan was buried at Merv. It was about this time that Merv reached
                    the zenith of her glory. During the reign of Sultan Sanjar of the same house,
                    towards the middle of the 11th century, Merv was overrun by the Turcomans of
                    Ghuz, and the country was reduced to a state of misery and desolation. These
                    Turcomans, the ancestors of the present tribes of Turcomania, were probably
                    introduced into the country by the Seljukian Turks as military colonists. They
                    formed the van of their armies, and rendered efficient service so long as the
                    dynasty lasted, and afterwards took part in the wars of Tamerlane.</p>
                <p>In 1221 Merv opened its gates to Toulai, son of Jenghiz, khan of the Mongols, on
                    which occasion the inhabitants, to the number of 700,000, are said to have been
                    butchered. From this time forward Merv, which had been the chief city of
                    Khorasan, and was popularly supposed to contain a million inhabitants, commenced
                    to languish in obscurity. In the early part of the 14th century Merv was again
                    the seat of a Christian archbishopric of the Eastern Church. On the death of the
                    grandson of Jenghiz Khan Merv became included in the possessions of Toghluk
                    Timur Khan (Tamerlane), in 1380. In 1505 the decayed city was occupied by the
                    Uzbeks, who five years later were expelled by Ismail Khan, the founder of the
                    Suifavean dynasty of Persia. Merv thenceforward remained in the hands of Persia
                    until 1787, when it was attacked and captured by the emir of Bokhara. Seven
                    years later the Bokhanans razed the city to the ground, broke down the dams, and
                    converted the district into a waste. About 1790 the Sarik Turcomans pitched
                    their tents there. When Sir Alexander Burnes traversed the country in 1832, the
                    Khivans were the rulers of Merv, the nomad population being subject to them.
                    About this time the Tekke Turcomans, then living at Orazkala on the Heri-rud,
                    were forced to migrate northward in consequence of the pressure from behind of
                    the Persians. The Khivans contested the advance of the Tekkes, but ultimately,
                    about the year 1856, the latter became the sovereign power in the country, and
                    have ever since resisted all attempts at reconquest.</p>
