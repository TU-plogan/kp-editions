                    area of 3922 square miles. The Ganges divides the district into two portions.
                    The northern, intersected by the Buri Gandak and Tiljugâ, two important
                    tributaries of the Ganges, is always liable to inundation during the rainy
                    season, and is a rich, flat, wheat and rice country, supporting a large
                    population. A considerable area, immediately bordering the banks of the great
                    rivers, is devoted to permanent pasture. Immense quantities of buffaloes are
                    sent every hot season to graze on these marshy prairies; and the <hi

                    important article of export to Calcutta. To the south of the Ganges the country
                    is dry, much less fertile, and broken up by fragmentary ridges. The soil
                    consists of quartz, mixed in varying proportions with mica. Ranges of hills
                    intersect this part of the district, and in the extreme south form conical
                    peaks, densely covered with jungle, but of no great height. Irrigation is
                    necessary throughout the section lying on the south of the Ganges.</p>
                <p>In 1872 the population of Monghyr was 1,812,986 (males, 897,074; females
                    915,912): Hindus, 1,613,546; Mohammedans, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0767-0740"/> 182,269; the remainder, consisting mainly of
                    aboriginal tribes and hill races, profess primitive forms of faith. There are
                    also a few Buddhists and Christians. Seven towns contained upwards of 5000
                    inhabitants in 1872—Monghyr, 59,698; Shaikhpura, 11,536; Jamâlpur, 10,453;
                    Barhiya, 10,405; Surâjgarha, 7935; Barbighâ, 6362; and Jamdi, 5197. No
                    trustworthy statistics of the area under cultivation exist since the revenue
                    survey in 1847, when it was returned at 1,311,768 acres; it is known, however,
                    that cultivation has largely extended since then. The land is held principally
                    under the tenure known as <hi rend="italic">bhâoli-jot,</hi> by which the tenant
                    pays rent, either in money or in kind, according to the out-turn of his crops in
                    each year. It is of ancient standing, and popular with the tenantry. Monghyr is
                    famous for its manufactures of iron: firearms, swords, and iron articles of
                    every kind are produced in abundance, but are noted for cheapness rather than
                    quality. The art of inlaying sword-hilts and other articles with gold and silver
                    affords employment to a few families. The most important manufacture, however,
                    is that of indigo, conducted by means of European capital and under European
                    supervision. The total area under indigo is estimated at about 10,000 acres,
                    with an average out-turn of 2900 cwts. of dye. Minor industries include weaving,
                    dyeing, cabinet-making, boot-making, soap-boiling, and pottery. The principal
                    exports, sent to Calcutta both by rail and river, are oil-seeds, wheat, rice,
                    indigo, gram and pulse, hides, and tobacco; and the chief imports consist of
                    European piece goods, salt, and sugar. The value of the former in 1876-77 was
                    £430,000, and of the latter £314,000. Education is making fair progress, and in
                    1874- 75 there were 229 Government and aided schools, attended by 6675 pupils.
                    The climate is dry and healthy. The temperature is high in the hot weather,
                    reaching 107° Fahr, in May; but the cold weather is cool and pleasant. The
                    average annual rainfall is 46⅜ inches. Malarial fever is comparatively uncommon,
                    but epidemics of cholera occur frequently.</p>
                <p>Monghyr was one of the principal centres of the Mohammedan administration in
                    Bengal. In the early years of British rule, Monghyr formed a part of Bhâgalpur,
                    and was not created a separate district till 1832.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Monghyr,</hi> chief town and administrative headquarters of
                    the above district, is situated on the south bank of the Ganges (25° 22' N.
                    lat., 86° 30' E. long.). The population in 1872 was 59,698: viz., Hindus,
                    44,900; Mohammedans, 14,346; Buddhists, 33; Christians, 305; “others,” 24.</p>
                <p>In 1195 Monghyr, a fortress of great natural strength, appears to have been taken
                    by Muhammad Bakhtyar Khilji, the first Moslem conqueror of Bengal. Henceforth it
                    is often mentioned by the Mohammedan chroniclers as a place of military
                    importance, and was frequently chosen as the seat of the local government. After
                    1590, when Akbar established his supremacy over the Afghan chiefs of Bengal,
                    Monghyr was long the headquarters of his general, Todar Mall; and it also
                    figures prominently during the rebellion of Sultan Shuja against his brother,
                    Aurangzeb. In more recent times Nawâb Mir Kasim, in his war with the English,
                    selected it as his residence and the centre of his military preparations. The
                    fame of Monghyr armourers is said to date from the arsenal which he established.
                    The town is now purely a civil station-and in some respects one of the most
                    picturesque in Bengal.</p>
