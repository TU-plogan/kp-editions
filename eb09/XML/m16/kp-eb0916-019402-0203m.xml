                    identity by showing that both, when treated with chlorine, yield the same
                    identical chloride of ethyl, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. Cl. This confirmed the now generally adopted notion
                    that the radical ethyl itself is nothing but methylo-methyl, H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> C—CH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> *, so that the
                    filling up of the gap* by an H must necessarily produce “hydride of ethyl” and
                    “dimethyl” in one. The “true methyl” which chemists used to dream of, and which,
                    when treated with chlorine, would yield two CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> CΓs
                    analogous to HH + C1C1 = HC1 + HC1, does not, and according to our present
                    knowledge cannot, exist. A quasi apology for it is “marsh gas,” CH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, the principal component of the gas mixture which
                    bubbles up from any marshy pond when its mud is stirred up with a stick. It is
                    always produced when vegetable matter decays in the presence of water, and in
                    the relative or absolute absence of air. What everybody knows as “fire-damp” is
                    nothing but a (necessarily explosive) mixture of air with impure marsh gas,
                    produced in the constantly progressing metamorphosis of the coal deposits; in
                    certain districts streams of marsh gas are issuing forth from cracks in the
                    earth; the “holy fire” of Baku is such a marsh-gas spring, which, having once
                    caught fire by accident, continues burning to this day. Perfectly pure marsh gas
                    can only be obtained from zincmethyl, Zn(CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, by its decomposition with water <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Marsh gas can be prepared synthetically by the action of bisulphide of carbon

                    A mixture of marsh gas and chlorine, when exposed to direct sunlight, explodes
                    with formation of hydrochloric acid and charcoal. In diffuse daylight only part
                    of the hydrogen is eliminated and “replaced” by its equivalent in chlorine,
                    which in general leads to the formation of four bodies: CH <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> C1 = CH. + Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>- HC1, chloride of methyl; CH

                    chloromethanes, as they are called, the first here interests us more than any of
                    the rest, because from it any other methyl compound can be produced by the
                    substitution of the proper kind of radical for the Cl of the CH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> C1. Thus, for instance, we can convert it into

                    (Berthelot). This is a most important synthesis, because it is this
                    methylalcohol that, in practice, always serves as the starting point in the
                    preparation of other methyl compounds.</p>

                    from wood-spirit, a commercial substance which is produced industrially in the
                    dry distillation of wood. The woodspirit is contained in the aqueous portion of
                    the tar produced in this operation, along with acetic acid. To recover both, the
                    tar-water is neutralized with lime and distilled, when the acetate remains,
                    while the spirit distils over, along with a deal of water, which, however, is
                    easily removed, as far as necessary, by redistillation and rejection of the less
                    volatile parts. The “crude” wood-spirit, as thus obtained, is not unlike in its
                    general properties to ordinary spirit of wine, from which, however, it is easily
                    distinguished by its abominable smell. The ordinary commercial article, besides
                    a variable percentage of water, contains from 35 to 80 per cent, of
                    methyl-alcohol; the rest consists chiefly of acetone, but besides includes
                    dimethyl-acetal, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>
                    (OCH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, acetate of
                    methyl, and numerous other minor components. In Great Britain large quantities
                    of wood-spirit are used for the making of methylated spirit, a mixture of
                    ordinary spirit of wine with one-ninth of its volume of wood-spirit, which is
                    allowed to be sold duty free for the preparation of varnishes, and for other
                    industrial purposes. In former times, here as elsewhere, wood-spirit itself used
                    to be employed as a cheap substitute for spiritus vini; but this is no longer
                    so, since the aniline-colour industry has created a large demand for pure
                    methyl-alcohol. Hence in some Continental works the wood-spirit, instead of
                    being sent out as such, is being worked up for its components, by the following
                    sequence of operations:—(1) dehydration by lime; (2) heating, under an inverted
                    condenser, with caustic soda, to convert the acetate into hydrate of methyl; (3)
                    destruction of the bad smells by mild oxidation; (4) distillation in a kind of
                    Coffey’s still, whereby it is split up into approximately pure alcohol, acetone,
                    and “tails.”</p>
                <p>The new industry led to the invention of the following technical methods for the
                    determination, in a given spirit, of the percentages of real methyl-alcohol and
                    of acetone.</p>
                <p>The alcohol is determined by saturating 5 c.c. of the spirit with hydriodic acid
                    (volatilization of alcohol and iodide of methyl being avoided by means of a
                    cold-water bath and an inverted condenser), and the product poured into water.
                    Iodide of methyl separates out as a heavy oil, which is measured as it is.
                    According to direct trials 5 c.c. of pure methyl-alcohol yields 7’45 c.c. of
                    crude iodide (Krell, Krämer and Grodzky).</p>
                <p>For the determination of the acetone the following reagents are required (Krämer)
                    (1) a solution of iodine, prepared by dissolving I <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    = 254 grammes of iodine, by means of (say) 500 grammes of iodide of potassium,
                    in water, and diluting to 1 litre; (2) a solution of caustic soda containing
                    twice (NaOH) grammes per litre; (3) alcohol-free ether. Ten c.c. of the soda are
                    placed in a graduated cylinder and mixed intimately, first with 1 c.c. of the
                    spirit, then with 5 c.c. of the iodine solution. Iodoform separates out (if
                    acetone is present) in minute yellow crystal plates; this product is “shaken
                    aut” by means of 10 c.c. of ether, and determined by evaporating an aliquot part
                    of the ethereal layer in a fared watch-glass to dryness and weighing the
                    residue. C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> ft</hi> O yields
                    CHI <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>; hence 1 part of iodoform indicates 0 ‘28 parts
                    of acetone.</p>
                <p>The formula of methyl-alcohol and its true chemical character were correctly
                    ascertained by Dumas and Péligot as early as 1834; yet pure methyl-alcohol may
                    be said to have been an unknown substance until 1852, when Wöhler taught us to
                    prepare it, by first extracting the CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> of the CH
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> OH in the wood-spirit as oxalate of methyl, and
                    then decomposing the (purified) oxalate with water.</p>
                <p>The most convenient raw material to use nowadays is the commercial “pure”
                    alcohol; if wood-spirit is employed it had better first be purified by
                    distillation over caustic soda <hi rend="italic">{vide supra).</hi> The
                    formation of the oxalate then is best effected (according to Alexander Watt) as
                    follows: —500 grammes of oxalic acid crystals are mixed with 200 c.c. of oil of
                    vitriol; then 500 c.c. of the spirit are added, the whole kept for a time at 80°
                    C., and then allowed to stand cold for twenty-four hours.</p>
                <p>The large crop of oxalate crystals—partly (CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">

                    2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> —is separated from the liquor by pressure
                    and subsequent drying over vitriol, and then decomposed by distillation with
                    water.</p>
                <p>The aqueous alcohol thus obtained is dehydrated by the well-known methods used in
                    the preparation of ordinary absolute alcohol.</p>
                <p>According to Krämer, a purer preparation than Wohler’s is obtained by extracting
                    the methyl as formiate instead of as oxalate, which is easily effected by
                    digesting the wood-spirit with a formic acid ofl∙22 specific gravity, and
                    purifying the formic ether by fractional distillation. This ether boils at 32°,
                    the oxalate at 16Γ C., hence a proper combination of the two methods should be
                    infinitely superior to either. What now follows must, in general, be understood
                    to refer to Wöhler’s preparation.</p>
                <p>Pure methyl-alcohol is a colourless liquid similar in its general properties, in
                    its behaviour to other chemically inert liquids, and in its action as a solvent
                    to ordinarj absolute alcohol, from which, however, it differs by the entire
                    absence from it of all spirituous odour. A preparation which smells of
                    wood-spirit may be condemned at once as impure. According to H. Kopp, its
                    specific gravity is 0∙8142 at 0° C. and 0'7997 at 16° '4. If the volume at <hi
                    rend="italic">t°</hi> be V, then (from 0° to 6Γ)</p>
                <p>V = l+ O001134ι! + l∙364 ×10- <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> Z <hi

                <p>The boiling point is 64°‘6 to 65°'2. The tension-curve was determined by Régnault
                    and by Landolt; but the results of the two observers do not agree except
                    (approximately) at P = 760 mm. Methyl-alcohol has quite a characteristic
                    tendency to “bump” badly on distillation, which, however, can be prevented by
                    addition of a small fragment of tinsodium, which produces a feeble but
                    sufficient current of hydrogen. Its specific heat is *6713; latent heat of
                    vapour, 26'4; combustion heat, 5307 per unit weight (Favre and Silbermann). The
                    refractive index for the D (sodium) ray is 1'3379 = <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>Methyl-alcohol mixes with water in all proportions with contraction.</p>
                <p>Since Wöhler’s discovery a table for the specific gravities of aqueous
                    methyl-alcohols has been constructed experimentally by A. Dupre; but
                    unfortunately his alcohol boiled at 58° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7, and
                    consequently must have been something different from what generally goes by this
                    name.</p>
                <p>In its chemical reactions methyl-alcohol, CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.OH, is
                    very similar to ordinary (ethyl) alcohol, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. OH, and consequently, in the same sense as the latter,
                    analogous to water, H. OH. Thus, for instance, metallic sodium and potassium
                    dissolve in either alcohol with evolution of hydrogen and formation of ethylates
                    or methylates of the alkali metals. Example—</p>
                <p>CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> OH + Na = CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.0Na +
                    ⅜H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>The two methylates crystallize from the solution with crystal-alcohol, which can
                    be driven off in an atmosphere of hydrogen by heat, without decomposition of the
                    salts themselves. Water at once decomposes them into caustic alkali and alcohol,
                    CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. ONa + H. OH = NaOH + CH <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> OH. Yet the reverse reaction takes place when the alcohol is treated with
                    a large excess of caustic soda.</p>
                <p>The action of acids on methyl-alcohol is in general quite analogous to that on,
                    for instance, caustic soda, with this important difference, however, that what

                <p>It would, however, be a great mistake to suppose that whether, for instance (Ex.
                    3 and 4), the monomethyl or the dimethyl compound is formed depends on the
                    quantity of methyl-alcohol employed per unit of acid. This depends far more
                    largely on other conditions, as will be illustrated in next paragraph. The
                    methyl-salts of oxygen acids are called esters, in opposition to the chloride,
                    bromide, iodide, sulphide, and oxide, which are set apart as ethers. Broadly
                    speaking, ethers are not, while esters are, readily decomposed by water into
                    their cogeners; but the nitrate CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. NO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> behaves in this respect like an ether.</p>

                    conversion of the two ingredients into methylsulphuric acid. Equal volumes of
                    acid and alcohol give a good yield. To prepare pure methyl sulphates, dilute the
                    mixture largely with water, avoiding elevation of temperature (which would
                    regenerate the ingredients), and saturate with carbonate of baryta. Filter off
                    the sulphate of baryta to obtain a solution of the pure methyl sulphate SO <hi

                    double decomposition with a solution of the respective sulphate; the acid
                    itself, for instance, by means of sulphuric acid. At higher temperatures the
                    reaction between vitriol and methyl-alcohol results in the formation of
                    methyl-ether, (CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O,

                <p>The gas dissolves in about one thirty-seventh of its volume of water; far more
                    largely in alcohol and in ether; most abundantly in oil of vitriol, which
                    dissolves about six hundred times its volume of methyl-ether gas, thus affording
                    a very handy means for storing up the gas for use. The solution needs only be
                    diluted with its own volume of water to be broken up into its components
                    (Erlenmeyer).</p>
                <p>Liquefied oxide of methyl is now being produced on the manufacturing scale, and
                    sold as a powerful refrigerating agent. One part of sulphuric acid is mixed with
                    a little over one part of dehydrated wood-spirit, and the mixture heated to 125°
                    to 128° C. (130° being carefully avoided), when methyl-ether goes off. When the
                    mixture is exhausted, more wood-spirit is added to the residue so as to
                    re-establish the original specific gravity (of 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    29), and the heating resumed, which again furnishes a supply of the gas, and so
                    on. This proves that the process is not, as used to be supposed, one of mere
                    dehydration, but a cycle of reactions analogous to those in the ordinary process
                    of etherification, as shown by the equations :—</p>

                    The analogy extends to the action on iodide of methyl, which, in the case of

                    museum, is now being manufactured on a large scale, and promises to play an
                    important part in industrial chemistry. The waste liquors obtained in the
                    distillation of alcohol from fermented beetroot molasses serve as a raw material
                    for its preparation. These liquors, when evaporated to dryness and subjected to
                    dry distillation, yield, besides tar and gases, an aqueous liquid containing
                    large quantities of ammonia, acetonitrile, methyl-alcohol, and trimethylamine.
                    This liquor is neutralized with sulphuric acid, and distilled, when the nitrile
                    and the methyl-alcohol distil over, to be recovered by proper methods. From the

                    commercial trimethylamine hydrochlorate. It is this product which serves for the

                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> I; 2NCAg) and ether in a sealed-up tube to 130° to
                    140°, to produce the crystalline body AgNC + NCCH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    (and Agi). The double cyanide, when distilled with some water and cyanide of
                    potassium, breaks up into its components,—the NC’Ag forming (NC) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> AgK; and the cyanide of methyl distils over. It is a
                    colourless liquid, characterized by quite an unbearably irritating and sickening
                    smell. The specific gravity is '756 at 14°, the boiling point 59° C. It combines
                    with hydrochloric acid into a crystalline salt which is readily decomposed by
                    water into methylamine and formic acid. Whence we conclude that in this case the
                    cyanogen is tied to the methyl by its nitrogen; thus :—</p>
                <p>C {N—CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>} + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = H.
                    C00H + NH <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi>. CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.</p>
                <p>Formic acid. Methylamine.</p>
                <p>The methyl here remains methyl, being separated by an N from the cyanogen-carbon,
                    which latter passes into formic acid.</p>
                <p>We must not close this section without at least referring to the <hi

                    series are of pretty much the same sense as those between the two prototypes.
                    Thus, for instance, while trimethylamine N(CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> is a strong base, but inert to oxygen gas,
                    trimethylphosphine is a relatively feeble base, but in contact with air greedily

                    in the history of organic chemistry, and our article would not be complete
                    without at least a short summary of its results. Bunsen started in his
                    investigation with a liquid which had been obtained by Cadet as early as 1760,
                    by the dry distillation of equal parts of white arsenic and anhydrous acetate of
                    potash, and which nobody cared to investigate because it emits fumes which have
                    an indescribably sickening smell and an intensity of poisonous action, compared
                    with which that of white arsenic itself appears insignificant. It was reserved
                    for Bunsen to attack this awful substance and force it to give an account of
                    itself. According to Bunsen, Cadet’s liquid is substantially an oxide, <hi

                    the liquor is distilled with corrosive sublimate and hydrochloric acid, which in
                    the first instance yields the pure muriate of the base <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    From this chloride of kakodyle the pure oxide is obtained by distillation with
                    caustic potash. The pure oxide emits no fumes; its specific gravity is 1*462; it
                    boils near 150°. A mixture of its vapour with air detonates at 50° C. From the
                    chloride again, Bunsen obtained the free radical <hi rend="italic"

                    special apparatus, so constructed that all the several operations involved could
                    be carried out without bringing the contents in contact with air,— a necessary
                    precaution, because kakodyle is a liquid which takes fire in air spontaneously
                    even at ordinary temperatures. Pure kakodyle is a heavy colourless liquid
                    boiling at about 170° C., and freezing at - 6°. When exposed to oxygen or
                    chlorine it suffers destructive combustion; but on slow access of air it is
                    oxidized into its oxide, (AsC <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, and kakodylic acid;
                    with chlorine water it unites into the chloride λvhich it came from; it also
                    unites directly with sulphur and other elements; in short, it is exactly to
                    kakodyle compounds what potassium is to potash and potash salts, “a true organic
                    element,” as Bunsen himself put it. This discovery of Bunsen’s was greeted with
                    an enthusiasm which it is difficult in these days to realize. With us now, a
                    radical is intrinsically a fiction; it was different in 1842. By the isolation
                    of kakodyle the “radical” notion suddenly rose from an unproved hypothesis to
                    the rank of a theory based on experiment. Still, however much our theoretical
                    notions may shift, Bunsen’s research will stand as a piece of monumental
                    scientific work.</p>

                    the chief points of its chemical history. This body was discovered by Frankland
                    in 1849. It is prepared by boiling iodide of methyl over granulated zinc in a
                    flask connected with an inverted condenser, and so contrived otherwise that the
                    contents are protected against access of moisture and oxygen. Under these
                    circumstances the two ingredients gradually unite into a non-volatile and solid
                    compound IZn . (CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>). When this body is heated with
                    more of iodide of methyl, it undergoes decomposition, with formation of iodide
                    of zinc and of dimethyl gas, I—Zn—CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + CH <hi

                    extent takes place unavoidably in the preparation of the zinc salt, however
                    great an excess of metal may be taken. What survives needs only to be subjected
                    to dry distillation (in the absence of air) to yield a distillate of zinc-methyl
