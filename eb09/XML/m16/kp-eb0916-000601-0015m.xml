                    (1809-1847). Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, one of the greatest
                    composers of this century, was the grandson of Moses Mendelssohn noticed below,
                    and was born in Hamburg on February 3, 1809.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the troubles caused by the French occupation of Hamburg,
                    Abraham Mendelssohn, his father, migrated in 1811 to Berlin, where his
                    grandmother, Fromet, then in the twenty-fifth year of her widowhood, received
                    the whole family into her house, No. 7 Neue Promenade. Here the little Felix and
                    his sister Fanny received their first instruction in music from their mother,
                    under whose care they progressed so rapidly that the altogether exceptional
                    character of their talent soon became unmistakably apparent. Their next teacher
                    was Madame Bigot, who, during the temporary residence of the family in Paris in
                    1816, gave them some valuable instruction. On their return to Berlin they took
                    lessons in thoroughbass and composition from Zelter, in pianoforteplaying from
                    Ludwig Berger, and in violin-playing from Henning,—the care of their general
                    education being entrusted to the father of the novelist Paul Heyse.</p>
                <p>Felix first played in public on the 24th of October 1818, taking the pianoforte
                    part in a trio by Woelfl. On April 11, 1819, he entered the Berlin Singakademie
                    as an alto, and in the following year began to compose with extraordinary
                    rapidity. His earliest dated work is a cantata, <hi rend="italic">In</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rührend feierlichen Tönen,</hi> completed on January 13, 1820.
                    During, that year alone he produced nearly sixty movements, including songs,
                    pianoforte sonatas, a trio for pianoforte, violin, and violoncello, a sonata for
                    violin and pianoforte, pieces for the organ, and even a little dramatic piece in
                    three scenes. In 1821 he wrote five symphonies for stringed instruments, each in
                    three movements; motetts for four voices; an opera, in one act, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Soldatenliebschaft</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> another, called
                    <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">beiden Pädagogen</hi>; part of a
                    third, called <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">wandernde
                    Comödianten</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and an immense quantity of other music
                    of different kinds, some of which, thought worthy of publication by the editors
                    of his posthumous works, now stands before the world in evidence of the
                    precocity of his genius. The original autograph copies of these early
                    productions are now preserved in the Berlin Library, where they form part of a
                    collection which fills forty-four large volumes, all written with infinite
                    neatness, and for the most part carefully dated—a sufficient proof that the
                    methodical habits which distinguished his later life were formed in early
                    childhood.</p>
                <p>In 1821 Mendelssohn paid his first visit to Goethe, with whom he spent sixteen
                    days at Weimar, in company with Zelter. From this year also dates his first
                    acquaintance with Weber, who was then in Berlin superintending the production of
                    <hi rend="italic">Der Freischütz’,</hi> and from the summer of 1822 his
                    introduction, at Cassel, to another of the greatest of his contemporaries,
                    Ludwig Spohr. During this year his pen was even more prolific than before,
                    producing, among other works, an opera, in three acts, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">beiden Neffen, oder Der Onkel aus
                    Boston,</hi> and a pianoforte concerto, which he played in public at a concert
                    given by Frau Anna Milder.</p>
                <p>It had long been a custom with the Mendelssohn family to give musical
                    performances on alternate Sunday mornings in their dining-room, with a small
                    orchestra, which Felix always conducted, even when he was not tall enough to be
                    seen without standing upon a stool. For each of these occasions he produced some
                    new work,—playing the pianoforte pieces himself, or entrusting them to Fanny,
                    while his sister Rebecka sang, and his brother Paul played the violoncello. In
                    this way <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">beiden Neffen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">κ⅛s,</hi> first privately
                    performed, on the fifteenth anniversary of his birthday, February 3, 1824.
                    Between the 3d and the 31st of March, in this year, he composed his fine
                    symphony in C minor, now known as Op. 10, and soon afterwards the quartett in B
                    minor, Op. 3, and the (posthumous) pianoforte sestett, Op. 110. In this year
                    also began his lifelong friendship with Moscheles, who, when asked to receive
                    him as a pupil, said, “If he wishes to take a hint from me, as to anything new
                    to him, he can easily do so; but he stands in no need of lessons.”</p>
                <p>In 1825 Abraham Mendelssohn took Felix to Paris, where among other musicians then
                    resident in the French capital he met the two most popular dramatic composers of
                    the age, Rossini and Meyerbeer, and lived on terms of intimacy with Hummel,
                    Kalkbrenner, Rode, Baillot, Herz, and many other artists of European celebrity.
                    On this occasion, also, he made his first acquaintance with Cherubini, who,
                    though he rarely praised any one, expressed a very high opinion of his talent,
                    and recommended him to write a <hi rend="italic">Kyrie,</hi> for five voices,
                    with full orchestral accompaniments, which he himself described as “exceeding
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n16/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0016-0007"/> in thickness” anything he had attempted. From
                    letters written at this period we learn that Felix’s estimate of the French
                    school of music was very far from a flattering one; but he formed some
                    friendships in Paris, which were pleasantly renewed on later occasions. He
                    returned to Berlin with his father in May 1825, taking leave of his Parisian
                    friends on the 19 th of the month, and interrupting his journey at Weimar for
                    the purpose of paying a second visit to Goethe, to whom he dedicated his .
                    quartett in B minor. On reaching home he must have fallen to work with greater
                    zeal than ever; for on the 23d of July in this same year he completed his
                    pianoforte Capriccio in F sharp minor (Op. 5), and on the 10th of August an
                    opera, in two acts, called <hi rend="italic">Die,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hochzeit</hi><hi rend="italic">des Camacho,</hi> a work of considerable
                    importance, concerning which we shall presently have to speak more
                    particularly.</p>
                <p>No ordinary boy could have escaped uninjured from the snares attendant upon such
                    a life as that which Mendelssohn now lived. Notwithstanding his overwhelming
                    passion for music, his general education had been so well cared for that he was
                    able to hold his own, in the society of his seniors, with the easy grace of an
                    accomplished man of the world. He was already recognized as a leading spirit by
                    the artists with whom he associated, and these artists were men of acknowledged
                    talent and position. The temptations to egoism by which he was surrounded would
                    have rendered most clever students intolerable. But the natural amiability of
                    his disposition, and the healthy influence of his happy home-life, counteracted
                    all tendencies towards inordinate self-assertion; and he is described by all who
                    knew him at this period as the most charming boy imaginable. Even Zelter, though
                    by nature no less repressive than Cherubini, was not ashamed to show that he was
                    proud of him; and Moscheles, whose name was already famous, met him from the
                    first on equal terms.</p>
                <p>Soon after his return from Paris, Abraham Mendelssohn removed from his mother’s
                    residence to No. 3 Leipziger Strasse, a roomy, old-fashioned house, containing
                    an excellent music-room, and in the grounds adjoining a “Gartenhaus” capable of
                    accommodating several hundred persons at the Sunday performances.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>After Mendelssohn’s death
                    this house was sold to the Prussian &lt;Jovernment; and the “Herrenhaus” now
                    stands on the site of the garden-house.</p></note> In the autumn of the
                    following year this “garden-house” witnessed a memorable private performance of
                    the work by means of which the greatness of Mendelssohn’s genius was first
                    revealed to the outer world—the overture to Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >'Midsummer Night's Dream.</hi> The finished score of this famous composition is
                    dated “Berlin, August 6, 1826,”— that is to say, three days after its author had
                    attained the age of seventeen years and a half. Yet we may safely assert that in
                    no later work does he exhibit more originality of thought, more freshness of
                    conception, or more perfect mastery over the details of technical construction,
                    than in this delightful inspiration, which, though now nearly sixty years old,
                    still holds its place at the head of the most brilliant achievements of our
                    modern schools. The overture was first publicly performed at Stettin, in
                    February 1827, under the direction of the young composer, who with this bright
                    patent of artistic nobility to support his claim, was at once accepted as the
                    leader of a new and highly characteristic manifestation of the spirit of modern
                    progress. Henceforth therefore we must speak of him, not as a student, but as a
                    mature and experienced artist.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile <hi rend="italic">Camacho's Wedding</hi> had been submitted to Herr
                    General-Musik-Director Spontini, with a view to its production at the opera. The
                    libretto, founded upon an episode in the history of Don Quixote, was written by
                    Klingemann, and Mendelssohn threw himself into the spirit of the romance with a
                    keen perception of its peculiar humour. The work was put into rehearsal soon
                    after the composer’s return from Stettin, produced on April 29, 1827, and
                    received with great apparent enthusiasm; but, for some reason which it is now
                    impossible to ascertain, a cabal was formed against it, and it never reached a
                    second performance. The critics abused it mercilessly; yet it exhibits merits of
                    a very high order. The solemn passage for the trombones, which heralds the first
                    appearance of the knight of La Mancha, is conceived in a spirit of reverent
                    appreciation of the idea of Cervantes, which would have done honour to a
                    composer of lifelong experience. Even the critics suborned to condemn the work
                    could not refrain from expressing their admiration of this; but it had been
                    decreed that the opera should not live—and it did not.</p>
                <p>Mendelssohn was excessively annoyed at this injustice, and some time elapsed
                    before his mind recovered its usual bright tone; but he continued to work
                    diligently for the cause of art. Among other serious undertakings, he formed a
                    choir for the study of the great choral works of Sebastian Bach, then entirely
                    unknown to the public; and, in spite of Zelter’s determined opposition, he
                    succeeded, in 1829, in inducing the Berlin Singakademie to give a public
                    performance of the <hi rend="italic">Passion according to St Matthew,</hi> under
                    his direction, with a chorus of between three and four hundred voices. The
                    scheme succeeded beyond his warmest hopes, and proved the means of restoring to
                    the world great compositions with which we are all now familiar, but which, at
                    that time, had never been heard since the death of Bach. But the obstructive
                    party were grievously offended; and at this period Mendelssohn was far from
                    popular among the musicians of Berlin.</p>
                <p>In April 1829 Mendelssohn paid his first visit to London. His reception was most
                    enthusiastic. He made his first appearance before an English audience at one of
                    the Philharmonic Society’s concerts—then held in the Argyll Rooms—on the 25th of
                    May, conducting his symphony in C minor from the pianoforte, to which he was led
                    by John Cramer. On the 30th he played Weber’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Concertstück,</hi> from memory, a proceeding at that time extremely unusual. At
                    a concert given by Drouet, on the 24th of June, he played Beethoven’s pianoforte
                    concerto in E flat, which had never before been heard in the country; and the
                    overture to <hi rend="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> was also, for the
                    first time, presented to a London audience. On returning home from the concert,
                    Mr Attwood, then organist of St Paul’s Cathedral, left the score of the overture
                    in a hackney coach, whereupon Mendelssohn wrote out another, from memory,
                    without an error. At another concert he played, with Moscheles, his still
                    unpublished concerto in E, for two pianofortes and orchestra. After the close of
                    the London season he started with Klingemann on a tour through Scotland, where
                    he was inspired with the first idea of his overture to <hi rend="italic">The
                    Isles of Fingal,</hi> returning to Berlin at the end of November. Except for an
                    accident to his knee, which lamed him for some considerable time, his visit was
                    a highly successful one, and laid the foundation of many firm friendships and
                    many prosperous negotiations in the time to come.</p>
                <p>The visit to England formed in reality the first division only of a great scheme
                    of travel which his father wished him to extend to all the most important art
                    centres in Europe. After refusing the offer of a professorship at Berlin, he
                    started again, in May 1830, for Italy, pausing on his way at Weimar, where he
                    spent a memorable fortnight with Goethe, and reaching Rome, after many pleasant
                    interruptions, on November 1. No possible form of excitement ever prevented him
                    from devoting a certain time every day to composition; but he lost no
                    opportunity <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n17/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0017-0008"/> of studying either the countless treasures which
                    form the chief glory of the great city or the manners and customs of modern
                    Romans. He attended, with insatiable curiosity, the services in the Sistine
                    Chapel; and his keen power of observation enabled him to throw much interesting
                    light upon them. His letters on this subject, however, lose much of their value
                    through his incapacity to comprehend the close relation existing between the
                    music of Palestrina and his contemporaries and the ritual of the Roman Church.
                    His Lutheran education kept him in ignorance even of the first principles of
                    ordinary chanting; and it is amusing to find him describing as enormities
                    peculiar to the papal choir customs familiar to every village singer in England,
                    and as closely connected with the structure of the “Anglican chant” as with that
                    of “Gregorian music.” Still, though he could not agree, in all points, with
                    Baini, the greatest ecclesiastical musician then living, he fully shared his
                    admiration for the <hi rend="italic">Improperia,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Miserere,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">cantus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >planus</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Lamentationes</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Exultet,</hi> the musical beauty of which he could understand,
                    apart from their ritual significance.</p>
                <p>In passing through Munich on his return in October 1831, ne composed and played
                    his pianoforte concerto in G minor, and accepted a commission (never fulfilled)
                    to compose an opera for the Munich theatre. Pausing for a time at Stuttgart,
                    Frankfort, and Düsseldorf, he arrived in Paris in December, and passed four
                    pleasant months in the renewal of acquaintances formed in 1825, and in close
                    intercourse with Liszt and Chopin. On February 19, 1832, the overture to <hi
                    rend="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> was played at the conservatoire,
                    and many of his other compositions were brought before the public; but he did
                    not altogether escape disappointments with regard to some of them, especially
                    the Reformation symphony, and the visit was brought to a premature close in
                    March by an attack of cholera, from <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> which,
                    however, he rapidly recovered.</p>
                <p>On the 23d of April 1832 he was again in London, where he twice played his G
                    minor concerto at the Philharmonic concerts, gave a performance on the organ at
                    St Paul’s, and published his first book of <hi rend="italic">Lieder ohne
                    Worte.</hi> He returned to Berlin in July, and during the winter he gave public
                    performances of his Reformation symphony, his concerto in G minor, and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Walpurgisnacht.</hi> In the following spring he paid a third visit
                    to London for the purpose of conducting his Italian symphony, which was played
                    for the first time, by the Philharmonic Society, on the 13th of May 1833. On the
                    26th of the same month he conducted the performances at the Lower Rhine festival
                    at Düsseldorf, with such brilliant effect that he was at once invited to accept
                    the appointment of general-music-director to the town, an office which included
                    the management of the music in the principal churches, at the theatre, and at
                    the rooms of two musical associations. This post he willingly accepted, and it
                    formed a stepping-stone to a far more important one.</p>
                <p>Before entering upon his new duties, Mendelssohn paid a fourth visit to London,
                    with his father, returning to Düsseldorf on the 27th of September 1833. His
                    influence produced an excellent effect upon the church music and in the
                    concert-room; but his relations with the management of the theatre were not
                    altogether pleasant; and it was probably this circumstance which first led him
                    to forsake the cultivation of the opera for that of sacred music. At Düsseldorf
                    he first designed his famous oratorio <hi rend="italic">St Paul,</hi> in
                    response to an application from the Cäcilien-Verein at Frankfort, composed his
                    overture to <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">schöne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Melusine,</hi> and planned some other works of importance. He
                    liked his appointment, and would probably have retained it much longer had he
                    not been invited to undertake the permanent direction of the Gewandhaus concerts
                    at Leipsic, and thus raised to the highest position attainable in the German
                    musical world. To this new sphere of labour he removed in August 1835, opening
                    the first concert at the Gewandhaus, on the 4th of October, with his overture
                    <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Meeresstille,</hi> a work possessing
                    great attractions, though by no means on a level with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Midsummer Night's Dream, The Isles of Fingal,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Melusine.</hi></p>
                <p>Mendelssohn’s reception in Leipsic was most enthusiastic; and under their new
                    director the Gewandhaus concerts prospered exceedingly. Meanwhile <hi
                    rend="italic">St Paul</hi> steadily progressed, and was first produced, with
                    triumphant success, at the Lower Rhine festival at Düsseldorf, on May 22, 1836.
                    On October 3 it was first sung in English, at Liverpool, under the direction of
                    Sir George Smart; and on March 16, 1837, Mendelssohn again directed it at
                    Leipsic.</p>
                <p>The next great event in Mendelssohn’s life was his happy marriage, on March 28,
                    1837, to Cecile Charlotte Sophie Jeanrenaud, whose amiable disposition,
                    surpassing beauty, and indescribable charm of manner endeared her to all who
                    knew her. The honeymoon was scarcely over before he was again summoned to
                    England to conduct <hi rend="italic">St Paul,</hi> at the Birmingham festival,
                    on September 20th. During this visit he played on the organ at St Paul’s and at
                    Christ Church, Newgate Street, with an effect which exercised a lasting
                    influence upon English organists. It was here also that he first contemplated
                    the production of his second oratorio, <hi rend="italic">Elijah.</hi></p>
                <p>Passing over the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Lobgesang</hi> in 1840, a
                    sixth visit to England in the same year, the scheme for the erection of a
                    monument to Sebastian Bach, and other events on which space does not permit us
                    to enlarge, we find Mendelssohn in 1841 recalled to Berlin by the king of
                    Prussia, with the title of Kapellmeister. Though this appointment resulted in
                    the production of <hi rend="italic">Antigone,</hi><hi rend="italic">Oe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dipus</hi><hi rend="italic">Coloneus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Athalie,</hi> the incidental music to the <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Night's
                    Dream,</hi> and other great works, it proved an endless source of vexation, and
                    certainly helped to shorten the composer’s life. In 1842 he came to England for
                    the seventh time, accompanied by his wife, conducted his Scotch symphony at the
                    Philharmonic, again played the organ at St Peter’s, Cornhill, and Christ Church,
                    Newgate Street, and was received with all possible honour by the queen and the
                    prince consort. He did not, however, permit his new engagements to interfere
                    with the direction of the Gewandhaus concerts; and in 1843 he founded in Leipsic
                    the great conservatoire which soon became the best musical college in Europe,
                    opening it on April 3, in the buildings of the Gewandhaus. In 1844 he conducted
                    six of the Philharmonic concerts in London, producing his new <hi rend="italic"
                    >Midsummer Night's Dream</hi> music, and playing Beethoven’s pianoforte concerto
                    in G with extraordinary effect. He returned to his duties at Berlin in
                    September, but happily succeeded in persuading the king to free him from his
                    most onerous engagements, and his delight at this relief was unbounded.</p>
                <p>After a brief residence in Frankfort, Mendelssohn returned to Leipsic in
                    September 1845, resuming his old duties at the Gewandhaus, and teaching
                    regularly in the conservatoire. Here he remained, with little interruption,
                    during the winter,—introducing his friend Jenny Lind, then at the height of her
                    popularity, to the critical frequenters of the Gewandhaus, and steadily working
                    at <hi rend="italic">Elijah,</hi> the first performance of which he conducted at
                    the Birmingham festival, on August 26, 1846. The enthusiastic reception of this
                    great work is well known. Unhappily, the excitement attendant upon its
                    production, added to the irritating effect of the worries at Berlin, made a
                    serious inroad upon the composer’s health. On his return to Leipsic he worked on
                    as usual, but it was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n18/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0018-0009"/> clear that his health was seriously impaired. In
                    1847 he visited England for the tenth and last time, to conduct four
                    performances of <hi rend="italic">Elijah</hi> at Exeter Hall, on the 16th, 2 3d,
                    28th, and 30th of April, one at Manchester on the 20th, and one at Birmingham on
                    the 27th. Again the queen and prince consort received him with marked respect,—
                    one might almost venture to say, affection,—and all seemed prosperous and happy.
                    But the necessary exertion was far beyond his strength. He witnessed Jenny
                    Lind’s first appearance at Her Majesty’s Theatre, on the 4th of May, and left
                    England on the 9 th, little anticipating the trial that awaited him in the
                    tidings of the sudden death of his sister Fanny, which reached him only a few
                    days after his arrival in Frankfort. The loss of his mother in 1842 had shaken
                    him much, but the suddenness with which this last sad intelligence was
                    communicated broke him down completely. He fell to the ground insensible, and
                    never fully recovered. In June he was so far himself again that he was able to
                    travel, with his family, by short stages, to Interlaken, where he stayed for
                    some time, illustrating the journey by a series of water-colour drawings, but
                    making no attempt at composition for many weeks. He returned to Leipsic in
                    September, bringing with him fragments of <hi rend="italic">Christies,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Loreley,</hi> and some other unfinished works, taking no part in
                    the concerts, and living in the strictest privacy. On the 9th of October he
                    called on Madame Frege, and asked her to sing his latest set of songs. She left
                    the room for lights, and on her return found him in violent pain, and almost
                    insensible. It was the beginning of the end. He lingered on, now better now
                    worse, through four weary weeks, and on the 4th of November he passed away, in
                    the presence of his wife, his brother, and his three dear friends, Moscheies,
                    Schleinitz, and Ferdinand David. A cross now marks the site of his grave, in the
                    Alte Dreifaltigkeits Kirchhof, at Berlin.</p>
                <p>Mendelssohn’s title to a place among the greatest composers of the century is
                    incontestable. His style, though differing but little in technical arrangement
                    from that of his classical predecessors, is characterized by a vein of melody
                    peculiarly his own, and easily distinguishable by those who have studied his
                    works, not only from the genuine effusions of contemporary writers, but from the
                    most successful of the servile imitations with which, even during his lifetime,
                    the music-shops were deluged. In less judicious hands the rigid symmetry of his
                    phrasing might, perhaps, have palled upon the ear; but under his skilful
                    management it serves only to impart an additional charm to thoughts which derive
                    their chief beauty from the evident spontaneity of their conception. In this, as
                    in all other matters of a purely technical character, he regarded the accepted
                    laws of art as the medium by which he might most certainly attain the ends
                    dictated by the inspiration of his genius. Though caring nothing for rules,
                    except as means for producing a good effect, he scarcely ever violated them, and
                    was never weary of impressing their value upon the minds of his pupils. His
                    method of counterpoint was modelled in close accordance with that practised by
                    Sebastian Bach. This he used in combination with an elastic development of the
                    sonata-form, similar to that engrafted by Beethoven upon the lines laid down by
                    Haydn. The principles involved in this arrangement were strictly conservative;
                    yet they enabled him, at the very outset of his career, to invent a new style no
                    less original than that of Schubert or Weber, and no less remarkable as the
                    embodiment of canons already consecrated by classical authority than as a
                    special manifestation of individual genius. It is thus that Mendelssohn stands
                    before us as at the same time a champion of conservatism and an apostle of
                    progress; and it is chiefly by virtue of these two apparently incongruous though
                    really perfectly compatible phases of his artistic character that his influence
                    and example have, for so many years, held in check the violence of reactionary
                    opinion which a little injudicious encouragement might easily have fanned into
                    revolutionary fury. Happily, this wholesome influence is still at work among us;
                    and in his oratorios, his symphonies, his overtures, his concertos, and his
                    smaller pianoforte pieces Mendelssohn sets before us an example the value of
                    which is universally recognized, and not likely to be soon forgotten.</p>
                <p>Concerning Mendelssohn’s private character there have never been two opinions. As
                    a man of the world, he was more than ordinarily accomplished,—brilliant in
                    conversation, and in his lighter moments overflowing with sparkling humour and
                    ready pleasantry, loyal and unselfish in the more serious business of life, and
                    never weary of working for the general good. As a friend he was unvaryingly
                    kind, sympathetic, and as true as steel. His earnestness as a Christian needs no
                    stronger testimony than that afforded by his own delineation of the character of
                    St Paul; but it is not too much to say that his heart and life were pure as
                    those of a little child.</p>
                <p>A complete list of Mendelssohn’s published compositions—one hundred and nineteen
                    in number, besides some five and twenty unnumbered works of considerable
                    importance—will be found in the thematic catalogue published by Messrs Breitkopf
                    and Härtel at Leipsic, and also in Grove’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Music
                    and Musicians,</hi> vol. ii. pp. 308, 309. Among his miscellaneous writings, we
                    may mention a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Andria</hi> of Terence, in
                    German verse, and an immense collection of letters, posthumously printed, and
                    calculated to give the reader a far closer acquaintance with his life and
                    character than any biographer can hope to convey. (W. S. R.)</p>
