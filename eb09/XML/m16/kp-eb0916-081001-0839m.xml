                    •empire, lies between 15° 5' and 18° 45' E. long., and 48° 50' and 50° 10' N.
                    lat. Its superficial extent is about 8580 square miles. Physically Moravia may
                    be described as a mountainous plateau sloping from north to south, and bordered
                    on three sides by mountain ranges of considerable elevation. On the north it is
                    separated from Austrian and Prussian Silesia by the Sudetes, which attain a
                    height of 4775 feet in the AItvater or Schneeberg, and sink gradually towards
                    the west, where the valley of the Oder forms a break between the German
                    mountains and the Carpathians. The latter are the dividing range between Moravia
                    and Hungary, having here an average height of 3000 to 4000 feet. On the west are
                    the so-called Bohemian-Moravian mountains, forming the elevated east margin of
                    Bohemia and descending in terraces, but without clearly-defined ridges, to the
                    river March. Branches of these different ranges intersect the whole country,
                    making the surface very irregular, except towards the south, where it consists
                    of fertile and extensive plains. Owing to this configuration of the soil the
                    climate varies more than might be expected in so small an area, so that, while
                    the vine and maize are cultivated successfully in the southern plains, the
                    weather in the mountainous districts is somewhat rigorous. The mean average
                    temperature at Brünn is 48° Fahr. The harvest amid the mountains is often four
                    or five weeks later than that in the south. Almost the whole of Moravia belongs
                    to the basin of the March or Morava, from which it derives its name, and which,
                    after traversing the entire length of the country in a course of 140 miles and
                    receiving numerous tributaries (Thaya, Hanna, &lt;fcc.), enters the Danube at
                    Pressburg. The Oder rises among the mountains in the north-east of Moravia, but
                    soon turns to the north and quits the country. With the exception of a stretch
                    of the March none of the rivers are navigable. Moravia is destitute of lakes,
                    but contains numerous large ponds. There are also several mineral springs.</p>
                <p>Nearly 97 per cent, of the soil of Moravia is productive, arable land occupying
                    53, gardens and meadows 8’5, pasturage 9, and forests 26 per cent, of the total.
                    It is one of the chief corn-growing regions of the Austrian empire, and also
                    produces excellent hemp, flax, potatoes, vegetables, and fruit. The following
                    table shows the amount of the chief crops in 1881 :—</p>

                <p>Large quantities of hay and other fodder, besides hops, clover-seed, anise,
                    fennel, &amp;c., are also raised. The forests on the slopes of the Sudetes
                    produce abundance of excellent timber. The live-stock of Moravia in 1880
                    consisted of 122,858 horses, 677,807 cattle, 158,852 sheep, 205,976 swine, and
                    116,880 goats. The breed of sheep on the Carpathians is of an improved quality,
                    and the horses bred in the fertile plain of the Hanna are highly esteemed. Geese
                    and poultry are also reared. In 1880 Moravia contained 83,440 beehives, and the
                    produce of wax and honey may be estimated at 3500 to 4000 cwts.</p>
                <p>The mineral wealth of Moravia, consisting chiefly of coal and iron, is very
                    considerable. In 1881 the produce included 392,625 tons of anthracite coal,
                    50,665 tons of lignite, 5700 tons of iron-ore, 1713 tons of graphite, and
                    smaller quantities of alum, potter’s clay, and roofing-slate. The mines give
                    employment to 4500 persons, and the annual value of the raw minerals produced is
                    about £370,000. The amount of raw and cast iron produced by the ironworks and
                    foundries in 1880 was 40,000 tons, and the value about £320,000.</p>
                <p>In point of industry Moravia belongs to the foremost provinces of the empire. The
                    principal manufactures are woollen, cotton, linen, and cast-iron goods,
                    beet-sugar, leather, and brandy. Its woollen cloths and flannels, the
                    manufacture of which centres in Brünn, have long been celebrated. The linen
                    manufacture is decreasing in importance as cotton manufactures develop. The
                    quantity of sugar made from beetroot is steadily increasing; in 1880 about
                    600,000 cwts. of sugar were produced in fiftyseven factories. About 10 per cent,
                    of the total value of the manufactures of Austria, representing an annual amount
                    of £13,000,000 to £15,000,000, falls to the share of Moravia. The trade of
                    Moravia consists mainly in the exchange of the various raw and manufactured
                    materials above mentioned for colonial produce, salt, and raw manufacturing
                    material. The lack of navigable rivers or canals is compensated by good roads
                    and an extensive railway system. The most important commercial towns are Brünn
                    for manufactures and Olmütz for live-stock.</p>
                <p>In educational matters Moravia compares favourably with most of the Austrian
                    states. It contains 10 gymnasia, 10 real-gymnasia, 13 real-schools, numerous
                    schools for special purposes, and nearly 2000 lower schools. The old university
                    of Brünn is now represented by a technical academy and a theological seminary.
                    Of children of schoolgoing age 79 per cent, attend school regularly. In 1870
                    about 46 per cent, of the Moravian recruits could write their names, as compared
                    with the extremes of 83∣ per cent, in Lower Austria and 1∣ per cent, in
                    Dalmatia. Fully 95 per cent, of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics under the
                    ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the archbishop of Olmütz and the bishop of Brünn,
                    while about 2 per cent, are Jews, and 3 per cent. Protestants.</p>
                <p>Moravia sends 36 members to the Austrian reichstag, 9 of these representing the
                    landed proprietors, 16 the towns and chambers of commerce, and 11 the
                    peasantry.</p>

                <p>Provincial affairs are managed by the landtag, consisting of the Roman Catholic
                    archbishop and bishop, 30 representatives of the landed gentry, 37
                    representatives of the towns and chambers of commerce, and 31 representatives of
                    the country districts. There are six courts of justice of the first instance in
                    Moravia, and one of the second instance (at Brünn), whence appeal lies to the
                    supreme court at Vienna. For military and judicial purposes Moravia is united
                    with Austrian Silesia.</p>
                <p>Moravia belongs to the group of old Slavonic states which have preserved their
                    nationality while losing their political independence. Upwards of 70 per cent,
                    of the inhabitants are Slavs, who are scarcely distinguishable from their
                    Bohemian neighbours. The differences in dialect between the two countries are
                    very slight, and are being gradually lost in a common literary language. The
                    name of Czech, however, is usually reserved for the Bohemians, while the Slavs
                    of Moravia and West Hungary •are called Moravians and Slovaks. The Czechs have
                    lost sight of their ancient tribal names, but the Moravians are still divided
                    into numerous secondary groups (Hovaks, Hanaks, &lt;fcc.), differing slightly in
                    costume and dialect. The peasants usually wear a national costume. In the south
                    of Moravia are a few thousand Croats, still preserving their manners and
                    language after three centuries’ separation from their kinsmen in Croatia; and in
                    the north-east are numerous Poles. The Germans form about 26 per cent, of the
                    population, and are found mostly in the towns and in the border districts. The
                    Jews are the best educated of the inhabitants, and in a few small towns form a
                    full half of the population. Their sympathies generally lie with the Germans. In
                    1880 the population was 2,153,407, showing an increase of 136,133 since 1869.
                    Moravia is one of the most densely-populated parts of Austria-Hungary, the
                    proportion being 252 persons per square mile. About 12 per cent, of the births
                    are illegitimate. The chief towns are Brünn, the capital and industrial centre
                    (82,660 inhabitants), Olmütz, a strong fortress defending the “Moravian Gate”
                    (20,176 inhabitants), Znaim, and Iglau.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> At the earliest period of which we have any
                    record Moravia was occupied by the Boii, the Celtic race which has perpetuated
                    its name in Bohemia. Afterwards it was inhabited by the Germanic Quadi, who
                    accompanied the Vandals in their westward migration; and they were replaced in
                    the 5th century by the Rugii ana Heruli. The latter tribes were succeeded about
                    the year 550 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> by the Lombards, and these in their
                    turn were soon forced to retire before an overwhelming invasion of Slavs, who,
                    on their settlement there, took the name of Moravians (German, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mehranen</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mähren)</hi> from the river Morava. These
                    new colonists became the permanent inhabitants of this district, and in spite of
                    the hostility of the Avars on the east founded the kingdom of Great Moravia,
                    which was considerably more extensive than the province now bearing the name.
                    Towards the end of the 8th century they aided Charlemagne in putting an end to
                    the Avar kingdom, and were rewarded by receiving part of it, corresponding to
                    North Hungary, as a fief of the German emperor, whose supremacy they also
                    acknowledged more or less for their other possessions. After the death of
                    Charlemagne the Moravian princes took advantage of the dissensions of his
                    successors to enlarge their territories and assert their independence, and
                    Rastislaus <hi rend="italic">(circa</hi> 850) even formed an alliance with the
                    Bulgarians and the Byzantine emperor. The chief result of the alliance with the
                    latter was the conversion of the Moravians to Christianity by two Greek monks,
                    Cyril and Methodius, despatched from Constantinople. Rastislaus finally fell
                    into the hands of Louis the German, who blinded him, and forced him to end his
                    days as a monk; but his successor, Suatopluk ( o⅛. 890), was equally vigorous,
                    and extended the kingdom of Great Moravia to the Oder on the west and the Gran
                    on the east. At this period there seemed a strong probability of the junction of
                    the northwestern and south-eastern Slavs, and the formation of a great Slavonic
                    power to the east of the German empire. This prospect, however, was dissipated
                    by the invasions of the Magyar hordes in the 10th century, the brunt of which
                    was borne by Moravia. The invaders were encouraged by the German monarchs and
                    aided by the dissensions and mismanagement of the successors of Suatopluk, and
                    in a short time completely subdued the eastern part of Great Moravia. The name
                    of Moravia was henceforth confined to the district to which it now applies. For
                    about a century the possession of this marchland was disputed by Hungary,
                    Poland, and Bohemia, but in 1029 it was finally incorporated with Bohemia, and
                    so became an integral part of the German empire. Towards the close of the 12th
                    century Moravia was raised to the dignity of a margraviate, but with the proviso
                    that it should be held as a fief of the crown of Bohemia. It henceforth shared
                    the fortunes of this country, and was usually assigned as an apanage to younger
                    members of the Bohemian royal house. In 1410 Jobst, margrave of Moravia, was
                    made emperor of Germany, but died a few months after his election. In 1526, on
                    the death of Louis II. of Hungary, Moravia came with the rest of that prince’s
                    possessions into the hands of the Austrian house. During the Thirty Years’ War
                    the depopulation of Moravia was so great that after the peace of Westphalia the
                    states-general published an edict giving every man permission to take two wives,
                    in order to ‘ ‘ repeople the country.” After the Seven Years’ War Moravia was
                    united in one province with the remnant of Silesia, but in 1849 it was made a
                    separate and independent crownland. The most noticeable feature of recent
                    Moravian history has been the active sympathy of its inhabitants with the
                    anti-Teutonic home-rule agitation of the Bohemian Czechs (see <hi
