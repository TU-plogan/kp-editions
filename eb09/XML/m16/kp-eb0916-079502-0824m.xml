                    of</hi></label> (1612- 1650), born in 1612, became the fifth earl of Montrose by
                    his father’s death in 1626. He was educated at St Andrews; and in 1629, at the
                    early age of seventeen, he married Magdalene Carnegie, daughter of the earl of
                    Southesk. In 1636, on his way home from a prolonged visit to the Continent, he
                    sought an introduction to Charles I., but, as it is said, was frustrated in his
                    hope of obtaining the king’s favour by an intrigue of the marquis of Hamilton.
                    Not long after the outbreak of the Scottish troubles in 1637 he joined the party
                    of resistance, and was for some time its most energetic champion. He had nothing
                    puritanical in his nature, but he shared in the ill feeling aroused in the
                    Scottish nobility by the political authority given by Charles to the bishops,
                    and in the general indignation at the king’s ill-judged scheme of imposing upon
                    Scotland a liturgy which had been drawn up at the instigation of the English
                    court, and which had been corrected in England by that Archbishop Laud who now
                    became known in Scotland under the nickname of “the pope of Canterbury.”
                    Montrose’s chivalrous enthusiasm eminently qualified him to be the champion of a
                    national cause, and the resistance of Scotland was quite as much national as it
                    was religious. He signed the Covenant, and became one of the foremost
                    Covenanters. The part assigned to him wrs the suppression of the opposition to
                    the popular cause which arose around Aberdeen and in the country of the Gordons.
                    Three times, in July 1638, and in March and June 1639, Montrose <pb break="no"

                    in effecting his object, on the second occasion carrying off the head of the
                    Gordons, the marquis of Huntly, as a prisoner to Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>In July 1639, after the signature of the treaty of Berwick, Montrose was one of
                    the Covenanting leaders who visited Charles upon the borders. This change of
                    policy on his part is frequently ascribed to the fascination of the king’s
                    conversation. In reality it arose from the nature of his own convictions. He
                    wished to get rid of the bishops without making presbyters masters of the state.
                    His was essentially a layman’s view of the situation. Taking no account of the
                    real forces of the time, he aimed at an ideal form of society in which the
                    clergy should confine themselves to their spiritual duties, and in which the
                    king, after being enlightened by open communication with the Scottish nation,
                    should maintain law and order without respect of persons. In the Scottish
                    parliament which met in September, Montrose attempted to carry out this policy,
                    and found himself in opposition to Argyll, who had placed himself at the head of
                    the Presbyterian and national party, which, by an alteration of the rules that
                    had hitherto regulated the selection of the Lords of the Articles, gave
                    supremacy in parliament to the representatives of the middle classes. Montrose,
                    on the other hand, wished to bring the king’s authority to bear upon parliament
                    to defeat this object, and offered him the support of a great number of the
                    nobles, who were by this time as much opposed to the predominance of the
                    Presbyterian clergy acting upon the middle classes as they had before been
                    opposed to the predominance of the bishops. He failed, because Charles could not
                    even then consent to abandon the bishops, and because no Scottish party of any
                    weight could be formed unless Presbyterianism were established
                    ecclesiastically.</p>
                <p>Rather than give way, Charles prepared in 1640 to invade Scotland. As usual, he
                    prepared difficulties for those who wished to support him. Montrose was of
                    necessity driven to play something of a double part. In August 1640 he signed
                    the Bond of Cumbernauld as a protest against the particular and direct
                    practising of a few—in other words, against the ambition of Argyll. But he took
                    his place amongst the defenders of his country, and in the same month he was the
                    first to wade across the Tweed at the head of the invaders of England. After the
                    invasion had been crowned with success, Montrose still continued to cherish his
                    now hopeless policy. On 27th May 1641 he was summoned before the Committee of
                    Estates charged with intrigues against Argyll, and on 11th June he was
                    imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. When Charles visited Scotland to give his formal
                    assent to the abolition of Episcopacy, Montrose communicated to him his belief
                    that Hamilton was a traitor. It has indeed been alleged, on Clarendon’s
                    authority, that he proposed to murder Hamilton and Argyll; but this is in all
                    probability only one of Clarendon’s many blunders. His letters to Charles,
                    however, must be taken in connexion with this so-called incident. During the
                    progress of the investigation of this plot, Montrose remained in custody, and
                    upon the king’s return to England he shared in the amnesty which was tacitly
                    accorded to all Charles’s partisans.</p>
                <p>For a time Montrose retired, not voluntarily, from public life. After the Civil
                    War in England began he constantly pressed Charles to allow him to make a
                    diversion on Scotland. At last in 1644, when the Scottish army entered England
                    to take part against the king, Montrose, now created a marquis, was allowed to
                    try what he could do. He set out to invade Scotland with about 1000 men. But his
                    followers deserted, and his condition appeared hopeless. Genius, however,
                    inspired him with courage. Disguised as a groom, he, with only two gentlemen,
                    started on 18th August to make his way to the Highlands. No enterprise might
                    seem rasher. Highlanders had never before been known to combine together, but
                    Montrose knew that most of the clans detested Argyll, not because they were
                    royalist but because Argyll, as the head of the Campbells, was the chief of an
                    aggressive and unscrupulous tribe. Montrose did not miscalculate his chances.
                    The clans rallied to his summons. About 2000 Irish had crossed the sea to assist
                    him. He won battle after battle. He defeated the Covenanters at Tippermuir on
                    1st September, and at the Bridge of Dee on 12th September. Rapidity of movement
                    was the distinguishing feature of his generalship. He crossed the mountains deep
                    with a winter’s snow into the country of Argyll, burning and destroying as he
                    rested for a time from more active operations. On 2d February 1645 he crushed
                    the Campbells at Inverlochy, whilst the head of the house, who was no warrior,
                    looked on at the disaster from a boat. The Scottish parliament declared Montrose
                    to have forfeited his life and estate as a traitor, but it could not reach him
                    to execute the sentence. On 19th February he captured Elgin, through March he
                    was ravaging Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire, on 3d April he stormed Dundee,
                    then on 9th May came the victory of Auldearn, on 2d July the victory of Alford,
                    and on 15th August the great victory of Kilsyth. Never till after this battle
                    had Montrose ventured far from the Highland hills. The Highlanders had the habit
                    of running home after a victory to secure their booty. Now, however, Montrose
                    found himself apparently master of Scotland. In the name of the king, who now
                    appointed him lord-lieutenant and captain-general of Scotland, he summoned a
                    parliament to meet at Glasgow on 20th October, in which he no doubt hoped to
                    reconcile loyal obedience to the king with the establishment of a non-political
                    Presbyterian clergy. That parliament never met. In England Charles was in evil
                    case. He had been defeated at Naseby on 14th June, and Montrose must come to his
                    help if there was to be still a king to proclaim. He never had a chance of
                    knowing what Montrose could do against the “new model” army. David Leslie, the
                    best of the Scottish generals, was despatched against Montrose to anticipate the
                    invasion. On 12th September he came upon Montrose, deserted by his Highlanders
                    and guarded only by a little group of followers, at Philiphaugh. He won an easy
                    victory. Montrose cut his way through to the Highlands; but he failed to
                    reorganize an army. On 3d September 1646 he embarked for Norway.</p>
                <p>Montrose was to appear once more on the stage of Scottish history. In June 1649
                    he was restored by the exiled Charles II. to his nominal lieutenant-governorship
                    of Scotland. In March 1650 he landed in the Orkneys to take the command of a
                    small force which he had sent on before him. Crossing to the mainland, he tried
                    to raise the clans, but the clans would not rise, and on 27th April he was
                    surprised and captured at Corbiesdale in Ross-shire. On 18th May he entered
                    Edinburgh as a prisoner. On the 20th he was sentenced to death by the
                    parliament, and he was hanged on the 21st, with Wishart’s laudatory biography of
                    him put round his neck. To the last he protested that he was a real Covenanter
                    and a loyal subject. “The Covenant which I took,” he said, “I own it and adhere
                    to it. Bishops, I care not for them <hi rend="italic">; I</hi> never intended to
                    advance their interest.” Something, at least, of Montrose’s dream, so impossible
                    to realize at that time, has been realized in Scotland. Scotland has remained
                    ecclesiastically Presbyterian. The political legality which Montrose wished to
                    uphold against factions by means of the king has been upheld by means of the
                    political ripeness of the Scottish nation itself. (s. K. G.)</p>
