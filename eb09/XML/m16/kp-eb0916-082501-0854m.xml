                    tides. The entrance of the roadstead is defended by the Chateau du Taureau,
                    which stands on a rock in the sea, and was built in 1542 to protect the town
                    from the English. Morlaix still contains a considerable number of curious wooden
                    houses of the 15th, 16th, and 17 th centuries; but the most striking piece of
                    architecture in the town is the gigantic two-storied viaduct of the railway from
                    Paris to Brest, 934 feet long and 207 feet above the quays. The old church of
                    the Dominicans is now occupied by the town library. The hospital has beds for
                    500 patients, and can accommodate 300 female lunatics besides. A
                    tobacco-factory, employing 400 men and 700 women, is the principal industrial
                    establishment; and there are also extensive paper-mills, a considerable
                    flax-mill, canvas-factories, foundries, and saw-mills. A considerable trade is
                    carried on in grain, yarn, canvas, leather, tallow, wax, and horses; and a large
                    quantity of butter, cattle, and vegetables is exported from Roscoff, a village
                    in the neighbourhood, which is also known for its sea-bathing and its zoological
                    station. The population of Morlaix was 15,183 in 1876.</p>
                <p>Judging by the numerous coins found on the spot, the site of Morlaix was probably
                    occupied in the time of the Romans. The counts of Leon held the lordship in the
                    12th century, but the dukes of Brittany disputed possession with them, and in
                    1187 Henry II. of England, guardian of Arthur of Brittany, made himself master
                    of the town after a siege of several weeks. During the War of the Hundred Years
                    Morlaix was again captured and recaptured by the French and the English, and
                    pillaged by the latter in 1522. Queen Mary of Scotland, on her way to be married
                    to the Dauphin, made solemn entry into Morlaix in 1548. And finally, the town
                    having joined the League, the castle was taken by storm in the name of Henry IV.
                    in 1594.</p>
