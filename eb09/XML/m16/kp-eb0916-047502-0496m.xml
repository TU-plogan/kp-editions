                <p><label type="entry">MINNESOTA</label>, one of the north-western States of the
                    American Union, extending from 43° 30' N. lat. to the British Possessions (about
                    49° N. lat.), and from Wisconsin and Lake Superior on the east to Dakota on the
                    west, between the meridians of 89° 39' and 97° 5' W. long. Its area, including
                    half of the lakes, straits, and rivers along its boundaries, except Rainy Lake
                    and Lake of the Woods, amounts to 83,365 square miles.</p>
                <p>The surface of Minnesota is diversified by few elevations of any great height. In
                    general it is an undulating plain, breaking in some sections into rolling
                    prairie, and traversed by belts of timber. It has an average elevation above
                    sea-level of about 1000 feet. The watershed of the north (which determines the
                    course of the three great continental river systems) and that of the west are
                    not ridges or hills, but elevations whose inclination is almost insensible. The
                    southern and central portions of the State are chiefly rolling prairie, the
                    upper part of which is crossed from N.W. to S.E. by the forest belt known as the
                    Big Woods,— a stretch of deciduous forest trees with an area of about 5000
                    square miles. North of the 47th parallel, the great Minnesota pine belt reaches
                    from Lake Superior to the confines of the Red River valley, including the region
                    of the headwaters of the Mississippi and its upper tributaries, as well as those
                    of the Superior streams. North of the pine region there is but a stunted growth
                    of tamarack and dwarf pine. In the north-east are found the rugged elevations of
                    the granite uplift of the shores of Lake Superior, rising to a considerable
                    height; while in the north-west the surface slopes away to the level prairie
                    reaches of the Red River valley. The surface elevation of the State varies from
                    800 to 2000 feet above sea-level. A short line of hills in the north-east
                    reaches the latter altitude, while only the valleys of the Red River, the
                    Mississippi, and the Minnesota fall below the former.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Soil.—</hi> The geology has not yet been mapped out
                    with the precision attained in other States. The great central zone, from Lake
                    Superior to the southwestern extremity of the State, is occupied by granitic and
                    metamorphic rocks, succeeded, in the south-east, by narrower bands of later
                    formation. Within the great Azoic area lies the central watershed of the
                    continent, from which the St Lawrence system sends its waters towards the
                    Atlantic, the Mississippi towards the Gulf of Mexico, and the Red River of the
                    North to Hudson’s Bay. These primordial rocks carry back the geologic history of
                    Minnesota to preSilurian times. They form in the north-east, in the
                    neighbourhood of Lake Superior, an extremely rough and hilly country, but as
                    they reach the central and southwestern portions of the State they for the most
                    part disappear beneath the surface drift. This central belt is succeeded, on the
                    south and east, by a stretch of sandstone, partially the true red Potsdam and
                    partially a similar but lighter-coloured stratum, which some have proposed to
                    designate the St Croix Sandstone. Isolated beds of sandstone are found in
                    various parts of the State. The northwestern corner, stretching east from the
                    Red River valley, is believed to be Cretaceous; but the great depth of drift and
                    alluvium, disturbed by no large rivers, prevents a positive conclusion. The
                    Lower Magnesian limestone underlies the extreme south-eastern portion of the
                    State, and extends along the west side of the Mississippi to a point a little
                    below St Paul; thence it takes a course almost semicircular, and finally passes
                    out of the State at the south-western boundary. The Trenton limestone occupies a
                    large field in the south and south-east; it comes to the surface in long
                    irregular bands, and an island of it underlies the cities of Minneapolis and St
                    Paul with the adjacent districts. The Galena limestone, the Masquoketa shales,
                    the Niagara limestone, and the rocks of the Devonian age in turn prevail in the
                    other counties of the south and east; while the existence of the St Peter
                    sandstone would scarcely be known but for its outcropping along the bluffs of
                    the Mississippi, and at the famous waterfall of Minnehaha. From these various
                    formations numerous kinds of stone valuable for building purposes are obtained.
                    The grey granite of St Cloud is extremely hard and enduring. The Lower Magnesian
                    furnishes two especially handsome building stones,—the pink limestone known as
                    Kasota stone, and the cream-coloured stone of Red Wing, both easily worked, and
                    hardening by exposure to atmospheric changes. Naturally, from its location
                    underneath the principal cities of the State, the Trenton limestone is the most
                    widely used. Sand suitable for glass-making, and argillaceous deposits abound.
                    The clays which make up so large a portion of the surface drift of the State are
                    almost wholly of glacial origin. Overlying the deposits of sand, gravel,
                    boulders, and clay is, in most portions of the State, a sandy loam, very finely
                    divided, rich in organic matter, deep brown or black in colour, and of the
                    greatest fertility. It is this soil which has given to the State its reputation
                    for productiveness. Its depth varies from 2 to 5 feet in various parts of the
                    State, and it has been described by Dr Owen as “excellent in quality, rich as
                    well in organic matter as in those mineral salts which give rapidity to the
                    growth of plants, while it has that durability which enables it to sustain a
                    long succession of crops.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers and Lakes.—</hi> The State holds a unique place with
                    reference to the great water systems of the continent. The Mississippi takes its
                    rise in Lake Itasca, north of the centre of the State. Before it leaves the
                    State limits it becomes a great river, half a mile wide, and from 5 to 20 feet
                    deep. It drains with its tributaries all the southern and central portions and a
                    large area of the northern part of the State. It is navigable as far as St Paul,
                    and at Minneapolis the falls of St Anthony afford unrivalled facilities for
                    manufacturing. Of the many affluents of the Mississippi the most important is
                    the Minnesota, which after a course of about 440 miles flows into the main
                    stream at Fort Snelling, 3 miles above St Paul. The source of the Minnesota is
                    but 1 mile from Lake Traverse, the origin of the Red River of the North, and it
                    is navigable during the high-water season for about 238 miles. Its principal
                    tributaries are the Blue Earth, Chippewa, Redwood, Lac qui Parle, and Pomme de
                    Terre. The Red River system drains the north-western part of the State, and its
                    waters <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n497/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0497-0476"/> finally pass into Hudson’s Bay, as also do those
                    from the country drained by streams flowing to the Rainy Lake river and the
                    lakes along the northern boundary line. East of this lies the region tributary
                    to Lake Superior and the St Lawrence system. This comprises an area within the
                    State estimated at 9000 square miles. Its principal river is the St Louis. There
                    are altogether about 2796 miles of navigable water in Minnesota.</p>
                <p>The number of lakes is estimated at seven thousand. They are of all sizes, and
                    are found chiefly in the northern two-thirds of the State. They have been
                    classified geologically into glacial or drift lakes, fluviatile or river lakes,
                    occupying basins on river courses, and lakes having rock basins either scooped
                    out by the action of glaciers or formed by the relative position of different
                    geological formations. By far the greater number give evidence of glacial action
                    in their origin. They abound over the region most deeply covered by the surface
                    drift, and are especially prevalent in morainic districts, forming the southern
                    fringe of the lacustrine area of North America. With the melting of the
                    ice-sheet which once overspread Minnesota its innumerable lakes came into
                    existence; and the gentle acclivity of its slopes, precluding rapid erosive
                    action, has tended to give permanence to the depressions constituting their
                    basins. The census returns give 4160 square miles of water surface within the
                    State. Most of the lakes are exceedingly picturesque in their surroundings.
                    Forests skirt their shores, which are seldom marshy; and their waters, abounding
                    in various kinds of fish, are clear and cool. Besides the sanitary advantages
                    afforded by the lakes, as supplying places for recreation and delightful summer
                    resorts, they affect the climate to some extent, tempering the extremes commonly
                    experienced in northern latitudes. The fact that many of the lakes are gradually
                    drying up must be explained by agricultural operations. The largest lakes,
                    exclusive of Superior, lying wholly or in part in Minnesota are as follows
                    :—Lake of the Woods, 612 square miles; Red, 342; Mille Lacs, 198; Leech, 194;
                    Rainy, 146; Winnibigoshish, 78; and Vermilion, 63.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora and Fauna.—</hi> The flora and fauna present no marked
                    differences from those of other States in the same latitude. In a partial list
                    of the birds of Minnesota, two hundred and eighty-one species are enumerated. Of
                    winter birds fifty-two species have been classified, twenty-three of them being
                    permanent residents.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The State lies so far north as to have a low
                    mean annual temperature, and so far inland as to have the characteristic
                    continental climate. Its elevation above sea-level gives an agreeable
                    rarefaction to the atmosphere, and makes the prevalence of fogs and damp weather
                    unknown. Between June and January there is an annual variation from the summer
                    heat of southern Ohio to the winter cold of Montreal. The winter, usually
                    commencing in November, and continuing till near the end of March, is not a
                    period of intense continued cold, but is subject to considerable variations. As
                    a rule, the comparative dryness of the atmosphere neutralizes the severest
                    effect of excessive cold. The snowfall is extremely light during most of the
                    winter, but as spring approaches precipitation becomes greater, and there are
                    frequently heavy snowfalls in February and March. The change from winter to
                    summer is rapid, vegetation sometimes seeming to leap into full and active
                    growth within the space of a few weeks. The summer months bring days of intense
                    heat, but, with comparatively rare exceptions, the nights are deliciously cook
                    Hot days and cool nights make the ideal weather for a good wheat crop; and the
                    forcing heats of summer produce in luxuriant growth the vegetable life which
                    belongs to the middle States. The Smithsonian chart assigns to Minnesota an
                    average temperature for the hottest week in summer of from 85” to 90’, and for
                    the coldest week in winter from 10° to 20’ below zero. The mean annual average,
                    for all below 47’ of latitude, it gives as 40*. Observations at St Paul,
                    extending over a period of more than thirty-five years, show the following mean
                    temperatures spring, 45° ∙6; summer, 7θ° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6;
                    autumn, 40° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9; winter, 16 <hi rend="superscript">
                    ,-</hi> 1; average, 44* <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6. The average annual
                    rainfall is about 25 ’ 5 inches. While this is not large, it is so distributed
                    as best to subserve the purposes of vegetable growth. No moisture is lost in
                    superfluous spring and autumn rains, or in the cold and non-producing part of
                    the year, the precipitation, which in winter is less than 2 inches, increasing
                    to about 12 for the summer. To the season of vegetable growth belong 70 per
                    cent, of the yearly measures of heat, 76 percent, of the rainfall, and 76
                    percent, of the atmospheric humidity. The prevailing winds are from the south or
                    south-east. In 1880 rain or snow fell on 150 days, and in 1881 on 167. It is
                    evident that the causes which mitigate the actual severity of the climate as
                    felt, which produce so large a number of clear days, and which forbid the
                    continued presence of a large amount of moisture in the atmosphere, are those
                    which render a climate healthful in the highest degree. Minnesota has been for
                    many years a favourite resort for invalids. The curative properties of its
                    climate are especially marked in the case of pulmonary complaints.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The leading industry of the State is
                    agriculture. The character of the surface soil varies in different parts of the
                    State with the character of the underlying strata. The fertile land comprises
                    about three-fourths of the entire area of the State. The drift soil proper of
                    the south and centre, including the Minnesota valley and the greater par t of
                    that of the Mississippi, contains silica and calcareous matter, and is
                    interspersed with alluvial river bottoms. The limestone soil, in which there is
                    a large calcareous element, lies chiefly on the western slope of the
                    Mississippi. The Red River valley consists of an argillaceous mould, rich in
                    organic deposits. Around Lake Superior, wherever arable land is to be found, it
                    is marked by a rich trap soil. North of the central fertile area, and in the
                    neighbourhood of the sources of the Mississippi, is much swampy land,
                    susceptible of easy drainage, with a large tract of sand and other drift
                    detritus, unfavourable to production. Maize and potatoes flourish, and the
                    uplands, which support hardwood ridges, are suited to general agriculture. To
                    the extreme north the surface, while indicating mineral wealth, is utterly
                    unfit, except in occasional isolated areas, for purposes of tillage.</p>
                <p>Wheat has hitherto been the staple product of the State. Soil and climate are
                    such as to ensure a large average yield, while the superior quality of the grain
                    has given it a wide reputation. The other cereals are also cultivated with
                    success. The tendency to diversify agriculture, especially in the southern part
                    of the State, has been stimulated by several partial failures of the wheat crop,
                    the locust invasions, and the competition of the farther north-west.</p>
                <p>The area of the State includes 39,791,265 acres surveyed, 10,968,575 acres not
                    surveyed, and 2,700,000 acres of lake surface. The total sales of public and
                    railroad lands in 1879 and 1880 were not far from 4,000,000 acres. It is
                    estimated that the aggregate of lands yet undisposed of, three-fourths of which
                    may be profitably cultivated, is nearly 20,000,000 acres, exclusive of the lands
                    belonging to the State. White Earth Indian reservation has thirty-six townships
                    of prairie and timber land; and Red Lake reservation contains 3,200,000
                    acres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forestry.—</hi> A special census bulletin estimates the amount
                    of merchantable white pine standing, May 31, 1880, as amounting in all to
                    6,100,000,000 feet. The entire cut for the census year 1880 was 540,997,000
                    feet. Of hardwood forest 3,840,000 acres remain, capable of yielding 57,600,000
                    cords of wood.</p>
                <p>Every encouragement is afforded, both by the railway corporations and the State,
                    to tree-planting on the prairies. A quarter section is given to any one who will
                    plant and keep in good condition 40 acres of timber for eight years. In 1880
                    there were planted 25,331 acres of trees, exclusive of those bordering highways
                    and the w indbreaks along the railroad lines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures. —</hi> The manufactures of Minnesota are yet in
                    their infancy. The abundant water-power of the State, its proximity to the
                    coal-fields of Iowa, its superior transportation facilities, and the large
                    demand for manufactured commodities are, however, rapidly developing this branch
                    of industry. The most important industries are the manufacture of flour and that
                    of lumber. The former naturally established itself in a State of immense wheat
                    yield andabundant water-power. It received its greatest stimulus from the
                    invention and adoption of the middlings purifying process, which produces the
                    highest grade of flour, and to which the hard spring wheat of Minnesota is
                    especially adapted. Among other manufacturing industries actively prosecuted are
                    the making of brick, pottery, stoneware, and agricultural implements, and also
                    meat-packing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> The geographical position of Minnesota gives it
                    extensive commercial interests. Two continental waterways terminate within the
                    State. The Mississippi affords continuous navigation to European ports during
                    eight months of the year. From Duluth numerous lines of vessels traverse the
                    chain of great lakes, and transport the products of the west to the eastern
                    seaboard. Three great transcontinental railway lines are connected more or less
                    directly with the railroad system of the State. Twelve lines of railway from
                    every part of Minnesota converge at the contiguous cities of St Paul and
                    Minneapolis, and three great trunk lines from these centres to Chicago secure
                    the advantages of a lively competition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The common school system is supported by land
                    grants, a local tax, and a State tax. The superintendent of instruction is
                    appointed by the governor. County superintendents are chosen by popular vote.
                    Common school districts have boards of three trustees each. Six directors are
                    appointed for independent districts. The permanent fund in 1881 was $4,850,000,
                    and the current fund $260,835. The State university, located at Minneapolis, is
                    governed by a board of regents, consisting of the governor of the State, the
                    superintendent of public instruction, the president of the university, and six
                    others; both sexes are admitted, and tuition is free. The State supports three
                    normal schools. Forty-two academies and six colleges are sustained by
                    denominational or private enterprise.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The departments of Government are, as in
                    all the States, the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. The State
                    contains seventy-eight counties, of which some are still subject to change of
                    boundary. From these are elected by districts forty-seven senators and one
                    hundred and three members of the House of Representatives. The State officers
                    are a governor, lieutenant-governor, secretary of state, treasurer, and
                    attorneygeneral, all elected by the people. The term of office is two years.</p>

                <p>The governor has power to veto separate items of a money bill. The judiciary is
                    elective, and the term of office seven years. The State requirements for
                    citizenship are residence in the United States oue year, in the State four
                    months, and in the election district ten days preceding an election. Women are
                    allowed to vote for school officers and upon questions relating to the
                    management of schools, and are also eligible to such offices. No county can
                    contain more than 400 square miles. The legislature meets biennially. Extra
                    sessions may be called, but no session can exceed sixty days in length. Under
                    the last apportionment the State is entitled to five representatives in the
                    national Congress.</p>
                <p>The annual valuation of property for 1882, as equalized by the State board, gives
                    the personal property as $79,219,445, the real estate $242,938,170. This
                    represents a total actual value of not far from $750,000,000.</p>
                <p>While Minnesota was still a Territory, but after it had adopted a State
                    constitution, an amendment was added to the constitution authorizing the issue
                    of a large amount of bonds in aid of railway construction. Shortly afterwards,
                    the companies having failed to fulfil their contracts and defaulted payment, the
                    State foreclosed its mortgage on the lands, franchises, Ac., of the roads, and
                    turned them over to other companies. By another amendment to the constitution,
                    the payment of the bonds was made contingent upon the result of a popular vote.
                    Several proposals having failed to receive this sanction, the necessity for it
                    was removed in 1881 by a decision of the supreme court, declaring the amendment
                    unconstitutional. The legislature immediately met, accepted a plan of settlement
                    proposed by the bondholders themselves, and over $4,000,000 worth of new bonds
                    were issued in exchange for the old. For the payment of the principal and
                    interest of these the people have voted (November 1882) to set aside as a
                    sinking fund the proceeds of 500,000 acres of land belonging to the State
                    internal improvement fund, the deficit to be paid out of the tax on railroad
                    earnings. These bonds include all the State debt except about $200,000. A tax of
                    3 per cent, imposed on the gross earnings of all railroads within the State will
                    soon meet all expenses except provision for educational, penal, and charitable
                    institutions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.</hi> — The population of the State was 6077 at the
                    census of 1850, 172,023 in 1860, 439,706 in 1870, and 780,773 (419,149 males and
                    361,624 females) in 1880. According to the last census 299,800 whites had been
                    born in the State; and of the 267,676 foreign-born inhabitants of the State
                    107,770 came from Scandinavian countries and 68,277 from the United Kingdom and
                    the British colonies, while 77,505 acknowledge the German as their native
                    tongue. The increase of population in the State for the last decade of years
                    alone was 75 per cent. The most important cities are St Paul, the capital, and
                    Minneapolis, with 41,473 and 46,887 inhabitants respectively in 1880; Winona had
                    10,208 and Stillwater 9055.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History. —</hi> Missionary efforts and the trading spirit first
                    induced white men to venture as far into the unexplored north-west as the
                    boundaries of what is now the State of Minnesota. The earliest accounts of its
                    natural features and native tribes appear in the Jesuit writings. The
                    “Relations” of 1670-71 allude to the Sioux or Dakotas. In 1678 a company was
                    formed for trading with this tribe. Du Luth was leader of this expedition, and
                    later on went from Lake Superior to the Mississippi by canoe. But the first
                    published account is that of Louis Hennepin, a Recollect monk, who, in 1680,
                    visited the falls of St Anthony, and gave them their name, from that of his
                    patron saint. For a century the only visitants of the wild region were a few
                    missionaries, and a number of fur traders who found the profit of the journey to
                    more than counterbalance its perils and hardships. To the latter class belong
                    Perrot, who reached the Mississippi by way of the Fox and Wisconsin in 1684, and
                    founded at Lake Pepin the first trading post in the State, and Le Sueur, a
                    Canadian, who ascended the great river from its mouth, and established another
                    post above Lake Pepin. Captain John Carver, the explorer of the country of the
                    upper Mississippi, visited the falls of St Anthony in 1766, being the first
                    British traveller who reached the spot. On March 20, 1804, Upper Louisiana was
                    organized, consisting of Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, and a large portion of
                    Minnesota. From this time onwards the progress of exploration was rapid, and
                    settlement followed in its train. The first really extensive exploration of any
                    large part of what is now Minnesota was made between 1817 and 1823, by Major S.
                    H. Long, of the United States engineer corps, in command of a Government
                    expedition. About the same time the Red River received its first visitant.
                    Thomas Douglas, earl of Selkirk, an Englishman of eccentric character, went, in
                    1817, to what is now Winnipeg, by way of York river. Having been struck with the
                    agricultural possibilities of the region about the Red River of the North, he
                    induced a colony of Swiss farmers to settle there. These were disappointed in
                    the country, and unused to the severity of the climate, so that they finally
                    removed to the vicinity of St Paul and contributed to the earliest development
                    of the agricultural industry of the State. In 1821 Colonel Snelling built, at
                    the junction of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers, a stronghold which he
                    named Fort St Anthony. The name was changed to Fort</p>
                <p>Snelling in his honour, in 1824, and the fort is still an important post as a
                    base of supplies for the newer north-west. The first steamboat made its
                    appearance at the head of navigation in 1823. The settlement of St Paul, one of
                    the oldest towns as well as the capital, is commonly dated from 1846, at which
                    time there were a few shanties on its site. Population now began to arrive in
                    constantly increasing numbers, and on March 3, 1849, a bill passed Congress for
                    organizing the Territory. It was proposed at one time to name it Itasca, but the
                    name Minnesota, meaning, “sky-tinted water,” and originally applied to the river
                    bearing that title, was finally retained. The western boundary of the territory
                    was fixed at the Missouri river. The population was but 4057, the largest town
                    had but a few hundred inhabitants, and a large part of the soil of the State
                    still belonged to the Indians. But progress now began in earnest. A constitution
                    was adopted in 1857, and on May 11, 1858, Minnesota was admitted as a State,
                    with a population, according to the last Territorial census, of 150,037.</p>
                <p>One of the first acts of the new State was the issue of the railroad bonds
                    noticed above. Soon after came the civil war. Within two months of Lincoln’s
                    first call for troops the first Minnesota regiment, over one thousand strong,
                    was mustered into service. By August of 1862 ten regiments had been called for
                    and furnished. In all,theStatesupplied to the armies of the Union 25,052 men, or
                    about one-seventh of its entire population at the outbreak of the war.</p>
                <p>In the meantime there occurred, in 1862, the horrible outbreak known as the Sioux
                    massacre. Settlements were cut off, isolated settlers murdered, and even a
                    strong post like Fort Ridgely was attacked. The outbreak spread over a large
                    portion of the.State; several severe engagements were fought; and it was not
                    until the State had a thoroughly equipped military force ready for the campaign
                    that the Indians begun to flee or to give themselves up. By this time over 700
                    persons had been murdered, 200, chiefly women, taken captive; eighteen counties
                    were ravaged, and 30,000 people were homeless. The property loss was not less
                    than $3,000,000.</p>
                <p>During these local and national disturbances the material prosperity of the State
                    was unabated. Notwithstanding the heavy cost of the civil war and the Sioux
                    massacre, the census of 1865 showed a population of 250,099. Railroad
                    construction began to be energetically carried forward; in 1870 329 miles were
                    made and 1096 miles were in operation; a road to Lake Superior was completed,
                    and the Northern Pacific was fairly under way. In 1873-76, and to some extent in
                    1877, successive visitations of locusts destroyed the crops of the south-western
                    counties. The sufferers were relieved by the State, and no repetition of the
                    scourge has since been experienced. (J. G. P.)</p>
