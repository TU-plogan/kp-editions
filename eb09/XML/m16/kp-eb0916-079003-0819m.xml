                    (1771-1854), poet and journalist, was justly described by Lord Byron, in a
                    footnote to <hi rend="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers,</hi> as “a man
                    of considerable genius,” though it was going far beyond the mark to speak of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Wanderer of Switzerland</hi> (his first notable poem,
                    published in 1806) as being worth a thousand “Lyrical Ballads.” Montgomery was
                    born 4th November 1771, at Irvine in Ayrshire, Scotland. Part of his boyhood was
                    spent in Ireland, but he received his education in Yorkshire, at the Moravian
                    school of Fulneck, named after the original home of the Moravians, to which sect
                    his father belonged. He drifted at an early age into journalism, and edited the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sheffield Iris</hi> for more than thirty years. When he began
                    his career the position of a Dissenting journalist was a difficult one, and he
                    twice suffered imprisonment (in 1795 and 1796) on charges that now seem absurdly
                    forced and unfair. His <hi rend="italic">Wanderer</hi> was mercilessly ridiculed
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> but in spite of this Montgomery
                    published many poems, which had a wide popularity :— <hi rend="italic">The West
                    Indies,</hi> 1810; <hi rend="italic">The World Before the Flood,</hi> 1812; <hi
                    rend="italic">Greenland,</hi> 1819; <hi rend="italic">Songs of Zion,</hi> 1822;
                    <hi rend="italic">The Pelican Island,</hi> 1827. On account of the religious
                    character of his poetry, he is sometimes confounded with Robert Montgomery, very
                    much to the injustice of his reputation. The inspiring force of James
                    Montgomery’s poetry was the humanitarian sentiment which has been such a power
                    in the political changes of this century, and the pulse of this sentiment is
                    nowhere felt beating more strongly than in his verse. His poetry has thus an
                    historical interest altogether apart from its intrinsic value as poetry. But
                    this value is far from contemptible or commonplace. Strictly speaking,
                    Montgomery was more of a rhetorician than a poet, but his imagination was bold,
                    ardent, and fertile, and more than one of his greater contemporaries owed
                    occasional debts to his vigorous invention and even to his casual felicities of
                    diction, while some passages from his poems keep a place in the literature that
                    is universally read and quoted. At the close of his career as a journalist, when
                    all parties agreed in paying him respect, he claimed for his poetry that it was
                    at least not imitative, and the claim was just as regarded conception and choice
                    of subjects; but as regards diction and imagery the influence of Campbell is
                    very apparent in his earlier poems, and the influence of Shelley is supreme in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pelican Island,</hi> his last and best work as a poet. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Poetry and General Literature,</hi> published in
                    1833, show considerable breadth of sympathy and power of expression. <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of him were published in seven volumes in 1856-8.
                    They furnish valuable materials for the history of English provincial politics
                    in the 19 th century. He died at Sheffield 30th April 1854.</p>
