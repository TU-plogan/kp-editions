                    was a very ancient one, belonging to Poitou, or rather to Angoumois. Direct
                    descent is said to be provable to the 13th century, and charters and other
                    documents carry the history of the house two centuries further back. For some
                    generations before the historian the family had been distinguished, not merely
                    in the army, but for scientific attainments. Montalembert’s father, René,
                    emigrated, fought under Condé, and subsequently served in the English army. He
                    married a Miss Forbes, and his eldest son Charles was born at London. At the
                    Restoration René de Montalembert returned to France, was raised to the peerage
                    in 1819, and became ambassador to Sweden (where Charles received much of his
                    education) in 1826. He died a year after the overthrow of the legitimate
                    monarchy. Charles de Montalembert was too young to take his seat as a peer
                    (twenty-five being the necessary age), but he retained other rights; and this,
                    combined with his literary and intellectual activity, made him a person of some
                    importance. He had eagerly entered into the somewhat undefined plans of
                    Lamennais and Lacordaire for the establishment of a school of Liberal
                    Catholicism, and he co-operated with them, both in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Avenir</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lamennais,</hi> vol. xiv. pp. 239, 240)
                    and in the practical endeavour, which absorbed some of the best energies of
                    France at the time, to break through the trammels of the system of state
                    education. This latter scheme first brought Montalembert into notice, as he was
                    formally charged with unlicensed teaching. He claimed the right of trial by his
                    peers, and made a notable defence, of course with a deliberate intention of
                    protest. His next most remarkable act was his participation in the famous
                    pilgrimage to Rome of his two friends. This step, as is well known, proved
                    useless to mitigate the measures which private intrigues, and perhaps a not
                    altogether injudicious instinct, prompted the Roman curia to take against the
                    <hi rend="italic">A venir</hi> and the doctrines of its promoters. Montalembert,
                    however, submitted dutifully to the encyclical of June 1835, and only devoted
                    himself more assiduously to the work on which he was engaged, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of St Elizabeth of Hungary.</hi> This appeared in 1836. It
                    displayed Montalembert’s constant literary characteristics, and, though inferior
                    to <hi rend="italic">Les Moines cΓOccident</hi> in research and labour, is
                    perhaps superior to it as a work of art. The famous speech by which Montalembert
                    is best known, —“Nous sommes les fils des croisés et jamais nous ne reculerons
                    devant les fils de Voltaire ”, expresses, or at least indicates, his attitude
                    not insufficiently. He was an ardent student of the Middle Ages, but his
                    mediaeval enthusiasm was strongly tinctured with religious sentiment, and at the
                    same time by no means connected with any affection for despotism. Montalembert
                    still clung to his early liberalism, and he made himself conspicuous during the
                    reign of Louis Philippe by his protests against the restrictions imposed on the
                    liberty of the press, besides struggling for freedom in national education. The
                    party which he represented, or rather which he strove to found, was by no means
                    wholly Legitimist at heart, and at the downfall of Louis Philippe Montalembert
                    had no difficulty in accepting the republic and taking, when elected, a seat in
                    the assembly. He had not a little to do with the support given by France to the
                    pope. As he had accepted the republic, he was not disinclined to accept the
                    empire; but the measures which <pb break="no"

                    disgusted him, though he still sat in the chamber. A defeat in 1857 put an end
                    to his parliamentary appearances. He was still, however, recognized as one of
                    the most formidable of the moderate opponents of the empire, and he was
                    repeatedly prosecuted for anti-imperialist letters and pamphlets. In the ten
                    years between 1840 and 1850 he had written little but political pamphlets, but
                    after the establishment of the •empire, and especially after he lost his seat in
                    the chamber, he became more prominent as an author. Even before this he had
                    produced a volume on the <hi rend="italic">Avenir Politique de Γ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Angleterre</hi> (1855), and another on <hi rend="italic">Pie

                    besides numerous articles and pamphlets, the chief of which were perhaps <hi

                    It is planned on too large a scale, and executed with too much regard to
                    profusion of picturesque detail and abundance of fluent argument on points which
                    the writer has at heart. Its best passages are inferior to the best of a younger

                <p>Montalembert, who had married Mademoiselle de Merode, sister of one of Pius IX.’s
                    ministers, but who had no male offspring, died in March 1870, the year so fatal
                    to France. His health had long been very bad, and was understood to have
                    suffered from the chagrins attending his exclusion from political life and the
                    defeat of most of his plans. Since his death his works have appeared in a
                    complete edition. They have, regarded from the literary point of view, many of
                    the faults of their time. A voluminous and vigorous writer, Montalembert was
                    more of a journalist, a pamphleteer, and an orator than of a man of letters
                    properly so called. His talents were diffused rather than concentrated, and they
                    were much occupied on merely ephemeral topics. But of picturesque eloquence in a
                    fluent and rather facile kind he was no inconsiderable representative.</p>
