                <p>The subject of this article will be—(1) the nature of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Midrash</hi> in the sense of <hi rend="italic">Agadah,</hi> to the exclusion of
                    <hi rend="italic">Halakhah</hi> (for which see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mishnah),</hi> and (2) the development of this <hi rend="italic">Midrash
                    Agadah</hi> into books <hi rend="italic">(Midrashim).</hi></p>
                <p>The thinking reader of the Scriptures cannot have failed to observe that by the
                    side of their ceremonial element, be it negative or affirmative, permissive or
                    jussive, there is also often to be met with (and sometimes so as to be
                    inseparable from it) a spiritual element. This spiritual element rests chiefly
                    on feeling or emotion, and produces pious works only indirectly. Now the
                    explanation or application of this element, either by the Scriptures themselves
                    or by the rabbis, is traditionally called <hi rend="italic">Midrash
                    Haggadah</hi> (recitation, preaching) or <hi rend="italic">Midrash
                    Agadah</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Those who
                    identify this word as merely the Chaldaic form of the Hebrew <hi rend="italic"
                    >Haggadah</hi> (and they have, certainly, some authority on their side) ought to
                    write it <hi rend="italic">Aggadah</hi> (ΠB∣N), which, however, is not the
                    traditional spelling of it (ΓΠJK). Singularly enough, the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">religio</hi> is similarly derived by some from <hi rend="italic"
                    >religare</hi> and by others from <hi rend="italic">religere.</hi></p></note>
                    (binding the soul to God and all that is godly).</p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">Haggadah</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Agadah</hi> varies
                    considerably both in nature and form. In its nature it sometimes humours, at
                    other times threatens; it alternately promises and admonishes, persuades and
                    rebukes, encourages and deters. In the end it always consoles, and throughout it
                    instructs and elevates. In form it is legendary, historical, exegetic, didactic,
                    theosophic, epigrammatic; but throughout it is ethical.</p>
                <p>And varied as was and is the <hi rend="italic">Midrash Agadah,</hi> so varied
                    have been its fortunes. Whilst at times it stood very high in the estimation

                    This statement alone would suffice to prove that R. Mosheh of Leon could never

                    He try him? By the feeding of sheep. David He tried by sheep and found him a
                    good shepherd, for it says(Ps. lxxviii. 70), “And He took him from the <hi

                    (Gen. viii. 2), “And the rain was restrained.” David restrained the big sheep in
                    favour of the small ones. He brought out first the young ones, so that they
                    should feed on the tender herbs; then he brought out the old ones that they
                    should feed on the less tender herbs; and, finally, he brought out the strong
                    sheep that they should feed on the coarser herbs. Upon this the Holy One
                    (blessed be He!) said, He who understandeth to feed sheep according to their
                    strength, let him come and feed My people! And this it is what is written (Ps.
                    lxxviii. 71), “From following the ewes great with young He brought him to feed
                    Jacob His people!” And the same was the case as regards Moses, whom the Holy One
                    (blessed be He !) tried by sheep. Our rabbis say, When Moses our teacher (peace
                    be upon him!) was feeding the sheep of Jethro in the wilderness, a kid ran away
                    from him, and Moses ran after it till they came to a mountain-hollow. When it
                    had reached the mountain-hollow there was a pool of water, and the kid stood
                    still in order to drink. When Moses reached the kid he said to it, I did not
                    know that thou didst run away from me because thou wast thirsty and faint.
                    Thereupon he put it on his shoulders and walked back with it to the flock.<note
