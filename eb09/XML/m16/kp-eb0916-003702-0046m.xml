                    September 28, 1803, and died at Cannes on the 23d of the same month sixty-sêven
                    years later, having lived just long enough to know that ruin was threatening
                    France. Not many details have been published in reference to his family, but his
                    father seems to have been a man of position and competence. Mérimée had English
                    blood in his veins on the mother’s side, and was always considered, at least in
                    France, to look and behave more like an Englishman than a Frenchman. He was
                    educated for the bar, but entered the public service instead. A young man at the
                    time of the romantic movement, he felt its influence strongly, though his
                    peculiar temperament prevented him from joining any of the côteries of the
                    period. This temperament was indeed exhibited by the very form and nature of the
                    works in which he showed the influence of romanticism. Nothing was more
                    prominent among the romantics than the fancy, as Mérimée himself puts it, for
                    “local colour,” the more unfamiliar the better. Mérimée exhibited this in an
                    unusual way. In 1825 he published what purported to be the dramatic works of a
                    Spanish lady, Clara Gazul, with a preface stating circumstantially how the
                    supposed translator, one Joseph I.’Estrange, had met the gifted poetess at
                    Gibraltar. This was followed by a still more audacious and still more successful
                    <hi rend="italic">supercherie.</hi> In 1827 appeared a small book entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">La Guda</hi> (the anagram of Gazul), and giving itself out as
                    translated from the Illyrian of a certain Hyacinthe Maglanovich. This book,
                    which has greater formal merit than <hi rend="italic">Clara Gazul,</hi> is said
                    to have taken in Sir John Bowring, a competent Slav scholar, the Russian poet
                    Poushkin, and some German authorities, although not only had it no original,
                    but, as Mérimée declares, a few words of Illyrian and a book or two of travels
                    and topography were the author’s only materials. In the next year appeared a
                    short dramatic romance, <hi rend="italic">La Jacquerie,</hi> in which all
                    Mérimée’s characteristics are visible—his extraordinary faculty of local and
                    historical colour, his command of language, his grim irony, and a certain
                    predilection for tragic and terrible subjects which was one of his numerous
                    points of contact with the men of the Renaissance. This in its turn was followed
                    by a still better piece, the <hi rend="italic">Chronique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Charles IX.,</hi> which stands towards the 16th century much as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jacquerie</hi> does towards the Middle Ages. All these works were
                    to a certain extent second-hand, being either directly imitated or prompted by a
                    course of reading on a particular subject. But they exhibited all the future
                    literary qualities of the author save the two chiefest, his wonderfully severe
                    and almost classical style, and his equally classical solidity and
                    statuesqueness of construction. For the latter there was not much opportunity in
                    their subjects, and the former required a certain maturity and self-discipline
                    which</p>
                <p>Mérimée had not yet given to himself. These were, however, displayed fully in the
                    famous Corsican story of <hi rend="italic">Colomba,</hi> published in the
                    momentous year 1830. This, all things considered, is perhaps Mérimée’s best
                    tale.</p>
                <p>He had already obtained a considerable position in the civil service, and after
                    the revolution of July he was <hi rend="italic">chef de cabinet</hi> to two
                    different ministers. He was then appointed to the more congenial post of
                    inspector of historical monuments. Mérimée was a born archaeologist, combining
                    linguistic faculty of a very unusual kind with the accurate scholarship which
                    does not always accompany it, with remarkable historical appreciation, and with
                    a sincere love for the arts of design and construction, in the former of which
                    he had some practical skill. In his official capacity he published numerous
                    reports, some of which, with other similar pieces, have been republished in his
                    works. He also devoted himself to history proper during the latter years of the
                    July monarchy, and published numerous essays and works of no great length,
                    chiefly on Spanish, Russian, and ancient Roman history. He did not, however,
                    neglect novel writing during this period, and numerous short tales, almost
                    without exception masterpieces, appeared, chiefly in the <hi rend="italic">Revue
                    de Paris.</hi> He travelled a good deal, both for his own amusement and on
                    official errands; and in one of his journeys to Spain, about the middle of Louis
                    Philippe’s reign, he made an acquaintance destined to influence his future life
                    not a little—that of Madame de Montijo, mother of the future empress Eugenie.
                    Mérimée, though in manner and language the most cynical of men, was a devoted
                    friend, and shortly before the accession of Napoleon III. he had occasion to
                    show this. His friend Libri was accused of having stolen valuable manuscripts
                    and books from French libraries, and Mérimée took his part so warmly that he was
                    actually sentenced to and und*erwent fine and imprisonment. He had been elected
                    of the Academy in 1844, and also of the Academy of Inscriptions, of which he was
                    a prominent member. Between 1840 and 1850 he wrote more tales, the chief of
                    which were <hi rend="italic">Arsène</hi><hi rend="italic">Guillot</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Carmen.</hi></p>
                <p>The empire made a considerable difference in Mérimée’s life. He was not a very
                    ardent politician, but all his sympathies were against democracy, and he had
                    therefore no reason to object to the Bonapartist rule, especially as his
                    habitual cynicism and his irreligious prejudices made legitimism distasteful to
                    him. But the marriage of Napoleon III. with the daughter of Madame de Montijo at
                    once enlisted what was always the strongest of Mérimée’s sympathies—the sympathy
                    of personal friendship—on the emperor’s side. He was made a senator, and
                    continued to exercise his archaeological functions; but his most important rôle
                    was that of a constant and valued private friend of both the “master and
                    mistress of the house,” as he calls the emperor and empress in his letters. He
                    was occasionally charged with a kind of irregular diplomacy, and once, in the
                    matter of the emperor’s <hi rend="italic">Caesar,</hi> he had to pay the penalty
                    frequently exacted from great men of letters by their political or social
                    superiors who are ambitious of literary reputation. But for the most part he was
                    strictly the “ami de la maison.” At the Tuileries, at Compiègne, at Biarritz, he
                    was a constant though not always a very willing guest, and his influence over
                    the empress was very considerable and was fearlessly exerted, though he used to
                    call himself, in imitation of Scarron, “le bouffon de sa majesté.” His
                    occupations during the last twenty years of his life were numerous and
                    important, though rather nondescript. He found, however, time for not a few more
                    tales, of which more will be said presently, and for two correspondences, which
                    are not the least of his literary achievements, while they have an extraordinary
                    interest of matter. One of these consists <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n47/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0047-0038"/> of the letters which have been published as <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres à une Inconnue,</hi> the other of the letters addressed to
                    Sir Antonio Panizzi, the late librarian of the British Museum. Various, though
                    idle and rather impertinent, conjectures have been made as to the identity of
                    the <hi rend="italic">inconnue</hi> just mentioned. It is sufficient to say that
                    the acquaintance extended over many years, that it partook at one time of the
                    character of love, at another of that of simple friendship, and that Mérimée is
                    exhibited under the most surprisingly diverse lights, most of them more or less
                    amiable, and all interesting. The correspondence with Panizzi has somewhat less
                    personal interest. Mérimée made the acquaintance originally by a suggestion that
                    his correspondent should buy for the Museum some MSS. which were in the
                    possession of Stendhal’s sister, and for some years it was chiefly confined to
                    correspondence. But Mérimée often visited England, where he had many friends
                    (among whom the late Mr Ellice of Glengarry was the chief), and certain
                    similarities of taste drew him closer to Panizzi personally, while during part
                    of the empire the two served as the channel for a kind of unofficial diplomacy
                    between the emperor and certain English statesmen. These letters are full of
                    shrewd <hi rend="italic">aperçus</hi> on the state of Europe at different times.
                    Both series abound in gossip, in amusing anecdotes, in sharp literary criticism,
                    while both contain evidences of a cynical and Rabelaisian or Swiftian humour
                    which was very strong in Mérimée. This characteristic is said to be so prominent
                    in a correspondence with another friend, which now lies in the library at
                    Avignon, that there is but little chance of its ever being printed. A fourth
                    collection of letters, of much inferior extent and interest, has been printed by
                    Μ. Blaze de Bury under the title of <hi rend="italic">Lettres à une</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">autre</hi><hi rend="italic">Inconnue.</hi> In the latter years of
                    his life Mérimée suffered very much from ill health. It was necessary for him to
                    pass all his winters at Cannes, where his constant companions were two aged
                    English ladies, friends of his mother. The terrible year found him completely
                    broken in health, and anticipating the worst for France. He lived long enough to
                    see his fears realized, and to express his grief in some last letters, and he
                    died on September 23, 1870.</p>
                <p>Mérimée’s character (which has been unwarrantably slandered by those to whom
                    political differences or his sarcastic intolerance of “pose” in literature made
                    him obnoxious) was a peculiar and in some respects an unfortunate one, but by no
                    means unintelligible, and perhaps in a minor degree not uncommon. Partly by
                    temperament, partly it is said owing to some childish experience, when he
                    discovered that he had been duped and determined never to be so again, not least
                    owing to the example of Beyle, who was a friend of his family, and of whom he
                    saw much, Mérimée appears at a comparatively early age to have imposed upon
                    himself as a duty the maintenance of an attitude of sceptical indifference and
                    sarcastic criticism. He certainly succeeded. Although, as has been said, a man
                    of singularly warm and affectionate feelings, he obtained the credit of being a
                    cold-hearted cynic; and, although he was both independent and disinterested, he
                    was abused as a hanger-on and toad-eater of the imperial court. Both imputations
                    were wholly undeserved, and indeed were prompted to a great extent by the
                    resentment felt by his literary equals on the other side at the cool ridicule
                    with which he met them. But he deserved in some of the bad as well as many of
                    the good senses of the term the phrase which we have applied to him of a man of
                    the Renaissance. He had the warm partisanship and amiability towards friends and
                    the scorpionlike sting for his foes, he had the ardent delight in learning and
                    especially in matters of art and belles lettres, he had the scepticism, the
                    voluptuousness, the curious delight in the contemplation of the horrible, which
                    marked the men of letters of the humanist period. Like them he was a man of the
                    world, and a man who without any baseness liked a king’s palace better than a
                    philosopher’s hovel. Like them he had an acute judgment in matters of business,
                    and like them a singular consciousness of the nothingness of things. Even his
                    literary work has this Renaissance character. It is tolerably extensive,
                    amounting to some seventeen or eighteen volumes, but its bulk is not great for a
                    life which was not short, and which was occupied at least nominally in little
                    else. About a third of it consists of the letters already mentioned, which will
                    always be to those who delight in personal literature the most attractive part,
                    and which, though in a fragmentary fashion, are really important as throwing
                    side lights on history. Rather more than another third consists of the official
                    work which has been already alluded to— reports, essays, short historical
                    sketches, the chief of which latter is a history of Pedro the Cruel, and another
                    of the curious pretender known in Russian story as the false Demetrius. Some of
                    the literary essays, such as those on Beyle, on Turguenief, &amp;c., where a
                    personal element enters, are excellent. Against others and against the larger
                    historical sketches—admirable as they are—Μ. Taine’s criticism that they want
                    life has some force. They are, however, all marked by Mérimée’s admirable style,
                    by his sound and accurate scholarship, his strong intellectual grasp of whatever
                    he handled, his cool unprejudiced views, his marvellous faculty of designing and
                    proportioning the treatment of his work. It is, however, in the remaining third
                    of his work, consisting entirely of tales either in narrative or in dramatic
                    form, and especially in the former, that his full power is perceived. He
                    translated a certain number of things (chiefly from the Russian); but his fame
                    does not rest on these, on his already-mentioned youthful supercheries, or on
                    his later semi-dramatic works. There remain about a score of tales extending in
                    point of composition over exactly forty years, and in length from that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Colomba,</hi> the longest, which fills about one hundred and fifty
                    pages, to that of <hi rend="italic">I.'Enlèvement de la Redoute,</hi> which
                    fills just half a dozen. They are unquestionably the best things of their kind
                    written during the century, the only <hi rend="italic">nouvelles</hi> that can
                    challenge comparison with them being the very best of Gautier, and one or two of
                    Balzac. The motives are sufficiently different. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colomba</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mateo Falcone,</hi> the Corsican point of
                    honour is drawn on; in <hi rend="italic">Carmen</hi> (written apparently after
                    reading Borrow’s Spanish books), the gipsy character; in <hi rend="italic">La
                    Vénus</hi><hi rend="italic">d'llle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lokis</hi> (two of
                    the finest of all), certain grisly superstitions, in the former case that known
                    in a milder form as the ring given to Venus, in the latter a variety of the
                    were-wolf fancy. <hi rend="italic">Arsène</hi><hi rend="italic">Guillot</hi> is
                    a singular satire full of sarcastic pathos on popular morality and religion; <hi
                    rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Chambre Bleue,</hi> an 18th-century <hi
                    rend="italic">conte,</hi> worthy of Crébillon for grace and wit, and superior to
                    him in delicacy; <hi rend="italic">The Capture of the Redoubt</hi> just
                    mentioned is a perfect piece of description; <hi rend="italic">I.'Abbé</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aubain</hi> is again satirical; <hi rend="italic">La
                    Double</hi><hi rend="italic">Méprise</hi> (the authorship of which was objected
                    to Mérimée when he was elected of the Academy) is an exercise in analysis
                    strongly impregnated with the spirit of Stendhal, but better written than
                    anything of that writer’s. These stories, with his letters, assure Mérimée’s
                    place in literature at the very head of the French prose writers of the century.
                    He had undertaken an edition of Brantôme for the Bibliothèque Elzévirienne, but
                    it was never completed.</p>
                <p>Mérimée’s works have only been gradually published since his death. The latest,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Letters to Panizzi,</hi> wnich have also appeared in
                    English, bears date 1881. There is as yet no uniform or handsome edition, but
                    almost everything is obtainable in the collections of MM. Charpentier and
                    Calmann Lévy. (G. SA.)</p>
