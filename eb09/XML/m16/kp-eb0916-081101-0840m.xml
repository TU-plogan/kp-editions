                <p><label type="entry">MORAVIAN BRETHREN, <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi></label>, are
                    a society of Christians whose history can be traced back to the year 1457 and
                    their origin found among the religious movements in Bohemia which followed the
                    martyrdom of John Huss by the council of Constance. The beginnings of the
                    Bohemian Brethren (for that was their earlier name) are somewhat obscure. The
                    followers of Huss broke up into two factions, one of which, the Calixtines, was
                    willing to acknowledge allegiance to Rome, provided the “compacts” of the
                    council of Basel permitting the Lord’s Supper <hi rend="italic">sub utraque
                    specie</hi> were maintained, and in the end it became the national church of
                    Bohemia; the other, the Taborites, refused all terms of reconciliation, and
                    appealed to arms. Separate from both these were many pious people who were
                    content to worship God in simple fashion, in quiet meetings for prayer and
                    Scripture-reading, like the <hi rend="italic">Gottesfreunde</hi> of Germany, and
                    who called themselves <hi rend="italic">Brethren.</hi> Bohemian historians have
                    conclusively shown that the Brethren represent the religious kernel of the
                    Hussite movement, and do not come either from the German Waldenses or from the
                    Taborites. Before 1457 many of these quiet Christians were known as the Brethren
                    of Chelcic, and were the followers of Peter Chelcicky, a Bohemian, whose
                    religious influence, strongly Puritan in its character, seems to have been
                    inferior only to that of Huss. In that year the Calixtine leader, Rokyzana,
                    wishing to protect them, permitted his nephew Gregory to gather them together at
                    Kunewald near Senftenberg, and form them into a community. This meeting was
                    really the foundation of the Brethren or <hi rend="italic">Unitas Fratrum,</hi>
                    and its founder Gregory announced that he and his companions received and taught
                    the rejection of oaths, of the military profession, of all official rank,
                    titles, and endowments, and of a hierarchy. They did not profess communism, but
                    they held that the rich should give of their riches to the poor, and that all
                    Christians should live as nearly as possible in the fashion of the apostolic
                    community at Jerusalem. At the synod of Lhota near Reichenau, in 1467, they
                    constituted themselves into a church separate from the Calixtine or national
                    church of Bohemia. They appointed ministers of their own election and with the
                    guidance of the “lot,” and had an organization and discipline of their own; at
                    their head was a bishop, who, it is said, received ordination from the Austrian
                    Waldenses, but apostolic succession among the Brethren is one of the most
                    obscure parts of their history.</p>
                <p>The constitution of the society was revised at a second synod held at Lhota under
                    the direction of Luke of Prague, who may be regarded as their second founder.
                    This reorganization<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n841/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0841-0812"/> enabled the society to grow rapidly. In the
                    earlier years of the 16th century the <hi rend="italic">Unitas</hi> included
                    nearly 400 congregations in Bohemia and Moravia with 150,000 members, and,
                    including Poland, embraced three provinces —Bohemia, Moravia, Poland. Each
                    province had its own bishops and synods, but all were united in one church and
                    governed by the general synod.</p>
                <p>The Lutheran movement in Germany awakened lively interest among the Brethren, and
                    some unsuccessful attempts were made under the leadership of Augusta to unite
                    with the Lutheran Church (1528-1546); but when the Calvinist reformation reached
                    Bohemia the Brethren found themselves more in sympathy with it than with the
                    Lutheran. The Jesuit anti-Reformation, instigated by Rudolf and his brothers
                    Matthias and Ferdinand, found the Brethren a prosperous church, but the pitiless
                    persecution which followed the unsuccessful attempt at revolution crushed the
                    whole Protestantism of Bohemia, and in 1627 the Evangelical churches there had
                    ceased to exist. About the same time the Polish branch of the Unity, in which
                    many refugees from Bohemia and Moravia had found a home, was absorbed in the
                    Reformed Church of Poland. A few families, however, especially in Moravia, held
                    religious services in secret, preserved the traditions of their fathers, and, in
                    spite of the vigilance of their enemies, maintained some correspondence with
                    each other. In 1722 some of these left home and property to seek a place where
                    they could worship in freedom. The first company, led by Christian David, a
                    mechanic, settled by invitation from Count Zinzendorf on his estate at
                    Berthelsdorf near Zittau, in Saxony. They were soon joined by others (about 300
                    coming within seven years), and built a town which they called Herrnhut. The
                    small community at first adopted the constitution and teaching of the old <hi
                    rend="italic">Unitas.</hi> The episcopate had been continued, and in 1735 David
                    Nitschmann was consecrated first bishop of the Renewed Moravian Church. The new
                    settlement was not, however, ’destined to be simply a revival of the
                    organization of the Bohemian Brethren. Zinzendorf, who had given them an asylum,
                    came with his wife, family, and chaplain to live among the refugees. He was a
                    Lutheran who had accepted Spener’s pietism, and he wished to form a society
                    distinct from national churches and devoted to good works. After long
                    negotiation a union was effected between the Lutheran element and the adherents
                    of the ancient <hi rend="italic">Unitas Fratrum.</hi> The emigrants at Herrnhut
                    attended the parish church at Berthelsdorf, and were simply a Christian society
                    within the Lutheran Church (ecclesiola in ecclesia). This peculiarity is still
                    to some extent preserved in the German branch of the church, and the Moravian
                    Brethren regard themselves as a church within the church, or the Brethren’s
                    Congregation within the Evangelical Protestant churches, which enables them to
                    do evangelistic work without proselytizing. The society adopted a code of rules
                    in 1727, and ordained twelve elders to carry on pastoral work. This was the
                    revival of the <hi rend="italic">Unitas Fratrum</hi> as a church.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Constitution.—</hi> The Unity of Moravian Brethren at present
                    embraces three provinces—German, English, and American. Each province has its
                    own government by synod and provincial elders’ conferences; but it forms with
                    the other two one organic whole, and is therefore under the control of a general
                    government also. The general synod, which governs the whole church, meets every
                    ten years at Herrnhut, and is attended by delegates from all the provinces and
                    from the missions. The elders’ conference of the Unity is an executive board,
                    which superintends all the provinces and the missions. The present constitution
                    dates from 1857, when the old organization of the <hi rend="italic">Unitas
                    Fratrum</hi> was remodelled.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ministers and Worship.—</hi> The ministers are bishops,
                    presbyters, and deacons. The bishops alone can ordain, but they are not
                    diocesan. They are appointed by the general synod, or by the elders’ conference
                    of the Unity, and have official seats both in the synods of the provinces where
                    they preside, and in the general synod. Unordained assistants in the ministry,
                    whether men or women, are formally set apart as acolytes. The worship is lituι -
                    gical. Special services are used on the festivals of the ecclesiastical year, on
                    the “Memorial Days” 1st March, 12th May, 17th and 25th June, 6th July, 13th and
                    21st August, 16th September, 31st October, and 13th November. Love-feasts are
                    still held, but the feet-washing and the use of the lot in the election of
                    ministers and in marriages have fallen into disuse. The use of the lot in
                    marriages was abolished in 1818.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Doctrine.—</hi> The Moravian Church has no formal creed, but
                    its doctrine, as found in the catechism, in the Easter morning litany, and in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Synodal Results,</hi> embraces the following points
                    (settled by the synod of 1879) :—(1) that Scripture is the only rule of faith
                    and practice, (2) the total depravity of human nature, (3) the love of God the
                    Father, (4) the real Godhead and the real humanity of Jesus Christ, (5) our
                    reconciliation unto God, and our justification before Him, through the sacrifice
                    of Jesus Christ, (6) the doctrine of the Holy Ghost and the operations of His
                    grace, (7) good works as the fruit of the Spirit, (8) the fellowship of
                    believers one with another in Christ Jesus, (9) the second coming of the Lord in
                    glory, and the resurrection of the dead unto life or unto condemnation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Work.—</hi> (a) <hi rend="italic">Home Work in the Three
                    Provinces.—</hi> This embraces two divisions. (1) Besides congregational work,
                    special home missions are carried on in each province. In the German province
                    there is a peculiar home mission called the <hi rend="italic">Diaspora,</hi>
                    which dates from 1729. Its object is unsectarian. It seeks to excite and foster
                    spiritual life by means additional to those provided by the established
                    churches, and does not make proselytes nor strive to draw members from other
                    Protestant churches. The work is carried on in Denmark, in Norway and Sweden, in
                    the various parts of Germany, in the Baltic provinces of Russia, in Poland, and
                    in Switzerland. In the English province home mission work is conducted on the
                    principle of establishing preaching-stations in populous places, which may
                    ultimately become congregations connected with the church. There is also a
                    society for propagating the gospel in Ireland. The work in the American province
                    is of the same kind. (2) The Brethren have always paid special attention to
                    education. Each province has a theological college, and there are in the three
                    provinces forty-seven boarding-schools for boys and girls not connected with the
                    Moravian Church. At these schools nearly 2500 pupils are educated.</p>
                <p>(δ) <hi rend="italic">Foreign Missions.—</hi> The Moravian Church since its
                    reorganization by Zinzendorf has been the missionary church <hi rend="italic"
                    >par excellence.</hi> The third jubilee of missions was celebrated in 1882. The
                    first period began with 1732, when two men, Leonard Dover and David Nitschmann,
                    -were sent to preach to the negroes of St Thomas; when it ended in 1782, the
                    church had 167 brethren and sisters occupying 27 stations. In 1832 the church
                    had to record 40,000 converts under the direction of 209 missionaries at 41
                    stations. The latest statistics show 115 stations with 317 additional
                    preaching-places, 7 normal schools with 70 scholars, 215 day schools with 15,616
                    pupils, 215 teachers, and 634 monitors, 94 Sunday schools with 13,355 pupils and
                    884 teachers, 312 missionaries (male and female), 1471 native assistants, and
                    76,646 converts.</p>
                <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">The Bohemian Mission.—</hi> The Brethren early made
                    missionary circuits from Herrnhut and Silesia through Bohemia and Moravia, and
                    since 1862 this itinerating work was largely increased. In 1869 it was resolved
                    to re-establish the church in these countries of its birth, and the first
                    congregation was inaugurated in October 1870. It now contains four
                    congregations, and in 1880 obtained legal sanction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">{d) The Leper Mission</hi> was begun in 1822 in South Africa,
                    and carried on there till 1867, when the English Government appointed a chaplain
                    to do the work. The Leper Home in Jerusalem was established in 1867, and
                    formally taken over by the elders’ conference of the Unity in 1881.</p>
