                    (1391-14721), was a Florentine by birth, the son of a tailor, and in early life
                    a pupil of Donatello. He was a sculptor of some ability in marble, bronze, and
                    silver. The statue of the young St John over the door of the Duomo at Florence,
                    opposite the Baptistery, is by him; and he also made the beautiful silver
                    statuette of the Baptist on the altar-frontal of San Giovanni. Michelozzi’s
                    great friend and patron was Cosimo I. dei Medici, whom he accompanied to Venice
                    in 1433 during his short exile. While at Venice, Michelozzi built the library of
                    San Giorgio Maggiore, and designed other buildings there. The magnificent
                    Palazzo dei Medici at Florence, built by Cosimo, was designed by him; it is one
                    of the noblest specimens of Italian 15th-century architecture, in which the
                    great taste and skill of the architect has combined the delicate lightness of
                    the earlier Italian Gothic with the massive stateliness of the Classical style.
                    With great engineering skill Michelozzi shored up, and partly rebuilt, the
                    Palazzo Vecchio, then in a ruinous condition, and added to it many important
                    rooms and staircases. When, in 1437, through Cosimo’s liberality, the monastery
                    of San Marco at Florence was handed over to the Dominicans of Fiesole,
                    Michelozzi was employed to rebuild the domestic part and remodel the church. For
                    Cosimo I. he designed numerous other buildings, mostly of great beauty and
                    importance. Among these were a guest-house at Jerusalem, for the use of
                    Florentine pilgrims, Cosimo’s summer villa at Careggi, and the strongly
                    fortified palace of Cafagiuolo in Mugello. For Giovanni dei Medici, Cosimo’s
                    son, he built a very large and magnificent palace at Fiesole. In spite of
                    Vasari’s statement that he died at the age of sixty-eight, he appears to have
                    lived till 1472. He is buried in the monastery of San Marco, Florence. Though
                    skilled both as a sculptor and engineer, his fame chiefly rests on his
                    architectural works, which claim for him a position of very high honour even
                    among the greatest names of the great 15th-century Florentines.</p>
