                    the sea and a range of sharp and rugged hills, called the Dinnamare, 3707 feet
                    at their highest point. It runs in a semicircle round the harbour, and presents
                    a picturesque appearance from the sea, as the houses rise in tiers upon the
                    slope of a hill, and behind are the wooded mountains.</p>
                <p>Messina is the second town of Sicily in importance and in size. Its population
                    was 97,074 in 1850,111,854 in 1871, and 126,497 in 1881. It is an archiépiscopal
                    see, and has a university, founded by the Jesuits in 1548, with a public library
                    of 56,000 volumes.</p>
                <p>The excellence of its harbour makes Messina an important trading town. The
                    harbour is formed by a tongue of low land which runs out from the shore in the
                    form of a sickle, and encloses a round basin, open to the north only, where the
                    entrance channel is about 500 yards wide. This basin is 1∣∙ miles in
                    circumference, and is of such depth that the largest vessels are able to use it.
                    It is estimated that 1300 steamers, with a total of 1,000,000 tons burthen, and
                    9000 sailing ships, with a total of 500,000 tons burthen, enter the port yearly.
                    The exports of Messina consist chiefly of oranges, lemons, raisins, wine, oil,
                    liquorice, and hides. There is no prominent manufacture; but silk stuffs are
                    made in considerable quantities. Many of the inhabitants are engaged in fishing,
                    chiefly for tunny. Sword-fish also are captured with the harpoon in the Straits
                    during July and August. Coral fishery is a trade of the people. The hills behind
                    Messina produce a strong dark wine, inferior to that which is made in other
                    parts of the island.</p>
                <p>Messina has few buildings of importance or antiquity. The sieges and earthquakes
                    from which the town has suffered destroyed most of its monuments. After the
                    great earthquake in 1783 the city was almost entirely rebuilt. The cathedral,
                    the principal building, is a church of the Norman period. It was begun in 1098
                    by Count Roger I., and finished by his son Roger II. The church is in the form
                    of a Latin cross, 305 feet long and 145 feet wide in the transepts. The lower
                    half of the façade is encrusted with slabs of red and white marble. It has three
                    Gothic portals, with pointed arches and rich ornamentation, belonging to the
                    period of the Anjou dynasty. The nave contains twenty-six columns of Egyptian
                    granite, said to have been brought from an ancient temple of Poseidon which
                    stood near the Faro. The mosaics of the apses date from the year 1330. In the
                    choir are the sarcophagi of the emperor Conrad ΓV. (d. 1254), of Alphonso the
                    Generous (d. 1458), and of Antonia, widow of Frederick III. of Aragon. In 1254
                    the cathedral was seriously damaged by fire; in 1559 the campanile was burned
                    down; in 1783 the earthquake overthrew the campanile and the transept. The
                    building therefore offers a mixture of styles,—first Norman, then Gothic, then
                    Early Renaissance, finally Barocco and Modern Gothic.</p>
                <p>The history of Messina begins very early. It is said to have been founded, on the
                    site of a more ancient Sicilian town, by pirates from Cumae, in 732 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It took its earlier name of Zancle (a sickle)
                    from the shape of its harbour. The number of its inhabitants was increased by an
                    influx of Chalcidians under Crataemenes; and in 649 B.c. the town was
                    sufficiently prosperous and populous to establish a colony at Himera. The
                    Samians occupied Zancle for a short time after Miletus had been captured by the
                    Persians in 494 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In the following year the city
                    fell into the hands of Anaxilas, tyrant of Rhegium, who introduced a population
                    of Messenians, from Messenia in the Peloponnesus; and they changed the name of
                    the place to Messana, in the Doric pronunciation, to remind them of their
                    fatherland. The sons of Anaxilas were expelled from the government of Messina in
                    466 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and a republic established; and this
                    government was continued until Messina fell into the hands of the Carthaginians
                    during their wars with Dionysius the elder of Syracuse (396 B.C.). The
                    Carthaginians destroyed the city; but Dionysius recaptured and rebuilt it.
                    During the next fifty years Messina changed masters several times, till Timoleon
                    finally expelled the Carthaginians in 343 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In the
                    wars between Agathocles of Syracuse and Carthage, Messina took the side of the
                    Carthaginians. Agathocles’s mercenaries, the Mamertines, treacherously seized
                    the town in 288 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and held it. They came to war
                    with Hiero II. of Syracuse, after Agathocles’s death; and Hiero’s allies, the
                    Carthaginians, helped him to reduce Messina. The Mamertines appealed for help to
                    Rome, which was granted, and this led to a collision between Rome and Carthage,
                    which ended in the First Punic War. At the close of that war, in 241 B.C.,
                    Messina became a possession of the Romans. During the civil wars which followed
                    the death of Julius Caesar, Messina held with Sextus Pompeius; and in 35 B.c. it
                    was sacked by Octavian’s troops. After Octavian’s proclamation as emperor he
                    founded a colony here; and Messina continued to flourish as a trading port. In
                    the division of the Roman empire it belonged to the emperors of the East; and in
                    547 A.n. Belisarius collected his fleet here before crossing into Calabria. The
                    Saracens took the city in 831 A.D.; and in 1061 it was the first permanent
                    conquest made in Sicily by the Normans under Roger d’Hauteville. In 1190 Richard
                    Coeur de Lion with his crusaders passed six months in Messina. He fell out with
                    Tancred, the last of the HautevÙle dynasty, and sacked the town. In 1194 the
                    city, with the rest of Sicily, passed to the house of Hohenstaufen under the
                    emperor Henry VI., who died there in 1197. At the time of the Sicilian Vespers
                    (1282), which drove the French out of Sicily, Messina bravely defended itself
                    against Charles of Anjou, and repulsed his attack. Peter I. of Aragon, through
                    his commander Ruggiero di Loria, defeated the French off the Faro; and from 1282
                    to 1713 Messina remained a possession of the Spanish royal house. In 1571 the
                    fleet fitted out by the Holy League against the Turk assembled at Messina, and
                    in the same year its commander, Don John of Austria, celebrated a triumph in the
                    city for his victory at Lepanto. Don John’s statue stands in the Piazza dell’
                    Annuziata. For one hundred years, thanks to the favours and the concessions of
                    Charles V., Messina enjoyed great prosperity. But the internal quarrels between
                    the Merli, or aristocratic faction, and the Malvezzi, or democratic faction,
                    fomented as they were by the Spaniards, helped to ruin the city (1671—78). The
                    Messinians suspected the Spanish court of a desire to destroy the ancient
                    senatorial constitution of the city, and sent to France to ask the aid of Louis
                    XIV. in their resistance. Louis despatched a fleet into Sicilian waters, and the
                    French occupied the city. The Spaniards replied by appealing to Holland, who
                    sent a fleet under Ruyter into the Mediterranean. The French admiral, Duquesne,
                    defeated the combined fleet of Spain and Holland, but, notwithstanding this
                    victory, the French suddenly abandoned Messina in 1678, and the Spanish occupied
                    the town once more. The senate was suppressed, and Messina lost its privileges.
                    This was fatal to the importance of the city, and it never recovered. In 1743
                    the plague carried off 40,000 inhabitants. The city was partially destroyed by
                    earthquake in 1783. During the revolution of 1848 against the Bourbons of
                    Naples, Messina was bombarded for three consecutive days. In 1854 the deaths
                    from cholera numbered about 15,000. Garibaldi landed in Sicily in 1860, and
                    Messina was the last city in the island taken from the Bourbons and made a part
                    of united Italy under Victor Emmanuel.</p>
                <p>Messina was the birthplace of the following celebrated men: Dicaearchus, the
                    historian <hi rend="italic">{cir.</hi> 322 B. c. ); Aristocles, the Peripatetic;
                    Euhemerus, the rationalist <hi rend="italic">(cir.</hi> 316 B.C.); Stefano
                    Protonotario, Mazzeo di Ricco, and Tommaso di Sasso, poets of the court of
                    Frederick II. (1250 A.D.); and Antonello da Messina, the painter (1447-99), five
                    of whose works are preserved in the university gallery. During the 15th century
                    the grammarian Constantine Lascaris taught in Messina; and Bessarion was for a
                    time archimandrite there.</p>
