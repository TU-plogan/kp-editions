                <p><label type="entry">MORTGAGE</label>. The general object of mortgage is to secure
                    a money debt by making it a charge on land, so that, if the debt be not paid by
                    a time agreed upon between the parties, the creditor may sell the land and pay
                    himself out of the proceeds. In English law this is done by a conveyance of the
                    land in absolute terms to the creditor, subject only to its being defeated if
                    the debt should be paid at the time fixed—an arrangement to which the law has
                    attached peculiar incidents designed to carry out its real object. An absolute
                    conveyance, however, is by no means essential to the purposes of mortgage.</p>
                <p>The history of mortgage transactions in Roman law shows three well-marked stages.
                    In the beginning the estate was conveyed absolutely to the creditor, who made a
                    covenant <hi rend="italic">(fiducia)</hi> to reconvey it when the debt should be
                    paid. All the interest, however, in the meantime passed from the debtor to the
                    creditor, and should the latter refuse to reconvey there was no remedy to the
                    original owner except a personal action. In the second stage (that of <hi
                    rend="italic">pignus)</hi> the property did not pass to the creditor; he merely
                    received possession of the thing pledged, together with certain rights of sale,
                    &amp;c., in the event of payment not being made at the time appointed. Lastly,
                    without parting with the possession even of the pledge the debtor could create a
                    lien or charge <hi rend="italic">(hypotheca)</hi> over it in favour of the
                    creditor, who acquired thereby a right on failure of payment to follow the thing
                    by real action against the possessor, whosoever he might be, and to repay
                    himself from the proceeds of his sale.</p>
                <p>The mortgage of English law is the result of two distinct influences. Its origin
                    and form belong to the common law; the restrictions by which it is made to serve
                    the purpose of a security only, and nothing more, belong to the courts of
                    equity. In the eye of the common law the mortgagee was the owner of the estate
                    conveyed in the mortgage; inequity the mortgager remains the real owner, and the
                    mortgagee is merely an encumbrancer. A, the owner of land in freehold, conveys
                    to B and his heirs, with a proviso that on repayment of money lent by B to A, on
                    a future day, with interest until payment, B or his heirs will reconvey the
                    estate to A and his heirs, and that, until default be made in payment, A and his
                    heirs may hold without interruption from B and his heirs. This is a common
                    mortgage of land, and at law, after failure of payment, the land belonged
                    absolutely to the mortgagee, while in the meantime, before payment, the legal
                    estate was considered to be vested in him, subject only to being defeated by
                    payment at the proper time. The Court of Chancery first interfered in the reign
                    of James I. to decree a redemption after forfeiture, and a case in the reign of
                    Charles I. decides that payment after forfeiture has the same effect as payment
                    before. The right of the mortgager to redeem his estate after it has been
                    forfeited, according to the terms of the deed, is called his equity of
                    redemption. No agreement between the parties was suffered to oust the
                    jurisdiction of the court, or to deprive the debtor of his equity of redemption.
                    And this equity, at first regarded as a mere right of the debtor, became
                    established in course of time as an estate in land which descended to the heirs
                    of the mortgager. On the other hand, the interest of the mortgagee is part of
                    his personal estate, and passes to his executor and not to his heir. In spite of
                    the terms of the mortgage, the owner of the land is still the owner, and the
                    mortgagee is a creditor for the money he advanced and the interest thereon. It
                    may be a question whether a given deed is a conveyance or a mortgage, and the
                    court, in deciding, will look at all the circumstances of the case, and will
                    treat it as a mortgage when it was the real intention of the parties that it
                    should operate as a security only. Thus, if the price was grossly inadequate, if
                    the purchaser was not let into immediate possession, if he accounted for the
                    rents to the grantor, retaining an amount equivalent to interest, if the expense
                    of the deed was borne by the grantor, there would be reason to believe that the
                    conveyance was only meant to be a mortgage. And “once a mortgage, always a
                    mortgage;” no subsequent agreements can change its character.</p>
                <p>A mortgagee may, however, on default of payment file a bill of foreclosure
                    requiring the mortgager to pay the amount of the debt with interests or costs by
                    an appointed day, or submit to be deprived of his equity of redemption. The
                    effect of failure to pay by the time appointed would be to make the mortgagee
                    absolute owner of the estate; but the court in any foreclosure suit may, at the
                    request of either side, order a sale instead of a foreclosure. And a power of
                    sale is now implied as one of the incidents of the mortgage, unless forbidden or
                    varied by express destination. The mortgagee is entitled to retain out of the
                    proceeds of the sale the amount of his principal, interest, and costs, the
                    surplus belonging to the mortgager. A mortgager cannot require the creditor to
                    receive payment before the time appointed in the deed; and, on default of
                    payment at the appointed time, he must give the creditor six months’ notice of
                    his intention to pay off the mortgage, so that the creditor may have time “to
                    look out for a fresh security for his money.”</p>
                <p>When the same land is successively mortgaged to different persons, their rights
                    take priority according to their chronological order. But the operation of
                    equitable doctrines in the formation of the law of mortgage leads to an
                    important modification of this rule. Of the successive mortgagees, the first
                    only takes the legal estate, and this, according to the maxim of the Court of
                    Chancery, will turn the scale when there is an equality of equitable rights
                    between two contracting parties. Thus, if the third mortgagee had no notice at
                    the time of making his advance of the existence of the second mortgagee, the
                    equities of the two claimants are supposed to be equal, and if nothing else
                    intervened priority of time would decide the order of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n880/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0880-0849"/> their rights. But if the third mortgagee gets an
                    assignment of the first mortgage, he can <hi rend="italic">tack</hi> his third
                    mortgage to the first, and so postpone the second mortgagee. And if the first
                    mortgagee himself makes an additional advance after the date of the second
                    mortgage, but without notice of it, his whole debt will take precedence of the
                    second mortgagee. A similar result of equitable rules is seen in the
                    consolidation of securities. Two separate estates, mortgaged at different times
                    and for different sums of money by the same mortgager to the same mortgagee, are
                    regarded as consolidated, so that the whole of the land becomes security for the
                    whole of the money, and the owner cannot redeem either mortgage without
                    redeeming the other. So that, as Mr Justice Williams reasons, no person can
                    safely lend money on a second mortgage, for, in addition to the risk of a third
                    mortgagee <hi rend="italic">tacking,</hi> there is the danger that, if the
                    mortgager should have mortgaged another estate for more than its value, the
                    holder of the deficient security may buy in the first mortgage, consolidate it
                    with his own, and exclude the second mortgagee.</p>
                <p>An <hi rend="italic">equitable</hi> mortgage is constituted simply by the deposit
                    of title-deeds in security for money advanced. The enactment of the Statute of
                    Frauds that no action shall be brought on “any contract or sale of lands,”
                    &lt;fcc., or any interests in or concerning them unless the agreement be in
                    writing and signed by the party to be charged, has been cited as incompatible
                    with the recognition of equitable mortgages, but it is argued by Lord Abinger
                    that the Act was never meant to affect such a transaction. The deeds which are
                    the evidence of title could not be recovered in an action at law, and, if they
                    were claimed in equity, the court would require the claimant to do equity by
                    repaying the money borrowed on the deposit. Any subsequent legal mortgagee,
                    having notice of the deposit, will be postponed to the equitable mortgagee, and
                    when the legal mortgagee has not inquired as to the title-deeds the court will
                    impute to him such knowledge as he would have acquired if he had made
                    inquiry.</p>
                <p>As to mortgages of personal property see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pledge.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">United States.—</hi> In the United States there is great diversity
                    in the extent to which equitable principles have been formally substituted for
                    the rules of the common law in dealing with mortgages. Washburn <hi
                    rend="italic">{Law of Real Property,</hi> vol. ii.) arranges the States into
                    three “pretty well-defined classes.” In the first, the mortgage deed is held to
                    create a seizin of and an estate in the premises, with all its common law
                    incidents, to be enforced if need be by ejectment. In the second, the
                    mortgagee’s rights are limited to such as the rules of equity prescribe, and may
                    not be enforced by a suit at law. In the third, the mortgagee’s interest is not
                    deemed an <hi rend="italic">estate</hi> at all, but is here only to be enforced
                    by the sale of the premises as a means of paying the debt. In the first class
                    come Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont,
                    Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Mississippi, Minnesota; in the second, Iowa,
                    Illinois, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas; in the third,
                    California, Georgia, and New York, to which may be added Oregon. (E. R.)</p>
