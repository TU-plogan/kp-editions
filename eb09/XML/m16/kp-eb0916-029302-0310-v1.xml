                <p><label type="entry">MILDEW</label> (explained as “meal-dew” or, with more
                    probability, as “honey-dew ”) is a popular name given to various minute fungi
                    from their appearance, and from the sudden, dew-like manner of their occurrence.
                    Like many other popular names of plants, it is used to denote different species
                    which possess very small botanical affinity. The term is applied, not only to
                    species belonging to various systematic groups, but also to such as follow
                    different modes of life. The corn-mildew, the hop-mildew, and the vine-mildew
                    are, for example, parasitic upon living plants, and the mildews of damp linen
                    and of paper are saprophytes, that is, they subsist on matter which is already
                    dead. It is generally possible to draw a distinct line between parasitic and
                    saprophytic fungi; a species which attacks the living body of its host does not
                    grow on dead matter, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> This is true so far
                    as is known of perhaps all the higher fungi except <hi rend="italic"
                        >Saprolegnia</hi><hi rend="italic">ferax</hi> (Gruith.), a parasite of
                    freshwater fishes (especially of the salmon), which also grows freely on their
                    dead bodies and on those of flies, &lt;fcc. As regards mildews in general, the
                    conditions of life and growth are mainly suitable nutrition and dampness
                    accompanied by a high temperature. The life-history of the same species of
                    mildew frequently covers two or more generations, and these are often passed on
                    hosts of different kinds. In some cases again the same generation confines its
                    attack to the same kind of host, while in others the same generation grows on
                    various hosts. For information regarding fungi generally see <hi

                    disease of our grain crops and of many other grass plants is very widely
                    distributed, like its hosts, over the earth, and is by far the most important to
                    man of all mildews. Its life-history is passed in three generations —two of them
                    on the grass plants and one on the barberry. In early spring the first
                    generation is found on the dead leaves and leaf-sheaths of grass plants (in
                    which the disease has hibernated), presenting to the naked eye the appearance of
                    thin black streaks. When examined with a microscope these streaks are seen to
                    consist of a great number of minute two-celled and thick-walled teleutospores
                    (reproductive bodies), each situated at the end of a stalk (see A in fig. 2,
                    vol. ix. p. 831). These have burst through the epidermis of the plant from their
                    origin on threads among the tissues beneath. When they have been in contact with
                    excessive moisture for a few hours, each of the spore-cells germinates by
                    emitting a fine tube called a promycelium, on which there are borne small round
                    thinwalled sporidia (reproductive bodies). The sporidia are easily detached and
                    carried from place to place by the wind, and on alighting on the leaves of a
                    barberry plant <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n311/mode/1up"

                    which perforates the epidermis and thus gains access to the interior of the
                    leaf, where it branches copiously, and forms a mass of thread-like tissue called
                    mycelium. The germ-tubes of sporidia are unable to enter the leaves, &amp;c., of
                    grass plants. In from six to ten days this mycelium gives rise to flaskshaped
                    bodies called spermogonia (vol. ix. p. 831, fig. 2 B, <hi rend="italic"
                        >sp),</hi> immediately under the surface of the leaf (usually the upper
                    one), but breaking through it at the neck of the flask, out of which there
                    protrudes a bunch of hairs. Within the flasks are formed at the end of stalks
                    many exceedingly small oval bodies called spermatia, which escape through the
                    neck. The function of these bodies has not yet been definitely made out, but
                    that they bear a very striking resemblance to the male sexual organs of other
                    fungi there can be no doubt. In the same leaves and on the same mycelium there
                    arise several days later numerous basinshaped bodies containing erect stalks,
                    bearing at the apex a number of round aecidiospores (reproductive bodies) in
                    vertical series (vol. ix. p. 831, fig. 2 B, <hi rend="italic">a).</hi> These
                    constitute the second generation. On their escape they germinate by emitting a
                    tube which, if the host on which they fall be a grass plant, enters the leaf
                    through one of the stomata in the epidermis, and there by branching forms a new
                    mycelium. On this there soon appears, bursting through the epidermis, a new
                    generation consisting of round or oval uredospores produced at the end of stalks
                    (vol. ix. p. 831, fig. 2 C). The uredospores constantly reproduce this
                    generation, and in such abundance that the grain crops are extensively ravaged
                    by its attack. It is in this generation that the term mildew is popularly given
                    to the fungus. Later in autumn on the same mycelium the two-celled teleutospores
                    appear, and these after hibernating renew in spring the life-history. This very
                    remarkable cycle of generations was first traced by Professor de Bary.</p>

                        rend="italic">Castagnei,</hi> Lev., Order <hi rend="italic"

                    be found on many other plants, such as <hi rend="italic">Potentüla,

                    dandelions, plantains, &amp;c. The thread-like mycelium appears on the young
                    shoots and leaves of the hop in white spots, which gradually extend and finally
                    unite. This mycelium bears many minute, round conceptacles (perithecia) which
                    with their supporting threads are brown-coloured. Within each perithecium is
                    found a somewhat oval body termed an ascus, containing eight ascospores
                    (reproductive bodies).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vine-Mildew (Erysiphe Tuckeri,</hi> Berk., Order <hi
                        rend="italic">Erysipheae)</hi> is known only in one generation—called the
                    oidiuιn stage. Soon after the flowering of the vine the attack takes place on
                    the young leaves, from which the thin white mycelium spreads rapidly to the
                    older leaves and twigs, which it does not appear to affect so injuriously. The
                    chief damage is done to the grapes while they are in a very immature condition.
                    The mycelium which travels over the surface sends down at intervals into the
                    tissues short irregular protuberances called haustoria, which perform for it the
                    functions of roots. Above these rise from the mycelium short stalks bearing each
                    a single oval spore at the apex. The disease spreads on the same plant not only
                    by the extension of the mycelium but by the scattering and germination of the
                    spores. Here no perithecia are known.</p>

                    damp paper, and therefore is saprophytic in its mode of life. It consists at
                    first of a branching filamentous mycelium on which minute globular spores occur.
                    Finally a round brown perithecium is formed among the threads which appear as
                    radiating from it. Within the perithecium are numerous linear asci containing
                    each a row of dark elliptic ascospores.</p>
