                    four assessors”; and since 1530 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> his title has
                    been “the philosopher Mang, sage of the second degree.”</p>
                <p>The Mangs or Mäng-suns had been in the time of Confucius one of the three great
                    clans of LÛ (all descended from the marquis Hwan, 711-694 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), which he had endeavoured to curb. Their power had subsequently been
                    broken, and the branch to which Mencius belonged had settled in Tsâu, a small
                    adjacent principality, the name of which still remains in Tsâu hsien, a district
                    of Yenchâu Shan-tung. A magnificent temple to Mencius is the chief attraction of
                    the district city. The present writer visited it in 1873, and was struck by a
                    large marble statue of him in the courtyard in front. It shows much artistic
                    skill, and gives the impression of a man strong in body and mind, thoughtful and
                    fearless. His lineal representative lives in the city, and thousands of Mangs
                    are to be found in the neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>The dates of some of the principal events in Mencius’s life are fixed by a
                    combination of evidence, and his death is referred by common consent to the year
                    289 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> He had lived to a great age,—some say to his
                    eighty-fourth year, placing his birth in 372 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and
                    others to his ninetyseventh, placing it in 385. All that we are told of his
                    father is that he died in the third year of the child, who was thus left to the
                    care of his mother. She was a lady of superior character, and well discharged
                    her trust. Her virtues and dealings with her son were celebrated by a great
                    writer in the first century before our era, and for two thousand years she has
                    been the model mother of China.</p>
                <p>We have no accounts of Mencius for many years after his boyhood, and he is more
                    than forty years old when he comes before us as a public character. He must have
                    spent much time in study, investigating the questions which were rife as to the
                    fundamental principles of morals and society, and brooding over the condition of
                    the country. The history, the poetry, the institutions, and the great men of the
                    past had received his careful attention. He intimates that he had been in
                    communication with men who had been disciples of Confucius. That sage had become
                    to him the chief of mortal men, the object of his untiring admiration; and in
                    the doctrines which he had taught Mencius recognized the truth for want of an
                    appreciation of which the bonds of order all round him were being relaxed, and
                    the kingdom hastening to a general anarchy.</p>
                <p>When he first comes forth from Tsâu, he is accompanied by several eminent
                    disciples. He had probably imitated Confucius in becoming the master of a
                    school, and encouraging the resort to it of inquiring minds that he might
                    resolve their doubts and unfold to them the right methods of government. One of
                    his sayings is that it would be a greater delight to the superior man to get the
                    youth of brightest promise around him and to teach and train them than to enjoy
                    the revenues of the kingdom. His intercourse with his followers was not so
                    intimate as that of Confucius had been with the members of his selected circle;
                    and, while he maintained his dignity among them, he was not able to secure from
                    them the same homage and reverent admiration.</p>
                <p>More than a century had elapsed since the death of Confucius, and during that
                    period the feudal kingdom of Châu had been showing more and more of the signs of
                    dissolution, and portentous errors that threatened to upset all social order
                    were widely disseminated. The sentiment of loyalty to the dynasty had
                    disappeared. Several of the marquises and other feudal princes of earlier times
                    had usurped the title of king. The smaller fiefs had been absorbed by the larger
                    ones, or reduced to a state of helpless dependence on them. Tsin, after greatly
                    extending its territory, had broken up into three powerful kingdoms, each about
                    as large as England. Mencius found the nation nominally one, and with the
                    traditions of two thousand years affirming its essential unity, but actually
                    divided into seven monarchies, each seeking to subdue the others under itself.
                    The consequences were constant warfare and chronic misery.</p>
                <p>In Confucius’s time we meet with recluses who had withdrawn in disgust from the
                    world and its turmoil; but these had now given place to a class of men who came
                    forth from their retirements provided with arts of war or schemes of policy
                    which they recommended to the contending chiefs, ever ready to change their
                    allegiance as they were moved by whim or interest. Mencius was once asked about
                    two of them, “Are they not really great men? Let them be angry, and all the
                    princes are afraid. Let them live quietly, and the flames of trouble are
                    everywhere extinguished.” He looked on them as little men, and delighted to
                    proclaim his idea of the great man in such language as the following :—</p>
                <p>“To dwell in love, the wide house of the world, to stand in propriety, the
                    correct seat of the world, and to walk in righteousness, the great path of the
                    world; when he obtains his desire for office, to practise his principles for the
                    good of the people, and when that desire is disappointed, to practise them
                    alone; to be above the power of riches and honours to make dissipated, of
                    poverty and mean condition to make swerve from the right, and of power and force
                    to make bend,—these characteristics constitute the great man.”</p>
                <p>Most vivid are the pictures which Mencius gives of the condition of the people in
                    consequence of the wars of the states. “The royal ordinances were violated; the
                    multitudes<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n13/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0013-0004"/> were oppressed; the supplies of food and drink
                    flowed away like water.” It is not wonderful that, when the foundations of
                    government were thus overthrown, speculations should have arisen that threatened
                    to overthrow what he considered to be the foundations of truth and all social
                    order. “A shrill-tongued barbarian from the south,” as Mencius called him,
                    proclaimed the dissolution of ranks, and advocated a return to the primitive
                    simplicity,</p>
                <p>“When Adam delved and Eve span.”</p>
                <p>He and his followers maintained that learning was quackery, and statesmanship
                    craft and oppression, that prince and peasant should be on the same level, and
                    every man do everything for himself. Another, called Yang-chû, denied the
                    difference between virtue and vice, glory and shame. The tyrants of the past, he
                    said, were now but so many rotten bones, and the heroes and sages were no more.
                    It was the same with all at death; after that there was but so much putridity
                    and rottenness. The conclusion of the whole matter therefore was—“Let us eat and
                    drink; let us gratify the ears and eyes, get servants and maidens, beauty,
                    music, wine; when the day is insufficient, carry it on through the night. Each
                    one for himself.” Against a third heresiarch, of a very different stamp, Mencius
                    felt no less indignation. This was Mo Tι, who found the source of all the evils
                    of the time and of all time in the want of mutual love. He taught, therefore,
                    that men should love others as themselves; princes, the states of other princes
                    as much as their own; children, the parents of others as much as their own. Mo,
                    in his gropings, had got hold of a noble principle, but he did not apprehend it
                    distinctly nor set it forth with discrimination. To our philosopher the doctrine
                    appeared contrary to the Confucian orthodoxy about the five relations of
                    society; and he attacked it without mercy and with an equal confusion of
                    thought. “Yang’s principle,” he said, “is ‘ each one for himself,’ which does
                    not acknowledge the claims of the sovereign. Mo’s is ‘to love all equally,’
                    which does not acknowledge the peculiar affection due to a father. But to
                    acknowledge neither king nor father is to be in the state of a beast. The way of
                    benevolence and righteousness is stopped up.”</p>
                <p>On this seething ocean of lawlessness, wickedness, heresies, and misery Mencius
                    looked out from the quiet of his school, and his spirit was stirred within him
                    to attempt the rescue of the people from the misrule and error. It might be that
                    he would prove the instrument for this purpose. “If Heaven,” he said, “wishes
                    that the kingdom should enjoy tranquillity and good order, who is there besides
                    me to bring it about ?” He formed his plan, and proceeded to put it in
                    execution. He would go about among the different kings till he should find one
                    among them who would follow his counsels and commit to him the entire
                    administration of his government. That obtained, he did not doubt that in a few
                    years there would be a kingdom so strong and so good that all rulers would
                    acknowledge its superiority, and the people hasten from all quarters to crown
                    its sovereign as monarch of the whole of China. This plan was much the same as
                    that of Confucius had been; but, with the bolder character that belonged to him,
                    Mencius took in one respect a position from which “the master” would have
                    shrunk. The former was always loyal to Châu, and thought he could save the
                    country by a reformation; the latter saw the day of Châu was past, and the time
                    was come for a revolution. Mencius’s view was the more correct, but he was not
                    wiser than the sage in forecasting for the future. They could think only of a
                    reformed dynasty or of a changed dynasty, ruling according to the model
                    principles of a feudal constitution, which they described in glowing language.
                    They desired a repetition of the golden age in the remote past; but soon after
                    Mencius disappeared from the stage of life there came the sovereign of Ch’in,
                    and solved the question with fire and sword, introducing the despotic empire
                    which has since prevailed.</p>
                <p>An inquiry here occurs—“How, in the execution of his plan, was Mencius, a
                    scholar, without wealth or station, to find admission to the courts of lawless
                    and unprincipled kings, and acquire the influence over them which he expected ?”
                    It can only be met by our bearing in mind the position accorded from the
                    earliest times in China to men of virtue and ability. The same written character
                    denotes both scholars and officers. They are at the top of the social scale,—the
                    first of the four classes into which the population has always been divided.
                    This appreciation of learning or culture has exercised a most powerful influence
                    over the government under both conditions of its existence; and out of it grew
                    the system, which was organized and consolidated more than a thousand years ago,
                    of making literary merit the passport to official employment. The ancient
                    doctrine was that the scholar’s privilege was from Heaven as much as the
                    sovereign’s right; the modern system is a device of the despotic rule to put
                    itself in Heaven’s place, and have the making of the scholar in its own hands.
                    The feeling and conviction out of which the system grew prevailed in the time of
                    Mencius. The dynasties that had successively ruled over the kingdom had owed
                    their establishment not more to the military genius of their founders than to
                    the wisdom and organizing ability of the learned men, the statesmen, who were
                    their bosom friends and trusted counsellors. Why should not he become to one of
                    the princes of his day what Î Yin had been to Thang, and Thâi-kung Wang to King
                    Wân, and the duke of Châu to Wû and Ch’äng? But, though Mencius might be the
                    equal of any of those worthies, he knew of no prince like Thang and the others,
                    of noble aim and soul, who would welcome and adopt his lessons. In his eagerness
                    he overlooked this condition of success for his enterprise. He might meet with
                    such a ruler as he looked for, or he might reform a bad one, and make him the
                    coadjutor that he required. On the strength of these peradventures, and attended
                    by several of his disciples, Mencius went for more than twenty years from one
                    court to another, always baffled, and always ready to try again. He was received
                    with great respect by kings and princes. He would not enter into the service of
                    any of them, but he occasionally accepted honorary offices of distinction; and
                    he did not scruple to receive large gifts which enabled him to live and move
                    about as a man of wealth. In delivering his message he was as fearless and
                    outspoken as John Knox. He lectured great men, and ridiculed them. He unfolded
                    the ways of the old sage kings, and pointed out the path to universal sway; but
                    it was all in vain. He could not stir any one to honourable action. He
                    confronted heresy with strong arguments and exposed it with withering sarcasm;
                    but he could work no deliverance in the earth. The last court at which we find
                    him was that of LÛ, probably in 310 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The marquis
                    of that state had given office to Yo-chäng, one of Mencius’s disciples, and he
                    hoped that this might be the means of a favourable hearing for himself. So it
                    had nearly happened. On the suggestion of Yo-chäng the marquis had ordered his
                    carriage to be yoked, and was about to step into it, and proceed to bring
                    Mencius to his palace, when an unworthy favourite stepped in and diverted him
                    from his purpose. The disciple told his master what had occurred, reproaching
                    the favourite for his ill-timed intervention; Mencius, however, said to him, “A
                    man’s advancement or the arresting of it may seem to be effected by others, but
                    is really beyond their power. My not finding in the marquis of Lû a ruler who
                    would confide <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n14/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0014-0005"/> in me and put my lessons in practice is from
                    Heaven.” He accepted this incident as a final intimation to him of the will of
                    Heaven. He had striven long against adverse circumstances, but now he bowed in
                    submission. We lose sight of him. He withdrew from courts and the public arena.
                    We have to think of him, according to tradition, I&gt;assing the last twenty
                    years of his life in the congenial society of his disciples, discoursing to
                    them, and giving the finishing touches to the record of his conversations and
                    opinions, which were afterwards edited by them, and constitute his works.
                    Living, he may have been a failure; dead, yet speaking in them, he has been a
                    great power among the ever-multiplying millions of his countrymen. Nor will any
                    thinker of the West refer to them without interest and benefit. Mencius was not
                    so oracular, nor so self-contained, as Confucius; but his teachings have a
                    vivacity and sparkle of which we never weary, and which is all their own.</p>
                <p>We will now attempt to indicate briefly the more important principles which our
                    philosopher thought would have been effectual to regenerate his country, and
                    make an end of misery and heresy within its borders.</p>
                <p>And first as to his views on government, and the work to be done by rulers for
                    their subjects. Mencius held with Confucius— and it was a doctrine which had
                    descended to them both from the remotest antiquity—that royal government is an
                    institution of God. An ancient sovereign had said that “Heaven, having produced
                    the people, appointed for them rulers, and appointed for them teachers, λvho
                    should be assisting to God.” Our philosopher, adopting this doctrine, was led by
                    the manifest incompetency of all the rulers of his time to ask how it could be
                    known on λvhat individual the appointment of Heaven had fallen or ought to fall,
                    and he concluded that this could be ascertained only from his personal character
                    and his conduct of affairs. The people must find out the will of Heaven as to
                    who should be their ruler for themselves. There was another old saying which
                    delighted Mencius,—“Heaven sees as the people see; Heaven hears as the people
                    hear.” He taught accordingly that, while government is from God, the governors
                    are from the people;— <hi rend="italic">vox</hi><hi rend="italic">populi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vox Dei.</hi></p>
                <p>No claim then of a “divine right” should be allowed to a sovereign if he were not
                    exercising a rule for the good of the people. “The people are the most important
                    element in a nation; the altars to the spirits of the land and grain are the
                    second; the sovereign is the lightest.” Mencius was not afraid to follow this
                    utterance to its consequences. The monarch whose rule is injurious to the
                    people, and who is deaf to remonstrance and counsel, should be dethroned. In
                    such a case “killing is no murder.”</p>
                <p>But who is to remove the sovereign that thus ought to be removed <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> Mencius had three answers to this difficult question.
                    First, he would have the members of the royal house perform the task. Let them
                    disown their unworthy head, and appoint some better individual of their number
                    in his room. If they could not or would not do this, he thought, secondly, that
                    any high minister, though not allied to the royal house, might take summary
                    measures with the sovereign, assuming that he acted purely with a view to the
                    public weal. His third and grand device was what he called “the minister of
                    Heaven.” When the sovereign had become a pest instead of a blessing, he believed
                    that Heaven would raise up some one for the help of the people, some one who
                    should so conduct himself in his original subordinate position as to draw all
                    eyes and hearts to himself. Let him then raise the standard not of rebellion but
                    of righteousness, and he could not help attaining to the highest dignity.
                    Mencius hoped to find one among the rulers of his day who might be made into
                    such a minister, and he counselled one and another to adopt measures with that
                    object. It was in fact counselling rebellion, but he held that the house of Châu
                    had forfeited its title to the throne.</p>
                <p>What now were the attributes which Mencius considered necessary to constitute a
                    good government according to his ideal of it? It must be animated by a spirit of
                    benevolence, and ever pursue a policy of righteousness. Its aims must be, first,
                    to make the people well off, and next, to educate them. No one was fit to occupy
                    the throne who could be happy while any of the people were miserable, who
                    delighted in war, who could indulge in palaces and parks which the poorest did
                    not in a measure share with him. Game laws received his emphatic condemnation.
                    Taxes should be light, and all the regulations for agriculture and commerce of a
                    character to promote and encourage them. The rules which he suggested to secure
                    those objects had reference to the existing condition of his country, but they
                    are susceptible of wide application. They carry in them schemes of drainage and
                    irrigation for land, and of free trade for commerce. But it must be, he
                    contended, that a sufficient and certain livelihood be secured for all the
                    people. Without this their minds would be unsettled, and they would proceed to
                    every form of wild licence. They would break the laws, and the ruler would
                    punish them,—punish those whom his neglect of his own duties had plunged into
                    poverty, of which crime was the consequence. He would be, not their ruler, but
                    their “trapper.”</p>
                <p>Supposing the people to be made well off, Mencius taught that education should be
                    provided for them all. He gave the marquis of Thang a programme of four kinds of
                    educational institutions, which he wished him to establish in his state—in the
                    villages and the towns, for the poor as well as the rich, so that none might be
                    ignorant of their duties in the various relations of society. But after all,
                    unless the people could get food and clothing by their labour, he had not much
                    faith in the power of education to make them virtuous. Give him, however, a
                    government fulfilling the conditions that he laid down, and he was confident
                    there would soon be a people, all contented, all virtuous. And he saw nothing to
                    prevent the realization of such a government. Any ruler might become, <hi
                    rend="italic">if he would, “</hi> the minister of Heaven,” who was his ideal,
                    and the influence of his example and administration would be all-powerful. The
                    people would nock to him as their parent, and help him to do justice on the foes
                    of truth and happiness. Pulse and grain would be abundant as water and fire, and
                    the multitudes, well clothed, and well principled, would sit under the shade of
                    their mulberry trees, and hail the ruler “king by the grace of Heaven.”</p>
                <p>Secondly, as to Mencius’s views about human nature. His conviction of the
                    goodness of that encouraged him to hope for such grand results from good
                    government, and his discussion of this subject gives his principal title to a
                    place among philosophical thinkers.</p>
                <p>Opinions were much divided about it among his contemporaries. Some held that the
                    nature of man is neither good nor bad; he may be made to do good and also to do
                    evil. Others held that the nature of some men is good, and that of others bad;
                    thus it is that the best of men sometimes have bad sons, and the worst of men
                    good sons. It was also maintained that the nature of man is evil, and whatever
                    good appears in it is the result of cultivation. In opposition to all these
                    views Mencius contended that the nature of man is good. “Water,” he said, “will
                    flow indifferently to the east or west; but will it flow indifferently up or
                    down? The tendency of man’s nature to goodness is like the tendency of water to
                    flow downwards. By striking water you may make it leap over your forehead; and
                    by damming and leading it you may make it go up a hill. But such movements are
                    not according to the nature of water; it is the force applied which causes them.
                    When men do what is not good, their nature has been dealt with in this way.”</p>
                <p>Mencius had no stronger language than this,—as indeed it would be difficult to
                    find any stronger,—to declare his belief of the goodness of human nature. With
                    various, but equally felicitous, illustration he replied to his different
                    opponents. Sometimes he may seem to express himself too strongly, but an
                    attentive study of his writings shows that he is speaking of our nature in its
                    ideal, and not as it actually is,—as we may ascertain, by an analysis of it,
                    that it was intended to be, and not as it has been made to become. In fact, his
                    doctrine of human nature is hardly to be distinguished from that of Bishop
                    Butler, while the Christian prelate is left far behind so far as charm of style
                    is concerned.</p>
                <p>Our author insists on the constituents of human nature, dwelling especially on
                    the principles of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom or
                    knowledge, the last including the judgment of conscience. “These,” said he, “are
                    not infused into us from without. Men have these four principles just as they
                    have their four limbs.” But man has also instincts and appetites which seek
                    their own gratification without reference to righteousness or any other control.
                    He met this difficulty by contending that human nature is a constitution, in
                    which the higher principles are designed to rule the lower. ‘ ‘ Some
                    constituents of it are noble and some ignoble, some great and some small. The
                    great must not be injured for the small, nor the noble for the ignoble.”</p>
                <p>One of his most vigorous vindications of his doctrine is the following :—“For the
                    mouth to desire flavours, the eye colours, the ear sounds, and the four limbs
                    ease and rest belong to man’s nature. An individual’s lot may restrict him from
                    the gratification of them; and in such a case the superior man will not say, ‘
                    My nature demands that pleasure, and I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> get it.’ On
                    the other hand, there are love between father and son, righteousness between
                    ruler and minister, the rules of ceremony between host and guest, and knowledge
                    seen in recognizing the able and virtuous, and in the sage’s fulfilling the
                    heavenly course;—these are appointed (by Heaven). But they also belong to our
                    nature, and the superior man will not say, ‘ The circumstances of my lot relieve
                    me from them.’” In his preliminary dissertation to the 7th edition of this
                    encyclopaedia, Sir James Mackintosh has said that in his sermons on human nature
                    Butler “taught truths more worthy of the name of discovery than any in the same
                    department of inquiry with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n15/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0015-0006"/> which we are acquainted; if we ought not to
                    except the first steps of the Grecian philosophers towards a theory of morals.”
                    Mencius was senior to Zeno, the one of those philosophers to whom Butler has
                    most affinity, and it does not appear that he had left anything for either of
                    them to discover.</p>
                <p>When he proceeded from his ideal of human nature to account for the phenomena of
                    conduct so different from what they ought to be according to that ideal, he was
                    necessarily less successful. They puzzled him and they made him indignant and
                    angry. ‘ ‘ There is nothing good,” he said, “that a man cannot do; he only does
                    not do it.” But why does he not do it? Against the stubborn fact Mencius beats
                    his wings and shatters his weapons,—all in vain. He mentions a few ancient
                    worthies who, he conceived, had always been, or who had become, perfectly
                    virtuous. Above them all he extols Confucius, taking no notice of that sage’s
                    confession that he had not attained to conformity to his own rule of doing to
                    others as he would have them do to him. No such acknowledgment about himself
                    ever came from Mencius. Therein he was inferior to his predecessor: he had a
                    subtler faculty of thought, and a much more vivid imagination; but he did not
                    know himself nor his special subject of human nature so well.</p>
                <p>Our limits will not allow us to go into a detail of his views on other special
                    subjects. A few passages illustrative of his style and general teachings will
                    complete all that can be said of him here. His thoughts, indeed, were seldom
                    condensed like those of “the master” into aphorisms, and should be read in their
                    connexion; but we have from him many words of wisdom that have been as goads to
                    millions for more than two thousand years. For instance :—</p>
                <p>“Though a man may be wicked, yet, if he adjust his thoughts, fast, and bathe, he
                    may sacrifice to God.”</p>
                <p>“When Heaven is about to confer a great office on any man, it first exercises his
                    mind with suffering, and his sinews and bones with toil. It exposes his body to
                    hunger, subjects him to extreme poverty, and confounds his undertakings. In all
                    these ways it stimulates his mind, strengthens his nature, and supplies his
                    incompetencies.”</p>
                <p>“The great man is he who does not lose Lis child-heart.”</p>
                <p>“The sense of shame is to a man of great importance. When one is ashamed of
                    having been without shame, he will afterwards not have occasion for shame.”</p>
                <p>“To nourish the heart there is nothing better than to keep the desires few. Here
                    is a man whose desires are few; in some things he may not be able to keep his
                    heart, but they will be few. Here is a man whose desires are many; in some
                    things he may be able to keep his heart, but they will be few.”</p>
                <p>“Benevolence is the distinguishing characteristic of man. As embodied in his
                    conduct, it may be called the path of duty.”</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ There is an ordination for everything; and a man should receive submissively
                    what may be correctly ascribed thereto. He who has the correct idea of what
                    Heaven’s ordination is will not stand beneath a tottering wall. Death sustained
                    in the discharge of one’s duties may be correctly ascribed to Heaven. Death
                    under handcuffs and fetters cannot be correctly so ascribed.”</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ When one by force subdues men, they do not submit to him in heart. When he
                    subdues them by virtue, in their hearts’ core they are pleased, and sincerely
                    submit.”</p>
                <p>Two translations of the works of Mencius are within the reach of European readers
                    :—that by the late Stanislaus Julien, in Latin, Paris, 1824-29; and that forming
                    the second volume of Legge's <hi rend="italic">Chinese Classics,</hi> Hong Kong,
                    1862. The latter has been published at London (1875) without the Chinese text.
