                    (1798-1855), Polish poet, was born in 1798, near Nowogrodek, in the present
                    government of Minsk, where his father, who belonged to the schlachta or lesser
                    nobility, had a small property. The poet was educated at the university of
                    Vilna; but, becoming involved in some political troubles there, he was forced to
                    terminate his studies abruptly, and was ordered to live for a time in Russia. He
                    had already published two small volumes of miscellaneous poetry at Vilna, which
                    had been favourably received by the Slavonic public, and on his arrival at St
                    Petersburg he found himself admitted to the leading literary circles, where he
                    was a great favourite both from his agreeable manners and his extraordinary
                    talent of improvisation. In 1825 he visited the Crimea, which inspired a
                    collection of sonnets in which we may admire both the elegance of the rhythm and
                    the rich Oriental colouring. The most beautiful are <hi rend="italic">The Storm,
                    Bakchi-serai,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Grave of the Countess Potocka.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1828 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Konrad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Wallenrod,</hi> a narrative poem describing the battles of knights of the
                    Teutonic order with the heathen Lithuanians. Here, under a thin veil, Mickiewicz
                    represented the sanguinary passages of arms and burning hatred which had
                    characterized the long feuds of the Russians and Poles. The objects of the poem,
                    although evident to many, escaped the Russian censors, and it was suffered to
                    appear, although the very motto, taken from Machiavelli, was significant:
                    “Dovete adunque sapere come sono duo generazioni da combattere . . . bisogna
                    essere volpe e leone.” After a five years’ exile in Russia the poet obtained
                    leave to travel; he had secretly made up his mind never to return to that
                    country or Poland so long as it remained under the government of the Muscovites.
                    Wending his way to Weimar, he there made the acquaintance of Goethe, who
                    received him cordially, and, pursuing his journey through Germany, he entered
                    Italy by the Splügen, visited Milan, Venice, and Florence, and finally took up
                    his abode at Rome. There he wrote the third part of his poem <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dziady,</hi> the subject of which is the religious commemoration of their
                    ancestors practised among Slavonic nations, and <hi rend="italic">Pan
                    Tadeusz,</hi> his longest poem, by many considered his masterpiece. A graphic
                    picture is drawn of Lithuania on the eve of Napoleon’s expedition to Russia in
                    1812. In 1832 Mickiewicz left Rome for Paris, where his life was for some time
                    spent in poverty and unhappiness. He had married a Polish lady, Selina
                    Szymanowska, who became insane. In 1840 he was appointed to the newly founded
                    chair of Slavonic languages and literature in the Collège de France, a post
                    which he was especially qualified to fill, as he was now the chief
                    representative of Slavonic literature, Poushkin having died in 1837. He was,
                    however, only destined to hold it for a little more than three years, his last
                    lecture having been given on the 28th of May 1844. His mind had become more and
                    more disordered under the influence of religious mysticism. His lectures became
                    a medley of religion and politics, and thus brought him under the censure of the
                    Government. A selection of them has been published in four volumes. They contain
                    some good sound criticism, but the philological part is very defective, for
                    Mickiewicz was no scholar, and he is obviously only well acquainted with two of
                    the literatures, viz., Polish and Russian, the latter only till the year 1830. A
                    very sad picture of the declining days of Mickiewicz is given in the memoirs of
                    Herzen. At a comparatively early period the unfortunate poet exhibited all the
                    signs of premature old age; poverty, despair, and domestic affliction had
                    wrought their work upon him. In 1849 he founded a French newspaper, <hi
                    rend="italic">La Tribune</hi><hi rend="italic">des Peuples,</hi> but it only
                    existed a year. The restoration of the French empire seemed to kindle his hopes
                    afresh; his last composition is said to have been a Latin ode in honour of
                    Napoleon III. On the outbreak of the Crimean War he was sent to Constantinople
                    to assist in raising a regiment of Poles to take service against the Russians.
                    He died suddenly there in 1855, and his body was removed to France and buried at
                    Montmorency.</p>
                <p>Mickiewicz is held to have been the greatest Slavonic poet, with the exception of
                    Poushkin. Unfortunately in other parts of Europe he is but little known; he
                    writes in a very difficult language, and one which it is not the fashion to
                    learn. There were both pathos and irony in the expression used by a Polish lady
                    to a foreigner, “Nous avons notre Mickiewicz à nous.” He is one of the best
                    products of the so-called romantic school. The Poles had long groaned under the
                    yoke of the classicists, and the country was full of legends and picturesque
                    stories which only awaited the coming poet to put them into shape. Hence the
                    great popularity among his countrymen of his ballads, each of them being
                    connected with some national tradition. Besides <hi rend="italic">Konrad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Wallenrod</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pan Tadeusz,</hi> attention
                    may be called to the poem <hi rend="italic">Grazyna,</hi> which describes the
                    adventures of a Lithuanian chieftainess against the Teutonic knights. It is said
                    by Ostrowski to have inspired the brave Emilia Plater, who was the heroine of
                    the rebellion of 1830, and after having fought in the ranks of the insurgents,
                    found a grave in the forests of Lithuania. A fine vigorous Oriental piece is <hi
                    rend="italic">Farys.</hi> Very good too are the odes to Youth and to the
                    historian Lelewel; the former did much to stimulate the efforts of the Poles to
                    shake off their Russian conquerors. It is enough to say of Mickiewicz that he
                    has obtained the proud position of the representative poet of his country; her
                    customs, her supeimitions, her history, her struggles are reflected in his
                    works.</p>
