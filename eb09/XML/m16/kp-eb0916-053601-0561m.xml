                    the title of a group of seven longish Arabic poems, which have come down to us
                    from the time before Islam. The name signifies “the suspended” (pl.), the
                    traditional explanation being that these poems were hung up by the Arabs on or
                    in the Ka'ba at Mecca. The oldest passage known to the writer where this is
                    stated occurs in the <hi rend="italic">'Ikd</hi> of the Spanish Arab, Ibn
                    'Abd-Rabbih <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 861-940), Bûlâk ed. vol. iii. p. 116
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> We read there: “The Arabs had such an interest in
                    poetry, and valued it so highly, that they took seven long pieces selected from
                    the ancient poetry, wrote them in gold on rolls (?) of Coptic cloth, and hung
                    them up <hi rend="italic">Çallakat')</hi> on the curtains which covered the

                    testimony of a contemporary of Ibn 'Abd-Rabbih, the grammarian Nahhâs <hi
                    rend="italic">(ob.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 949), who says in his
                    commentary on the Mo'allakât: “As for the assertion that they were hung up in
                    [stc] the Ka'ba, it is not known to any of those who have handed down ancient
                    poems.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ernst Frenkel,

                    rejecting a story so utterly unauthenticated. The customs of the Arabs before
                    Mohammed are pretty accurately known to us; we have also a mass of information
                    about the affairs of Mecca at the time when the Prophet arose; but no trace of
                    this or anything like it is found in really good and ancient authorities. We
                    hear, indeed, of a Meccan hanging up a spoil of battle on the Ka'ba (Ibn Hishâm,
                    ed. Wüstenfeld, p. 431). Less credible is the story of an important document
                    being deposited in that sanctuary, for this looks like an instance of later
                    usages being transferred to pre-Islamic times. But at all events this is quite a
                    different thing from the hanging up of poetical manuscripts. To account for the
                    disappearance of the Mo'allakât from the Ka'ba we are told, in a passage of late
                    origin (De Sacy, <hi rend="italic">Clιrestom.,</hi> ii. 480), that they were
                    taken down at the capture of Mecca by the Prophet. But in that case we should
                    expect some hint of the occurrence in the circumstantial biographies of the
                    Prophet, and in the works on the history of Mecca; and we find no such thing.
                    That long poems were <hi rend="italic">written</hi> at all at that remote period
                    is improbable in the extreme. All that we know of the diffusion of Arabic
                    poetry, even up to a time when the art of writing had become far more general
                    than it was before the spread of Islam, points exclusively to <hi rend="italic"
                    >oral</hi> tradition. Moreover, it is quite inconceivable that there should have
                    been either a guild or a private individual of such acknowledged taste, or of
                    such influence, as to bring about a consensus of opinion in favour of certain
                    poems. Think of the mortal offence which the canonization of one poet must have
                    given to his rivals and their tribes! It was quite another thing for an
                    individual to give his own private estimate of the respective merits of two
                    poets who had appealed to him as umpire; or for a number of poets to appear at
                    large gatherings, such as the fair of Okâz, as candidates for the place of
                    honour in the estimation of the throng which listened to their recitations. In
                    short, this legend, so often retailed by later Arabs, and still more frequently
                    by Europeans, must be entirely rejected.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the name “suspended.” The word was taken in its literal sense; and as these
                    poems were undoubtedly prized above all others in after times, the same opinion
                    was attributed to “the [ancient] Arabs,” who were supposed to have given effect
                    to their verdict in the way already described. A somewhat simpler version, also
                    given by Nahhâs in the passage already cited, is as follows: “Most of the Arabs
                    were accustomed to meet at Okâz and recite verses; then if the king was pleased
                    with any poem, he said, ‘Hang it up, and preserve it among my treasures.’” But,
                    not to mention other difficulties, there was no king of all the Arabs; and it is
                    hardly probable that any Arabian king attended the fair at Okâz. The story that
                    the poems were written in gold has evidently originated in the name “the golden
                    poems” (literally “the gilded”), a figurative expression for excellence. We must
                    interpret the designation “suspended” on the same principle. In all probability
                    it means those (poems) which have been raised, on account of their value, to a
                    specially honourable position. Another derivative of the same root is <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">ilk,</hi> “precious
                    thing.”</p>
                <p>The selection of these seven poems can scarcely have been the work of the ancient
                    Arabs at all. It is much more likely that we owe it to some connoisseur of a
                    later date. Now Nahhâs says expressly in the same passage: “The true view of the
                    matter is this: when Hammâd arrâwiya (Hammâd the Rhapsodist) saw how little men
                    cared for poetry, he collected these seven pieces, urged people to study them,
                    and said to them: ‘ These are the [poems] of renown.’” And this agrees with all
                    our other information. Hammâd (who lived in the first three quarters of the 8th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> was perhaps of all men the one who knew
                    most Arabic poetry by heart. The recitation of poems was his profession. To such
                    a rhapsodist the task of selection is in every way appropriate; and it may be
                    assumed that he is responsible also for the somewhat fantastic title of “the
                    suspended.”</p>
                <p>The collection of Hammâd appears to have consisted of the same seven poems which
                    are found in our modern editions, composed respectively by Amraa⅛ais, Tarafa,
                    Zohair, Labid, 'Antara, 'Amr ibn Kolthιim, and Hârith ibn Hilliza. These are
                    enumerated both by Ibn 'Abd-Rabbih, and, on the authority of the older
                    philologists, by Nahhâs; and all subsequent commentators seem to follow them. We
                    have, however, evidence of the existence, at a very early period, of a slightly
                    different arrangement. Two of the foremost authorities in Arabic poetry are Abù
                    'Obaida and Mofaddal,—men who for care and accuracy in preserving the genuine
                    text were far ahead of their much older contemporary Hammâd. Both of these
                    inserted a poem by Nâbigha and one by A'shâ in place of those of 'Antara and
                    Hârith;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The passage is

                    collection <hi rend="italic">Moallakât.</hi> Mofaddal employs, besides, the
                    names “the seven long [poems]” and “the necklaces.” This last became afterwards
                    a common title for the seven poems. The comparison of songs to strings of pearls
                    is a very apt one, from the nature of the Arabic poem, composed as it is of
                    separate loosely-connected parts. Hence it became so popular that even in
                    ordinary prose to speak in rhythmical form is called simply <hi rend="italic"
                    >nazm,</hi> “to string pearls.” Mofaddal expressly opposes the view of those who
                    did not acknowledge the pre-eminence of the seven poets selected by him. This
                    appears to be an attack on HammAd for including in his collection the works of
                    two men who for poetic fame could certainly never enter the lists with NAbigha
                    and A'shA. It is <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> more
                    likely that a later writer should have replaced the less famous poets by those
                    who were universally placed in the first rank, than <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> Perhaps another fact is of some importance here. HammAd, a Persian
                    by descent, was a client of the Arab tribe, Bakr ibn WAil. In the heathen period
                    this tribe was much at war with the closely - related tribe Taghlib. Now of all
                    Arabic poems none was more famous than that in which 'Amr ibn Kolthιim
                    celebrates in glowing terms the praises of his tribe Taghlib. If, therefore,
                    Hammâd’s collection embraced this poem, it was very natural for him to gratify
                    his patrons the Bakrites by placing alongside of it that of HArith—a Bakrite and
                    contemporary of 'Amr—where he extols his own tribe and assails the Taghlibites
                    with bitter scorn. Such considerations did not affect Abù 'Obaida and
                    Mofaddal.</p>
                <p>The authority of these men has so far prevailed that the poems of their
                    favourites NAbigha and A'shA often appear in the manuscripts, not indeed instead
                    of those of 'Antara and HArith, but after the other seven. Thus we sometimes
                    read of <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> Mo'allakAt. The first author in whom the
                    writer has observed this is the great philosophic historian Ibn Khaldùn <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 1332-1406); he mentions instead of HArith the far
                    more celebrated 'Alkama; whether relying on ancient authority, or by an
                    oversight, we cannot tell. In an excellent collection of forty-nine long poems
                    by Abù Zaid al-Korashi (date unknown) MofaddaΓs seven poets appear in the first
                    class, “the necklaces;” but NAbigha and A'sha are each represented by a
                    different piece from that usually reckoned among the Mo'allakAt. By this editor
                    the name “golden poems,” which, as we have seen, sometimes occurs as a synonym
                    of “Mo'allakAt,” is applied to seven quite distinct songs.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Noldeke, <hi rend="italic">Beiträge,</hi>

                    titles may serve as an additional proof that the “suspension,” on the Ka'ba or
                    anywhere else, is a fable.</p>
                <p>The lives of these seven (or nine) poets were spread over a period of more than a
                    hundred years. The earliest of them, according to the common and probably
                    correct opinion, was <hi rend="smallcaps">Amraalkais</hi> (pronounced also
                    Imroolkais, Imraalkais, &lt;fcc.), regarded by many as the most illustrious of
                    Arabian poets. His exact date cannot be determined; but probably the best part
                    of his career fell within the first half of the 6th century. He was a scion of
                    the royal house of the tribe Kinda, which lost all its power at the death of
                    King HArith ibn 'Amr in the year 529.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of this HArith, was killed by Bedouins. The son led an adventurous life as a
                    refugee, now with one tribe, now with another, and appears to have died young.
                    The anecdotes related of him—which, however, are very untrustworthy in detail—as
                    well as his poems, imply that the glorious memory of his house and the hatred it
                    inspired were still comparatively fresh, and therefore recent.</p>
                <p>The Mo'allaka of <hi rend="smallcaps">'Amr</hi> hurls defiance against the king
                    of Hira, 'Amr son of Mundhir, who reigned from the summer of 554 till 568 or
                    569, and was afterwards slain by our poet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >Hârith</hi> in his Mo'allaka. Of <hi rend="smallcaps">Tarafa,</hi> who is said
                    to have attained no great age, a few satirical verses have been preserved,
                    directed against this same king. This agrees with the fact that a grandson of
                    the Kais ibn KhAlid, mentioned as a rich and influential man in Tarafa’s
                    Mo'allaka (v. 80 or 81), figured at the time of the battle of Dlnι KAr, in which
                    the tribe Bakr routed a Persian army. This battle falls between <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 604 and 610 (Nöldeke’s <hi rend="italic">Tabari,</hi>
                    p. 311).</p>
                <p>The Mo'allaka of <hi rend="smallcaps">'Antara</hi> and that of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zohair</hi> contain allusions to the feuds of the kindred
                    tribes 'Abs and DhobyAn. Famous as these contests were, their time cannot be
                    ascertained. But the date of the two poets can be approximately determined from
                    other data. Ka'b, son of Zohair, composed first a satire, and then, in the year
                    630, a eulogy on the Prophet; another son, Bojair, had begun, somewhat sooner,
                    to celebrate Mohammed. 'Antara killed the grandfather of the Ahnaf ibn Kais who
                    died at an advanced age in <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 686 or 687; he
                    outlived 'AbdallAh ibn Simma, whose brother Doraid was a very old man when he
                    fell in battle against the Prophet (early in <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    630); and he had communications with Ward, whose son, the poet 'Orwa, may
                    perhaps have survived the flight of Mohammed to Medina. From all these
                    indications we may place the productive period of both poets in the end of the
                    6th century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    evidence might be supplemented from a poem in Zohair’s name, whose author
                    describes himself as a man of ninety years, and in which the downfall of King
                    No'mân of Hira <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 601, see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tabari,</hi> p. 347) is spoken of as a not very recent event. But the
                    genuineness of this poem is more than doubtful (see Ahlwardt, <hi rend="italic"
                    >op. tit.</hi> p. 64, and C. J. Lyall in the <hi rend="italic">Academy,</hi>

                    Mo'allaka seems to lie somewhat earlier than that of Zohair’s.</p>
                <p>To the same period appears to belong the poem of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >'Alkama,</hi> which, as we have seen, Ibn Khaldün reckons amongst the

                    who was one of the most distinguished of Arabic poets. For in the poem often
                    reckoned as a Mo'allaka, as in many others, he addresses himself to the
                    above-named No'mAn, king of Hira, who reigned in the two last decades of the 6th
                    century. The same king is mentioned as a contemporary in one of 'Alkama’s
                    poems.</p>
                <p>The poem of <hi rend="smallcaps">A'sha,</hi> which Mofaddal placed among the
                    Mo'allakAt, contains an allusion to the battle of I)lιιi KAr (under the name
                    “Battle of Hinw,” v. 62). This poet, not less famous than NAbigha, lived to
                    compose a poem in honour of Mohammed, and died not long before <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 630.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">d</hi> is the only one of these poets who embraced Islam. His
                    Mo'allaka, however, like almost all his other poetical works, belongs to the
                    pagan period. He is said to have lived till 661 or even later; certainly it is
                    true of him, what is asserted with less likelihood of several others of these
                    poets, that he lived to a ripe old age.</p>
                <p>We have already mentioned that the old Arabic poetry was transmitted not by
                    manuscripts but simply through oral tradition. Many pieces, especially the
                    shorter ones, may have owed their preservation to their hold on the popular
                    memory. But, fortunately, there was a class of men who made it their special
                    business to learn by rote, and repeat, the works either of a single poet or of
                    several. The poets themselves used the services of such rhapsodists <hi
                    rend="italic">(rdwιs).</hi> The last representative of this class is HammAd, the
                    man who formed the collection of Mo'allakAt: but he, at the same time, marks the
                    transition from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n563/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0563-0538"/> the rhapsodist to the critic and scholar. Now,
                    when we consider that more than a century—in some cases two centuries—elapsed
                    before the poems were fixed by literary men, we must be prepared to find that
                    they have not retained their original form unaltered. The most favourable
                    opinion of the rhapsodists would require us to make allowance for occasional
                    mistakes; expressions would be interchanged, the order of verses disarranged,
                    passages omitted, and probably portions of different poems pieced together. The
                    loose structure of the ancient poems rendered them peculiarly liable to
                    corruptions of this kind. But the fact is that Hammàd in particular dealt in the
                    most arbitrary fashion with the enormous quantity of poetry which he professed
                    to know thoroughly. He is even charged with falsifications of all sorts in this
                    department. Of others, again—and notably of the great philologist Khalaf, “the
                    Red ”—it is credibly reported that they used their intimate knowledge of the
                    style and language of the ancients to pass off whole poems of their own making
                    as the productions of earlier authors. The worst anticipations are only too
                    completely confirmed by an examination of such pieces as are still preserved, as
                    is shown most conclusively in Ahlwardt’s <hi rend="italic">Bemerkungen,</hi>
                    already cited. The seven Mo'allakât are indeed free from the suspicion of
                    forgery, but even in them verses are frequently transposed; in all there are
                    lacunae; and probably all contain verses which do not belong to them. Some of
                    them have more than one introduction. This is the case even with the poem of
                    'Amr, although, as the finest panegyric of his very powerful tribe, it must have
                    had a wide circulation. The true introduction begins at v. 9; before that we
                    find another which certainly does not belong to this poem, and can hardly be the
                    work of the same poet. 'Amr lived in the desert regions near the lower
                    Euphrates, under the Persian dominion; whereas the author of v. 8 boasts of his
                    carousals in several parts of Roman Syria, and in v. 1 he speaks of drinking
                    wine from a place in Northern Syria. It is evident that all attempts to restore
                    the original order, to fill up blanks, or to remove interpolations, can only be
                    carried to a certain degree of probability at the best; there must always be a
                    large subjective element in judgments on points of the kind. Still less can we
                    hope to discover and rectify the minor changes, in single expressions or
                    grammatical forms, wifi ch the text may have undergone before it was fixed in
                    writing. It may be remarked in this connexion that where any ancient song has
                    been transmitted through two different grammatical schools it generally appears
                    in two considerably divergent forms, each having been taken down from the lips
                    of a separate râwi. Of secondary importance are the errors due to later
                    copyists. Considerable as these often are, we are, at least in many cases,
                    better able to correct them.</p>
                <p>Even the masters of old Arabian poetry do not exhibit such characteristic
                    differences in their general manner and style as to leave in the mind a clear
                    idea of their individuality. A few distinct poetic types emerge, but the great
                    majority of these poets present a somewhat monotonous aspect to the Western
                    scholar, who indeed can at best have but a very imperfect feeling for <hi
                    rend="italic">nuances</hi> of style in this field. But if we are thus unable to
                    isolate the various constituent parts of this poetical literature, and pass a
                    critical opinion on each, we do get from this literature, as a whole, what is of
                    far greater importance than an aesthetic estimate of this or that particular
                    poet, viz. a poetic picture of the whole life and activity of that remarkable
                    people which, amid the endless agitation and endless sameness of its existence,
                    and in an extremely inhospitable region, was preparing one of the mightiest
                    revolutions in the history of the world. This collective impression is hardly
                    impaired by the involuntary alterations made by the rAwis; nor is it greatly
                    distorted by the forgers of the 2d century of Islam, who were thoroughly
                    familiar with the spirit and style of antiquity, and seldom did violence to
                    them.</p>
                <p>The critics of the 2d and 3d centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> unanimously
                    ranked the poets of the heathen period above those of Islam; and in that verdict
                    we must concur. The older Moslem poets were for the most part mere Epigoni,
                    content, for better or worse, to borrow the style of their pagan predecessors.
                    It is only natural, therefore, that the seven best poems should have been
                    selected from the productions of heathenism. But how these particular seven came
                    to be fixed upon, it is difficult to decide. It is remarkable that people who
                    knew thousands of such poems should have agreed as to the superiority of five,
                    and only differed about two. No doubt the selection was greatly influenced by
                    the widely-established reputation of certain poets, like Amraalkais, Zohair, and
                    Tarafa; while in other cases single poems, such as that of 'Amr, stood in high
                    repute for special reasons. Still, even we, with a much narrower range of
                    selection, should hardly pick out these seven as the finest. In all probability
                    our choice would not light on a single one of them. The truth is, our aesthetic
                    ideal is essentially different from that of those old <hi rend="italic"
                    >litterateurs.</hi> And, while we may certainly consider our own taste, formed
                    on the model of the Greeks and the best of the moderns, to be on the whole purer
                    than theirs, we must not forget that they had the advantage of perfect knowledge
                    of the language and the subject-matter, and could thus perceive a multitude of
                    beautiful and delicate touches, which we either miss entirely or realize with
                    laborious effort. The world of the old Arabian poet lay at an infinite remove
                    from ours. His mental horizon was narrow; but within that horizon every minute
                    detail was seized and designated with precision. Among the nomads, for example,
                    the smallest point of the horse or camel that the eye can see has its
                    importance; the language has precise and generally understood words for them
                    all, where ours has only technical terms. It is the same with all the physical
                    properties of the animal—its paces, etc. Thus, when a poet faithfully described
                    the exterior and the deportment of his camel, that was to his hearers—and the
                    same is true of later critics—a genuine pleasure, because the description
                    conveyed to them a definite pictorial impression. But we do not understand the
                    details of the picture; or, when at best with all the resources of tradition and
                    natural history we have gained some tolerable comprehension of them, the whole
                    still leaves us indifferent. A camel to us is simply not a poetical object; and
                    even a horse ceases to be aesthetically interesting—except perhaps to a
                    sportsman—when one is asked to go over his points in detail. For this reason we
                    are apt to find a great part of Tarafa’s Mo'allaka, and many parts of the poems
                    of Amraalkais, viewed as poetry, distasteful rather than interesting. More
                    attractive are the descriptions of the life and habits of wild animals in the
                    desert, such as the wild ass and some species of antelope, which the poets are
                    fond of introducing (see, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Mo'allaka of Labfd).
                    There are also many vivid sketches from nature to be met with,—nature, of
                    course, as seen in the very monotonous Arabian landscape. Monotony, indeed, is a
                    predominant characteristic of this poetry. When one first reads poems where the
                    bard begins by shedding tears over the scarcely perceptible traces of the
                    dwelling of his beloved in years gone by, one’s sympathy is aroused. But when
                    poem after poem is found to commence with the same scene, and possibly with
                    almost the same words, the emotion is somewhat damped. No doubt such occurrences
                    must really have been very common in the nomad life; nevertheless the suspicion
                    becomes at last irresistible that for the most part all this is pure fiction.
                    Nor can we be sure that the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n564/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0564-0539"/> poets are always to be taken <hi rend="italic">au
                    sérieux</hi> when they describe those carousals, and other adventures in peace
                    and war, of which they love to boast. They are probably more serious in the
                    narratives of their love experiences: these are often very highly coloured, and
                    yet are always pervaded by a certain natural refinement, which is too often
                    wanting in the later erotic poetry of the Moslems. But there, too, our enjoyment
                    is frequently marred by minute and even prosy descriptions of the physical
                    charms of the object of affection.</p>
                <p>The lyrical and even the more rhetorical passages of the poems make in general a
                    deeper impression upon us than the descriptive portions, to which they owe their
                    distinctive character, and which are often intimately blended with the former.
                    When those old Arabs are really moved by love, or rage, or grief, when personal
                    or tribal vanity vents itself in immoderate boasting, invective, or banter, then
                    they strike chords that thrill our breasts. In those passages where genuine
                    human feeling is stirred, they also display far greater individuality than in
                    the more conventional descriptions. Especially affecting are the numerous
                    passages or complete poems which mourn over the beloved and venerated dead.
                    Their sober practical philosophy too, as it is presented in the Mo'allaka of
                    Zohair and in many of Labid’s poems, is really impressive.</p>
                <p>The Mo'allakàt are highly characteristic specimens of this poetry. They exhibit
                    nearly all its merits as well as most of its defects. Amongst its merits we
                    ought, perhaps, to include the unfailing regιdarity of the verse. That a people
                    living under such extremely simple conditions should have cultivated a purely
                    quantitative metre, so euphonious and so rigorously adhered to, is a fact worthy
                    of our highest admiration. It is one evidence of that sense of measure and fixed
                    form which is, in other directions also, a marked feature in the life and speech
                    of the Arabs. The mere fact that in their verses they give so much attention to
                    elegance of expression deserves commendation. Amongst the defects of this poetry
                    we must emphasize the loose connexion between the separate parts. JFe require a
                    poem, like any other work of art, to be a compact unity; the Arabs and many
                    other Orientals lay all the stress on the details. In the Mo'allaka of Tarafa,
                    for instance, after the poet has spoken long enough about his beloved, he starts
                    off in this fashion: “But I banish care when it comes near with a ”— she-camel
                    of such and such qualities, and then proceeds to give a description of his
                    riding-camel. Equally abrupt transitions occur in almost all these poems,
                    generally more than once in the same poem. In many cases a sort of unity is
                    preserved by making the different sections represent so many scenes from the
                    life σf the poet or from the common life of the Bedouins; but even then there is
                    something unsatisfactory in the want of real connexion. It does not mend matters
                    much when the poet keeps up a merely mechanical transition; as, for example,
                    when he speaks first of his camel, then with the words “it is as swift as a wild
                    ass which,” Arc., passes to a description of that animal, and again proceeds,
                    “or as swift as an ostrich which,” Arc., in order to introduce the ostrich.</p>
                <p>This loose structure of the poems explains the fact that from a very early period
                    particular pieces were culled from larger works and recited by themselves. For
                    the town-Arabs of later times this procedure was especially convenient. For them
                    the wild ass or oryx-antelope had little attraction; and on the camel they
                    bestowed about as much notice as we do on our dray-horses and waggons. But the
                    love and hate, the pride and scorn, the fierce lust of revenge and the wailing
                    grief, the bravery and the gaiety, which breathed through the old Bedouin songs,
                    had an intense fascination for them. We see that their attitude towards that
                    poetry had in some degree approximated to our own. Hence it is that some
                    anthologies from the old poetry, made by men of learning and ability, with an
                    eye to contemporary tastes, are on the whole much more pleasing to us than the
                    complete poems themselves. This is eminently true of the excellent collection
                    edited by Abιi TammAm, himself a considerable poet (first half of the 9th
                    century), under the title HamAsa (Valour). This collection, which, however,
                    embraces many pieces of the Moslem period, is certainly fitted to give a
                    European a rather too favourable idea of ancient Arabic poetry. Whoever wishes
                    really to know that poetry—and without this knowledge it is impossible to
                    understand the Arabs themselves or their language— must betake himself to those
                    which, like the Mo'allakAt and others, have been preserved more or less in their
                    integrity.</p>
                <p>The Mo'allakAt have been repeatedly printed, separately and collectively, both in
                    the West and the East, generally with an Arabic commentary. A good commentary by
                    a competent European is a real desideratum. A work of this kind would do more
                    for the understanding of the poems than any poetical translation, which must
                    always fail in rendering these definite concrete expressions of the Arabs for
                    which we possess neither the idea nor the image. A translation must either be a
                    mere paraphrase or else substitute something utterly vague. (TH. N. )</p>
