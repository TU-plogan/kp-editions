                <p>It is at once apparent that the book of Micah divides itself into at least two
                    distinct discourses, chap. vi. 1 forming a new commencement; and from what we
                    know in general of the compilation of the prophetic collection we cannot at once
                    determine whether the second discourse, which has no title, is to be ascribed to
                    the author of the immediately preceding prophecy, or is to be regarded as an
                    independent and anonymous piece. To decide this question, if it can be decided,
                    we must begin by a separate study of the earlier chapters to which the title in
                    Micah i. 1 directly belongs. These again fall into two parts. Chaps, i.-iii.
                    (with the exception of two verses, ii. 12, 13) are a predic tion of judgment on
                    the sins of Judah and Ephraim. In a majestic exordium Jehovah Himself is
                    represented as coming forth in the thunderstorm (comp. Amos i. 2) from His
                    heavenly palace, and descending on the mountains of Palestine, at once as
                    witness against His people, and the executer of judgment on their sins. Samaria
                    is sentenced to destruction for idolatry; and the blow extends to Judah also,
                    which participates in the same guilt (chap. i.). But, while Samaria is summarily
                    dismissed, the sin of Judah is analysed at length in chaps, ii. and iii., in
                    which the prophet no longer deals with idolatry, but with the corruption of
                    society, and particularly of its leaders—the grasping aristocracy whose whole
                    energies are concentrated on devouring the poor and depriving them of their
                    little holdings, the unjust judges and priests who for gain wrest the law in
                    favour of the rich, the hireling and gluttonous prophets who make war against
                    every one “that putteth not into their mouth,” but are ever ready with
                    assurances of Jehovah’s favour to their patrons, the wealthy and noble sinners
                    that fatten on the flesh of the poor. The prophet speaks with the strongest
                    personal sympathy of the sufferings of the peasantry at the hands of their
                    lords, and contemplates with stern satisfaction the approach of the destroyer
                    who shall carry into exile “the luxurious sons” of this race of petty tyrants
                    (i. 16), and leave them none to stretch the measuring line on a field in the
                    congregation of Jehovah (ii. 5). The centre of corruption is the capital, the
                    city of Zion, grown great on the blood and wrongs of the provincials, the seat
                    of the cruel princes, the corrupt judges and diviners. For their sake, he
                    concludes, Zion shall be plowed as a field, Jerusalem shall lie in ruins, and
                    the temple hill return to jungle (üi. 12).</p>
                <p>The situation thus sketched receives its elucidation from the data supplied by
                    the title (i. 1) and confirmed and rendered more precise by a remarkable passage
                    in Jeremiah. According to the title Micah flourished in the reigns of Jotham,
                    Ahaz, and Hezekiah; according to Jeremiah (xxvi. 18 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi>
                    the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem just cited was spoken under
                    Hezekiah, and bore fruit in the repentance of king and people, by which the
                    judgment was averted. The allusion beyond doubt is to Hezekiah’s λvork of
                    religious reformation (2 Kings xviii. 4 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> It is
                    hardly possible to separate this reformation from the influence of Isaiah, which
                    did not become practical in the conduct of the state till the crisis of
                    Sennacherib’s invasion; and the conclusion that Hezekiah was not from the first
                    a reforming king, which is forced on us by many passages of Isaiah, is confirmed
                    by the prophecy of Micah, which, after Hezekiah’s accession, still represents
                    wickedness as seated in the high places of the kingdom. The internal disorders
                    of the realm depicted by Micah are also prominent in Isaiah’s prophecies; they
                    were closely connected, not only with the foreign complications due to the
                    approach of the Assyrians, but with the break-up of the old agrarian system
                    within Israel, and with the rapid and uncompensated aggrandisement of the nobles
                    during those prosperous years when the conquest of Edom by Amaziah and the
                    occupation of the port of Elath by his son (2 Kings xiv. 7, 22) placed the
                    lucrative trade between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea in the hands of the
                    rulers of Judah. On the other hand the democratic tone which distinguishes Micah
                    from Isaiah, and his announcement of the impending fall of the capital (the
                    deliverance of which from the Assyrian appears to Isaiah as the necessary
                    condition for the preservation of the seed of a new and better kingdom), are
                    explained by the fact that, while Isaiah lived in the centre of affairs, Micah
                    was a Morasthite or inhabitant of Moresheth Gath, a place near the Philistine
                    frontier so unimportant as to be mentioned <pb break="no"

                    mentioned together, and their names played upon in a way that could hardly have
                    suggested itself to any but a man of the district. The paronomasia makes the
                    verses difficult, and in i. 14 none of the ancient versions recognizes Moresheth
                    Gath as a proper name. The word Morasthite <hi rend="italic">(M6rashti)</hi> was
                    therefore obscure to them; but this only gives greater weight to the traditional
                    pronunciation within the first syllable, which is as old as the LXX., and goes
                    against the view, taken by the Targum both on Micah and on Jeremiah, and
                    followed by some moderns (including Roorda), that Micah came from Mareshah. When

                    not likely that ho is thinking of Mareshah (Maresa), for he speaks of the former
                    as a village and of the latter as a ruin 2 miles from Eleutheropolis. Jerome too

                    provincial prophet sees the capital and the aristocracy entirely from the side
                    of a man of the oppressed people, and foretells the utter ruin of both. But this
                    ruin does not present itself to him as involving the captivity or ruin of the
                    nation as a whole; the congregation of Jehovah remains in Judaea when the
                    oppressors are cast out (ii. 5); Jehovah’s words are still good to them that
                    walk uprightly; the glory of Israel is driven to take refuge in Adullam, as in
                    the days when David’s band of broken men was the true hope of the nation, but
                    there is no hint that it is banished from the land. Thus upon the prophecy of
                    judgment we naturally expect to follow a prophecy of the redintegration of
                    Jehovah’s kingship in a better Israel, and this we find in ii. 12, 13 and in
                    chaps, iv., v. Both passages, however, present difficulties. The former seems to
                    break the pointed contrast between ii. 11 and iii. 1, and is therefore regarded
                    by Ewald as an example of the false prophecies on which the wicked rulers
                    trusted. The thought, however, is one proper to all true prophecy (comp. Hos. i.
                    11 [ii. 2], Isa. xi. 11 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> Zeph. iii. 14, Jer. xxxi.
                    8), and precisely in accordance with chaps, iv., v., even in the détails of
                    expression and imagery.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    these verses are a separate oracle of Micah, which did not originally stand in

                    hand, is really difficult, and has given rise to much complicated

                    cited at length, but they are tacitly kept in view in what follows.</p></note>
                    There is a growing feeling among scholars that iv. 11-13 stands in direct
                    contradiction to iv. 9, 10, and indeed to iii. 12. The last two passages agree
                    in speaking of the capture of Jerusalem, the first declares Zion inviolable, and
                    its capture an impossible profanation. Such a thought can hardly be Micah’s,
                    even if we resort to the violent harmonistic process of imagining that two quite
                    distinct sieges, separated by a renewal of the theocracy, are spoken of in
                    consecutive verses. An interpolation, however, in the spirit of such passages as
                    Ezek. xxxviii., xxxix., Joel iii. [iv.], Zech, xiv., is very conceivable in
                    post-exilic times, and in connexion with the growing impulse to seek a literal
                    harmony of all prophecy on lines very different from the pre-exilic view in Jer.
                    xxvi., that predictions of evil may be averted by repentance. Another difficulty
                    lies in the words “and thou shalt come even to Babylon” in iv. 10. Micah
                    unquestionably looked for the destruction of Jerusalem as well as of Samaria in
                    the near future and by the Assyrians (i. 9), and this was the judgment which
                    Hezekiah’s repentance averted. If these words, therefore, belong to the original
                    context, they mark it as not from Micah’s hand; but it is easy to see that they
                    are really a later gloss. The prophetic thought is that the daughter
                    (population) of Zion shall not be saved by her present rulers or defensive
                    strength; she must come down from her bulwarks and dwell in the open field;
                    there, and not within her proud ramparts, Jehovah will grant deliverance from
                    her enemies. This thought is in precise harmony with chaps, i.-iii., and equally
                    characteristic is what follows in chap. v. Micah’s opposition to present tyranny
                    expresses itself in recurrence to the old popular ideal of the first simple
                    Davidic kingdom (iv. 8) to which he had already alluded in i. 15. These old days
                    shall return once more. Again guerilla bands (τ∏m□) gather to meet the foe as
                    they did in the time of Philistine oppression. A new David, like him whose
                    exploits in the district of Micah’s home were still in the mouths of the common
                    people, goes forth from Bethlehem to feed the flock in the strength of Jehovah.
                    The kindred Hebrew nations are once more united to their brethren of Israel
                    (comp. Amos ix. 12, Isa. xvi. 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> The remnant of
                    Jacob springs up in fresh vigour, inspiring terror among the surrounding
                    peoples, and there is no lack of chosen captains to lead them to victory against
                    the Assyrian foe. In the rejuvenescence of the nation the old stays of that
                    oppressive kingship which began with Solomon, the strongholds, the fortified
                    cities, the chariots and horses so foreign to the life of ancient Israel, are no
                    more known; they disappear together with the divinations, the soothsayers, the
                    idols, the <hi rend="italic">maççebas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">asheras</hi> of
                    the high places Jehovah is king on Mount Zion, and no inventions of man come
                    between Him and His people.</p>
                <p>The elements of this picture, drawn so largely from the most cherished memories
                    of the Judaeans, could not fail to produce a wide impression, especially when
                    the invasion of Sennacherib, although it spared Jerusalem, fulfilled in the most
                    striking way a great part of Micah’s predictions of judgment. Of this we have
                    evidence, not only in Jer. xxvi., but in the political and religious ideas of
                    the book of Deuteronomy. The picture of the right king (Deut, xvii. 14 s«/.) and
                    the condemnation of the high-places alike follow the doctrine of Micah.</p>
                <p>A difficulty still remains in the opening verses of chap. iv. Micah iv. 1-3 and
                    Isa. ii. 2-4 are but slightly modified recensions of the same text, and as Isa.
                    ii. is older than the prophecy of Micah, while on the other hand Micah iv. 4
                    seems the natural completion of the passage, it is common to suppose that both
                    copy an older prophet. But the words have little connexion with the context in
                    Isaiah, and may be the quotation of a copyist suggested by ver. <hi
                    rend="italic">5.</hi> On the other hand it has been urged that the passage
                    belongs to a later stage of prophetic thought than the 8th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> There is, however, no real difficulty in the idea
                    that foreign nations shall seek law and arbitrament at the throne of the king of
                    Zion (comp, the old prophecy Isa. xvi.); and the mention of the temple as the
                    seat of Jehovah’s sovereignty may be illustrated by Isa. vi., where the heavenly
                    palace (Micah i. 3) is at least pictured in the likeness of the temple on Zion.
                    At the same time the Jerusalem of Micah iv. 8 is the Jerusalem of David not of
                    Solomon, the ideas of iv. 1-4 do not reappear in chap, v., and the whole
                    prophecy would perhaps be more consecutive and homogeneous if iv. 6 (where the
                    dispersed and the suffering are, according to chap, ii., the victims of domestic
                    not of foreign oppression) followed directly on iii. 12.</p>
                <p>The sixth chapter of Micah presents a very different situation from chaps, i.-v.
                    Jehovah appears to plead with his people fortheir sins, but the sinners are no
                    longer a careless and oppressive aristocracy buoyed up by deceptive assurances
                    of Jehovah’s help, by prophecies of wine and strong drink; they are bowed down
                    by a religion of terror, wearied with attempts to propitiate an angry God by
                    countless offerings, and even by the sacrifice of the first-born. Meantime the
                    substance of true religion—justice, charity, and a humble walk with God—is
                    forgotten, fraud and deceit reign in all classes, the works of the house of Ahab
                    are observed (worship of foreign gods). Jehovah’s judgments are multiplied
                    gainst the land, and the issue can be nothing else than its total desolation.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0239-0226"/> these marks fit exactly the evil times of
                    Manasseh as described in 2 Kings xxi. Chap. vii. 1-6, in which the public and
                    private corruption of a hopeless age is bitterly bewailed, obviously belongs to
                    the same context (comp. vol. xiii. p. 415). Micah may very well have lived into
                    Manasseh’s reign, but the title in i. 1 does not cover a prophecy which
                    certainly falls after Hezekiah’s death, and the style has nothing in common with
                    the earlier part of the book. It is therefore prudent to regard the prophecy,
                    with Ewald, as anonymous. Ewald ascribes the whole of chaps, vi., vii. to one
                    author. Wellhausen, however, remarks with justice that the thread is abruptly
                    broken at vii. 6, and that verses 7-20 represent Zion as already fallen before
                    the heathen and her inhabitants as pining in the darkness of captivity. The hope
                    of Zion is in future restoration after she has patiently borne the chastisement
                    of her sins. Then Jehovah shall arise mindful of His oath to the fathers, Israel
                    shall be forgiven and restored, and the heathen humbled. The faith and hope
                    which breathe in this passage have the closest affinities with the book of
                    Lamentations and Isa. xl.-lxvi.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the text of Micah has suffered from redactors; it is also not
                    free from verbal corruptions which make some places very obscure. The LXX. had
                    many readings different from the present Hebrew, but their text too was far from
                    sound. Of commentaries on Micah, that which deals most fully with the question
                    of the text is Roorda’s Latin work, Leyden, 1869. The most elaborate book on
                    Micah is Caspari's (δ7eδer <hi rend="italic">Micha den</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">prophetische Schrift,</hi> Christiania, 1851-52). In English
