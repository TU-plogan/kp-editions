                    but it is not possible to infer that he was born on the day of his christening.
                    The exact place of his birth is also disputed, but it seems tolerably certain
                    that he saw the light in a house of the Rue St Honoré. His father was Jean
                    Poquelin, an upholsterer, who, in 1631, succeeded his own uncle as “valet
                    tapissier de chambre du roi.” The family of Poquelin came from Beauvais, where
                    for some centuries they had been prosperous tradesmen. The legend of their
                    Scotch descent seems to have been finally disproved by the researches of Μ. E.
                    Révérend du Mesnil. The mother of Molière was Marie Cressé; and on his father’s
                    side he was connected with the family of Mazuel, musicians attached to the court
                    of France. In 1632 Molière lost his mother; his father married again in 1633.
                    The father possessed certain shops in the covered Halle de la Foire, Saint
                    Germain des Prés, and the biographers have imagined that Molière might have
                    received his first bent towards the stage from the spectacles offered to the
                    holiday people at the fair. Of his early education little is known; but it is
                    certain that his mother possessed a Bible and Plutarch’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lives,</hi> books which an intelligent child would not fail to study. In spite
                    of a persistent tradition, there is no reason to believe that the later
                    education of Molière was neglected. “Il fit ses humanitez au Collège de
                    Clermont,” says the brief life of the comedian published by his friend and
                    fellow-actor, La Grange, in the edition of his works printed in 1682. La Grange
                    adds that Molière “eut 1’ad van tage de suivre Μ. le Prince de Conti dans toutes
                    ses classes.” As Conti was seven years younger than Molière, it is not easy to
                    understand how Molière came to be the school contemporary of the prince. Among
                    more serious studies the Jesuit fathers encouraged their pupils to take part in
                    <hi rend="italic">ballets,</hi> and in later life Molière was a distinguished
                    master of this sort of entertainment. According to Grimarest, the first writer
                    who published a life of Molière in any detail (1705), he not only acquired “his
                    humanities,” but finished his “philosophy” in five years. He left the Collège de
                    Clermont in 1641, the year when Gassendi, a great contemner of Aristotle,
                    arrived in Paris. The <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ethics</hi> of Aristotle, with his <hi rend="italic">Physics</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Metaphysics,</hi> were the chief philosophical text-books at the
                    Collège de Clermont. But when he became the pupil of Gassendi (in company with
                    Cyrano de Bergerac, Chapelle, and Hesnaut), Molière was taught to appreciate the
                    atomic philosophy as taught by Lucretius. There seems no doubt that Molière
                    began, and almost or quite finished, a translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Natura</hi><hi rend="italic">Rerum.</hi> According to
                    a manuscript note of Trailage, published by Μ. Paul Lacroix, the manuscript was
                    sold by Molière’s widow to a bookseller. His philosophic studies left a deep
                    mark on the genius of Molière. In the <hi rend="italic">Jugement</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Pluton</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les deux

                    Morts</hi> (1684), the verdict is “que Molière ne parleroit point de
                    Philosophie.” To “talk philosophy” was a favourite exercise of his during his
                    life, and his ideas are indicated with sufficient clearness in several of his
                    plays. There seems no connexion between them and the opinions of “Molière le
                    Critique” in a dialogue of that name, published in Holland in 1709. From his
                    study of philosophy, too, he gained his knowledge of the ways of contemporary
                    pedants, —of Pancrace the Aristotelian, of Marphorius the Cartesian, of
                    Trissotin, “qui s’attache pour l’ordre au Péripatétisme”, of Philaminte, who
                    loves Platonism, of Belise, who relishes “les petits corps,” and Armande, who
                    loves “les tourbillons.” Grimarest has an amusing anecdote of a controversy in
                    which Molière, defending Descartes, chose a lay-brother of a begging order for
                    umpire, while Chapelle appealed to the same expert in favour of Gassendi. His
                    college education over, Molière studied law, and there is even evidence—that of
                    tradition in Grimarest, and of Le Boulanger de Chalussay, the libellous author
                    of a play called <hi rend="italic">Elomire Hypochondre—</hi> to prove that he
                    was actually called to the bar. More trustworthy is the passing remark in La
                    Grange’s short biography (1682), <hi rend="italic">“au sortir des écoles de
                    droit,</hi> il choisit la profession de comédien.” Before joining a troop of
                    half-amateur comedians, however, Molière had some experience in his father’s
                    business. In 1637 his father had obtained for him the right to succeed to his
                    own office as “valet tapissier de chambre du roi.” The document is mentioned in
                    the inventory of Molière’s effects, taken after his death. When the king
                    travelled the valet tapissier accompanied him to arrange the furniture of the
                    royal quarters. There is very good reason to believe (Loiseleur, <hi
                    rend="italic">Points</hi><hi rend="italic">Obscurs,</hi> p. 94) that Molière
                    accompanied Louis XIII. as his valet tapissier to Provence in 1642. It is even
                    not impossible that Molière was the young valet de chambre who concealed Cinq
                    Mars just before his arrest at Narbonne, 13th June 1642. But this is part of the
                    romance rather than of the history of Molière. Our next glimpse of the comedian
                    we get in a document of 6th January 1643. Molière acknowledges the receipt of
                    money due to him from his deceased mother’s estate, and gives up his claim to
                    succeed his father as “valet de chambre du roi.” On 28th December of tlψ same
                    year we learn, again from documentary evidence, that Jean Baptiste Poquelin,
                    with Joseph Béjard, Madeleine Béjard, Geneviève Béjard, and others, have hired a
                    tennis-court, and fitted it up as a stage for dramatic performances. The company
                    called themselves I.’Illustre Théâtre, <hi rend="italic">illustre</hi> being
                    then almost a slang word, very freely employed by the writers of the period.</p>
                <p>We now reach a very important point in the private history of Molière, which it
                    is necessary to discuss at some length in defence of the much maligned character
                    of a great writer and a good man. Molière’s connection with the family of Béjard
                    brought him much unhappiness. The father of this family, Joseph Béjard the
                    elder, was a needy man with eleven children at least. His wife’s name was Marie
                    Hervé. The most noted of his children, companions of Molière, were Joseph,
                    Madeleine, Geneviève, and Armande. Of these, Madeleine was a woman of great
                    talent as an actress, and Molière’s friend, or perhaps mistress, through all the
                    years of his wanderings. Now, on 14th February 1662 (for we must here leave the
                    chronological order of events), Molière married Armande Claire Elisabeth
                    Grésinde Béjard. His enemies at that time, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n652/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0652-0625"/> and a number of his biographers in our own day,
                    have attempted to prove that Armande Béjard was not the sister, but the daughter
                    of Madeleine, and even that Molière’s wife may have been his own daughter by
                    Madeleine Béjard. The arguments of Μ. Arsène Houssaye in support of this
                    abominable theory are based on reckless and ignorant confusions, and do not
                    deserve criticism. But the system of Μ. Loiseleur is more serious, and he goes
                    no further than the idea that Madeleine was the mother of Armande. This,
                    certainly, was the opinion of tradition, an opinion based on the slanders of
                    Montfleury, a rival of Molière’s, on the authority of the spiteful and anonymous
                    author of <hi rend="italic">La Fameuse, Comédienne</hi> (1688), and on the no
                    less libellous play, <hi rend="italic">Rlomire IIypochondre.</hi> In 1821
                    tradition received a shock, for Beffara then discovered Molière’s “acte de
                    mariage,” in which Armande, the bride, is spoken of as the sister of Madeleine
                    Béjard, by the same father and mother. The old scandal, or part of it, was
                    revived by Μ. Fournier and Μ. Bazin, but received another blow in 1863. Μ.
                    Soulié then discovered a legal document of 10th March 1643, in which the widow
                    of Joseph Béjard renounced, in the name of herself and her children, his
                    inheritance, chiefly a collection of unpaid bills. Now in this document all the
                    children are described as minors, and among them is “<hi rend="italic"
                    >une</hi><hi rend="italic">petite non encore</hi><hi rend="italic">baptisée
                    y</hi> This little girl, still not christened in March 1643, is universally
                    recognized as the Armande Béjard afterwards married by Molière. We reach this
                    point, then, that when Armande was an infant she was acknowledged as the sister,
                    not as the daughter, of Madeleine Béjard. Μ. Loiseleur refuses, however, to
                    accept this evidence. Madeleine, says he, had already become the mother, in
                    1638, of a daughter by Esprit Raymond de Moirmoron, comte de Modène, and
                    chamberlain of Gaston duc d’Orléans, brother of Louis XIII. In 1642 Modène, who
                    had been exiled for political reasons, “was certain to return, for Richelieu had
                    just died, and Louis XIII. was likely to follow him.” Now Madeleine was
                    again—this is Μ. Loiseleur’s hypothesis— about to become a mother, and if Modène
                    returned, and learned this fact, he would not continue the <hi rend="italic"
                    >liaison,</hi> still less would he marry her,—which, by the way, he could not
                    do, as his wife was still alive. Madeleine, therefore, induced her mother to
                    acknowledge the little girl as her own child. In the first place, all this is
                    pure unsupported hypothesis. In the second place, it has always been denied that
                    Béjard’s wife could have been a mother in 1643, owing to her advanced age,
                    probably fifty-three. But Μ. Loiseleur himself says that Marie Hervé was young
                    enough to make the story “sufficiently probable.” If it was probable, much more
                    was it possible. Μ. Loiseleur supports his contention by pointing out that two
                    of the other children, described as legally minors, were over twenty-five, and
                    that their age was understated to make the account of Armande’s birth more
                    probable. Nothing is less likely than that Modène would have consulted this
                    document to ascertain the truth about the parentage of Armande, yet Μ. Loise
                    leur’s whole theory rests on that extreme improbability. It must also be
                    observed that the date of the birth of Joseph Béjard is unknown, and he <hi
                    rend="italic">may</hi> have been, and according to Μ. Jal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dictionnaire</hi><hi rend="italic">Critique,</hi> p. 178) <hi rend="italic"
                    >must</hi> have been, a minor when he was so described in the document of 10th
                    March 1643, while Madeleine had only passed her twenty-fifth birthday, her legal
                    majority, by two months. This view of Joseph’s age is supported by Bouquet <hi
                    rend="italic">(Molière à</hi><hi rend="italic">Rouen,</hi> p. 77). Μ.
                    Loiseleur’s only other proof is that Marie Hervé gave Armande a respectable
                    dowry, and that, as we do not know whence the money came, it must have come from
                    Madeleine. The tradition in Grimarest, which makes Madeleine behave <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">femme</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >furieuse,</hi> when she heard of the marriage, is based on a juster
                    appreciation of the character of women. It will be admitted, probably, that the
                    reasons for supposingthat Molière espoused the daughter of a woman who had been
                    his mistress (if she had been his mistress) are flimsy and inadequate. The
                    affair of the dowry is insisted on by Μ. Livet <hi rend="italic">(La Fameuse
                    Comédienne,</hi> reprint of 1877, p. 143). But Μ. Livet explains the dowry by
                    the hypothesis that Armande was the daughter of Madeleine and the comte de
                    Modène, which exactly contradicts the theory of Μ. Loiseleur, and is itself
                    contradicted by dates, at least as understood by Μ. Loiseleur. Such are the
                    conjectures by which the foul calumnies of Molière’s enemies are supported in
                    the essays of modern French critics.</p>
                <p>To return to the order of events, Molière passed the year 1643 in playing with,
                    and helping to manage, the Théâtre Illustre. The company acted in various
                    tennis-courts, with very little success. Molière was actually arrested by the
                    tradesman who supplied candles, and the company had to borrow money from one
                    Aubrey to release their leader from the Grand Châtelet (13th August 1645). The
                    process of turning a tennis-court into a theatre was somewhat expensive, even
                    though no seats were provided in the pit. The troupe was for a short time under
                    the protection of the duc d’Orléans, but his favours were not lucrative. The due
                    de Guise, according to some verses printed in 1646, made Molière a present of
                    his cast-off wardrobe. But costume was not enough to draw the public to the
                    tennis-court theatre of the Croix Noire, and empty houses at last obliged the
                    Théâtre Illustre to leave Paris at the end of 1646.</p>
                <p>“Nul animal vivant n’entra dans nôtre salle,” says the author of the scurrilous
                    play on Molière, <hi rend="italic">Flomire Hypochondre.</hi> But at that time
                    some dozen travelling companies found means to exist in the provinces, and
                    Molière determined to play among the rural towns. The career of a strolling
                    player is much the same at all times and in all countries. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Roman</hi><hi rend="italic">Comique</hi> of Scarron gives a vivid picture of
                    the adventures and misadventures, the difficulty of transport, the queer
                    cavalcade of horses, mules, and lumbering carts that drag the wardrobe and
                    properties, the sudden metamorphosis of the tennis-court, where the balls have
                    just been rattling, into a stage, the quarrels with local squires, the disturbed
                    nights in crowded country inns, all the loves and wars of a troupe on the march.
                    Perrault tells us what the arrangements of the theatre were in Molière’s early
                    time. Tapestries were hung round the stage, and entrances and exits were made by
                    struggling through the heavy curtains, which often knocked off the hat of the
                    comedian, or gave a strange cock to the helmet of a warrior or a god. The lights
                    were candles stuck in tin sconces at the back and sides, but luxury sometimes
                    went so far that a chandelier of four candles was suspended from the roof. At
                    intervals the candles were let down by a rope and pulley, and any one within
                    easy reach snuffed them with his fingers. A flute and tambour, or two fiddlers,
                    supplied the music. The highest prices were paid for seats in the <hi
                    rend="italic">dedans</hi> (cost of admission fivepence); for the privilege of
                    standing up in the pit twopence-halfpenny was the charge. The doors were opened
                    at one o’clock, the curtain rose at two.</p>
                <p>The nominal director of the Théâtre Illustre in the provinces was Du Fresne; the
                    most noted actors were Molière, the Béjards, and Du Parc, called Gros René. It
                    is extremely difficult to follow exactly the line of march of the company. They
                    played at Bordeaux, for example, but the date of this performance, when Molière
                    (according to Montesquieu) failed in tragedy and was pelted, is variously given
                    as 1644-45 (Trailage), 1647 (Loiseleur), 1648-58 (Lacroix). Perhaps the theatre
                    prospered better elsewhere than in Paris, where the streets were barricaded in
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n653/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0653-0626"/> these early days of the war of the Fronde. We
                    find Molière at Nantes in 1648, at Fontenay-le-Compte, and in the spring of 1649
                    at Agen, Toulouse, and probably at Angouleme and Limoges. In January 1650 they
                    played at Narbonne, and between 1650 and 1653 Lyons was the headquarters of the
                    troupe. In January 1653, or perhaps 1655, Molière gave <hi rend="italic">I.</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">Etourdi</hi> at Lyons, the first of his finished pieces, as
                    contrasted with the slight farces with which he generally diverted a country
                    audience. It would be interesting to have the precise date of this piece, but La
                    Grange (1682) says that “in 1653 Molière went to Lyons, where he gave his first
                    comedy, I.’Étourdi,” while in his <hi rend="italic">Registre</hi> La Grange
                    enters the year as 1655. At Lyons De Brie and his wife, the famous Mlle, de
                    Brie, entered the troupe, and Du Parc married marquise de Gorla, better known as
                    Mlle, du Parc. The libellous author of <hi rend="italic">La Fameuse
                    Comédienne</hi> reports that Molière’s heart was the shuttlecock of the
                    beautiful Du Parc and De Brie, and the tradition has a persistent life.
                    Molière’s own opinion of the ladies and men of his company may be read between
                    the lines of his <hi rend="italic">Impromptu de Versailles.</hi> In 1653 Prince
                    de Conti, after many political adventures, was residing at La Grange, near
                    Pézénas, in Languedoc, and chance brought him into relations with his old
                    schoolfellow Molière. Conti had for first gentleman of his bedchamber the abbé
                    Daniel de Cosnac, whose memoirs now throw light for a moment on the fortunes of
                    the wandering troupe. Cosnac engaged the company “of Molière and of La Béjart;”
                    but another company, that of Cormier, nearly intercepted the favour of the
                    prince. Thanks to the resolution of Cosnac, Molière was given one chance of
                    appearing on the private theatre of La Grange. The excellence of his acting, the
                    splendour of the costumes, and the insistence of Cosnac, and of Sarrasin,
                    Conti’s secretary, gained the day for Molière, and a pension was assigned to his
                    company (Cosnac, <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> i. 128, Paris, 1852). As
                    Cosnac proposed to pay Molière a thousand crowns of his own money to recompense
                    him in case he was supplanted by Cormier, it is obvious that his profession had
                    become sufficiently lucrative. In 1654, during the session of the estates of
                    Languedoc, Molière and his company played at Montpellier. Here Molière danced in
                    a <hi rend="italic">ballet</hi><hi rend="italic">(Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ballet des Incompatibles')</hi> in which a number of men of rank took part,
                    according to the fashion of the time. Molière’s own <hi rend="italic">rôles</hi>
                    were those of the Poet and the Fishwife. The sport of the little piece is to
                    introduce opposite characters, dancing and singing together. Silence dances with
                    six women, Truth with four courtiers, Money with a poet, and so forth. Whether
                    the ballet, or any parts of it, are by Molière, is still disputed <hi
                    rend="italic">(La Jeunesse de Molière, suivie</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Ballet</hi><hi rend="italic">des Incompatibles,</hi> P. I.. Jacob, Paris, 1858).
                    In April 1655 it is certain that the troupe was at Lyons, where they met and
                    hospitably entertained a profligate buffoon, Charles d’Assoucy, who informs the
                    ages that Molière kept open house, and <hi rend="italic">“une</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">table</hi><hi rend="italic">bien garnie.”</hi> November 1655 found
                    Molière at Pézénas, where the estates of Languedoc were convened, and where
                    local tradition points out the barber’s chair in which the poet used to sit and
                    study character. The longest of Molière’s extant autographs is a receipt, dated
                    at Pézénas, 4th February 1656, for 6000 livres, granted by the estates of
                    Languedoc. This year was notable for the earliest representation, at Béziers,-
                    of Molière’s second finished comedy, the <hi rend="italic">Dépit Amoureux.</hi>
                    Conti now withdrew to Paris, and began to “make his soul,” as the Irish say.
                    Almost his first act of penitence was to discard Molière’s troupe (1657), which
                    consequently found that the liberality of the estates of Languedoc was dried up
                    for ever. Conti’s relations with Molière must have definitively closed long
                    before 1666, when the now pious prince wrote a treatise against the stage, and
                    especially charged his old schoolfellow with keeping a new school, a school of
                    atheism <hi rend="italic">(Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de la</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Comédie,</hi> p. 24, Paris, 1666). Molière was now (1657)
                    independent of princes and their favour. He went on a new circuit to Nismes,
                    Orange, and Avignon, where he met another old class-mate, Chapelle, and also
                    encountered the friend of his later life, the painter Mignard. After a later
                    stay at Lyons, ending with a piece given for the benefit of the poor on 27th
                    February 1658, Molière passed to Grenoble, returned to Lyons, and is next found
                    in Rouen, where, we should have said, the Théâtre Illustre had played in 1643
                    (F. Bouquet, <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Troupe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Molière à</hi><hi rend="italic">Rouen,</hi> p. 90, Paris,
                    1880). At Rouen Molière must have made or renewed the acquaintance of Pierre and
                    Thomas Corneille. His company had played pieces by Corneille at Lyons and
                    elsewhere. The real business of the comedian in Rouen was to prepare his return
                    to Paris. “After several secret journeys thither he was fortunate enough to
                    secure the patronage of Monsieur, the king’s only brother, who granted him his
                    protection, and permitted the company to take his name, presenting them as his
                    servants to the king and the queen-mother” (Preface to La Grange’s edition of
                    1682). The troupe appeared for the first time before Louis XIV. in a theatre
                    arranged in the old Louvre (24th October 1658).</p>
                <p>Molière was now thirty-six years of age. He had gained all the experience that
                    fifteen years of practice could give. He had seen men and cities, and noted all
                    the humours of rural and civic France. He was at the head of a company which, as
                    La Grange, his friend and comrade, says, “sincerely loved him.” He had the
                    unlucrative patronage of a great prince to back him, and the jealousy of all
                    playwrights, and of the old theatres of the Hôtel de Bourgogne and the Marais,
                    to contend against. In this struggle we can follow him by aid of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Registre</hi> of La Grange (a brief diary of receipts and
                    payments), and by the help of notices in the rhymed chronicles of Loret.</p>
                <p>The first appearance of Molière before the king was all but a failure. <hi
                    rend="italic">Nicomède,</hi> by the elder Corneille, was the piece, and we may
                    believe that the actors of the Hôtel de Bourgogne, who were present, found much
                    to criticize. When the play was over, Molière came forward and asked the king’s
                    permission to act “one of the little pieces with which he had been used to
                    regale the provinces.” The <hi rend="italic">Docteur Amoureux,</hi> one of
                    several slight comedies admitting of much “gag,” was then performed, and
                    “diverted as much as it surprised the audience.” The king commanded that the
                    troupe should establish itself in Paris (Preface, ed. 1682). The theatre
                    assigned to the company was a <hi rend="italic">salle</hi> in the Petit Bourbon,
                    in a line with the present Rue du Louvre. Some Italian players already occupied
                    the house on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays; the company of Molière played on
                    the other days. The first piece played in the new house (3d Nov. 1658) was <hi
                    rend="italic">I.</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Etourdi.</hi> La Grange says the
                    comedy had a great success, producing seventy pistoles for each actor. The
                    success is admitted even by the spiteful author of <hi rend="italic">Elomire
                    IIypochondre</hi> (Paris, lfi θ) &lt;&lt; j <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> j <hi

                <p>The success, however, is attributed to the farcical element in the play and the
                    acting—the cuckoo cry of Molière’s detractors. The original of <hi rend="italic"
                    >I.</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Étourdi</hi> is the Italian comedy (1629) <hi
                    rend="italic">LΙnavvertito,</hi> by Nicolo Barbieri detto Beltrame; Molière
                    pushed rather far his right to “take his own wherever he found it.” Had he
                    written nothing more original, the contemporary critic of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Festin</hi><hi rend="italic">de Pierre</hi> might have said, not untruly, that
                    he only excelled in stealing pieces from the Italians. The piece is
                    conventional: the stock characters of the prodigal son, the impudent valet, the
                    old father occupy the stage. But the dialogue <pb break="no"

                    Coquelin in Mascarille still makes <hi rend="italic">I.’Étourdi</hi> a favourite
                    on the stage, though it cannot be read with very much pleasure. The next piece,
                    new in Paris, though not in the provinces, was the <hi rend="italic">Dépit
                    Amoureux</hi> (first acted at Béziers, 1656). The play was not less successful
                    than <hi rend="italic">I.’Étourdi.</hi> It has two parts, one an Italian <hi
                    rend="italic">imbroglio</hi>; the other, which alone keeps the stage, is the
                    original work of Molière, though, of course, the idea of <hi rend="italic"
                    >amantium</hi><hi rend="italic">irae</hi> is as old as literature. “Nothing so
                    good,” says Mr. Saintsbury, “had yet been seen on the French stage, as the
                    quarrels and reconciliations of the quartette of master, mistress, valet, and
                    soubrette.” Even the hostile Le Boulanger de Chalussay <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Élomire</hi><hi rend="italic">Hypochondre)</hi> admits that the audience was
                    much of this opinion—</p>
                <p>“Et de tous les côtés chacun cria tout haut, ‘ C’est la faire et jouer les pièces
                    comme il faut.’”</p>
                <p>The same praise was given, perhaps even more deservedly, to <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Précieuses</hi><hi rend="italic">Ridicules{</hi> 18th November 1659). Doubtshave
                    been raised as to whether this famous piece, the first true comic satire of
                    contemporary foibles on the French stage, was a new play. La Grange calls it <hi
                    rend="italic">pièce nouvelle</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Registre,</hi> but,
                    as he enters it as the third <hi rend="italic">pièce nouvelle,</hi> he may only
                    mean that, like <hi rend="italic">I.’Étourdi,</hi> it was new to Paris. The
                    short life of 1682, produced under La Grange’s care, and probably written by
                    Marcel the actor, says the <hi rend="italic">Précieuses</hi> was “made” in 1659.
                    There is another controversy as to whether the ladies of the Hôtel Rambouillet,
                    or merely their <hi rend="italic">bourgeoises</hi> and rustic imitators, were
                    laughed at. Ménage, in later years at least, professed to recognize an attack bn
                    the over-refinement and affectation of the original and, in most ways,
                    honourable <hi rend="italic">précieuses</hi> of the Hôtel Rambouillet. But
                    Chapelle and Bachaumont had discovered provincial <hi rend="italic"
                    >précieuses,</hi> hyper-aesthetic literary ladies, at Montpellier before
                    Molière’s return to Paris; and Furetière, in the <hi rend="italic">Roman
                    Bourgeois</hi> (1666), found Paris full of middleclass <hi rend="italic"
                    >précieuses,</hi> who had survived, or, like their modern counterparts, had
                    thriven on ridicule. Another question is—Did Molière copy from the earlier <hi
                    rend="italic">Précieuses</hi> of the abbé de Pure? This charge of plagiarism is
                    brought by Somaize, in the preface to his <hi rend="italic">Véritables
                    Précieuses.</hi> De Pure’s work was a novel (1656), from which the Italian
                    actors had put together an acting piece in their manner, that is, a thing of
                    “gag,” and improvized speeches. The reproach is interesting only because it
                    proves how early Molière found enemies who, like Thomas Corneille in 1659,
                    accused him of being skilled only in farce, or, like Somaize, charged him with
                    literary larceny. These were the stock criticisms of Molière’s opponents as long
                    as he lived. The success of the <hi rend="italic">Précieuses</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ridicules</hi> was immense; on one famous occasion the king was a
                    spectator, leaning against the great chair of the dying Cardinal Mazarin. The
                    play can never cease to please while literary affectation exists, and it has a
                    comic force of deathless energy. Yet a modern reader may spare some sympathy for
                    the poor heroines, who do not wish, in courtship, to “begin with marriage,” but
                    prefer first to have some less formidable acquaintance with their wooers.
                    Molière’s next piece was less important, and more purely farcical, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sganarelle;</hi><hi rend="italic">ou le Cocu Imaginaire</hi> (28th
                    May 1660). The public taste preferred a work of this light nature, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Sganarelle</hi> was played every year as long as Molière lived.
                    The play was pirated by a man who pretended to have retained all the words in
                    his memory. The counterfeit copy was published by Ribou, a double injury to
                    Molière, as, once printed, any company might act the play. With his habitual
                    good-nature, Molière not only allowed Ribou to publish later works of his, but
                    actually lent money to that knave (Soulié, <hi rend="italic">Recherches,</hi> p.
                    287).</p>
                <p>On 11th October 1660 the Théâtre du Petit Bourbon was demolished by the
                    superintendent of works, without notice given to the company. The king gave
                    Molière the Salle du Palais Royal, but the machinery of the old theatre was
                    maliciously destroyed. Meanwhile the older companies of the Marais and the Hôtel
                    de Bourgogne attempted to lure away Molière’s troupe, but, as La Grange declares
                    <hi rend="italic">{Registre,</hi> p. 26), “all the actors loved their chief, who
                    united to extraordinary genius an honourable character and charming manner,
                    which compelled them all to protest that they would never leave him, but always
                    share his fortunes.” While the new theatre was being put in order, the company
                    played in the houses of the great, and before the king at the Louvre. In their
                    new house (originally built by Richelieu) Molière began to play on 20th January
                    1661. Molière now gratified his rivals by a failure. <hi rend="italic">Don Garde
                    de Navarre,</hi> a heavy tragi-comedy, which had long lain among his papers, was
                    first represented on 4th February 1661. Either Molière was a poor actor outside
                    comedy, or his manner was not sufficiently “stagy,” and, as he says, “demoniac,”
                    for the taste of the day. His opponents were determined that he could not act in
                    tragi-comedy, and he, in turn, burlesqued their pretentious and exaggerated
                    manner in a later piece. In the <hi rend="italic">Prédeuses</hi> (sc. ix.)
                    Molière had already rallied “les grands comédiens” of the Hôtel Bourgogne. “Les
                    autres,” he makes Mascarille say about his own troupe, “sont des ignorants qui
                    récitent comme l’on parle, ils ne savent pas faire ronfler les vers.” All this
                    was likely to irritate the <hi rend="italic">grands</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >comédiens,</hi> and their friends, who avenged themselves on that unfortunate
                    jealous prince, Don Garcie de Navarre. The subject of this unsuccessful drama is
                    one of many examples which show how Molière’s mind was engaged with the serious
                    or comic aspects of jealousy, a passion which he had soon cause to know most
                    intimately. Meantime the everyday life of the stage went on, and the doorkeeper
                    of the Théâtre St. Germain was wounded by some revellers who tried to force
                    their way into the house (La Grange, <hi rend="italic">Registre').</hi> A year
                    later, an Italian actor was stabbed in front of Molière’s house, where he had
                    sought to take shelter (Campardon, <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Pièces,</hi> p.
                    20). To these dangers actors were peculiarly subject: Molière himself was
                    frequently threatened by the marquises and others whose class he ridiculed on
                    the stage, and there seems even reason to believe that there is some truth in
                    the story of the angry marquis who rubbed the poet’s head against his buttons,
                    thereby cutting his face severely. The story comes late (1725) into his
                    biography, but is supported by a passage in the contemporary play, <hi
                    rend="italic">Zélinde</hi> (Paris, 1663, scene viii.). Before Easter, Molière
                    asked for two shares in the profits of his company, one for himself, and one for
                    his wife, if he married. That fatal step was already contemplated (La Grange).
                    On 24th June he brought out for the first time <hi rend="italic"
                    >I.’École</hi><hi rend="italic">des Maris.</hi> The general idea of the piece is
                    as old as Menander, and Molière was promptly accused of pilfering from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Adelphi</hi> of Terence. One of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ficelles</hi> of the comedy is borrowed from a story as old, at least, as
                    Boccaccio, and still amusing in a novel by Charles de Bernard. It is significant
                    of Molière’s talent that the grotesque and baffled paternal wooer, Sganarelle,
                    like several other butts in Molière’s comedy, does to a certain extent win our
                    sympathy and pity as well as our laughter. The next new piece was <hi
                    rend="italic">Les</hi><hi rend="italic">Fascheux,</hi> a <hi rend="italic"
                    >comédie-ballet,</hi> the Comedy of Bores, played before the king at Fouquet’s
                    house at Vaux le Vicomte (August 15-20, 1661). The comedians, without knowing
                    it, were perhaps the real “fascheux” on this occasion, for Fouquet was absorbed
                    in the schemes of his insatiable ambition <hi rend="italic">{Quo non</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ascendam</hi><hi rend="italic">1</hi> says his motto), and the
                    king was organizing the arrest and fall of Fouquet, his rival in the affections
                    of La Vallière. The author of the prologue to <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Fascheux,</hi> Pellisson, a friend of Fouquet’s, was arrested along with the
                    superintendent of finance. Pellisson’s prologue and <pb break="no"

                    dedication to the king Molière says that Louis suggested one scene (that of the
                    Sportsman), and in another place he mentions that the piece was written,
                    rehearsed, and played in a fortnight. The fundamental idea of the play, the
                    interruptions by bores, is suggested by a satire of Régnier’s, and that by a
                    satire of Horace. Perhaps it may have been the acknowledged suggestions of the
                    king which made gossips declare that Molière habitually worked up hints and <hi
                    rend="italic">mémoires</hi> given him by persons of quality <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Nouvelles Nouvelles,</hi> 1663).</p>
                <p>In February 1662 Molière married Armande Béjard. The date is given thus in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Registre</hi> of La Grange: “Mardy 14, Les Visionnaires,
                    I.’Écol des Μ.</p>

                <p>And on the margin he has painted a blue circle, his way of recording a happy
                    event, with the words, “mariage de Μ. de Molière au sortir de la Visite.” Μ.
                    Loiseleur gives the date in one passage as 29th February, in another as 20th
                    February. But La Grange elsewhere mentions the date as “Shrove Tuesday,” which
                    was, it seems, 14th February. Elsewhere Μ. Loiseleur makes the date of the
                    marriage a vague day “in January.” The truth is that the marriage contract is
                    dated 23d January 1662 (Soulié, <hi rend="italic">Documents,</hi> p. 203). Where
                    it is so difficult to establish the date of the marriage, a simple fact, it must
                    be infinitely harder to discover the truth as to the conduct of Madame Molière.
                    The abominable assertions of the anonymous libel, <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Intrigues</hi><hi rend="italic">de Molière et celles de sa Femme; ou la Fameuse
                    Comédienne</hi> (1688), have found their way into tradition, and are accepted by
                    many biographers. But Μ. Livet and Μ. Bazin have proved that the alleged lovers
                    of Madame Molière were actually absent from France, or from the court, at the
                    time when they are reported, in the libel, to have conquered her heart. A
                    conversation between Chapelle and Molière, in which the comedian is made to tell
                    the story of his wrongs, is plainly a mere fiction, and is answered in Grimarest
                    by another dialogue between Molière and Rohault, in which Molière only complains
                    of a jealousy which he knows to be unfounded. It is noticed, too, that the
                    contemporary assailants of Molière counted him among jealous, but not among
                    deceived, husbands. The hideous accusation brought by the actor Montfleury, that
                    Molière had married his own daughter, Louis XIV. answered by becoming the
                    godfather of Molière’s child. The king, indeed, was a firm friend of the actor,
                    and, when Molière was accused of impiety on the production of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don Juan</hi> (1665), Louis gave him a pension. We need not try to make Madame
                    Molière a <hi rend="italic">vertu,</hi> as French ladies of the theatre say, but
                    it is certain that the charges against her are unsubstantiated. It is generally
                    thought that Molière drew her portrait in <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bourgeois</hi><hi rend="italic">Gentilhomme,</hi> acte iii. sc.

                <p>From 1662 onwards Molière suffered the increasing hatred of his rival actors. La
                    Grange mentions the visit of Floridor and Montfleury to the queen-mother, and
                    their attempt to obtain equal favour, “la troupe de Molière leur donnant
                    beaucoup de jalouzie” (12th August 1662). On 26th December was played for the
                    first time the admirable <hi rend="italic">École</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Femmes,</hi> which provoked a literary war, and caused a shower of “paper
                    bullets of the brain.” The innocence of Agnes was called indecency; the sermon
                    of Arnolphe was a deliberate attack on Christian mysteries. We have not the
                    space to discuss the religious ideas of Molière; but both in <hi rend="italic"
                    >I.’École</hi><hi rend="italic">des Femmes</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Juan</hi> he does display a bold contempt for the creed of “boiling chaldrons”

                    Perhaps the only biographical matter we gain from Boursault’s play is the
                    interesting fact that Molière was a tennis-player. On 4th November 1663 Molière
                    replied with <hi rend="italic">I.'Impromptu de Versailles,</hi> a witty and
                    merciless attack on his critics, in which Boursault was mentioned by name. The

                <p>In all those quarrels the influence of Corneille was opposed to Molière, while
                    his cause was espoused by Boileau, a useful ally, when “les comédiens et les
                    auteurs, depuis le cèdre [Corneille?] jusqu’à l’hysope, sont diablement animés
                    contre lui” <hi rend="italic">{Impromptu de Versailles,</hi> scène v.).</p>
                <p>Molière’s next piece was <hi rend="italic">Le Marnage Forcé</hi> (15th February
                    1664), a farce with a ballet. The comic character of the reluctant bridegroom
                    excites contemptuous pity, as well as laughter. From the end of April till 22d
                    May the troupe was at Versailles, acting among the picturesque pleasures of that
                    great festival of the king’s. The <hi rend="italic">Princesse d’Élide</hi> was
                    acted for the first time, and the three first acts of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tartuffe</hi> were given. Molière’s natural hatred of hypocrisy had not been
                    diminished by the charges of blasphemy which were showered on him after the <hi
                    rend="italic">École</hi><hi rend="italic">des Femmes.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tartuffe</hi> made enemies everywhere. Jansenists and Jesuits, like the two
                    marquises in <hi rend="italic">I.’Impromptu</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Versailles,</hi> each thought the others were aimed at. Five years passed before
                    Molière got permission to play the whole piece in public. In the interval it was
                    acted before Madame, Condé, the legate, and was frequently read by Molière in
                    private houses. The <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> of 17th May 1664 (a paper
                    hostile to Molière) says that the king thought the piece inimical to religion.
                    Louis was not at that time on good terms with the <hi rend="italic">dévots,</hi>
                    whom his amours scandalized; but, not impossibly, the queen-mother (then
                    suffering from her fatal malady) disliked the play. A most violent attack on
                    Molière, “that demon clad in human flesh,” was written by one Pierre Roullé <hi
                    rend="italic">{Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Roy</hi><hi rend="italic">Glorieux
                    au</hi><hi rend="italic">Monde,</hi> Paris, 1664). This fierce pamphlet was
                    suppressed, but the king’s own copy, in red morocco with, the royal arms,
                    remains to testify to the bigotry of the author, who was curé of Saint
                    Barthélemy. According to Roullé, Molière deserved to be sent through earthly to
                    eternal fires. The play was prohibited, as we have seen, but in August 1665 the
                    king adopted Molière’s troupe as his servants, and gave them the title of
                    “troupe du roy.” This, however, did not cause Molière to relax his efforts to
                    obtain permission for <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tartufe,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe,</hi> as it was variously spelled),
                    and his perseverance was at length successful. That his thoughts were busy with
                    contemporary hypocrisy is proved by certain scenes in one of his greatest
                    pieces, the <hi rend="italic">Festin</hi><hi rend="italic">de Pierre,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Don Juan</hi> (15th February 1665). The legend of <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Juan</hi> was familiar already on the Spanish, Italian, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n656/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0656-0629"/> and French stages. Molière made it a new thing:
                    terrible and romantic in its portrait of <hi rend="italic">un</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">grand seigneur</hi><hi rend="italic">mauvais homme,</hi> modern in
                    its suggested substitution of <hi rend="italic">la humanité</hi> for religion,
                    comic, even among his comedies, by the mirthful character of Sganarelle. The
                    piece filled the theatre, but was stopped, probably by authority, after Easter.
                    It was not printed by Molière, and even in 1682 the publication of the full text
                    was not permitted. Happily the copy of De la Regnie, the chief of the police,
                    escaped obliterations, and gave us the full scene of Don Juan and the Beggar.
                    The piece provoked a virulent criticism <hi rend="italic">(Observations</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur le Festin de Pierre,</hi> 1665). It is allowed that Molière
                    has some farcical talent, and is not unskilled as a plagiarist, but he “attacks
                    the interests of Heaven,” “keeps a school of infidelity,” “insults the king,”
                    “corrupts virtue,” “offends the queen-mother,” and so forth. Two replies were
                    published, one of which is by some critics believed to show traces of the hand
                    of Molière. The king’s reply, as has been shown, was to adopt Molière’s company
                    as his servants, and to pension them. <hi rend="italic">LΑmour</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Médecin,</hi> a light comedy, appeared 22d September 1665. In this
                    piece Molière, for the second time, attacked physicians. In December there λvas
                    a quarrel with Racine about his play of <hi rend="italic">Alexandre,</hi> which
                    he treacherously transferred to the Hôtel de Bourgogne. June <hi rend="italic"

                    as the original second title ran). This piece, perhaps the masterpiece of
                    Molière, was more successful with the critics, with the court, and with
                    posterity than with the public. The rival comedians called it “a new style of
                    comedy,” and so it was. The eternal passions and sentiments of human nature,
                    modified by the influence of the utmost refinement of civilization, were the
                    matter of the piece. The school for scandal kept by Célimène, with its hasty
                    judgments on all characters, gave the artist a wide canvas. The perpetual strife
                    between the sensible optimism of a kindly man of the world (Philinte) and the
                    <hi rend="italic">saeva</hi><hi rend="italic">indignatio</hi> of a noble nature
                    soured (Alceste) supplies the intellectual action. The humours of the joyously
                    severe Célimène and of her court, especially of that deathless minor poet
                    Oronte, supply the lighter comedy. Boileau, Lessing, Goethe have combined to
                    give this piece the highest rank even among the comedies of Molière. As to the
                    “keys” to the characters, and the guesses about the original from whom Alceste
                    was drawn, they are as valueless as other contemporary tattle.</p>
                <p>A briefer summary must be given of the remaining years of the life of Molière.
                    The attractions of <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Misanthrope</hi>
                    were reinforced (6th August) by those of the <hi rend="italic">Médecin
                    Malgré</hi><hi rend="italic">Lui,</hi> an amusing farce founded on an old <hi
                    rend="italic">fabliau.</hi> In December the court and the comedians went to
                    Saint Germain, where, among other diversions, the pieces called <hi
                    rend="italic">Mel·icerte, La Pastorale</hi><hi rend="italic">Comique</hi> (of
                    which Molière is said to have destroyed the MS.), and the charming little piece
                    <hi rend="italic">Le Sicilien,</hi> were performed. A cold and fatigue seem to
                    have injured the health of Molière, and we now hear of the consumptive tendency
                    which was cruelly ridiculed in <hi rend="italic">Élomire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hypochondre.</hi> Molière was doubtless obliged to see too much of the
                    distracted or pedantic physicians of an age when medicine was the battlefield of
                    tradition, superstition, and nascent chemical science. On 17th April 1667
                    Robinet, the rhyming gazetteer, says that the life of Molière was thought to be
                    in danger. On the 10th of June, however, he played in <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Sicilien</hi> before the town. In the earlier months of 1667 Louis XIV. was with
                    the army in Flanders. There were embassies sent from the comedy to the camp, and
                    on 5th August it was apparent that Molière had overcome the royal scruples. <hi
                    rend="italic">Tartuffe</hi> was played, but Lamoignon stopped it after the first
                    night. La Grange and La Torillière hastened to the camp, and got the king’s
                    promise that he would reconsider the matter on his return. Molière’s next piece
                    (13th January 1668) was <hi rend="italic">Amphitryon,</hi> a free—a very
                    free—adaptation from Plautus, who then seems to have engaged his attention, for
                    not long afterwards he again borrowed from the ancient writer in <hi
                    rend="italic">I.’Avare.</hi> There is a controversy as to whether <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphitryon</hi> was meant to ridicule Μ. de Montespan, the husband
                    of the new mistress of Louis XIV. Michelet has a kind of romance based on this
                    probably groundless hypothesis. The king still saw the piece occasionally, after
                    he had purged himself and forsworn sack under Madame de Maintenon, and probably
                    neither he nor that devout lady detected any personal references in the coarse
                    and witty comedy. As usual, Molière was accused of plagiarizing, this time from
                    Rotrou, who had also imitated Plautus. The next play was the immortal <hi
                    rend="italic">George Dandin</hi> (10th July), first played at a festival at
                    Versailles. Probably the piece was a rapid palimpsest on the ground of one of
                    his old farces, but the addition of these typical members of a county family,
                    the De Sotenville, raises the work from farce to satiric comedy. The story is
                    borrowed from Boccaccio, but is of unknown age, and always new,—Adolphus Crosbie
                    in <hi rend="italic">The Small House at Allington</hi> being a kind of modern
                    George Dandin. Though the sad fortunes of this peasant with social ambition do
                    not fail to make us pity him somewhat, it is being too refined to regard <hi
                    rend="italic">George Dandin</hi> as a comedy with a concealed tragic intention.
                    Molière must have been at work on <hi rend="italic">E</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Avare</hi> before <hi rend="italic">George Dandin</hi> appeared, for the new
                    comedy after Plautus was first acted on 9th September. There is a tradition that
                    the piece almost failed; but, if unpopular in the first year of its production,
                    it certainly gained favour before the death of its author. <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    de Pourceaugnac</hi> (17th September 1669) was first acted at Chambord, for the
                    amusement of the king. It is a rattling farce. The physicians, as usual, bore
                    the brunt of Molière’s raillery, some of which is still applicable. Earlier in
                    1669 (5th February) <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe</hi> was played at last, with
                    extraordinary success. <hi rend="italic">Les Amants Magnifiques,</hi> a
                    comedy-ballet, was acted first at Saint Germain (10th February 1670). The king
                    might have been expected to dance in the ballet, but from Racine’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Britannicus</hi> (13th December 1669) the majestical monarch
                    learned that Nero was blamed for exhibitions of this kind, and he did not wish
                    to out-Nero Nero. Astrology this time took the place of medicine as a butt, but
                    the satire has become obsolete, except, perhaps, in Turkey, where astrology is
                    still a power. The <hi rend="italic">Bourgeois</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gentilhomme,</hi> too familiar to require analysis, was first played on 23d
                    October 1770. The lively <hi rend="italic">Fourberies</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Scapin</hi> “saw the footlights” (if footlights there were) on 24th May 1671,
                    and on 7th May we read in La Grange, “les Repetitions de Spsyche ont commancé.”
                    La Grange says the theatre was newly decorated and fitted with machines. A
                    “concert of twelve violins” was also provided, the company being resolute to
                    have everything handsome about them. New singers were introduced, who did not
                    refuse to sing unmasked on the stage. Quinault composed the words for the music,
                    which was by Lulli; Molière and Pierre Corneille collaborated in the dialogue of
                    this magnificent opera, the name of which <hi rend="italic">(Psyché}</hi> La
                    Grange eventually learned how to spell. The <hi rend="italic">Comtesse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’Escarbagnas</hi> (2d February 1672) was another piece for the
                    amusement of the court, and made part of an entertainment called <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Ballet des Ballets.</hi> In this play, a
                    study of provincial manners, Molière attacked the financiers of the time in the
                    person of Μ. Harpin. The comedy has little importance compared with <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Femmes</hi><hi rend="italic">Savantes</hi> (11th February), a
                    severer <hi rend="italic">Précieuses,</hi> in which are satirized the vanity and
                    affectation of sciolists, pedants, and the women who admire them. The satire is
                    never out of date, and finds its modern form in <pb break="no"

                    by Μ. Pailleron. On the 17 th February Madeleine Béjard died, and was buried at
                    St Paul. She did not go long before her old friend or lover, Molière. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Mariage Forcé,</hi> founded, perhaps, on a famous anecdote of De
                    Gramont, was played on 8th July. On 7th August La Grange notes that Molière was
                    indisposed, and there was no comedy. Molière’s son died on the 11th October. On
                    2 2d November the preparations for the <hi rend="italic">Malade Imaginaire</hi>
                    were begun. On 10th February 1673 the piece was acted for the first time. What
                    occurred on 17 th February we translate from the <hi rend="italic">Registre</hi>
                    of La Grange :—</p>
                <p>“This same day, about ten o’clock at night, after the comedy, Monsieur de Molière
                    died in his house, Rue de Richelieu. He had played the part of the said Malade,
                    suffering much from cold and inflammation, which caused a violent cough. In the
                    violence of the cough he burst a vessel in his body, and did not live more than
                    half an hour or three-quarters after the bursting of the vessel. His body is
                    buried at St Joseph’s, parish of St Eustache. There is a gravestone raised about
                    a foot above the ground.”</p>
                <p>Molière’s funeral is thus described in a letter, said to be by an eye-witness,
                    discovered by Μ. Benjamin Fillon :—</p>
                <p>“Tuesday, 21st February, about nine in the evening, was buried Jean Baptiste
                    Poquelin Moliere, <hi rend="italic">tapissier</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >valet</hi><hi rend="italic">du chambre,</hi> and a famous actor. There was no
                    procession, except three ecclesiastics; four priests bore the body in a wooden
                    bier covered with a pall, six children in blue carried candles in silver
                    holders, and there were lackeys with burning torches of wax. The body . . . was
                    taken to St Joseph’s churchyard, and buried at the foot of the cross. There was
                    a great crowd, and some twelve hundred livres were distributed among the poor.
                    The archbishop had given orders that Molière should be interred without any
                    ceremony, and had even forbidden the clergy of the diocese to do any service for
                    him. Nevertheless a number of masses were commanded to be said for the
                    deceased.”</p>
                <p>When an attempt was made to exhume the body of Molière in 1792, the wrong tomb
                    appears to have been opened. Unknown is the grave of Molière.</p>
                <p>Molière, according to Mlle. Poisson, who had seen him in her extreme youth, was
                    “neither too stout nor too thin, tall rather than short; he had a noble
                    carriage, a good leg, walked slowly, and had a very serious expression. His nose
                    was thick, his mouth large with thick lips, his complexion brown, his eyebrows
                    black and strongly marked, and it was his way of moving these that gave him his
                    comic expression on the stage.” “His eyes seemed to search the deeps of men’s
                    hearts,” says the author of <hi rend="italic">Zélinde.</hi> The inventories
                    printed by Μ. Soulié prove that Molière was fond of rich dress, splendid
                    furniture, and old books. The charm of his conversation is attested by the names
                    of his friends, who were all the wits of the age, and the greater their genius
                    the greater their love of Molière. As an actor, friends and enemies agreed in
                    recognizing him as most successful in comedy. His ideas of tragic declamation
                    were in advance of his time, for he set his face against the prevalent habit of
                    ranting. His private character was remarkable for gentleness, probity,
                    generosity, and delicacy, qualities attested not only by anecdotes but by the
                    evidence of documents. He is probably (as Menander is lost) the greatest of all
                    comic writers within the limits of social and refined as distinguished from
                    romantic comedy, like that of Shakespeare, and of political comedy, like that of
                    Aristophanes. He has the humour which is but a sense of the true value of life,
                    and now takes the form of the most vivacious wit and the keenest observation,
                    now of melancholy, and pity, and wonder at the fortunes of mortal men. In the
                    literature of France his is the greatest name, and in the literature of the
                    modern drama the greatest after that of Shakespeare. Besides his contemplative
                    genius he possessed an unerring knowledge of the theatre, the knowledge of a
                    great actor and a great manager, and hence his plays can never cease to hold the
                    stage, and to charm, if possible, even more in the performance than in the
                    reading.</p>
                <p>There is no biography of Molière on a level with the latest researches into his
                    life. The best is probably that of Μ. Taschereau, prefixed to an edition of his
                    works <hi rend="italic">{Oeuvres Complètes,</hi> Paris, 1863). To this may be
                    added Jules Loiseleur’s <hi rend="italic">Les Points</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Obscurs</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Vie de Moliere,</hi> Paris, 1877. We have
                    seen that Μ. Loiseleur is not always accurate, but he is laborious. For other
                    books it is enough to recommend the excellent <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie
                    Moliércsque</hi> of Μ. Paul Lacroix (1875), which is an all but faultless guide.
                    The best edition of Molière’s works for the purposes of the student is that
                    published in <hi rend="italic">Les Grands</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Écrivains</hi><hi rend="italic">de la France</hi> (Hachette, Paris, 1874-1882).
                    The edition is still incomplete. It contains reprints of many contemporary
                    tracts, and, with the <hi rend="italic">Registre</hi> of La Grange, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collection</hi><hi rend="italic">Moliércsque</hi> of Μ. Lacroix,
                    is the chief source of the facts stated in this notice, in cases where the
                    rarity of documents has prevented the writer from studying them in the original
                    texts. Another valuable authority is the <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur
                    Molière et sur sa Famille</hi> of Ed. Soulié (1863). Lotheisen’s <hi

                    rend="italic">seine</hi><hi rend="italic">Werke</hi> (Frankfurt, 1880), is a
                    respectable German compilation. <hi rend="italic">Le Moliériste</hi> (Tresse,
                    Paris, edited by Μ. Georges Monval) is a monthly serial, containing notes on
                    Molière and his plays, by a number of contributors. The essays, biographies,
                    plays, and poems on Molière are extremely numerous. The best guide to these is
                    the indispensable <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie</hi> of Μ. Lacroix. The
                    English biographies are few and as a rule absolutely untrustworthy. (A. I..
