                <p>We have separated the last two from the rest because the methods used for their
                    preparation are more of the character of laboratory operations, and because we
                    do not mean to include these in our general exposition of metallurgic
                    principles. The history of metallurgy, up to the most recent times, is obscure.
                    It is only since about the beginning of this century that the art has come to be
                    at all scientifically criticized; and in the case of the most important
                    processes all that science has been able to do has been merely to put her stamp
                    upon what experience has long found to be right. Great and brilliantly
                    successful scientific efforts in the synthetic line are not wanting, but they
                    all belong to recent times. Science, by its very nature, aims at publicity;
                    empiricism at all times has done the reverse; hence a history of the development
                    of the art of metallurgy does not and cannot exist. A few historical notes on
                    the discovery of certain of the useful metals are given in the introduction to
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Metals</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.).</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >General Sequence of Operations.—</hi> Occasionally metallic ores present
                    themselves in the shape of practically pure compact masses, from which the
                    accompanying matrix or “gangue” can be detached by hand and hammer. But this is
                    a rare exception. In most cases the “ore,” as it comes out of the mine, is
                    simply a mixture of ore proper and gangue, in which the latter not unfrequently
                    predominates so much that it is not the gangue but the ore that really occupies
                    the position of what the chemist would call the impurity. Hence, in general, it
                    is necessary, or at least expedient, to purify the ore as such before the
                    liberation of the metal is attempted. Most metallic ores are specifically
                    heavier than the impurities accompanying them, and their purification may be
                    (and generally is) effected by reducing the crude ore to a fine enough powder to
                    detach the metallic from the earthy part, and then washing away the latter by a
                    current of water, as far as possible. In the case of a “reguline” ore, such as
                    auriferous quartz, for instance, the ore thus concentrated may consist
                    substantially of the metal itself, and require only to be melted down and cast
                    into ingots to be ready for the market. This, however, is a rare case, the vast
                    majority of ores being chemical compounds, which for the extraction of their
                    metals demand chemical treatment. The chemical operations involved may be
                    classified as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Fiery Operations.—</hi> The ore, along in general with some
                    kind of “flux,” is exposed to the direct action of a powerful fire. The fire in
                    most cases has a chemical, in addition to its obvious physical function. It is
                    intended either to burn away certain components of the ore—in which case it must
                    be so regulated as to contain a sufficient excess of unburned oxygen; or it is
                    meant to deoxidize (“reduce ”) the ore, when the draught must be restricted so
                    as to keep the ore constantly wrapped up in combustible flame gases (carbonic
                    oxide, hydrogen, marsh-gas, &amp;c.). The vast majority of the chemical
                    operations of metallurgy fall into this category, and in these processes other
                    metalreducing agents than those naturally contained in the fire (or wind) are
                    only exceptionally employed.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Amalgamation.—</hi> The ore by itself (if it happens to be a
                    reguline one), or the ore plus certain reagents (if it does not), is worked up
                    with mercury so that the metal is obtained ultimately as an amalgam, which can
                    be separated mechanically from the dross. The purified amalgam is subjected to
                    distillation, when the mercury is recovered as a distillate while the metal
                    remains.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Wet Processes.—</hi> Strictly speaking, certain amalgamation
                    methods fall under this head; but, in its ordinary acceptance, the term refers
                    to processes in which the metal is extracted either from the natural ore, or
                    from the ore as it is after roasting or some other preliminary treatment, by
                    means of an aqueous acid or salt solution, and from this solution
                    precipitated—generally in the reguline form—by some suitable reagent.</p>
                <p>Few methods of metal extraction at once yield a pure product. What as a rule is
                    obtained is a more or less impure metal, which requires to be “refined” to
                    become fit for the market. We now pass to the individual consideration of the
                    several steps referred to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Comminution of Ores.—</hi> Assuming the ore to be given in the
                    shape of large lumps, these must first be broken up into small stones (of about
                    the size of those used for macadamizing a road) before they can go to the
                    grinding-mill. This formerly used to be done by handwork; nowadays it is
                    preferably effected by means of an American invention called the stone-breaker
                    (fig. 1). This consists essentially of two substantial vertical iron plates; one
                    is fixed, the other is connected withan excentric worked by an engine so as to
                    alternately dash against and recede from the former. The lumps of ore, in
                    passing through this jaw-like contrivance, are broken up into smaller fragments
                    fit for the mill. For the production of a coarse powder revolving cylinders are
                    often employed. Two cylinders of equal diameter and length, made of iron, steel,
                    or stone, are suspended by parallel axes in close Proximity to each other. The
                    width of the slit between them can e made to vary according to the requirements
                    of the case. The cylinders are made to revolve in opposite directions, so that
                    the stones when run into the groove formed by their lipper halves are drawn
                    between them and are crushed into bits of a size depending on the least distance
                    between the two surfaces. Exceptionally hard stones might bring the machine to a
                    standstill or cause breakages; hence only one of the two axes of rotation is
                    absolutely fixed; the cushions of the other are only held in relatively fixed
                    positions, each between a couple of guiding rails, by means of powerful springs
                    at their backs. The springs are made of alternate disks of indiarubber and
                    sheet-iron, and yield appreciably only to very strong pressures. When an
                    exceptionally hard stone comes on, they yield <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n68/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0068-0059"/> and allow it to pass through uncrushed. Sometimes
                    two sets of cylinders are arranged one above the other, so that the grit from
                    the upper falls into the jaws of the lower set to receive further comminution.
                    The diameter of the cylinders is from a foot to a yard, their length from 9
                    inches to a yard, the velocity of a point on the periphery a foot to a yard per
                    second. The quantity of ore reduced per hour per horse-power is about 5 cubic
                    feet for quartz or other hard minerals, and about 14 cubic feet for minerals of
                    moderate hardness.</p>
                <p>For the production of a relatively fine powder the pounding-mill is frequently
                    used, which, in its action, is analogous to a mortar and pestle. The mortar is a
                    rectangular trough, while the pestle is replaced by a parallel set of heavy
                    metal or metal-shod beams, which (by means of a revolving cylinder with cogs
                    catching projections on the beams) are lifted up in succession and tlιen let
                    fall by their own weight so as to pound up the ore in the trough. The ore is
                    supplied from a prismatic reservoir with a sloping bottom leading into a canal
                    through which the stones slide into the trough. A current of water, which
                    constantly flows into the trough from below, lifts up the finer particles and
                    carries them away over the edge of the trough into a settling tank.</p>
                <p>The object pursued in powdering an ore is to prepare it for being purified by
                    washing. But the velocity with which a solid particle falls through water
                    depends on its size as well as on its specific gravity—an increase in either
                    accelerating the fall; hence, where the difference in specific gravity between
                    the things to be separated is small, the washing must be preceded by a
                    separation of the ore-powder into portions of approximately equal fineness. This
                    is often effected by passing the ore through a system of sieves of different
                    width of mesh superposed over one another, the coarser sieve always occupying
                    the higher position. Sometimes the sieves are made to “go dry,” sometimes they
                    are aided in their action by a current of water which, more effectually than
                    mere shaking, prevents adherence of dust to coarser parts.</p>
                <p>Another contrivance is the “Drum” (fig. 2). A long perforated circular cylinder
                    made of sheet-iron, open at both ends, is suspended, in a sloping position, by a
                    revolving shaft passing through its axis. The size of the perforations is
                    generally made to increase in passing from the upper to the lower belts of the
                    cylinder. While the drum is revolving, the ore, suspended in water, flows in at
                    the upper end, and in travelling down it casts off first its finest and then its
                    coarser parts, the coarsest only reaching the exit at the lower end. The several
                    grades of powder produced fall each into a separate division of the collecting
                    tank.</p>
                <p>The drum, or course, is subject to endless modifications. A very ingenious
                    combination is H. E. Taylor’s “Drum Dressing Machine’’ (fig. 3). It consists of
                    three truncated cone-shaped drums D, fixed co-axially to the same horizontal
                    revolving shaft, so that the narrow end of No. 1 projects into the wider end of
                    No. 2, and No. 2 similarly into No. 3. The drums are not perforated, but are
                    armed inside with screw-threads formed of strips of sheet metal fixed edgeways
                    to the drum. The ore grit to be dressed is placed in a hopper A, and from it, by
                    a worm B fixed to the revolving shaft, is being screwed forward into a short
                    fixed truncated cone C projecting into the revolving drum No. 1, into which it
                    flows in a constant current. The rotary motion of the drum tends to convey the
                    ore along the spiral path prescribed by the screw-thread towards the other end,
                    and from it into drum No. 2, and so on. But the ore in each drum meets with a
                    jet of water E impelling it the opposite way, and the effect is that, in each
                    drum, the lighter parts follow the water, and with it run off over the entrance
                    edge to be collected in a special tank, while the coarser parts roll down the
                    spiral path toward the next drum to undergo further parting. The tank or pit for
                    drum 1 receives the finest and lightest parts, that of drum 2 a heavier, that of
                    drum 3 a still heavier portion, while only the very heaviest matter finds its
                    way out of the exit end of No. 3 into a fourth receptacle.</p>
                <p>Of the large number of other ore-dressers, only two need be mentioned here.</p>
                <p>The “Clausthal Turn-Table” consists of a circular table, the surface of which
                    rises from the periphery towards the centre so as to form a very flat cone of
                    about 170°, which is fixed co-axially to a vertical rotary shaft. At the apex of
                    the table, surrounding the shaft, but independent of its motion, there is a
                    circular trough of sheet zinc, divided into two compartments; one receives a
                    stream of water carrying the ore, the other a supply of pure water. A large
                    annular trough of sheet zinc is placed below the periphery of the table, so as
                    to receive whatever may fall over the edge. It also is divided into
                    compartments, as shall be explained further on. Supposing the table to be at
                    rest, a sector of about 60° of it would be constantly run over by the ore-mud
                    out of the first compartment of the upper trough. This mud current would suffer
                    partial separation into heavier and lighter parts,—rich ore resting in the
                    higher and poorer in the lower latitudes, and a still poorer ore falling over
                    the periphery into the lower trough. The same happens with the moving table;
                    only each sector of such partially analysed ore undergoes further purification
                    by passing through about 90° of watershower. After passing this, it meets with a
                    perforated fixed waterpipe going up radially to about half the radius of the
                    table. This pipe also carries sweeping brushes, so that the belt of ore from the
                    lower latitudes of the table is swept off into the corresponding section of the
                    receiving trough. What of ore remains on the higher latitudes subsequently meets
                    with a similar arrangement which sweeps it off into its compartment. If the
                    table turns from the left to the right, and we follow the process, beginning at
                    the left edge of the ore-mud compartment, it will be seen that a first sector of
                    the receiving trough gathers the light dross, a succeeding one an intermediate
                    product, a third the most highly purified ore. The “intermediate” is generally
                    run into the ore-mud trough of a second table to be further analysed.</p>
                <p>In the “Continuous Wash-Pumps” (Continuirliche Setzpumpe) of the Harz, three
                    funnel-shaped vessels (one of which is shown in fig. 4) are set in a frame
                    beside one another, but at different levels, so that any overfloλv from No. 1
                    runs into No. 2 and thence into No. 3. Each funnel communicates below with its
                    own compartment of a common cistern.</p>
                <p>Into each funnel a riddle with narrow meshes is inserted somewhere near the upper
                    end, while, beside the riddle, there is a pump of short range, which, by means
                    of an excentric, is worked so that the piston alternately goes rapidly down and
                    slowly up. The mode of working is best explained by an example. At Breinigerberg
                    in Rhenish Prussia the apparatus serves to separate a complex ore into the
                    following four parts, which we enumerate in the order of their specific

                    most striking is that nothing will pass through the bed of galena but what is at
                    least as heavy as galena itself. In a similar manner No. 2 and No. 3 <pb

                    apparatus is said to do its work with a wonderful degree of precision, and of
                    course is susceptible of wider application, but it ceases to work when the raw
                    material is a slime so fine that the particles fall too slowly.</p>

                    be said on this topic has already been anticipated in the articles <hi

                    a few notes may be added on specially metallurgic points.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Furnace Materials. —</hi> In a metallurgic furnace the working
                    parts at least must be made of special materials capable of withstanding the
                    very high temperatures to which they are exposed and the action of the fluxes
                    which may be used. No practically available material fully meets both
                    requirements, but there is no lack of merely fire-proof substances.</p>
                <p>Of native stones, a pure quartzose sandstone, free from marl, may be named as
                    being well adapted for the generality of structures; but such sandstone, or
                    indeed any kind of fire-proof stone, is not always at hand. What is more readily
                    procured, and consequently more widely used, is refractory brick, made from
                    “fire-clay.” The characteristic chemical feature of fire-clays is that in them
                    the clay proper (always some kind of hydrated silicate of alumina) is associated
                    with only small proportions of lime, magnesia, ferrous oxide, or other
                    protoxides. If the percentage of these goes beyond certain limits, the bricks,
                    when strongly heated, melt down into a slag. The presence of free silica, on the
                    other hand, adds to their refractoriness. In fact the best fire-bricks in
                    existence are the so-called Dinas bricks, which consist substantially of silica,
                    contaminated only with just enough of bases to cause it to frit together on
                    being baked. Dinas bricks, however, on account of their high price, are reserved
                    for special cases involving exceptionally high temperatures. Amongst ordinary
                    fire-bricks those from Stourbridge enjoy the highest reputation. It follows from
                    what has just been said that, in a metallurgic furnace, lime-mortar cannot be
                    used as a cement, but must be replaced by fire-clay paste.</p>
                <p>In the construction of cupels, reverberatory furnaces, &amp;c., only the general
                    groundwork is, as a rule, made of built bricks, and this groundwork is coated
                    over with some kind of special fire-proof and flux-proof material, such as
                    bone-ash, a mixture of baked fire-clay and cokes or graphite, or of quartz and
                    very highly silicated slags, &amp;c. These beddings are put on in a loose
                    powdery form, and then stamped fast. They offer the advantage that, when worn
                    out, they are easily removed and renewed. The powerful draught which a
                    metallurgic fire needs can be produced by a chimney, where the fuel forms a
                    relatively shallow layer spread over a large grating; but, when closely-packed
                    deep masses of fuel or fuel and ore have to be kept ablaze, a blast becomes
                    indispensable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chimneys.—</hi> The efficiency of a chimney is measured by the

                    mean temperature of the chimney gases, which theoretically is not
                    unobjectionable; but the weakest point in the formula is the smallness and utter

                    in the case of work on a relatively small scale requiring moderate wind
                    pressure; while the “cylinder blast” comes in where large masses of
                    high-pressure wind are required. Two highly interesting blowing-machines,
                    however, are omitted in that article, which may be shortly described here.</p>
                <p>The “Water Blast” (Wassertrommelgebläse) is interesting historically, having been
                    used metallurgically in Hungary for many centuries. A mass of water, stored up
                    in a reservoir, is made to fall down continuously through a high narrow vertical
                    shaft having air-holes at its upper end. The vertical column of water sucks in
                    air through these holes and carries it down with it into a kind of inverted tub
                    standing in a reservoir kept at a constant level. Air. and water there separate,
                    the former flowing away through a pipe into a wind-box, from which it is led to
                    its destination.</p>
                <p>The “Cagniardelle” (figs. 5,6), so called fromits inventor Cagniard Latour, also
                    utilizes water to carry air, but in quite another way. By means of a round shaft
                    passing through its axis, a cylindrical drum of sheet-metal is suspended
                    slantingly in a mass of water, so that the lower end is fully immersed, while of
                    the upper end the segment above the upper side of the shaft is uncovered. The
                    space between shaft and drum is converted into a very wide screw-shaped canal by
                    a band of sheet-metal hermetically fixed edgeways to the two. Both the top and
                    the bottom end of the drum are partially closed by flat bottoms soldered or
                    riveted to the respective edges; the lower one leaves a ring-shaped opening
                    between its edge and the shaft, which serves for the introduction of a fixed
                    air-pipe bent so as to reach up to near the top of the drum’s air-space; in the
                    upper bottom three quadrants are closed, the fourth is open. Supposing the
                    screw-canal, traced from below, to go from the left to the right, the drum is
                    made to revolve in the same.sense, and the effect is that, in each revolution,
                    the screw-canal at its top end swallows a certain volume of air which, by the
                    succeeding entrance of the water—which, of course, moves relatively to the screw
                    —is pushed towards and ultimately into the air-space at the bottom end. The
                    Cagniardelle yields a perfectly continuous blast, and, as it is not encumbered
                    with any dead resistances except the friction of the shaft against its bearings
                    (which can be reduced to very little) and the very slight friction of the water
                    against the screw-canal, it utilizes a very large percentage of the energy spent
                    on it. This percentage, according to experiments by Schwamkrug, amounts to from
                    75 to 84’5; in the case of the cylinder-blast it is 60 to 65 per cent.; with
                    bellows, about 40 per cent.; with the “Wassertrommelgebläse” 10 to 15 per cent.
                    Hence the “Wassertrommelgebläse” stands last in relative efficiency; but we must
                    not forget that it alone directly utilizes native energy, while, in the cylinder
                    blast, for example, 100 units of work done by the steam-engine involve a vastly
                    greater energy spent on the engine as heat.</p>
                <p>To maintain a desired temperature in a given furnace charged in a certain manner,
                    the introduction of a certain volume of air per unit of time is necessary. But
                    this quantity, in a given blowingmachine, is determined by the over-pressure of
                    the wind, as measured by a manometer, the velocity of the wind being
                    approximately proportional to √M∕(B + Μ), where Μ stands for the height of the
                    mercury-manometer, and B for that of the barometer. Hence the practical
                    metallurgist, in adjusting his blast, has nothing to do but to see that the
                    manometer shows the reading which, by previous trials, has been proved to yield
                    an adequate supply of wind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fuel.—</hi> In some isolated cases the ore itself, by its
                    combustion, supplies the necessary heat for the operation to be performed upon
                    it. Thus, for instance, the roasting of blackband iron-stone is effected by
                    simply piling up the ore and setting fire to it, so that the ore is at the same
                    time its own furnace and fuel; in the Bessemer process of steel-making, the
                    burning carbon of the pig-iron supplies the heat necessary for its own
                    combustion; and a similar process has been tried experimentally, and not
                    λvithout success, for the working up of certain kinds of pyrites. But, as a
                    rule, the high temperatures required for the working of ores are produced by the
                    combustion of extraneous fuel, such as wood, woodcharcoal, coal, coke. Of these
                    four, wood-charcoal is of the widest applicability, but not much used in Britain
                    on account of its high price. High-class coke or pure anthracite, volume for
                    volume, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n70/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0070-0061"/> gives the highest temperature. Wood or coal is
                    indicated when a voluminous Hame is one of the requisites. Obviously fuel of the
                    same kind and quality gives a higher calorific intensity when, before use, it is
                    deprived by drying of its moisture, or when it is used in conjunction with a not
                    instead of a cold blast. This latter principle, as every one knows, is largely
                    discounted in the manufacture of pig-iron, where nowadays coal, with the help of
                    the hot blast, is made to do what formerly could only be effected with charcoal
                    or coke. For further information see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fuel</hi> and <hi

                <p>The method to be adapted for the extraction of a metal from its ore is determined
                    chiefly, though not entirely, by the nature of the non-metallic component with
                    which the metal is combined. The simplest case is that of the reguline ores
                    where there is no non-metallic element. The important cases are those of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gold, Bismuth,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Mercury</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi><hi rend="italic">Oxides, Hydrates, Carbonates, and
                    Silicates. —</hi> All iron and tin ores proper fall under this heading, which,
                    besides, comprises certain ores of copper, of lead, and of zinc. In any case the
                    first step consists in subjecting the crude ore to a roasting process, the
                    object of which is to remove the water and carbonic acid, and burn away, to some
                    extent at least, what there may be of sulphur, arsenic, or organic matter. The
                    residue consists of an impure (perhaps a very impure) oxide of the respective
                    metal, which in all cases is reduced by treatment with fuel at a high
                    temperature. Should the metal be present in the silicate form, lime must be
                    added in the smelting to remove the silica and liberate the oxide.</p>
                <p>In the case of zinc the temperature required for the reduction lies above the
                    boiling point of the metal; hence the mixture of ore and reducing agent
                    (charcoal is generally used) must be heated in a retort combined with the
                    necessary condensing apparatus. In all the other cases the reduction is effected
                    in the fire itself, a towershaped blast furnace being preferably used. The
                    furnace is charged with alternate layers of fuel and ore (or rather ore and
                    flux, see below), and the whole kindled from below. The metallic oxide, partly
                    by the direct action of the carbon with which it is in contact, but principally
                    by that of the carbonic oxide produced in the lower strata from the oxygen of
                    the blast and the hot carbon there, is reduced to the metallic state; the metal
                    fuses and runs down, with the slag, to the bottom of the furnace, whence both
                    are withdrawn by the periodic opening of plug-holes provided for the
                    purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sulphides.—</hi> Iron, copper, lead, zinc, mercury, silver, and
                    antimony very frequently present themselves in this state of combination, as
                    components of a very numerous family of ores which may be divided into two
                    sections: (1) such as substantially consist of simple sulphides, as iron pyrites
                    (FeS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), galena (PbS), zinc blende (ZnS), cinnabar
                    (HgS); and (2) complex sulphides, such as the various kinds of sulphureous
                    copper ores (all substantially compounds or mixtures of sulphides of copper and
                    iron); bournonite, a complex sulphide of lead, antimony, and copper;
                    rothgiltigerz, sulphide of silver, antimony, and arsenic; fahlerz, sulphides of
                    arsenic and antimony, combined with sulphides of copper, silver, iron, zinc,
                    mercury, silver; and mixtures of these and other sulphides with one another.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of a sulphureous ore, the first step as a rule is to subject it
                    to oxidation by roasting it in a reverberatory or other furnace, which, in the
                    first instance, leads to the burning away of at least part of the arsenic and
                    part of the sulphur. The effect on the several individual metallic sulphides
                    (supposing only one of these to be present) is as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. Those of silver (Ag <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S) and mercury (HgS) yield
                    sulphurous acid gas and metal; in the case of silver, sulphate is formed as an
                    intermediate product, at low temperatures. Metallic mercury, in the
                    circumstances, goes off as a vapour, which is collected and condensed; silver
                    remains as a regulus, but pure sulphide of silver is hardly ever worked.</p>
                <p>2. Sulphides of iron and zinc yield the oxides Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and ZnO as final products, some basic sulphate
                    being formed at the earlier stages, more especially in the case of zinc. The
                    oxides can be reduced by carbon.</p>
                <p>3. The sulphides of lead and copper yield, the former a mixture of oxide and
                    normal sulphate, the latter one of oxide and basic sulphate. Sulphate of lead is
                    stable at a red heat; sulphate of copper breaks up into oxide, sulphurous acid,
                    and oxygen. In practice, neither oxidation process is ever pushed to the end; it
                    is stopped as soon as the mixture of roasting-product and unchanged sulphide
                    contains oxygen and sulphur in the ratio of O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>: S.
                    The access of air is then stopped and the whole heated to a higher temperature,
                    when the potential SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> actually çoes off as
                    sulphurousacid gas and the whole of the metal is eliminated as such. This method
                    is largely utilize^ in the smelting of lead (from galena) and of copper from
                    copper pyrites. In the latter case, however, the sulphide Cιι <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S has first to be produced from the ore, which is done
                    substantially as follows. The ore is roasted with silica until a certain
                    proportion of the sulphur is burned away as SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    while a corresponding proportion of oxygen has gone to the metal part of the
                    ore. Now it so happens that copper has a far greater affinity for sulphur than
                    iron has; hence any locally produced oxide of copper, as long as sufficient
                    sulphide of iron is left, is sure to be reconverted into sulphide, and the final
                    result is that, while a large quantity of oxidized iron passes into the slag,
                    all the copper and part of the iron separate out as a mixed regulus of Cu <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> S and FeS (“mat”). This regulus, by being fused up
                    repeatedly with oxidized copper ores or rich copper slags (virtually with CuO
                    and silica), gradually yields up the whole of its iron, so that ultimately a
                    regulus of pure subsulphide of copper, Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S (“fine
                    mat"), is obtained, which is worked up for metal as above explained.</p>
                <p>4. Sulphide of antimony, when roasted in air, is converted into a kind of alloy
                    of sulphide and oxide; the same holds for iron, only its oxysulphide is quite
                    readily converted into the pure oxide Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> by further roasting. Oxysulphide of antimouy, by
                    suitable processes, can be reduced to metal, but these processes are rarely
                    used, because the same end is far more easily obtained try “precipitation," <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> withdrawing the sulphur by fusion with metallic iron,
                    forming metallic antimony and sulphide of iron. Both products fuse, but readily
                    part, because fused antimony is far heavier than fused sulphide of iron is. A
                    precisely similar method is used occasionally for the reduction of lead from
                    galena. Sulphide of lead when fused together with metallic iron in the
                    proportion of 2Fe: IPbS yields a regulus (-lPb) and a “mat” Fe <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S, which, however, on cooling, decomposes into FeS
                    parts of ordinary sulphide and Fe parts of finely divided iron. What we have
                    just been explaining are only two special cases of a more general metallurgic
                    proposition. According to Fournet, any one of the metals copper, iron, tin,
                    zinc, lead, silver, antimony, arsenic, in general, is capable of desulphurizing
                    or precipitating (at least partially) any of the others that follows it in the
                    series just given, and it does so the more readily and completely the greater
                    the number of intervening terms. Hence, supposing a complete mixture of these
                    metals to be melted down under circumstances admitting of only a partial
                    sulphuration of the whole, the copper has the best chance of passing into the
                    “mat,’’ while the arsenic is the first to be eliminated as such, or, in the
                    presence of oxidants, as oxide.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arsenides.—</hi> Although arsenides are amongst the commonest
                    impurities of ores generally, ores consisting essentially of arsenides are
                    comparatively rare. The most important of them are certain double arsenides of
                    cobalt and nickel, which in practice, however, are always contaminated with the
                    arsenides or other compounds of foreign metals, such as iron, manganese, &amp;c.
                    The general mode of working these ores is as follows. The ore is first roasted
                    by itself, when a part of the arsenic goes off as such and as oxide (both
                    volatile), while a complex of lower arsenides remains. This residue is now
                    subjected to careful oxidizing fusion in the presence of glass or some other
                    fusible solvent for metallic bases. The effect is that the several metals are
                    oxidized away and pass into the slag (as silicates) in the following
                    order,—first the manganese, secondly the iron, thirdly the cobalt, lastly (and
                    very slowly) the nickel; and at any stage the as yet unoxidized residue of
                    arsenide assumes the form of a fused regulus, which sinks down through the slag
                    as a “speis.” (This term, as will readily be understood, has the same meaning in
                    reference to arsenides as “mat” has in regard to sulphides.) By stopping the
                    process at the right moment, we can produce a speis which contains only cobalt
                    and nickel, and if at this stage also the flux is renewed we can further produce
                    a speis which contains only nickel and a slag which substantially is one of
                    cobalt only. The composition of the speises generally varies from AsMe <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to AsMe <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, where “Me” means one atomic weight of metal in toto,
                    so that in general lMe=αjFe + yCo + zNi, where <hi rend="italic">x+y+∑ =</hi>
                    l.„ The siliceous cobalt is utilized as a blue pigment called “smalte”; the
                    nickel-speis is worked up for metal, preferably by wet processes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minor Reagents.</hi> —Besides the oxidizing and reducing agents
                    naturally present in the fire, and the “fluxes” added for the production of
                    slags, there are various minor reagents, of which the more important may be
                    noticed here. One—namely, metallic iron as a desulphurizer--has already been
                    referred to.</p>
                <p>Oxide of lead, PbO (litharge), is largely used as an oxidizing agent. At a red
                    heat, when it melts, it readily attacks all metals, except silver and gold, the
                    general result being the formation of a mixed oxide and of a mixed regulus, a
                    distnbution, in other words, of both the lead and the metal acted on between
                    slag and regulus. More important and more largely utilized is its action on
                    metallic sulphides, which, in general, results in the formation of three things
                    besides sulphurous acid gas, viz., a mixed oxide slag including the excess of
                    litharge, a regulus of lead (which may include bismuth and other more readily
                    reducible metals), and, if the litharge is not sufficient for a complete
                    oxidation, a “mat; comprising the more readily sulphurizable metals. Oxide of
                    lead, being a most powerful solvent for metallic oxides generally, is also <pb

                    from base metallic oxides.</p>
                <p>Metallic lead is to metals generally what oxide of lead is to metallic oxides. It
                    accordingly is available as a solvent for so to say licking up small particles
                    of metal diffused throughout a mass of slag or other dross, and uniting them
                    into one regulus. This naturally leads us to consider the process of
                    “cupellation,” which discounts the solvent powers of both metallic lead and its
                    oxide. This process serves for the extraction of gold and silver from their
                    alloys with base metals such as copper, antimony, &amp;c. The first step is to
                    fuse up the alloy with a certain proportion of lead, which is determined by the
                    weight of base metal to be eliminated, and is always sufficient to produce a
                    lead-alloy of low fusing point. This alloy is heated on a shallow dish-shaped
                    bed of bone earth to redness, and at this temperature subjected to the action of
                    air. The base metals (copper, &amp;c. ) are oxidized away, the first portions as
                    an infusible scum containing little oxide of lead, the latter in the form of a
                    solution in molten litharge. Lead is, in general, less oxidizable than the other
                    base metals; hence the last instalment of liquid litharge which runs off is
                    pure, and the ultimately remaining regulus consists of silver and gold only.
                    These latter may be separated by nitric acid or boiling oil of vitriol, which
                    converts the silver into soluble salts and leaves the gold.</p>
                <p>Oxide of iron, and also binoxide of manganese, are used for the decarburation of
                    pig-iron. The oxygen of the reagent burns the carbon of the pig into carbonic
                    acid, while the metal of the reagent becomes iron and FeO or MnO respectively,
                    the oxides uniting with the silica added as such, or formed by the oxidation of
                    the silicon of the pig, into a fusible slag.</p>
                <p>Iron pyrites, FeS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is employed for the preliminary
                    concentration of traces of gold diffused throughout slags or base ores. The
                    reagent, through the action of the heat, gives up one-half of its sulphur, which
                    reduces part of the metallic oxides present. The gold and silver unite with what
                    is left of protosulphide of iron (FeS) into a mat, which is then worked up for
                    the noble metals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fluxes.—</hi> Practically speaking, all ores are contaminated
                    with more or less of gangue, which in general consists of infusible matter, and
                    consequently, if left unheeded in the reduction of the metallic part of the ore,
                    would retain more or less of the metal disseminated through it, or at best foul
                    the furnace. To avoid this, the ore as it goes into the furnace is mixed with
                    “fluxes” so selected as to convert the gangue into a fusible “slag,” which
                    readily runs down through the fuel with the regulus and separates from the
                    latter. The quality and proportion of flux should, if possible, be so chosen
                    that the formation of the slag sets in only after the metal has been reduced and
                    molten; or else part of the basic oxide of the metal to be extracted may be
                    dissolved by the slag and its reduction thus be prevented or retarded. Slags are
                    not, as one might be inclined to think, a necessary evil; if an ore were free
                    from gangue we should add gangue and flux from without to produce a slag,
                    because one of its functions is to form a layer on the regulus which protects it
                    against the further action of the blast or furnace gases. Fluxes may be arranged
                    under the three heads of (1) fluor-spar (which is <hi rend="italic">sui
                    generis'),</hi> (2) basic fluxes, and (3) acid fluxes.</p>
                <p>Fluor-spar owes its name to the facility with which it fuses up at a red heat
                    with silica, sulphates of lime and barium, and a few other infusible substances
                    into homogeneous masses. It shows little tendency to dissolve basic oxides, such
                    as lime, &amp;c. One part of fluor-spar liquefies about half a part of silica,
                    four parts of sulphate of lime, and one and a half parts of sulphate of baryta.
                    Upon these facts its wide application in metallurgy is founded.</p>
                <p>Carbonate of soda (or potash) may be said to be the most powerful of basic
                    fluxes. It dissolves silica and all silicates into fusible glasses. On the other
                    hand, borax may be taken as a type for the acid fluxes. At a red heat, when it
                    forms a viscid fluid, it readily dissolves up all basic oxides into fusible
                    complex borates. Now the gangue of an ore in general consists either of some
                    basic material such as carbonate of lime (or magnesia), ferric oxide, alumina,
                    &amp;c., or of silica (quartz) or some more or less acid silicate, or else of a
                    mixture of the two classes of bodies. So any kind of gangue might be liquefied
                    by means of borax or by means of alkaline carbonate; but neither of the two is
                    used otherwise than for assaying; what the practical metal-smelter does is to
                    add to a basic gangue the proportion of silica, and to an acid ore the
                    proportion of lime, or, indirectly, of ferrous or perhaps manganous oxide, which
                    it may need for the formation of a slag of the proper qualities. The slag must
                    possess the proper degree of saturation. In other words, taking SiO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + nMeO (where MeO means an equivalent of base) as a
                    formula for the potential slag, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> must have the proper
                    value. If <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is too small, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> if
                    the slag is too acid, it may dissolve up part of the metal to be brought out as
                    a silicate; if <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is too great, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the slag too basic, it may refuse to dissolve, for instance, the
                    ferrous oxide which is meant to go into it, and this oxide will then be reduced,
                    and its metal (iron in our example) contaminate the regulus. In reference to the
                    problem under discussion, it is worth noting that oxides of lead and copper are
                    more readily reduced to metals than oxide of iron Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> is to FeO, the latter more readily to FeO
                    than</p>
                <p>FeO itself to metal, and FeO more readily to metal than manganous oxide is. Oxide
                    of calcium (lime) is not reducible at all. The order of basicity in the oxides
                    (their readiness to go into the slag) is precisely the reverse.</p>
                <p>Most slags being, as we have seen, complex silicates, it is a most important
                    problem of scientific metallurgy to determine the relations in this class of
                    bodies between chemical composition on the one hand and fusibility and solvent
                    power for certain oxides (CaO, FeO, SiO, &amp;c.) on the other. Now the
                    composition of a silicate can be stated in an infinite number of ways; but there
                    must be one mode of formulation which reduces the law to its simplest terms. The
                    mode adapted by metallurgists is something like the following. If we start with
                    the quantity H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CJ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> of
                    muriatic acid or the quantity H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> of sulphuric acid, it is clear that to convert either
                    into a normal salt we require such a quantity of base as will convert the H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> of the acid completely into water; but the quantity of
                    base that does so is that containing one atomic weight of oxygen. Hence it is
                    reasonable to define the quantities K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O of potash,

                <p>The names are the metallurgic ones; scientific chemists designate Class I. as
                    orthosilicates, Class II. as metasilicates,Class III. as sesqui-silicates. In
                    the formulae Μ stands for K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Ca, Fe, &amp;c., or
                    for al = ⅜A1, fe = ⅜Fe, &amp;c.; or, shortly, MO for one equivalent of base as
                    above defined. It should be possible to represent each quality of a silicate as
                    a function of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> — , and of the nature of the individual
                    bases <hi rend="italic">m</hi> that make up the RO and (fe or al) 0
                    respectively. Our actual knowledge falls far short of this possibility. The
                    problem, in fact, is a very tough one, the more so as it is complicated by the
                    existence of aluminates, compounds such as Al <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.3CaO, in which the alumina plays the part of acid, and
                    the occasional existence of compounds of fluorides and silicates in certain
                    slags. The following notes on the fusibility of simple silicates are taken from
                    Plattner’s researches.</p>
                <p>Of the lime silicates, the tri-silicate melts at 2100° C., the bisilicate at
                    2150°.</p>
                <p>Magnesia silicates are most refractory. The bi-silicate and trisilicate melt in
                    the oxyhydrogen flame at 2250°.</p>
                <p>Of manganous silicates, the easily fusible bi-silicate is yellow or red; the
                    tri-silicate is more refractory.</p>
                <p>Of cuprous (Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> 0) silicates, the bi-silicate is
                    violet, and melts pretty easily; the singulo-silicate is red, dense, and rather
                    refractory.</p>
                <p>Cupric silicates, as slags, hardly exist,—the CuO being always reduced to at
                    least Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> 0.</p>
                <p>Lead silicates all melt readily into yellowish transparent glasses. But they have
                    no standing as slags.</p>
                <p>As regards the ferrous silicates, the singulo-silicate (orthosilicate) fuses at
                    1790° (this is about the composition of iron-puddling slag); the bi-silicate is
                    less readily fusible.</p>
                <p>Ferric silicates (unmixed) do not exist as slags,—the Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> being reduced in the fire to IFeO,
                    although Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    occasionally replaces part of the A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> in complex silicates.</p>
                <p>Alumina silicates are all infusible in even the hottest furnace fires. They begin
                    to soften in the oxyhydrogen flame at about 2400°. But certain aluminates, for
                    instance the salt 3 CaO. 1A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 3</hi> according to Sefström, melt at furnace heats.</p>
                <p>The fusing points of mixtures of two simple silicates cannot be calculated from
                    those of the components. In many cases it is lower than either of the latter
                    two. Thus for instance most magnesialime silicates fuse,—the bi-silicate
                    combination (Mg, Ca)OSiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> most readily.</p>
                <p>Alumina silicates become fusible by addition of a sufficient proportion of
                    silicate of lime at about 1918°. The singulo-silicate and bi-silicate
                    combinations melt into grey glasses. Magnesia acts like lime, and so, in a more
                    limited sense, do ferrous and manganous oxides; but their double compounds with
                    A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and silica are
                    more viscid when fused.</p>
                <p>Plattner’s work is a bold attempt to deal synthetically with the problem here
                    presented, but it does not go the length of even an approximate solution. No one
                    seems to have done much to continue it; hence in the meantime the metallurgist
                    has, for his <pb break="no"

                    which have been made of slags actually produced (by the rule of thumb) in
                    successful metallurgical operations. For some of such slags also Plattner has

                    Assaying.—</hi> To assay an ore originally meant to execute a set of tentative
                    experiments on a small scale in order to find out the proper mode of working it
                    practically. But noλvadays the term is always used in the sense of an analysis
                    carried out to determine the money-value of an ore. For this purpose, in many
                    cases it is sufficient to determine the percentages of the metals for which the
                    ore is meant to be worked. But sometimes nothing short of a complete analysis
                    will do. This holds more especially of ores of iron. As this metal is cheap, the
                    value of an ore containing it depends as much on the nature and relative
                    quantities of the impurities as on the percentage of metal. The proved absence
                    of sulphur and phosphorus may be worth more than an additional 5 per cent, of
                    iron, which latter again would perhaps not compensate for the proved presence of
                    a large percentage of uncombined silica.</p>
                <p>An assay to be of any value must start with a fair sample of the object of sale.
                    The fulfilment of this condition in alt cases is difficult. The general method
                    is, from say a given ship load of ore, to take out (say) half a ton of ore from
                    a large number of different places and to crush this large sample into small
                    fragments of uniform size, which are well shovelled up together. From different
                    parts of this ore-heap a sample of the second order—amounting to, say, 20 lb—is
                    then drawn, and rendered more homogeneous by finer powdering and mixing. From
                    this sample of the second (or perhaps from one of the third) order quantities of
                    1 or 2 lb are bottled up for assaying. At the same time the moisture of the ore
                    is determined, on a large scale, by some conventional method, such as the drying
                    of 1 or 2 lb in an open basin at 100° C., and weighing of the residue as dry
                    ore. This is done at the sampling place by the firms concerned. The assayer
                    further pounds up and mixes his sample, and then proceeds to determine the
                    percentages of moisture and metal in his own way. He has always the choice
                    between two methods, the dry and the wet. For the majority of gold or silver
                    ores, and for cobalt and nickel ores almost as a rule, certain dry-process tests
                    are preferred as the most exact analytically. In almost all other cases it may
                    be said that the wet method is susceptible of the higher degree of precision,
                    yet even in some of these cases the old dry-process tests are preferred to the
                    present day. For instance, all copper ores in the British Isles are sold by the
                    result of the Swansea assay, a kind of imitation of the process of sulphureous
                    copper-ore smelting; and this, singularly, is adhered to even in the case of
                    such cupriferous materials as are worked by the wet way, although the Swansea
                    assay is well known to lose about 1 per cent, of the copper present. A
                    copper-smelter therefore had better buy 5 per cent, than 10 per cent,
                    copper-pyrites cinders, because in the first case he pays only for four-fifths,
                    while in the latter he must pay for nine-tenths of the copper present. To
                    compensate for this anomaly, empirical methods have been contrived tor
                    calculating prices. (W. D.)</p>
