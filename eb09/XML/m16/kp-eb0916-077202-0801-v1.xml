                <p><label type="entry">MONTANA</label>, one of the north-western Territories of the
                    United States, is limited on the N. by British Columbia, on the E. by Dakota, on
                    the S. by Wyoming and Idaho, and on the W. by Idaho. Its boundaries, as
                    established by statute, are as follows :—on the N., the 49th parallel; on the
                    E., the 27th meridian west of Washington, or the 104th west of Greenwich; on the
                    S. and W. the boundary follows the 45 th parallel from the 27 th meridian west
                    to the 34th meridian west, then turns south along the latter meridian to its
                    point of intersection with the continental watershed, thence along the
                    crest-line of this watershed westward and north-westward until it reaches the
                    Bitter-root Mountains; it then follows the crest of this range north-westward to
                    the point where it is crossed by the 39th meridian west, which it follows north
                    to the line of British Columbia. The total area is about 146,080 square miles—an
                    approximate estimate, as the boundary along the continental watershed and the
                    Bitter-root Mountains has not been exactly surveyed. The average elevation above
                    sea-level has been estimated at 3900 feet.</p>
                <p>Topographically, Montana may be separated into two great divisions—that of the
                    plains comprising the eastern two-thirds, and that of the mountains comprising
                    the western portion. The former, a monotonous rolling expanse, broken only by
                    the beds of the few streams which traverse it, and by a few small groups of
                    hills, extends over nine degrees of longitude in a gentle uniform slope, rising
                    from 2000 feet above the sea at the eastern boundary to 4000 at the base of the
                    Rocky Mountains. Except along the streams and upon the scattered groups of
                    hills, this section is entirely devoid of forest-growth of any kind. Vegetation
                    is limited to the bunch grasses, artemisia, and cacti. The grasses are the most
                    abundant and luxuriant near the mountains, where the rainfall is greatest. The
                    mountain section, comprising the western third of the Territory, is composed, in
                    general terms, of a succession of ranges and valleys running very uniformly
                    somewhat in a north-west and south-east direction. The mountains vary in height
                    from 8000 to 10,000, even in isolated cases reaching 11,000 feet, with
                    mountain-passes 6000 to 8000 feet above the sea. Towards the north the ranges
                    become almost continuous, forcing the streams into long and circuitous courses
                    in order to disentangle themselves from the maze of mountains, while, on the
                    other hand, the ranges of the south-western part of the Territory are much
                    broken, affording numerous low passes and water-gaps.</p>
                <p>In the mountainous part of the Territory are the headwaters of the Missouri
                    (Atlantic basin) and Clark’s Fork of the Columbia (Pacific basin). The former
                    rises in the south-west of the territory in three large branches, the Jefferson,
                    Madison, and Gallatin, which meet at the foot of the Gallatin valley at a point
                    known as the " Three Forks of the Missouri.” Here the Missouri is a good-sized
                    stream, fordable with difficulty even when the current is lowest. From this
                    point to its mouth navigation is possible when the stream is not below its mean
                    height; it is interrupted only at the Great Falls of the Missouri, near Fort
                    Benton, above which, however, it is practically little used for navigation. Its
                    other principal tributaries in its upper course are the Sun, Teton, Marias,
                    Musselshell, and Milk rivers, all of which vary much in size with the season,
                    —the last two being nearly or quite dry near their ihouths in the fall of the
                    year. The Yellowstone, one of the most important tributaries of the Missouri,
                    has nearly all its course in Montana, and is navigable for small steamers as far
                    as the Crow Agency, except when the water is low. Clark’s Fork of the Columbia
                    is formed by the junction of the Flathead and the Missoula or Hellgate river.
                    The former rises in the mountains of British Columbia and flows nearly south
                    through Flathead Lake to its point of junction with the Missoula. The latter
                    rises opposite the Jefferson river and flows north-westward, receiving on its
                    way several large affluents. Below the point of junction of these streams,
                    Clark’s Fork flows north-west along the <pb break="no"

                    This stream is very rapid, and is not navigable. Its course, as well as those of
                    most of its tributaries, passes through narrow valleys, the surrounding country
                    being well watered and covered with dense forests of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Coniferae.</hi><hi rend="italic">Geology. —</hi> Most of the mountain area
                    belongs to the Eozoic and Silurian formations. Along the base of the mountains
                    is a Triassic belt of variable width. Succeeding this is a broad area of nearly
                    horizontal Cretaceous beds, followed by the Tertiary formation, which covers
                    nearly one-third of the Territory. These recent formations are interrupted here
                    and there by volcanic upheavals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of Montana differs almost as greatly
                    in different parts of the Territory as that of California. In the northwest it
                    resembles that of the Pacific coast. The westerly winds blowing off the Pacific
                    do not meet with as formidable a barrier as farther south, and consequently are
                    not chilled, or deprived of so large a proportion of their moisture. The result
                    is that the northwestern portion of Montana enjoys a mild temperature and a
                    rainfall sufficient for the needs of agriculture. The valleys of the Kootenai,
                    Flathead, Missoula, and Bitter-root can be cultivated without irrigation with
                    little danger of loss from drought. Farther east and south the rainfall
                    decreases. In the valleys of the upper Missouri, the Jefferson, Madison,
                    Gallatin, and the upper Yellowstone irrigation is almost everywhere required, as
                    well as over the broad extent of the plains. Over most of the Territory the
                    rainfall ranges from 10 to 15 inches annually; in the north-western corner it
                    mes to 25.</p>
                <p>The general temperature is comparatively mild for the latitude, the elevation
                    above the sea being decidedly less than that of the average of the Rocky
                    Mountain region. The mean annual temperature ranges from 40° to 50° Fahr., but
                    the variations are very great and violent. Frosts and snowstorms are possible
                    during every month of the year, so that agriculture and stock-raising are more
                    or less hazardous. On the other hand, the ordinary extremes of temperature are
                    not so great as in more arid portions of the country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forests.—</hi> Throughout the Territory, as everywhere else in
                    the Cordilleran region, forests follow rainfall. The plains are treeless; the
                    mountain valleys about the heads of the Missouri are clothed only with grass and
                    artemisia, many localities extending to a considerable height up the mountains,
                    which are themselves timbered, though not heavily. In the north-western part,
                    roughly defined as the drainage area of Clark’s Fork, where the rainfall is
                    somewhat greater, the forests become of importance. The mountains are forest
                    clad from summit to base; and the narrower valleys are also covered, while the
                    timber is of larger size and of much greater commercial value than elsewhere in
                    the Territory, —the valuable timber consisting entirely of the various species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Coniferae,</hi> pine, fir, cedar, &amp;c. Of the
                    broad-leaved species, willow, aspen, and cotton-wood are abundant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> The native fauna is not sharply distinguished from
                    that of neighbouring States and Territories. The higher latitude is, however,
                    indicated by the relatively greater abundance of species favouring a colder
                    climate. The moose and the Rocky Mountain goat, though by no means abundant,
                    still frequent chosen haunts in the mountains,—the former in the cool marshy
                    valleys, the latter upon the most rugged inaccessible elevations. The
                    black-tailed and mule deer, the antelope, elk, and mountain sheep are abundant,
                    and the bison still ranges the plains, though in sadly reduced numbers. Among
                        <hi rend="italic">Carnivores,</hi> the black and grizzly bears, mountain
                    lion, lynx, wild cat, and several species of wolves are still plentiful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agrivulture and Industry.—</hi> Agriculture is dependent in
                    most parts of Montana upon the supply of water furnished by the streams. Owing
                    to this fact it is probable that not more than 8 per cent, of the total area of
                    the Territory can ever, even under the most economical distribution of the
                    water-supply, be brought under cultivation. In the drainage area of Clark’s Fork
                    are several fine valleys containing a considerable extent of arable land, such
                    as those of the Missoula, Bitter-root, Deer Lodge, Jocko, and Flathead. Upon the
                    head-waters of the Missouri is also a large extent of arable land. The valleys
                    of the Jefferson and Madison also deserve mention. Along the eastern base of the
                    mountains, near the head-waters of the Sun, Teton, and Marias rivers, are
                    considerable areas susceptible of irrigation. Below the Forks the Missouri flows
                    for 75 miles through a broad valley, much of which can be irrigated; below Fort
                    Benton, however, the bluffs become higher and close in on the river. The
                    Yellowstone, also, after leaving the mountains, flows through a similar kind of
                    valley, which extends with a few minor breaks down to the point where the river
                    turns from an east to a north-east course, when it enters a country of <hi
                        rend="italic">mauvaises terres,</hi> which, except as a mausoleum of fossil
                    remains, is utterly valueless.</p>
                <p>Owing to the comparatively isolated position of the Territory, agricultural
                    pursuits have been limited by the demands of home consumption. The census of
                    1880 reported the area in farms to consist of 405,683 acres, with an average of
                    267 acres to each farm. The whole is less than one-half per cent, of the entire
                    area of the Territory. The improved land is reported as amountin" to 262,611
                    acres. The follθλving are the amounts of the principal agricultural
                    products:—wheat, 469,688 bushels; maize, 5689 bushels; oats, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n803/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0916-0803-0774"/> 900,915 bushels; barley, 39,970 bushels; hay,
                    63,947 tons; wool, 995,484 pounds ;—value of all farm products, $2,024,923. The
                    livestock interest is large, and is increasing rapidly. The great extent of
                    pasture afforded by the plains and the broad valleys of the mountains would seem
                    to promise an almost unlimited extension of this industry in the future. Both
                    cattle and sheep owners, however, labour under disadvantages as compared with
                    the owners farther south. The lower temperature and heavier snows, and
                    particularly the danger of great extremes of temperature, require that provision
                    of shelter and food be made for a part or all of the winter season, otherwise
                    the rancheman runs the risk of occasional severe losses. The census of 1880
                    furnishes the following statistics of live-stock :—horses, 35,114; mules and
                    asses, 858; working oxen, 936; milch cows, 11,308; other cattle, 160,143; sheep,
                    184,277; swine, 10,278 ;—total value of live-stock, $5,151,554.</p>
                <p>In mineral production Montana has never taken a leading place, although in the
                    early days some of the placer ground yielded well. The rich placers of Little
                    Prickly Pear, Bannack, and Alder Gulch were quickly exhausted. The produce of
                    the latter has been reported variously at from $25,000,000 to $40,000,000, the
                    greater part of which was extracted in a few months. In the year 1879-80
                    $1,805,767 worth of gold and $2,905,068 of silver were extracted, about
                    three-fourths from deep mines and one-fourth from placers. For the year 1882 the
                    total mineral production is reported at $8,004,000, of which about $1,000,000
                    was for copper and lead.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> Owing largely to its remote position the
                    population as well as the material prosperity of Montana have had a slow growth
                    in comparison with other more favoured portions of the west. The population in
                    1880, as reported by the census, was 39,159 (28,177 males, and 10,982
                    females),—an increase of 90 1 per cent, over that in 1870. There were 27,638
                    natives, and 11,521 of foreign birth, while 35,385 were whites, 346 negroes or
                    of mixed negro blood, 1765 Chinese, and 1663 citizen Indians. By far the greater
                    portion of the population is found in the western half, upon the head-waters of
                    the Missouri and Clark’s Fork. The eastern half is as yet but very sparsely
                    settled, and probably it will never sustain more than a small population.</p>
                <p>The Territory is divided into eleven counties, which, with their population in
                    1880, were the following: — Beaverhead, 2712; Choteau, 3058; Custer, 2510;
                    Dawson, 180; Deer Lodge, 8876; Gallatin, 3643; Jefferson, 2464; Lewis and Clark,
                    6521; Madison, 3915; Meagher, 2743; Missoula, 2537. The principal settlements
                    are—Helena, the capital (3624); Butte, a mining town (3363); and Bozeman, in the
                    Gallatin valley upon the Northern Pacific Railway, which in 1880 had a
                    population of 894 and has probably double that number at present (1883).</p>
                <p>The total number of Indians in Montana is estimated by the Indian office at
                    19,764. These are nominally congregated at five agencies, although in reality
                    they roam over the entire Territory. They are of various tribes, the principal
                    of which are the Sioux, Crow, Blackfoot, Gros Ventre, Assinaboine, and Pend’
                    d’Oreille. Their reservations cover more than one-third of the Territory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government and Finance.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    government of Montana is similar to that of the other Territories. The governor,
                    secretary, chief justice, and two associate justices are appointed by the
                    president of the United States. The treasurer, auditor, and superintendent of
                    public instruction are elected by the people of the Territory, as are also the
                    members of the two houses of the legislature. Montana is represented in Congress
                    by a delegate, also elective, who has liberty to take part in debate but has no
                    vote. The Territorial debt at the close of 1881 was but $70,000. The amount
                    raised by Territorial taxation was $93,211.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The Montana country was originally acquired by
                    the United States under the Louisiana purchase. It became successively a part of
                    Louisiana Territory, of Missouri Territory, of Nebraska Territory, and of
                    Dakota. On 26th May 1864 it was organized under a Territorial government of its
                    own, with practically its present boundaries. The exploration of this region
                    commenced with the celebrated expedition of Lewis and Clark in 1803-1806.
                    Between 1850 and 1855 it was traversed and mapped by a number of exploring
                    parties, having in view the selection of trans-continental railroad routes.
                    Since then numberless expeditions have examined it, and some systematic
                    topographic work has been done under different branches of the United States
                    Government. The first settlers entered the Territory in 1861, discovered placer
                    gold on Little Prickly Pear Creek, and shortly after built the city of Helena.
                    Later, the placers at Bannack were discovered, and a small “rush” to the
                    Territory commenced. In 1863 the rich placers at Alder Gulch were brought to
                    view, and miners and adventurers swarmed in from all parts. Then it was that the
                    early social history of California was repeated on a smaller scale in Montana.
                    The lawless elements assumed control, and for many months neither life nor
                    property was safe. Indeed, for a time the community was in a state of blockade;
                    no one with money in his possession could get out of the Territory. Finally, the
                    citizens organized a “Vigilance Committee” for self-preservation, took the
                    offensive, and after a short sharp struggle rid the community of its disturbing
                    elements. After the exhaustion of the placers, the population decreased, owing
                    to the migration of the floating mining class; but their place was soon taken by
                    more permanent settlers. (H. G*.)</p>
