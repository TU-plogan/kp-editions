                <p><label type="entry">MENNONITES</label> is a name borne by certain Christian
                    communities in Europe and America, denoting their adherence to a type of
                    doctrine of which Menno Simons <pb break="no"

                    exponent at the time when the anti-paedo-baptism of the congregations in which
                    he laboured took permanent form in opposition to ordinary Protestantism on the
                    one hand and to the theocratic ideas of the Münster type of anabaptism on the
                    other. The original home of the views afterwards called Mennonite was in Zürich,
                    where, as early as 1525, Grebel and Manz founded a community having for its most
                    distinctive mark baptism upon confession of faith. The chief doctrines of these
                    Zürich Baptists have been already stated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Baptists,</hi> vol. iii. p. 353. The main interest of the sect lay not in dogma
                    but in discipline. Within the communities evangelical life was reduced to a law
                    of separation from the world, and this separation—enforced by a stringent use of
                    excommunication and the prohibition of marriage beyond the brotherhood—involved
                    not only abstinence from worldly vanities but refusal of civic duties (the state
                    being held to be un-Christian)—refusal to take an oath or use the sword. In
                    their revolt against the corruptions of the mediaeval church the Reformers
                    neither denied the continuity of the church as an organization nor impugned the
                    Christian character of the state. The new sect did both; and their position thus
                    appeared so radically subversive of the foundations of society that it is not
                    surprising, under the imperfect views of toleration then current, that they
                    became the objects of bitter persecution from Protestants as well as from
                    Catholics. But the Grebelians had no desire, like the fanatics of Münster, to
                    found a new theocracy in opposition to the anti-Christian state. They sought
                    only to withdraw from what their conscience condemned, content to live as
                    strangers upon earth, and devoting all their energy to preserve the purity of
                    their own communities. The mediaeval conception of separation from the world as
                    the true path of Christian perfection had leavened all middle-class society in
                    Europe, and prepared many to accept separatist views of the church as soon as
                    they were reached by the impulse of revolt against Roman Catholicism; the
                    pursuit of holiness in a society protected by a strict discipline is an idea
                    which experience has shown to have a great attraction for one class of earnest
                    minds; hence, in spite of persecutions incomparably fiercer than any of the
                    larger Protestant bodies ever underwent, the new doctrine and praxis rapidly
                    spread from Switzerland to Germany, Holland, and even to France. Each community
                    was quite independent, united to the rest only by a bond of love. There was no
                    sort of hierarchy, but only “exhorters” chosen by the congregation, of whom the
                    most prominent were also “elders” entrusted with the administration of the
                    sacraments—an organization so easily kept alive or reproduced that the movement
                    could hardly be checked by any persecution short of the total annihilation which
                    at length was actually the fate of many of the Swiss communities. The remnants
                    of the Swiss Mennonites broke in 1620 into two parties, the stricter of which,
                    the Ammanites or Upland Mennonites, were distinguished from the Lowland
                    Mennonites by holding that excommunication of one party dissolved marriage, and
                    by their rejection of buttons and the use of the razor. Their persecution lasted
                    till 1710; a few congregations still remain and keep themselves quite distinct
                    from Baptist bodies of more modern origin. In Germany the Mennonites are
                    somewhat more numerous; more important are the German Mennonite colonies in
                    southern Russia, brought thither in 1783 by the empress Catherine, which in turn
                    have recently sent many emigrants to America. America indeed, and especially
                    Pennsylvania, early became a refuge for the Mennonites of Switzerland, the
                    Palatinate, and Holland, and is now the chief home of the body (175,000 in the
                    United States and 25,000 in Canada). The oldest congregation is that of
                    Germantown (since 1683); the most numerous of several divisions are the Old
                    Mennonites, corresponding to the less strict of the Swiss sections.</p>
                <p>All these communities in Europe and America are distinguished by an antique
                    simplicity combined with antique prejudices, by indifference to the interests of
                    the greater world, while at the same time their industry and self-concentration
                    have made them generally well-to-do. Their religious type has varied very little
                    in the course of centuries, as indeed is not surprising, their theology being
                    ascetic rather than dogmatic or speculative. The Mennonites of Holland, on the
                    other hand, have passed through an interesting and progressive history.</p>
                <p>It was in Holland and the adjoining parts of Low Germany that the personal
                    influence of .Menno Simons (1492-1559) was mainly felt. He was originally a
                    priest, and was pastor at his native place Witmarsum in Friesland from 1531 to
                    1536, when convictions long ripening in his mind compelled him to resign his
                    cure. At this time the anti-paedo-baptist societies in the Low Countries were
                    much agitated. The views which had just before received their political
                    deathblow at Münster (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Anabaptists)</hi> were not
                    extinct, and even those who did not share them were by no means at one. Menno
                    attached himself to the Obbenites, who held that on earth true Christians had no
                    prospect but to suffer persecution, refused to use the sword, and looked for no
                    millennium on earth. Menno became one of their elders, and by his wanderings
                    among the scattered and oppressed communities, and especially by the natural
                    eloquence and religious power of his numerous writings, did much to sustain the
                    faith of his associates, to confirm the type of their religious life, and to
                    prevent startling aberrations in doctrine or discipline. He was not an original
                    thinker; but the love which all felt for the man, and which was kept alive for
                    generations by his writings, gave him the place which the name of Mennonites
                    expresses.</p>
                <p>It may be ascribed to the influence of Menno’s writings that the Dutch
                    Mennonites, though for a time (since 1554) they broke into fractions on
                    questions of discipline, and especially on the effect of excommunication upon
                    marriage, never fell so far apart as regards the type of their religious life as
                    to preclude the possibility of reunion. The Waterlanders in North Holland, who
                    held the least strict doctrine of excommunication, soon moved farther in the
                    direction of liberality, and exchanged the name Mennonites for that of
                    Doopsgezinden (Baptist persuasion). In 1579 they refused to condemn any one for
                    opinions, even on the incarnation, which the word of Scripture did not pronounce
                    necessary to salvation. They aided William the Silent with money, and from 1581
                    to 1618 even accepted civil office. Meantime the stricter party had undergone
                    various divisions, which, however, in 1627-32 were reunited on the basis of
                    confessions essentially embodying Menno’s teachings. They too had learned
                    moderation, at least in their views of excommunication, and their antithesis to
                    the state was softened since the cessation of persecution in 1581, but
                    especially since in 1672 they were recognized as citizens. On the other hand,
                    the adoption of a confession had deepened the separation between them and the
                    liberal Doopsgezinden; but doctrine was never the fundamental principle of the
                    Mennonite communities, confessionalism took no firm root, and the two sections
                    gradually approached, and through a series of partial fusions became at length
                    finally united when the Amsterdam congregations came together in 1801. The
                    persuasion declined much in numbers in the 18th century; since then it has
                    increased, and has now 127 congregations with nearly 50,000 members. The
                    objection to hold civil office disappeared in 1795; that to carry arms in the
                    war of freedom against Napoleon. Baptism on profession of faith and the refusal
                    of the oath, tolerance in matters of doctrine without religious indifference,
                    are the chief marks of the body, which in point of theological culture and
                    general enlightenment, philanthropic zeal and social importance, has long stood
                    very high.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Authorities.—</hi> The best life of Menno Simons is Cramer’s,

                    before Menno joined the Obbenites, is almost certainly spurious. See Sepp, <hi
