                <p><label type="entry">MICRONESIA</label>. The term “Micronesia” embraces that
                    region of the Pacific north of the great Melanesian islands, where, either
                    perhaps from a greater or more rapid subsidence, or from the decreasing activity
                    northwards of the coral builders, the islands become, generally speaking,
                    smaller and fewer, and finally cease. Accordingly, excepting the Marianas or
                    Ladrones, which are of volcanic origin, and a few isolated instances of
                    elevation in the Carolines, the Micronesian islands, though many of the groups
                    cover a vast area, are almost without exception very small low coral (atoll)
                    formations. Besides the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ladrone</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Caroline Islands</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(ç.v.)</hi>
                    Micronesia includes the Marshall and Gilbert groups, and some geographers
                    include the Anson group, a number of small widely-scattered islets to the west
                    of Hawaii, the Magellan group farther west, and the Bonin Islands north of the
                    Ladrones.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These islands,
                    which contain a mixed immigrant population, are claimed, and have been recently
                    surveyed, by Japan. But they were annexed to England by Captain Beechey in 1827.
                    (See Von Kittlitz, <hi rend="italic">Denkwürdigkeiten einer Reise nach ....

                <p>North-easterly winds prevail during the winter months over the Marshalls,
                    Ladrones, and Carolines, except in the extreme west, while between May and
                    September the influence of the monsoon causes unsettled weather from the west,
                    with heavy gales. In the Gilberts the south-east trade-wind brings fine weather
                    at this season.</p>
                <p>The ethnological features of Micronesia are much more definite than the
                    geographical, for its populations form one great branch of the fair Polynesian
                    race, distinguished from the other by well-marked differences in appearance,
                    language, and institutions. Its ethnological relations are not thoroughly
                    understood. The proximity of Japan and the Philippines on the west and of the
                    Papuan and South Polynesian islands on the south and south-east suggests, what
                    in fact we find, a combination of elements in different degrees of fusion. In
                    some places the oblique Mongolian eye is noticed, and (along with certain
                    Indo-Chinese customs) there is often a scantiness of beard and general “Malay”
                    look which increases westwards, and seems to imply relations with the
                    archipelago subsequent to the departure thence of the pure Polynesians. In the
                    Gilberts the traces of Polynesian (Samoan) influences are evident, and are
                    confirmed by tradition. Among the Carolines and the Marshalls darker and more
                    savage communities are found, suggesting a Melanesian element, which is further
                    traceable in the Ebon (Marshall) and other languages.</p>
                <p>Each of the four groups, from long isolation, has developed peculiarities of its
                    own. The most advanced were the “Chamorros” of the Ladrones, owing to the
                    greater natural resources of the islands, and perhaps more frequent contact with
                    influences from the west; but as a separate people they no longer exist, having
                    been nearly exterminated by the Spaniards in the 17th century. Next in
                    advancement come the Carolines. The general type is a well-proportioned rather
                    slightly built figure, with small and regular features; head high and
                    well-proportioned, but forehead rather retreating, and narrow at the temples;
                    cheek bones and chin slightly prominent; colour somewhat darker than the
                    Polynesians, the Marshalls being darker and more vigorous than the Carolines,
                    while the Gilbert type is still darker and coarser. The upper class greatly
                    surpasses the common people in physique and intelligence.</p>
                <p>There is a peculiar division of society into septs or clans, the membership of
                    which constitutes the closest tie. Persons of the same sept must not intermarry,
                    and when two islands or communities meet in war the members of one sept, however
                    widely separated by distance of space or time, will not injure or fight with
                    each other. Each community is usually composed (but there are local differences)
                    of—(1) an upper class of chiefs, from among whom the head <hi rend="italic"
                    >(tamol</hi> or ⅛os) is chosen; (2) a lower but still noble class; and (3)
                    common people, mostly without rights of property. These last are only allowed
                    one wife. Assemblies of the chiefs everywhere limit the kingly authority. In the
                    Marshalls the sovereign has lost his control over many of the atolls, and in the
                    Gilberts the above distinctions have nearly disappeared; the headship has
                    lapsed, and, especially in the southern islands, the man of largest substance is
                    the most powerful, and sometimes establishes a local supremacy. Here and there
                    are traces, as in Tonga, of a spiritual sovereign, the descendants probably of a
                    conquered dynasty. Succession is through the female side, which assures to women
                    a certain position, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n272/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0272-0257"/> and leads besides to some curious results (see
                    paper by Kubary in <hi rend="italic">Das Ausland,</hi> 1880, No. 27). The upper
                    class are the keepers of traditions, boat-builders, leaders of expeditions;
                    tattooing is generally done by them, the amount increasing with a man’s rank;
                    the custom here still has definite religious associations. Both sexes are
                    tattooed. The people are singularly amiable and well disposed, but will repay
                    ill usage with treachery. The women (although chastity is not expected before
                    marriage) are somewhat more moral than the Polynesians, and are treated with
                    respect, as are the aged. The natives are polite and hospitable to strangers
                    (except on the poorer and ruder islands), bright and intelligent, active
                    traders, expert cultivators and fishermen. They have a hand-loom from which
                    beautiful fabrics of banana, hibiscus, and other fibres are produced. The
                    Marshall Islanders are the boldest and most skilful navigators in the Pacific.
                    Their voyages of many months’ duration, in great canoes sailing with outrigger
                    to windward, well-provisioned, and depending on the skies for fresh water, help
                    to show how the Pacific was colonized. They have a sort of chart, <hi
                    rend="italic">tnedo,</hi> of small sticks tied together, representing the
                    positions of islands and the directions of the winds and currents. A two-edged
                    weapon, of which the blade is of sharks’ teeth, and a defensive armour of
                    braided sennit, are also peculiar to the islands; a large adze, made of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tridacna gigas,</hi> was formerly used in the Carolines, probably
                    by the old builder race.</p>
                <p>The languages of Micronesia, though grammatically alike, differ widely in their
                    vocabularies. They have the chief characteristics of the Polynesian, with Malay
                    affinities, and peculiarities such as the use of suffixes and inseparable
                    pronouns and, as in Tagal, of the infix to denote changes in the verb; in the
                    west groups there is a tendency to closed syllables and double consonants, and a
                    use of the palatals <hi rend="italic">ch, j, sh,</hi> the dental <hi
                    rend="italic">th,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (the last perhaps only in
                    foreign words), which is alien to the Polynesian. These letters are wanting in
                    the Gilbert language, which differs considerably from all the others, and has
                    much greater affinities with the Polynesian.</p>
                <p>The religious myths are generally identifiable with the Polynesian, but a belief
                    in the gods proper is overshadowed by a general deification of ancestors, who
                    are supposed from time to time to occupy certain blocks of stone, set up near
                    the family dwelling, and surrounded by circles of smaller ones. These stones are
                    anointed with oil, and worshipped with prayer and offerings, and are also used
                    for purposes of divination, in which, and in various omens, there is a general
                    belief. In the Marshalls, in place of these stones, certain palm trees are
                    similarly enclosed. The spirits also sometimes inhabit certain birds or fishes,
                    which are then <hi rend="italic">tabu,</hi> as food, to the family; but they
                    will help to catch them for others. All this closely recalls the <hi
                    rend="italic">hancars or</hi> ancestral images of New Guinea. Temples are very
                    rare, though these blocks of coral are sometimes surrounded by a roofless
                    enclosure opening to the west. The bodies of the dead, and sometimes even of the
                    sick, are despatched to sea westwards, with certain rites; those of the chiefs,
                    however, are buried, for the order has something essentially divine about it;
                    their bodies therefore are sacred, and their spirits naturally assume the
                    position above described. Such a belief greatly strengthens the king’s
                    authority, for the spirits of his ancestors are necessarily more powerful than
                    any other spirits. Thus too it comes that the chiefs, and all belonging to them,
                    are tabu as regards the common people. There are various other subjects and
                    occasions of tabu, but the institution has not the oppressive and all-pervading
                    character which it has in Polynesia. Its action is often economical or
                    charitable, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the ripening cocoa-nuts are tabu as
                    long as the breadfruit lasts, thus securing the former for future use; or it is
                    put on after a death, and the nuts thus saved are given to the family— a
                    kindness to them, and a mark of respect for the dead.</p>
                <p>The flora of the Gilbert and Marshall groups is of the usual oceanic character,
                    with close Indo-Malay affinities. It is much poorer than that of the
                    Carolines,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>About 180
                    species have been observed on Kusaie, one-fourth of all the plants being
                    ferns.</p></note> with its Moluccan and Philippine elements, and this again is
                    surpassed by that of the Ladrones. In the Gilberts the scattered woods of
                    cocoa-palm and <hi rend="italic">Pandanus</hi> have little undergrowth, while
                    the south Marshalls, being within the belt of constant precipitation, have a
                    dense growth of (mostly) low trees and shrubs, with here and there a tropical
                    luxuriance and variety unusual on atolls. The <hi rend="italic">Pandanus</hi>
                    grows wild profusely, and is of exceptional importance, being the chief staple
                    of food, so that the cocoa-nut, which, however, flourishes chiefly in the
                    Gilberts, is used mainly to produce oil for exportation. The bread-fruit glows
                    chiefly in the south Marshalls. The taro <hi rend="italic">{Arum
                    cordi/olium</hi> and others) is cultivated laboriously, deep trenches being cut
                    in the solid rock for its irrigation, but this and other plants of cultivation,
                    and indeed the vegetation generally, fall oif in number and quality northwards.
                    Various vegetables are grown on soil imported for the purpose. Marine plants are
                    rare. Wilkes found on Makin Island, Gilbert group, a “fruit resembling the
                    gooseberry,” called “teiparu,” from which a preserve is made. This seems very
                    like the tipari or Cape gooseberry of India <hi rend="italic">{Physalis
                    peruviana').</hi> And their <hi rend="italic">karaka,</hi> a drink made from the
                    sap of the flower-stalk of the cocoa-palm (unfermented before the arrival of
                    Europeans), recalls the arrack of southern Asia.</p>
                <p>The fauna, like the flora, becomes poorer eastwards, birds being much more
                    numerous on the high islands than on the atolls, where the few are chiefly
                    aquatic. On Bonabe (Puynipet) out of twenty-nine species eleven are sea birds,
                    and of the remaining eighteen seven are peculiar to the island. From the Pelews
                    fifty-six species are recorded ( twelve peculiar), and from the neighbouring
                    Mackenzie group (Ulithi) twenty (six peculiar). Yet curiously no species is
                    recorded common to these two groups and peculiar to them. The common fowl is
                    found everywhere, wild or tame, and in some places is kept for its feathers
                    only. The rat and a <hi rend="italic">Pteropus</hi> are the only indigenous land
                    mammals. The Indian crocodile is found as far east as the Pelews. There are five
                    or six lizards, including a <hi rend="italic">Gecko</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ablephorus.</hi> Insects are numerous, but of few kinds. Scorpions and
                    centipedes are common, but are said to be harmless.</p>
                <p>The houses in the Gilberts and Marshalls (much less elaborate than in the
                    Carolines) consist merely of a thatched roof resting on posts or on blocks of
                    coral about 3 feet high, with a floor at that level, which is reached from an
                    opening in the centre. On this the principal people sleep, and it serves as a
                    storehouse inaccessible to rats, which infest all the islands.</p>
                <p>The Marshall archipelago consists of two nearly parallel chains of atolls, from
                    100 to 300 miles apart, the west known as Ralik, the east as Ratak. They lie
                    between 4° 30' and 12° N., and between 165° 15' and 172° 15' E., and run about
                    N.N.W. and S.S.E. They were discovered in 1529 by Saavedra, who, observing the
                    fine tattooing of the inhabitants (the first allusion to the practice in the
                    Pacific), called them Los Pintados. Among modern voyagers Wallis first visited
                    them in 1767; Captains Marshall and Gilbert reached them in 1788, and Kotzebue
                    (1816) explored them more thoroughly. Each group contains fifteen or sixteen
                    atolls, which range from 2 to 50 miles in circumference. An anomalous feature is
                    reported on some of them, viz., that the greater proportion of land, or at all
                    events of soil, is not found as usual on the windward side of the lagoon, for
                    the prevailing north-east wind sweeps, it is said, the materials of which the
                    soil of such islands is composed across to the lee side. Jaluit Island is the
                    commercial emporium of the whole region. There is a curious tradition on Ebon
                    Island of the Darwinian fact that the atoll once formed the barrier reef of an
                    island now sunk beneath the lagoon. The population of Ratak is about 6000, of
                    Ralik 4000; there is little intercourse between the two groups.</p>
                <p>The Gilbert archipelago, discovered by Byron in 1765, is geographically a south
                    continuation of the Marshalls, the channel separating them being 50 leagues
                    wide. It lies between 2° 40' S. and 3° 20' N., and between 172° 30' and 177° 15'
                    E., and contains sixteen atolls, not including two hilly islands, Banaba and
                    Nawodo, which lie 5° to 6° to the west. Several have good anchorages inside the
                    lagoon, with entrances on the lee side. On some the lee or west reef is wanting,
                    owing to the abrading force of the west storms. During these large trees are
                    washed ashore, their roots containing pieces of fine basalt, of which implements
                    are made. There is a far larger proportion of land to submerged reef and lagoon
                    than in the Marshalls, the land sometimes rising 20 feet above the sea, whereas
                    in the Marshalls the average level of the reef rock is less than a foot above
                    the surface; but, though the supply of fresh water is exceptionally great, in
                    fact enough for the luxury of a bath, the soil (especially in the south) is very
                    much less productive. Yet the population, about 50,000, is exceptionally dense.
                    The usual scattered houses are replaced by compact rows of roofs which, shaded
                    by cocoa-palm, and each with its boat-shed below, line the shore. Their numbers
                    are unchecked either by the constant practice of abortion or by fighting, to
                    which they are much addicted, their weapons being more formidable than those of
                    their neighbours. This exceptional vigour may be due to the decidedly hybrid
                    character of the race. Hawaiian missionaries, under American superintendence,
                    have laboured here since 1857.</p>
