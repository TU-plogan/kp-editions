                <p><label type="entry">MITHRAS</label> was a Persian god whose worship spread over
                    the Roman world during the 2d and 3d centuries after Christ. His name is found
                    in the oldest records of the East Aryan races. In the Rig-Veda, Mitra, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the friend, and Varuna, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ουρανός,</hi> are a pair of gods regularly associated: they denote
                    the heaven of day and the heaven of night. Mithras is therefore by origin the
                    god of the bright heaven and of day, closely related in conception to, and yet
                    expressly distinguished from, the sun. In the developed Old Persian religion of
                    Zoroaster Mithras retained a place; he was not one of the greatest gods, but was
                    first of a triad which, while less pure embodiments of the divine nature, were
                    more easy for men to comprehend and to worship. The seventh month, which bears
                    his name, and the sixteenth day of every month were sacred to Mithras; prayers
                    were offered to him at sunrise, at mid-day, and at sunset. When the Persians
                    conquered Assyria and Babylonia their religion was much affected by the worship
                    of these more educated races. The worship of foreign deities was introduced,
                    that of Persian deities was changed in character; and the gods were represented
                    by images. The cultus of Mithras now became far more prominent, he was
                    identified with the sun, and an elaborate ritual with the non-Aryan
                    accompaniment of mysteries was established. This revolution had begun before
                    Herodotus (i. 131) could identify Mithras with the Assyrian goddess Mylitta, and
                    it became more thorough during the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>It is in this most developed form that we know the cultus of Mithras. The god of
                    light becomes by a ready transition, which is made in the very oldest Aryan
                    records, the god of purity, of moral goodness, of knowledge. There goes on in
                    the world as a whole, and in the life of each man, a continual struggle between
                    the power of good and the power of evil; Mithras is always engaged in this
                    contest, and his religion teaches all, men and women alike, to aid in the
                    battle. Victory in this battle can be gained only by sacrifice and probation,
                    and Mithras is conceived as always performing the mystic sacrifice through which
                    the good will triumph. The human soul, which has been separated from the divine
                    nature and has descended to earth, can reascend and attain union with God
                    through a process of fasting and penance which is taught in the mysteries; the
                    sacrifice which is being always offered by Mithras makes this ascent and union
                    possible. Those who were initiated in the mysteries of Mithras had to pass
                    through a long probation, with scourging, fasting, and ordeal by water, and were
                    then admitted as soldiers fighting on behalf of Mithras. This was the lowest
                    terrestrial grade, but there were still two others to attain, the Bull and the
                    Lion, each involving further probation, before the soul could rise above the
                    earth. It then ascended by the grades of Vulture, Ostrich, and Crow through the
                    region of aether; and then it strove to become pure fire through the grades of
                    Gryphon, of Perses, and of the Sun. Finally <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n556/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0556-0531"/> the soul attained complete union with the divine
                    nature through the grades of Father Eagle, of Father Falcon, and of Father of
                    Fathers. A holy cave on a hill was the central point in the worship; and the
                    mystic rites involved watching and fasting all night till sunrise brought the
                    •triumph of light.</p>
                <p>The worship of Mithras became known to the Romans through the Cilician pirates
                    captured by Pompey about 7 0 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It gained a footing
                    in Rome under Domitian, was regularly established by Trajan about 100 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and by Commodus about 190. Finally the mysteries
                    were prohibited and the holy cave destroyed in 378. Dedicatory inscriptions to
                    <hi rend="italic">Deo Soli</hi><hi rend="italic">Invicto</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mithrae,</hi> and votive reliefs of Roman work, are very common. The usual
                    representation shows Mithras in the mystic cave performing the mystic sacrifice;
                    a young man in Oriental costume kneels with one knee on a prostrate bull,
                    grasping the head and pulling it back with the left hand, while with the right
                    he plunges his sword into its neck. A dog, a snake, and a scorpion drink the
                    blood that flows from the bull; a crow sits on the rock behind Mithras; the
                    figures of the sun and of the moon occupy the two sides of the relief.</p>
