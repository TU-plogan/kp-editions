                    were “earnest followers of Calvin,” but he himself “could never swallow that
                    hard doctrine.” As soon as he went to Eton he gave himself up to what he
                    considered a more genial and encouraging train of religious thought. From his
                    boyhood in the Eton playing-fields he was a philosophical and religious dreamer,
                    and he describes his moods of religious reverie in a very <pb break="no"

                    have no morbid taint; they are the natural carriage of a strangely gifted
                    spirit. “From the beginning all things in a manner came flowing to him,” and his
                    mind, according to his own saying, “was enlightened with a sense of the noblest
                    theories in the morning of his days.” In 1631 he went to Cambridge, and was
                    admitted at Christ’s College about the time Milton was leaving it. He immersed
                    himself “over head and ears in the study of philosophy,” and fell for a time
                    into a sort of scepticism, from which, however, he was delivered by a study of
                    the “Platonic writers.” He was fascinated especially by Neo-Platonism, and this
                    fascination never left him. The <hi rend="italic">Theologia Germanica</hi> also
                    exerted a great and permanent influence over him. He entered upon a course of
                    spiritual self-discipline which made all his previous studies seem of
                    comparatively no value; and gradually light as well as peace came to him. He got
                    “into a most joyous and lucid state of mind,” which he described in a Greek
                    epigram, as he had formerly described his state of mental and spiritual darkness
                    in the same manner. He took his bachelor’s degree in 1635, his master’s degree
                    in 1639, and immediately afterwards was chosen fellow of his college. In this
                    position he may be said to have remained all his life. Many offers of preferment
                    were made to him, but he refused them all, with one exception. Fifteen years
                    after the Restoration, he accepted a prebend in Gloucester cathedral, but only
                    to resign it in favour of his friend Dr. Edward Fowler, afterwards the
                    well-known bishop of Gloucester. He had no ambition, and steadily declined all
                    attempts to draw him towards public life. He would not even accept the
                    mastership of his college, to which, it is understood, he would have been
                    preferred in 1654, when Cud worth was appointed. He drew many young men of a
                    refined and thoughtful turn of mind around him, but among all his pupils the
                    most interesting was a young lady of noble family, a “heroine pupil,” as his
                    biographer (Ward) says, “of an extraordinary nature.” This lady is supposed to
                    have been a sister of Lord Finch, afterwards earl of Nottingham, a well-known
                    statesman of the Restoration. She afterwards became Lady Conway, and at her
                    country seat at Ragley in Warwickshire More continued at intervals to spend “a
                    considerable part of his time.” She and her husband both greatly appreciated
                    him, and amidst the woods of this pleasant retreat he composed several of his
                    books. There is reason to think that the spiritual enthusiasm of Lady Conway was
                    a considerable factor in some of More’s speculations, none the less that she at
                    length passed from his religious pupilage into the ranks of the Quakers.
                    Susceptible to all the excited impulses of her time, this lady became the friend
                    not only of More and Penn but of Baron van Helmont and Valentine Greatrakes,
                    mystical thaumaturgists who played a considerable part amid the teeming
                    enthusiasms of the 17th century. Ragley became a centre not only of devotion but
                    of wonder-working spiritualism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    happy days,” More says, he spent in this “paradise,” and its fantastic mysticism
                    had more allurements for him than he himself realized. His genius suffered in
                    consequence, and the play of rationality which distinguishes his earlier is much
                    less conspicuous in his later works. He was a voluminous writer both in verse
                    and prose, and the mere list of his works would occupy more space than we can
                    give to it. Many of his productions are now unreadable; but the <hi
                    rend="italic">Divine Dialogues,</hi> published in 1668, may be still read with
                    pleasure. It is animated and sometimes even brilliant, with less prolixity and
                    digression than his other productions, while it has also the advantage for
                    modern readers that it condenses his general view of philosophy and religion.
                    Most of his. characteristic principles may in fact be gathered from it.</p>
                <p>The year in which he composed the <hi rend="italic">Divine Dialogues</hi> may be
                    said to mark the highest point of his intellectual activity. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Manual of Metaphysics</hi> and elaborate treatises on Jacob Boehme
                    and Spinoza were subsequent to this; but the elasticity and freshness of his
                    philosophical genius are less buoyant in these efforts, and the
                    prophetico-mystical elements which were a weakness in his mental constitution
                    from the first grew as his years advanced. He represents more than any other
                    member of the school the mystical and theosophic side of the Cambridge movement.
                    Its lofty rationality, the rationality of which he himself had spoken earlier in
                    noble language, at length evaporates in him in intellectual reverie and dreams.
                    The Neo-Platonic extravagances which lay hidden in the school from the first
                    came in his writings to a head, and merged in pure phantasy,—a set of favourite
                    ideas which not merely guided but dominated the reason. Withal Henry More can
                    never be spoken of save as a spiritual genius and significant figure in the
                    history of British philosophy, less robust and manly and in some respects less
                    learned than Cudworth but more interesting and fertile in thought, and more
                    sweet, singular, and genial in character. From youth to age he describes himself
                    as gifted with a most happy and buoyant temper. The presence of nature filled
                    him with rapture; he wished he could be always <hi rend="italic">sub dio.</hi>
                    “Walking abroad after his studies his sallies towards nature would be often
                    inexpressibly ravishing, beyond what he could convey to others.” His own
                    thoughts were to him a never-ending source of pleasurable excitement. His mind
                    moved with great rapidity and at a lofty elevation, so that, as he says, he
                    seemed “all the while to be in the air.” This mystical glow and elevation were
                    the chief features of his mind and character, a certain transport and radiancy
                    of thought which carried him beyond the common life without raising him to any
                    false or artificial height, for his humility and charity were not less
                    conspicuous than his piety. The last ten years of his life are without any
                    special record, and he died on the morning of 1st September 1687, and was buried
                    in the chapel of the college he loved so well, where within less than a year his
                    friend Cudworth was laid beside him.</p>
