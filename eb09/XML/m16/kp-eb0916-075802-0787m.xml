                    now a town of about 16,300 inhabitants, situated 5 miles inland from Palermo, on
                    the slope of Mount Caputo overlooking the beautiful and very fertile valley
                    called “La Concha d’Oro” (the Golden Shell), famed for its orange, olive, and
                    almond trees, the produce of which is exported in large quantities. The town,
                    which for long was a mere village, owed its origin to the founding of a large
                    Benedictine monastery, with its church, the seat of the metropolitan archbishop
                    of Sicily.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An earlier
                    church appears to have existed at Monreale since the 6th century, but no traces
                    of it now remain.</p></note> This, the greatest of all the monuments of the
                    wealth and artistic taste of the Norman kings in northern Sicily, who in 1072
                    expelled the Mohammedans and established themselves there with Palermo as their
                    capital, was begun about 1170 by William II., and in 1182 the church, dedicated
                    to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, was, by a bull of Pope Lucius III.,
                    elevated to the rank of a metropolitan cathedral. It was, and is even now, one
                    of the most magnificent buildings in the world, and Pope Lucius in no way
                    exaggerated its splendour when he said in his bull, “ut simile opus per aliquem
                    regem factum non fuerit a diebus antiquis.”</p>
                <p>The archiépiscopal palace and monastic buildings on the south side were of great
                    size and magnificence, and were surrounded by a massive precinct wall, crowned
                    at intervals by twelve towers. This has been mostly rebuilt, and but little now
                    remains except ruins of some of the towers, a great part of the monks’ dormitory
                    and frater, and the very splendid cloister, completed about 1200. This latter is
                    well <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n788/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0788-0759"/> preserved, and is one of the finest cloisters
                    both for size and beauty of detail that now exists anywhere. It is about 170
                    feet square, with pointed arches covered with marble inlay, supported on pairs
                    of columns in white marble, 216</p>
                <p>in all, which are sumptuously decorated either by rich surface carving or by
                    bands of patterns in gold, silver, and colours, made of glass tesserae, arranged
                    either spirally or vertically from end to end of each shaft. The marble caps are
                    each richly carved with figures and foliage executed with great skill and
                    wonderful fertility of invention—no two being alike. At one angle, a square
                    pillared projection contains the marble fountain or monks’ lavatory, evidently
                    the work of Moslem sculptors.</p>
                <p>The chief feature of the place—the church—like the main cloister, is fortunately
                    well preserved. In plan it is a curious mixture of Eastern and Western
                    arrangement (see fig.). The nave is like an Italian basilica, while the large
                    triple-apsed choir is like one of the early three-apsed churches, of which so
                    many examples still exist in Syria and other Eastern countries (see De Vogue,
                    <hi rend="italic">Syrie Centrale').</hi> It is, in fact, like two quite
                    different churches put together endwise. The basilican nave is wide, with narrow
                    aisles. Monolithic columns of Oriental granite (except one, which is of
                    cipollino), evidently the spoils of older buildings, on each side support eight
                    pointed arches much stilted. There is no tπforium, but a high clerestory with
                    wide two-light windows, &gt;vith simple tracery like those in the nave-aisles
                    and throughout the church. The other half, Eastern in two senses, is both wider
                    and higher than the nave. It also is divided into a central space with two
                    aisles, each of the divisions ending at the east with an apse. The roofs
                    throughout are of open woodwork very low in pitch, constructionally plain, but
                    richly decorated with colour, now mostly restored. At the west end of the nave
                    are two projecting towers, with narthex-entrance between them. A large open
                    atrium, which once existed at the west, is now completely destroyed. The outside
                    of the church is plain, except the aisle walls and three eastern apses, which
                    are decorated with intersecting pointed arches and other ornaments inlaid in
                    marble. The outsides of the principal doorways and their pointed arches are
                    magnificently enriched with carving and inlay, a curious combination of three
                    styles—Norman-French, Byzantine, and Arab.</p>
                <p>It is, however, the enormous extent (80,630 square feet) and glittering splendour
                    of the glass mosaics covering the interior, which make this church so
                    marvellously splendid (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mosaic).</hi> With the exception
                    of a high dado, itself very beautiful, made of marble slabs enriched with bands
                    of mosaic, the whole interior surface of the walls, including soffits and jambs
                    of all the arches, is covered with minute mosaic-pictures in brilliant colours
                    on a gold ground. This gorgeous method of decoration takes the place of all
                    purely architectural detail, such as mouldings and panelling. The mosaic covers
                    even the edges of the arches and jambs, which are slightly rounded off, so as to
                    allow them to be covered by the glass tesserae. This device gives apparent
                    softness to all the edges, and greatly enhances the richness of effect produced
                    by the gleaming gold grounds. The only carving inside is on the sculptured caps
                    of the nave arcade, mostly Corinthian in style. The mosaic pictures are arranged
                    in tiers, divided by horizontal and vertical bands of elaborate flowing mosaic
                    ornament. In parts of the choir there are five of these tiers of subjects or
                    single figures one above another. The half dome of the central apse has a
                    colossal half-length figure of Christ, with a seated Virgin and Child below; the
                    other apses have full-length colossal figures of St Peter and St Paul.
                    Inscriptions on each picture explain the subject or saint represented; these are
                    in Latin, except some <hi rend="italic">few</hi> which are in Greek. The
                    subjects are partly from the Old Testament types of Christ and His scheme of
                    redemption, with figures of those who prophesied and prepared for His coming.
                    Towards the east are subjects from the Neλv Testament, chiefly representing
                    Christ’s miracles and suffering, with apostles, evangelists, and other saints.
                    The design, execution, and choice of subjects all appear to be of Byzantine
                    origin, the subjects being selected from the <hi rend="italic">Menologium.</hi>
                    drawn up by the emperor Basilius Porphyrogenitus in the 10th century.</p>
                <p>No other mosaics perhaps so closely resemble the Monreale<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n789/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0789-0760"/> ones as those over the nave columns in the Church
                    of the Nativity at Bethlehem. They are alike, not only in design and treatment,
                    but also in the curious mixture of Latin and Greek in the inscriptions (see De
                    Voguë, <hi rend="italic">Églises de la Terre Sainte,</hi> 1860). This similarity
                    is easily accounted for by the fact that these two sets of mosaics, though so
                    far apart, were executed about the same date and under the same conditions,
                    viz., by the hands of Byzantine artists, working for Norman-French kings.</p>
                <p>In the central apse at Monreale, behind the high altar, is a fine marble throne
                    for the archbishop. This position of the throne is a survival of the early
                    basilican arrangement, when the apse and altar were at the west end. In that
                    case the celebrant stood behind the altar at mass, and looked <hi rend="italic"
                    >over</hi> it eastwards towards the people. This position of the throne was
                    frequently reproduced in churches which, like this, have the apse at the east.
                    On the north side, in front of the high altar, is another somewhat similar
                    throne for the use of the king. The tomb of William I., the founder’s father—a
                    magnificent porphyry sarcophagus contemporary with the church, under a marble
                    pillared canopy—and the founder William II.’s tomb, erected in 1575, were both
                    shattered by a fire, which in 1811 broke out in the choir, injuring some of the
                    mosaics, and destroying all the fine walnut choir-fittings, the organs, and most
                    of the choir roof. The tombs were rebuilt, and the whole of the injured part of
                    the church restored, mostly very clumsily, a few years after the fire. On the
                    north of the choir are the tombs of Margaret, wife of William I., and her two
                    sons Roger and Henry, together with an urn containing the viscera of St Louis of
                    France, who died in 1270. The pavement of the triple choir, though much
                    restored, is a very magnificent specimen of marble and porphyry mosaic in “opus
                    Alexandrinum,” with signs of Arab influence in its main lines.</p>
                <p>Two bronze doors, those on the north and west of the church, are of great
                    interest in the history of art. They are both divided into a number of square
                    panels with subjects and single figures, chiefly from Bible history, cast in
                    relief. That on the north is by Barisanos of Trani in southern Italy, an artist
                    probably of Greek origin. It is inscribed <hi rend="smallcaps">barisanus tran.
                    me fecit.</hi> The cathedrals at Trani and Ravello also have bronze doors by the
                    same sculptor. The western door at Monreale, inferior to the northern one both
                    in richness of design and in workmanship, is by Bonannus of Pisa, for the
                    cathedral of which place he cast the still existing bronze door on the south,
                    opposite the leaning tower. The one at Monreale is inscribed <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> MCLXXXVI IND. III. BONANNUS CIVIS PISANVS ME FECIT.
                    It is superior in execution to the Pisan one. The door by Barisanos is probably
                    of about the same time, as other examples of his work with inscribed dates show
                    that he was a contemporary of Bonannus. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Metal-work.)</hi> The monastic library contains some valuable MSS., especially
                    a number of bilingual documents in Greek and Arabic, the earliest being dated
                    1144. The archbishop now occupies the eastern part of the monastic buildings,
                    the original palace being destroyed.</p>
