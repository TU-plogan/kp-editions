                        Lord</hi></label> (1714-1799), author of works on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Origin and Progress</hi><hi rend="italic">of Language</hi> (published in
                    1773), and <hi rend="italic">Ancient Metaphysics</hi> (1779), was one of the
                    most marked characters in Scottish literary circles in the 18th century. He was
                    born in 1714 at Monboddo in Kincardineshire, studied at Aberdeen and Groningen,
                    and quickly took a leading position at the Edinburgh bar, being made one of the
                    Lords of Session in 1767. Many of his eccentricities, both of conduct and
                    opinion, appear less eccentric to the present generation than they did to his
                    contemporaries; though he seems to have heightened the impression of them by his
                    humorous sallies in their defence. He may have had other reasons than the
                    practice of the ancients for dining late and performing his journeys on
                    horseback instead of in a carriage. His views about the origin of society and
                    language and the faculties by which man is distinguished from the brutes
                    afforded endless matter for jest to the wags of his day; but readers of this
                    generation are more likely to be surprised by the scientific character of his
                    method and the acuteness of his conclusions than amused by his eccentricity.
                    These conclusions have many curious points of contact with Darwinism and
                    Neo-Kantism. His idea of studying man as one of the animals, and of collecting
                    facts about savage tribes to throw light on the problems of civilization, bring
                    him into contact with the one, and his intimate knowledge of Greek philosophy
                    with the other. In both respects Monboddo was far in advance of his neighbours.
                    His happy turn of Virgil’s line—</p>
                <p>“Tantae molis erat <hi rend="italic">humanam</hi> condere gentem ”— might be
                    adopted as a motto by the Evolutionists; and Neo-Kantians would find it hard to
                    believe that he published his criticism of Locke in 1773. His studied abstinence
                    from fine writing—from “the rhetorical and poetical style fashionable among
                    writers of the present day ”—on such subjects as he handled confirmed the idea
                    of his contemporaries that he was only an eccentric concocter of supremely
