                    up by his paternal grandmother, Madame de Souza, a writer of society novels, and
                    a woman of great wit and high breeding. As a boy of nineteen he was declared
                    after the revolution of 1830 a hero of July, and was entered at the staff
                    college. In 1832 he was gazetted sub-lieutenant, and served in Algeria as
                    aide-de-camp to General Oudinot; he was present at Mascara and Constantine, and
                    was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour. In 1838 he returned to Paris, and
                    began his career as dandy and speculator. In the first capacity he set the
                    fashions both of dress and manners to the young men of Paris, and conceived the
                    idea of the modern society journal, and in the second established a manufactory
                    of beetroot sugar at Clermont-Ferrand. This last idea brought about his election
                    for the department of the Puy-de-Dôme. In the chamber he voted consistently with
                    the ministers. The republic of 1848 marked the crisis in his fortunes, and by
                    1851 all his speculations had failed, and all his property was sold. In
                    desperation he determined to play a part in politics, and was the heart and soul
                    of the <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> of December 1851. The success of the
                    <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> was certain, owing to the fear of the extreme
                    republicans entertained by the great majority of the nation, and all that was
                    needed was a head for intrigue and an utter absence of scruples to shed innocent
                    blood. Morny and St Arnaud fulfilled these requisites. Morny was on the day of
                    the <hi rend="italic">coup</hi><hi rend="italic">J</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >état</hi> made minister of the interior, but he had no taste for the drudgery
                    of administration, and in January 1852 found an excuse for resigning on the
                    question of the property of the Orleanist princes. The empire established, he
                    was again able to begin speculating, and used both the money of the state and
                    his influence with his brother for the success of his schemes. He had been in
                    1852 re-elected deputy for Clermont-Ferrand, and was in 1854 elected president
                    of the corps legislatif, an office which he held for the rest of his life. This
                    office in every way suited him; he had large pay, and resided in a magnificent
                    official residence, where he produced little plays to admiring audiences. The
                    work was not hard, being chiefly to maintain the Government majority in a good
                    humour by sumptuous entertainments, and to win over the Liberals by the same
                    tactics. He still speculated in railways, pictures, mines, and even in a new
                    watering-place, Deauville, and, being absolutely unscrupulous and venal, amassed
                    an immense fortune in spite of the utmost extravagance. In 1856 he was special
                    ambassador at the coronation of Czar Alexander II., when he spent immense sums,
                    and married a wealthy Russian, Princess Troubetzkoy. In 1862 he was created a
                    duke, and in 1865, after continuing to the last his career of dissipation, died
                    of sheer anaemia from the measures he took to keep himself fit for yet further
                    excesses.</p>
                <p>Of the due de Morny little good can be said either as a statesman or a man. He
                    looked upon everything from a purely selfish point <pb break="no"

                    shrewd enough to perceive that the empire rested on the prestige it maintained
                    for France not only in war but in fashion, ana in assisting the empress to make
                    Paris the centre of fashion for the whole civilized world he knew he was not
                    only pleasing himself but doing a service to the empire. He was a thorough man
                    of the world, and was witty as such, but the wit does not appear at its
                    brightest in his plays, published under the name of Saint-Remy, of which perhaps
                    the most readable is <hi rend="italic">Μ. Choufleury</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    no claim to personal fidelity, as could his less able but equally unscrupulous
