                <p><label type="entry">MISSIONS</label>. The history of Christian missions may, for
                    practical purposes, be best divided into three chief periods—(1) the primitive,
                    (2) the mediaeval, and (3) the modern. None of these periods can be neglected,
                    for they have an intimate connexion with each other, and illustrate the activity
                    respectively of individuals, of the church in her corporate capacity, and of
                    societies.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The. Primitive Period.</hi></p>
                <p>Christian missions had their origin in the example and the command of our Lord
                    Himself (Matt, xxviii. 19); and the unparalleled boldness on the part of the
                    Founder of Christianity, which dared to anticipate for the Christian faith a
                    succession of efforts which should never cease to cause its propagation to be
                    undertaken as “a distinct and direct work,” has been justified by the voice of
                    history.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Davison, <hi

                    spread from country to country as component parts of popular opinion, have
                    travelled with migration or conquest, have passed in the train of things and by
                    the usual channels of communication, the first foundations of the church had
                    hardly been laid before individual missionary activity marked the life of each
                    one of the circle of the apostles.</p>
                <p>Of the actual details of their Labours we have been permitted to know but little.
                    Three only of the immediate followers of the Saviour have any conspicuous place
                    in the apostolic records, and the most illustrious in the whole domain of
                    missionary activity, St Paul, did not belong to the original twelve. His
                    activity took the form of journeys and voyages, chiefly to large towns, where
                    his message found a point of contact either with the Jewish synagogue or the
                    aspirations of the Gentile world. The result of his labours and of those of his
                    successors <pb break="no"

                    church had gradually extended its conquests through Asia Minor, Greece, Italy,
                    southern Gaul, and northern Africa.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    earliest teachers, and the infancy of many of the primitive congregations is
                    wrapped in hopeless darkness. Whatever was effected was due to the evangelizing
                    labours of individual bishops and clergy, who occupied themselves “in season and
                    out of season,” and toiled zealously and effectively in the spread of the
                    church, though leaving no record of their devotion. Amongst the most
                    distinguished representatives of this individual activity in the 4th and 5th
                    centuries may be mentioned Ulfila, the “apostle of the Goths,” about 325;
                    Frumentius, a bishop of Abyssinia, about 327; Chrysostom, who founded at
                    Constantinople in 404 A.D. an institution in which Goths might be trained to
                    preach the gospel to their own people;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Valentinus, the “apostle of Noricum,” about 440; and Honoratus, who from his
                    monastic home in the islet of Lerins, about 410, sent forth numerous labourers
                    to southern and western Gaul, to become the leading missionaries of their day
                    among the masses of heathendom in the neighbourhood of Arles, Lyons, Troyes,
                    Metz, and Nice.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Mediaeval Period.</hi></p>
                <p>With the 5th century the church found a very different element proposed to her
                    missionary energies and zeal. Her outposts of civilization had scarcely been
                    planted when she was confronted with numberless hordes which had long been
                    gathering afar off in their native wilds, and which were now precipitated over
                    the entire face of Europe. Having for some time ceased to plead for toleration,
                    and learnt to be aggressive, she not only stood the shock of change but girded
                    herself for the difficult work of calming the agitated elements of society, of
                    teaching the nations a higher faith than a savage form of nature worship, of
                    purifying and refining their recklessness, independence, and uncontrollable love
                    of liberty, and fitting them to become members of an enlightened
                    Christendom.</p>
                <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">The Celtic Missionaries.—</hi> The first pioneers who went
                    forth to engage in this difficult enterprise came from the secluded Celtic
                    churches of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands, which, though almost forgotten
                    amidst the desolating contest which was breaking up the Roman world, were no
                    sooner founded than they sent forth “armies of Scots” to pour back upon the
                    Continent the gifts of civilization and the gospel. Of many who deserve mention
                    in connexion with this period, the most prominent were—Columba, the founder of
                    the famous monastery of Iona, and the evangelizer of the Albanian Scots and
                    northern Picts; Aidan, the apostle of Northumbria; Columbanus, the apostle of
                    the Burgundians of the Vosges; Callich or Gallus, the evangelizer of
                    north-eastern Switzerland and Alemannia; Kilian, the apostle of Thuringia; and
                    Trudpert, the martyr of the Black Forest. The zeal of these singular men at the
                    head of ardent disciples seemed to take the world by storm. Travelling generally
                    in companies, and carrying a simple outfit, these Celtic pioneers flung
                    themselves on the Continent of Europe, and, not content with reproducing at
                    Annegray or Luxeuil the willow or brushwood huts, the chapel and the round
                    tower, which they had left behind in Derry or in the island of Hy, they braved
                    the dangers of the northern seas, and penetrated as far as the Faroes and even
                    far distant Iceland.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    A. W. Haddan, "Scots on the Continent,” <hi rend="italic">Remains,</hi> p.
                    256.</p></note></p>
                <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">The English Missionaries.—</hi> Thus they laid the
                    foundations, awing the heathen tribes by their indomitable spirit of
                    self-sacrifice and the sternness of their rule of life.</p>
                <p>But, marvellous as it was, their work lacked the element of permanence; and it
                    became clear that if Europe was to be carried through the dissolution of the old
                    society, and missionary operations consolidated, a more practical system must be
                    devised and carried out. The men for this work were now ready. Restored to the
                    commonwealth of nations by the labours of the followers of Augustine of
                    Canterbury and the Celtic missionaries from Iona, the sons of the newly
                    evangelized English churches were ready to go forth to the help of their
                    Teutonic brothers in the German forests. The energy which warriors were
                    accustomed to put forth in their efforts to conquer was now “exhibited in the
                    enterprise of conversion and teaching”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Willibrord, in the same region, and last, not least, by the famous Winfrid or
                    Boniface, the “apostle of Germany,” who went forth first to assist Willibrord at
                    Utrecht, then to labour in Thuringia and Upper Hessia, then, with the aid of his
                    kinsmen Wunibald and Willibald, their sister Walpurga, and her thirty
                    companions, to consolidate the work of earlier missionaries, and finally to die
                    a martyr on the shore of the Zuyder Zee.</p>
                <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Scandinavian Missions.—</hi> Devoted, however, as were the
                    labours of Boniface and his disciples, the battle was not yet nearly won. All
                    that he and they and the emperor Charlemagne after them achieved for the fierce
                    untutored world of the 8th century seemed to have been done in vain when, in the
                    9th, “on the north and north-west the pagan Scandinavians were hanging about
                    every coast, and pouring in at every inlet; when on the east the pagan
                    Hungarians were swarming like locusts and devastating Europe from the Baltic to
                    the Alps; when on the south and south-east the Saracens were pressing on and on
                    with their victorious hosts. It seemed then as if every pore of life were
                    choked, and Christendom must be stifled and smothered in the fatal
                    embrace.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Lightfoot,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ancient and Modern Missions.</hi></p></note> But it was even
                    now that one of the most intrepid of missionary enterprises was undertaken, and
                    the devoted Anskar went forth and proved himself a true apostle of Denmark and
                    Sweden, sought out the Scandinavian viking in his native home and icy fiords,
                    and, after persevering in the face of apparently insurmountable difficulties and
                    hardships, handed on the torch of self-denying zeal to others, who “casting
                    their bread on the waters” saw, after the lapse of many years, the close of the
                    monotonous tale of burning churches and pillaged monasteries, and taught the
                    fierce Northman to lay aside his old habits of piracy, and gradually learn
                    respect for civilized institutions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(d) Slavonic Missions.—</hi> Thus the “gospel of the kingdom”
                    was successively proclaimed to the Roman, the Celtic, the Teutonic, and the
                    Scandinavian world. A contest still more stubborn remained with the Slavonic
                    tribes, with their triple and many-headed divinities, their powers of good and
                    powers of evil, who could be approached only with fear and horror, and
                    propitiated only with human sacrifices. Mission work commenced in Bulgaria
                    during the latter part of the 9th century; thence it extended to Moravia, where
                    two Greek missionaries—Cyril and Methodius—provided for the people a Slavonic
                    Bible <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n534/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0534-0513"/> and a Slavonic Liturgy; thence to Bohemia, and so
                    onwards to the Scythian wilds and level steppes, where arose the Russian kingdom
                    of Ruric the Northman, and where about the close of the 10th century the Eastern
                    Church “silently and almost unconsciously bore into the world her mightiest
                    offspring.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stanley, <hi
                    rend="italic">Eastern Church,</hi> p. 294.</p></note> But, though the baptism of
                    Vladimir and the flinging of the triple and many-headed idols into the waters of
                    the Dnieper was a heavy blow to Slavonic idolatry, mission work was carried on
                    with but partial success; and it taxed all the energies of Albrecht, bishop of
                    Bremen, of Vicilin, bishop of Oldenburg, of Bishop Otto of Bamberg the apostle
                    of the Pomeranians, of Adalbert the martyr-apostle of Prussia, to spread the
                    word in that country, in Lithuania, and in the territory of the Wends. It was
                    not till 1168 that the gigantic fourheaded image of Swantevit was destroyed at
                    Arcona, the capital of the island of Rügen, and this Mona of Slavonic
                    superstition was included in the advancing circle of Christian civilization. As
                    late as 1230 human sacrifices were still being offered up in Prussia and
                    Lithuania, and, in spite of all the efforts of the Teutonic Knights to expel by
                    force the last remains of heathenism from the face of Europe, idolatrous
                    practices still lingered amongst the people, while in the districts inhabited by
                    the Lapps, though successful missions had been inaugurated as early as 1335,
                    Christianity cannot be said to have become the dominant religion till at least
                    two centuries later.</p>
                <p>(e) <hi rend="italic">Moslem Missions.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The mention
                    of the order of the Teutonic Knights reminds us how the crusading spirit had
                    affected Christendom, and exchanged the patience of a Boniface or an Anskar for
                    the fiery zeal of the warrior of the cross. Still it is refreshing to notice how
                    even now there was found the famous Raymond Lully to protest against
                    propagandism by the sword, to urge on pope after pope the necessity of missions
                    amongst the Moslems, and to seal his testimony with his blood outside the gates
                    of Bugiah in northern Africa (June 30, 1315). Out of the crusades, however,
                    arose other efforts to bear the banner of the cross into the lands of the East,
                    and to develop the work which Nestorian missionaries from Baghdad, Edessa, and
                    Nisibis had already inaugurated along the Malabar coast, in the island of
                    Ceylon, and in the neighbourhood of the Caspian Sea. In 1245 the Roman pontiff
                    sent two embassies, one to charge the Mongol warriors to desist from their
                    desolating inroads into Europe, the other to attempt to win them over to the
                    Christian faith. The first, a party of four Dominicans, sought the
                    commander-in-chief of the Mongol forces in Persia; the second, consisting of
                    Franciscans, made their way into Tartary, and sought to convert the successor of
                    Oktai-Khan. Their exertions were seconded in 1253 by the labours of another
                    Franciscan whom Louis IX. of France sent forth from Cyprus,<note anchored="true"

                    by two learned Dominicans, visited the court of Kublai-Khan, and at the
                    commencement of the 14th century two Franciscans penetrated as far as Peking,
                    and kept alive a flickering spark of Christianity in the Tartar kingdom, even
                    translating the New Testament and the Psalter into the Tartar language, and

                    North America opened up a new world to missionary enterprise. These bold
                    discoverers had secured the countenance of the pope on the condition that
                    wherever they might plant a flag they should be also zealous in promoting the
                    extension of the Christian faith. Thus a grand opportunity was given to the
                    churches of Portugal and Spain. But the zeal of the Portuguese, even when not
                    choked by the rising lust of wealth and territorial power, took too often a

                    conqueror of Mexico evinced no little solicitude for the spiritual welfare of
                    his charge; and the labours of the devoted men whom he begged the emperor to

                    Missions.—</hi> It was during the period at which we have now arrived that the
                    great organization of the Jesuits came into existence, and one of the first of
                    Loyola’s associates, Francis Xavier, was also one of the greatest and most
                    zealous missionaries of his or any other era. Encouraged by the joint
                    co-operation of the pope and of John III. of Portugal, and strongly tinged like
                    Loyola with ideas of chivalry and self-devotion, he disembarked at Goa on the
                    6th of May 1542, and before his death on the Isle of St John (Hiang-Shang),
                    December 2, 1552, he had roused the European Christians of Goa to a new life,
                    laboured with singular success amongst the Para-vars, a fisher caste near Cape
                    Comorin, gathered many converts in the kingdom of Travancore, visited the island
                    of Malacca, made his way to and founded a mission in Japan, thence revisited
                    Goa, and impelled by the quenchless desire to unfurl the banner of the cross in
                    China, had set out thither to fall a victim to malignant fever at the early age
                    of forty-six, within sight of that vast empire whose conversion had been the
                    object of his holy ambition.</p>
                <p>The immediate successor of Xavier, Antonio Criminalis, was regarded by the
                    Jesuits as the first martyr of their society (1562). Mattheo Ricci, an Italian
                    by birth, was also an indefatigable missionary in China for twenty-seven years,
                    while the peculiar methods of unholy compromise with Brahmanism in India
                    followed by Robert de’ Nobili drew down the condemnatory briefs of pope after
                    pope, and were fatal to the vitality of his own and other missions.</p>

                <p>Other representatives of the same order worked with success in evangelizing the
                    Spanish settlement of Paraguay in 1582, while their defeated foes the Huguenots
                    sent forth under a French knight of Malta a body of devoted men to attempt the
                    formation of a Christian colony at Rio Janeiro. By the close of the 16th century
                    the unflagging zeal of the Jesuits led to a more complete development and
                    organization of the missionary system of the Roman Church. To give unity and
                    solidity to the work of missions, a committee of cardinals was appointed under
                    the name of the “Congregatio de propaganda fide,” and to it was entrusted the
                    entire management of the mission, conducted under the superintendence of the
                    pope. The scheme originated with Gregory XIII., but was not fully organized till
                    forty years afterwards, when Gregory XV. gave it plenary authority by a bull
                    dated June 2, 1622. Gregory’s successor, Urban VIII., supplemented the
                    establishment of the congregation by founding in connexion with it a great
                    missionary college, where Europeans might be trained for foreign labours, and
                    natives might be educated to undertake mission work wherever new colonies were
                    settled. At this college is the missionary printing-press of the Roman Church,
                    and its library contains an unrivalled collection of literary treasures bearing
                    on the particular work. From its walls have gone forth numbers of devoted men,
                    who have proved themselves able to promote in a singular degree the enlargement
                    of the boundaries of the church by means of material as well as spiritual
                    forces.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The, Modern Period.</hi></p>
                <p>This last period of missionary activity is distinguished in a special degree by
                    the exertions of societies for the development of mission work.</p>
                <p>As contrasted with the colossal display of power on the part of the Church of
                    Rome, it must be allowed that the churches which in the 16th century broke off
                    from their allegiance to the Latin centre at first presented a great lack of
                    anxiety for the extension of the gospel and the salvation of the heathen. The
                    causes of this, however, are not far to seek. The isolation of the Teutonic
                    churches from the vast system with which they had been bound up, the conflicts
                    and troubles among themselves, the necessity of fixing their own principles and
                    defining their own rights, concentrated their attention upon themselves and
                    their own home work, to the neglect of work abroad.</p>
                <p>Still the development of the maritime power of England, which the Portuguese and
                    Spanish monarchies noted with fear and jealousy, was distinguished by a singular
                    anxiety for the spread of the Christian faith. Edward VI. in his instructions to
                    the navigators in Willoughby’s fleet, Cabot in those for the direction of the
                    intended voyage to Cathay, good old Hakluyt, who promoted many voyages of
                    discovery in addition to writing their history, agree with Sir Humphrey
                    Gilbert’s chronicler that “the sowing of Christianity must be the chief intent
                    of such as shall make any attempt at foreign discovery, or else whatever is
                    builded upon other foundation shall never obtain happy success or continuance.”
                    When on the last day of the year 1600 Queen Elizabeth granted a charter to
                    George, earl of Cumberland, and other “adventurers,” to be a bodycorporate by
                    the name of “The Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the
                    East Indies,” the expressed recognition of higher duties than those of commerce
                    may by some be deemed a mere matter of form, and, to use the words of Bacon,
                    “what was first in God’s providence was but second in man’s appetite and
                    intention.” Yet a keen sense of missionary duty marks many of the chronicles of
                    English mariners. Notably was this the case with the establishment of the first
                    English colony in America, that of Virginia, by Sir Walter Raleigh. The
                    philosopher Heriot, one of his colleagues, laboured for the conversion of the
                    natives, amongst whom the first baptism is recorded to have taken place on
                    August 13, 1587.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    might be among the savages bordering among them”; and the honoured names of
                    Nicolas Ferrar, John Ferrar, Dr Donne, and Sir John Sandys, a pupil of Hooker,

                    conducted.</p>

                    to the East India Company, and much about the same time appeared the well-known

                    >Veritate Religionis</hi><hi rend="italic">Christianae,</hi> written for the

                    American colonies did not escape the attention of Archbishop Laud during his
                    official connexion with them as bishop of London, and he was developing a plan
                    for promoting a local episcopate there when his troubles began and his scheme
                    was interrupted. During the Protectorate, in 1649, an ordinance was passed for
                    “the promoting and propagating of the gospel of Jesus Christ in New England” by
                    the erection of a corporation, to be called by the name of the President and
                    Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England, to receive and dispose
                    of moneys for the purpose, and a general collection was ordered to be made in
                    all the parishes of England and Wales; and Cromwell himself desired a scheme for
                    setting up a council for the Protestant religion, which should rival the Roman
                    Propaganda, and consist of seven councillors and four secretaries for different

                    monarchy, through the influence of Richard Baxter with Lord Chancellor Hyde, the
                    charter already granted by Cromwell was renewed, and its powers were enlarged.
                    For now the corporation was styled “The Propagation of the Gospel in New England
                    and the parts adjacent in America,” and its object was defined to be “not only
                    to seek the outward welfare and prosperity of those colonies, but more
                    especially to endeavour the good and salvation of their immortal souls, and the
                    publishing the most glorious gospel of Christ among them.” On the list of the
                    corporation the first name is the earl of Clarendon, while the Hon. Robert Boyle
                    was appointed president. Amongst the most eminent of its missionaries was the
                    celebrated John Eliot, who, encouraged by Boyle, and assisted by him with
                    considerable sums of money, brought out the Bible in the Indian language in
                    1661—64, having revealed at the end of the Indian grammar which he had composed
                    the secret of his success: “prayer and pains, through faith in Jesus Christ,
                    will do anything.” Boyle displayed in other ways his zeal for the cause of
                    missions. He contributed to the expense of printing and publishing at Oxford the
                    four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles in the Malay language, and at his
                    death left £5400 for the propagation of the gospel in heathen lands.</p>
                <p>The needs of the colonial church soon excited the attention of others also, and
                    great efforts were made by Bishop Beveridge, Archbishop Wake, Archbishop Sharpe,
                    Bishop Gibson, and afterwards by the philosophic Bishop Berkeley, and Bishop
                    Butler, the famous author of the <hi rend="italic">Analogy,</hi> to <pb

                    wants of the Indian tribes. In 1696 Dr Bray, at the request of the governor and
                    assembly of Maryland, was selected by the bishop oi London as ecclesiastical
                    commissary; and, having sold his effects, and raised money on credit, he sailed
                    for Maryland in 1699, where he promoted, in various ways, the interests of the
                    church. Returning to England in 1700-1, and supported by all the weight of
                    Archbishop Tenison and Bishop Compton, he was graciously received by William
                    III., and received letters patent under the great seal oi England for creating a
                    corporation by the name of the “Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
                    Foreign Parts” on the 16th of June 1701.</p>
                <p>With the establishment of this corporation the era oi the activity of societies
                    for carrying out mission work may be said to commence, though the opening of the
                    18th century saw other movements set on foot for the same object. Thus in 1705
                    Frederick IV. of Denmark founded a mission on the Coromandel coast, and
                    inaugurated the labours of Ziegenbalg, Schultze, and Schwartz, whose devotion
                    and success told with such remarkable reflex influence on the church at home.
                    Again in 1731 the Moravians illustrated in a signal degree the growing
                    consciousness of obligation towards the heathen. Driven by persecution from
                    Moravia, hunted into mountain-caves and forests, they had scarcely secured a
                    place of refuge in Saxony before, “though a mere handful in numbers, yet with
                    the spirit of men banded for daring and righteous deeds, they formed the heroic
                    design, and vowed the execution of it before God, of bearing the gospel to the
                    savage and perishing tribes of Greenland and the West Indies, of whose condition
                    report had brought a mournful rumour to their ears.” And so, literally with
                    “neither bread nor scrip,” they went forth on their pilgrimage, and, incredible
                    as it sounds, within ten years they had established missions in the islands of
                    the West Indies, in South America, Surinam, Greenland, among the North American
                    tribes, in Lapland, Tartary, Algiers, Guinea, the Cape of Good Hope, and
                    Ceylon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Holmes, <hi

                <p>Sueh were the preparations for the more general movements during the last hundred
                    years, and the manifestation of missionary zeal on a scale to which it would be
                    difficult to find a parallel in Western Christianity.</p>
                <p>The progress that has been made may be best judged of from consideration of the
                    following details :—</p>
                <p>(a) At the close of the last century there were only seven missionary societies
                    in existence, properly so called. Of these three only, the Society for the
                    Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the Halle-Danish Society, and the
                    Moravians, had been at work for the greater part of the century, whilst four,
                    the Church Missionary Society, the Baptist Missionary Society, the London
                    Missionary Society, and the Dutch Society at Rotterdam, began their work only in
                    its tenth decade. To-day these seven have, in Europe and America alone,
                    increased to upwards of seventy, and to these must be added, not only several
                    independent societies in the colonies, but numerous missionary associations on a
                    smaller scale, the offspring of English and American societies.</p>

                    about 5000 heathen converts under instruction, not counting those belonging to
                    the Roman Catholic missions. At the present day the converts from heathenism may
                    be estimated certainly at no less than 1,800,000, a single year (1878) showing
                    an increase of about 60,000.</p>
                <p>(e) When the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was founded in 1701, there
                    were probably not twenty clergymen of the Church of England in foreign parts.
                    The spiritual condition of the settlers in America and elsewhere was terrible in
                    the extreme, and no effort was then made by the church to win over the heathen
                    to Christ. But now the position which the church holds in the British colonies
                    and dependencies and many parts of heathendom is recognized by all. In those
                    regions where the society labours, and which before it commenced its work were
                    spiritually the “waste places” of the earth, there are, including the American
                    Church (the first fruits of the society’s efforts), 138 bishops, more than 5000
                    clergy, and upwards of 2,000,000 members of the communion.</p>
                <p>The above tables sufficiently indicate how varied are the missionary agencies now
                    at work, covering the heathen <pb break="no"

                    within the last century have won nearly two millions of converts to the
                    Christian faith.</p>
                <p>The continuity of missionary enthusiasm maintained through the primitive, the
                    mediaeval, and the modern periods of the church’s history, operating at every
                    critical epoch, and surviving after periods of stagnation and depression, is a
                    very significant fact. It is true that other religions have been called
                    missionary religions, and that one of them occupies the first place in the
                    religious census of mankind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    and no characteristic rite distinguishing it has found its way into a second
                    continent; while, as for Mohammedanism, the character of its teaching is too
                    exact a reflexion of the race, time, place, and climate in which it arose to
                    admit of its becoming universal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    their hold over millions, but it must be admitted that their prospect of
                    endurance in the presence of advancing Christianity is very small, and it is
                    difficult to trace the slightest probability of their harmonizing with the
                    intellectual, social, and moral progress of the modern world. With all its
                    deficiencies, the Christian church has gained the “nations of the future,” and
                    whereas in the 3d century the proportion of Christians to the whole human race
                    was only that of one in a hundred and fifty, this has now been exchanged for one
                    in five,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lightfoot, <hi

                    progress of the human race at this moment is entirely identified with the spread
                    of the influence of the nations of Christendom.</p>
                <p>Side by side with this continuity of missionary zeal, a noticeable feature is the
                    immense influence of individual energy and the subduing force of personal
                    character. Around individuals penetrated with Christian zeal and selfdenial has
                    centred not merely the life, but the very existence, of primitive, mediaeval,
                    and modern missions. What Ulfila was to the Gothic tribes, what Columba and his
                    disciples were to the early Celtic missions, what Augustine or Aidan was to the
                    British Isles, what Boniface was to the churches of Germany and Anskar to those
                    of Denmark and Sweden, that, on the discovery of a new world of missionary
                    enterprise, was Xavier to India, Hans Egede to Greenland, Eliot to the Red
                    Indians, Martyn to the church of Cawnpore, Marsden to the Maoris, Carey and
                    Marshman to Burmah, Heber, Wilson, Milman, and Duff to India, Gray, Livingstone,
                    Mackenzie, Steere, Callaway to Africa, Broughton to Australia, Patteson to
                    Melanesia, Mountain and Feild to Newfoundland, Crowther to the Niger Territory,
                    Brett to Guiana. At the most critical epochs such men have ever been raised up,
                    and the reflex influence of their lives and self-denial has told upon the church
                    at home, while apart from their influence the entire history of important
                    portions of the world’s surface would have been altered.</p>
                <p>If from the agents themselves we turn to the work that has been accomplished it
                    will not be disputed that the success of missions has been marked amongst rude
                    and aboriginal tribes. What was true in the early missions has been found true
                    in these latter times. The rude and barbarous northern peoples seemed to fall
                    like “full ripe fruit before the first breath of the gospel.” The Goths and the
                    Vandals who poured down upon the Roman empire were evangelized so silently and
                    rapidly that only a fact here and there relating to their conversion has been
                    preserved. Now this is exactly analogous to modern experience in the South Seas,
                    America, and Africa. We must here content ourselves with a cursory survey of

                <p>In Australia work among the aborigines, wherever it has been zealously conducted,
                    has been blessed with signal success. Amongst the Papuans the Moravian stations
                    of Ebenezer in the district of Wimmera, and Ramahyuck in that of Gippsland, can
                    point to their little villages of 125 native Christian inhabitants, their
                    cleanly houses, and their well-ordered churches. In the district of South
                    Adelaide, at Point Macleay, the Scottish Presbyterian Mission has been similarly
                    successful, while in New Zealand the native population was converted almost
                    within a single generation. In the islands north and north-west of Australia the
                    Dutch missionaries have been especially successful in the Minahassa (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Celebes),</hi> of whose 114,000 inhabitants more than 80,000
                    have been won over to the Christian faith, forming 195 communities with 125
                    schools; and in southern Borneo, the Rhenish Mission in the south and the
                    Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in the north have been enabled to
                    establish themselves firmly, while the former society has also done a great work
                    among the Battaks in Sumatra. Amongst the dark-coloured races of Polynesia
                    missionary work has made great advances through the labours of the London
                    Missionary Society, the Wesleyans, and the American Board. Making Tahiti its
                    basis of operations, the first-named society has carried on missionary
                    operations in the islands of Australasia, Hervey, Samoa, Tokelau, and Ellice,
                    while the American Board has witnessed equally favourable results in the
                    Sandwich Islands, and in Micronesia (Caroline, Marshall, and Gilbert Islands)
                    the agents of the Hawaiian Association are actively at work under the direction
                    of American missionaries. In Melanesia the Society for the Propagation of the
                    Gospel, the Wesleyans, the London Missionary Society, and the Presbyterians are
                    all actively engaged. The Fiji group stands out as one of the most promising
                    centres of Christian civilization, and the governor, Sir A. Gordon, was enabled
                    to report in 1879 that, out of a population of about 120,000, 102,000 are now
                    regular worshippers in the churches, which number 800, while over 42,000
                    children are in attendance in 1534 Christian day schools. The Loyalty Islands
                    have been occupied partly by Roman Catholic missions and partly by the London
                    Missionary Society, while in the New Hebrides the missionaries of the Γrco
                    Church of Scotland and of the Presbyterian churches of Canada, New Zealand, and
                    Australia, in spite of many obstacles, the unhealthiness of the climate, and the
                    variety of the dialects spoken, have upwards of 3000 natives receiving Christian
                    teaching, 800 communicants, and 100 native teachers. On the islands of Banks,
                    Santa Cruz, and Solomon, the English Episcopal Church is achieving no little
                    success, sending native youths for months at a time to Norfolk Island to receive
                    instruction, whence they return again in order to spread the knowledge of truth
                    at home. These islands will ever be famous in connexion with the martyr death of
                    the noble Bishop Patteson.</p>

                    genius named William Duncan has succeeded in civilizing a body of Indians
                    degraded by cannibalism, and at his Metlakahtla mission stands at the head of a
                    community of some thousand persons, which has a larger church than is to be
                    found between there and San Francisco. Testimony to the value of the results
                    achieved was borne in 1876 by Lord Dufferin, then governor-general of Canada,
                    who declared that he could hardly find words to express his astonishment at what
                    he witnessed. Amongst the Indian tribes of the United States work is carried on
                    by the Moravians, the American Board of Missions, the Presbyterians of the North
                    and South, the Baptists, the Episcopal Methodists, and the American Missionary
                    Society; and the result is that 27,000 Indians, divided amongst the 171
                    communities of different denominations (including the Roman Catholic) are in
                    full membership with the church, and have 219 places of worship, besides 366

                    rapidly extended, and now upwards of half the Indian population are members of
                    Christian churches. In the British West Indies, through the united labours of
                    various missionary societies, out of 1,000,000 inhabitants upwards of 248,000
                    are returned as regular members of the churches, 85,000 as communicants, while

                    English Wesleyan missionaries and of the North German missionary societies have
                    been crowned with no small success, while the Basel Society, which celebrated
                    its jubilee in 1878, has extended its sphere of activity to Ashantee,
                    translating the Scriptures into the native languages, and changing primeval
                    marshes into bright-looking Christian villages. In the Yoruba lands the Church
                    Missionary Society has 11 stations, 5994 Christians, and 1657 scholars, while on
                    the Niger we are confronted with the interesting spectacle of negro preachers
                    and teachers labouring under the coloured Bishop Crowther, carrying on a work
                    which within the last few years was consecrated by the blood of martyrs.</p>
                <p>South Africa has for some time been a centre of missionary activity. Here
                    thirteen British aud Continental associations have proved that all the South
                    African races, Hottentots and Kaffres, Fingoes and Bechuanas, Basutos and Zulus,
                    are capable of attaining a considerable degree of Christian civilization, and
                    can not only be instructed iu handicraft and agriculture, but trained as
                    ministers and teachers. A single instance of this is afforded in British
                    Kaffraria by the Lovedale Institute of the Free Church of Scotland, where youths
                    from all the above-mentioned tribes are taught along with Europeans, and every
                    Sunday sixty students proclaim the gospel in the neighbouring villages. In the
                    cause of mission work here few ever laboured more zealously than the late Bishop
                    Gray, whose diocese, when first constituted, included the whole colony of the
                    Cape, but whose successor has now for his suffragans the bishops of Grahamstown,
                    Maritzburg, St Helena, Bloemfontein, Zululand, St John’s, and Pretoria.</p>
                <p>East and East Central Africa, so long neglected, is now being rapidly occupied by

                    evangelized, while on the island of Mauritius the Anglican Mission has developed
                    pre-eminent results. On the mainland, the coast of Zanzibar calls for special
                    notice. Here the little island of the same name has long been the seat of the
                    Universities Mission to Central Africa, and the heroic Bishop Steere has not
                    only erected a cathedral on the site of the former slave-market, but translated
                    the New Testament into Sawahili, a language which can be understood by the
                    tribes around the lakes, and even iu Uganda.</p>

                    brazen gates of thine be broken through?” was the mournful exclamation of
                    Valignani, the successor of Xavier, as he gazed in sadness at the mountains of
                    China. The words well express the incredible difficulties which this largest aud
                    most thickly peopled heathen land in the world, with its petrified constitution
                    and culture of three thousand years, presents in the way of missionary effort.
                    The country itself, the people, their speech, their manners, their religion,
                    their policy, seemed to unite in opposing an insuperable barrier, but history
                    has to record how efforts have been made by many bodies, and at many times, to
                    break it down. An early Nestorian Church established itself in the empire, but
                    was either uprooted, or died out in course of time. In the 16 th century the
                    Jesuits undertook the task, and in spite of the persecutions which they have
                    undergone the missions of the Roman Church, with their numerous foreign clergy
                    and their hosts of natives of different ecclesiastical degrees, have attained no
                    small measure of success. Before the country was really opened to foreigners by
                    the treaty of Tientsin, pioneers proceeded thither from America, and from the
                    London Missionary Society. The labours of Dr Legge in translating and reducing
                    to system the Chinese classics are well known. At the present day it is
                    estimated that there are upwards of 29 societies at work in the country, with
                    about 250 ordained missionaries and 63 female teachers, and the number is
                    constantly increasing. These societies, of which the largest proportion belong
                    to England, and'the next largest to America, support, it is estimated, 20
                    theological schools, 30 higher boarding schools for boys with 611 scholars, 38
                    for girls with 777 scholars, 177 day schools for boys with 4000 to 5000 pupils
                    in attendance, 82 for girls with 1307, while 16 missionary hospitals and 24
                    dispensaries are under the direction of medical missionaries, whose work in
                    China has been recognized almost from the first as the source of the greatest
                    blessing. The mission centres stud the east coast from Hong Kong and Canton to
                    the frontiers of Manchuria in the north; thence they advance little by little
                    every year into the interior, while as yet the western provinces are scarcely
                    touched by missionary effort. The literary labours of the various societies have
                    been carried on with the utmost perseverance; and on the foundations laid by a
                    Morrison and a Milne later toilers have been enabled to raise a superstructure
                    of translations of various portions of the Bible, as well as various Christian
                    books and religious and general periodicals which constitute a means of vast
                    importance towards gradually gaining over this land of culture. At Peking a
                    Russian mission has been labouring for more than one hundred and fifty years.
                    The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Church Missionary Society

                    yet too early to forecast the future. The signing of the commercial treaties of
                    1854 and 1858 with America and England was followed in 1859 by efforts on the
                    part of the American churches to extend a knowledge of Christianity, and in
                    these Bishop Williams, an accomplished Japanese scholar, proved himself a
                    valuable leader and guide. Soon afterwards other societies found their way into
                    the country, and in March 1872 the first Japanese congregation, of 11 converts,
                    was constituted in Yokohama. Within the last eight years these 11 have increased
                    to 1200, while the American missions have been supplemented by those of the
                    Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.
                    Nearly every mission has what may be called a high school for girls, and these
                    institutions are very popular. Thousands of copies also of the Gospels have been
                    circulated in Japanese, and representatives of nearly all the missions are
                    engaged in translating the entire New Testament, while a Russo-Greek mission has
                    established itself in the north, and is advancing steadily, having already made
                    about 3000 converts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>

                    when it is considered that in the beginning of the 17th century the Japanese
                    Government drove out the Portuguese and massacred the native Catholic converts,
                    and prohibited all Christians under pain of death from ever setting foot in the
                    country, and when it is borne in mind that many of these old laws against
                    Christianity have not yet been repealed and that the old distrust of strangers
                    is still plainly discernible among the governing classes, it is clear that,
                    while there is much ground for hope, effectual results can only be the work of
                    time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">India.—</hi> What is true of China and Japan applies with
                    tenfold force to India. Here the results achieved resemble those which were
                    attained in the conflict between Christianity and the religion of old pagan
                    Rome, with its mass of time-honoured customs interwoven with the literature,
                    institutions, and history of the empire. Against the influence of prestige and
                    settled prejudice the wave of the gospel beat for centuries in vain. Slowly and
                    gradually it was undermining the fabric, but no striking results were
                    immediately visible. So also in India with the Hindu proper Christianity has
                    hitherto made inappreciable progress, while among the rude aboriginal or
                    non-Aryan tribes its success has been remarkable. Independently of Roman
                    Catholic missions upwards of twenty-eight societies are earnestly engaged in the
                    English mission field, and the following figures will give some idea of the
                    progress that has been made during the last twenty or thirty years. In British
                    India, including Burmah and Ceylon, it is estimated that in 1852 there were
                    22,400 communicants and 128,000 native Christians young and old; in 1862 these
                    had increased to 49,681 communicants and 213,182 native Christians; in 1872
                    there had been a further increase to 78,494 communicants and 318,363 native
                    Christians, while in 1878 the latter figures rose to 460,000. When we look at
                    the share that each of the societies has had in this increase, we find that the
                    Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Church Missionary Society
                    together have since 1850 increased in membership from 61,442 to upwards of
                    164,000; the London Missionary Society from 20,000 to upwards of 48,000; the
                    Presbyterian missions of Scotland, England, Ireland, and America from 800 to
                    10,000; the Basel mission in India from 1000 to 6805; the Baptist missionary
                    societies (including the American as well as the English) from 30,000 to 90,000;
                    the five Lutheran societies from 3316 to about 42,000. In some places the

                    in the Telugu territory, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the
                    London Missionary Society laboured side by side for upwards of thirty years
                    without winning over more than 200 converts. Then on a sudden there sprang up a
                    revival among the non-caste population, and the 200 became nearly 11,000. Among
                    the Kols, after five years’ waiting, the Gossner missionaries baptized their
                    first converts in 1850; now in the German and English stations together these
                    amount to about 40,000. Since the famine, however, in 1878-79, the increase of
                    new converts has been still more rapid, and the practical experience of the
                    superiority of Christian pity to heathen selfishness and of the helplessness of
                    their heathen deities, united with the effect produced by persistent missionary
                    labour in past years, brought thousands into the fold of the church. Thus in the
                    Tinnevelly district, where the Church Missionary Society carries on its
                    operations, upwards of 11,000 heathens applied in 1878 to Bishop Sargent and his
                    native clergy for instruction preparatory to baptism.<note anchored="true"

                    between July 1877 and the end of June 1878 upwards of 23,564 persons betook
                    themselves to Bishop Caldwell and his fellowlabourers for Christian teaching.
                    Thus the English Church missions in Tinnevelly and Ramnad received in little
                    more than a year and a half an increase of 35,000 souls,<note anchored="true"

                    Propagation Society is now proclaiming the gospel in nearly six hundred and
                    fifty villages in the Tinnevelly district, amongst not merely food-seeking “rice
                    Christians” but those who have had the courage to face severe persecution for
                    joining the Christian church. Encouraging progress has also been made among the
                    Santals and the Karens in Burmah and Pegu. Speaking generally, it may be said
                    that the largest proportion of native converts is in the south, in the
                    presidency of Madras; next to southern India the most fruitful field is Burmah,
                    where the American Baptist missions are carrying on a successful work among the
                    Karens, while the Propagation Society has founded many schools on the Irawadi,
                    and penetrated up to Rangoon, and beyond British territory to Mandalay; next in
                    point of numbers stand Bengal and the North-West Provinces. Here the largest
                    contingent is supplied by the missions in Chutiâ Nagpùr, among the aboriginal
                    tribes of the Kols, while the Santal mission also presents many promising
                    features. For the Punjab district and that of Sind, the Church Missionary
                    Society has planted in Lahore a flourishing theological seminary for Christian
                    Hindus, Sikhs, and Mohammedans, and Christianity has advanced thence by way of
                    Peshawar into Afghanistan and Kashmir. It thus appears that by far the greatest
                    measure of success has been obtained amongst the aboriginal races and those who
                    are either of low caste or of no caste at all, while the real strongholds of the
                    Hindu religion and civilization still stand out like strong fortresses and defy
                    the attempts of the besiegers. Still the disintegrating agency of contact with
                    Christianity is working out its slow but sure results. “Statistical facts,”
                    writes Sir Bartie Frere, “can in no way convey any adequate idea of the work
                    done in any part of India. The effect is often enormous where there has not been
                    a single avowed conversion. The teaching of Christianity amongst 160 millions of
                    civilized industrious Hindus and Mohammedans in India is effecting changes,
                    moral, social, and political, which for extent and rapidity in effect are far
                    more extraordinary than any that have been witnessed in modern Europe.” “The
                    number of actual converts to Christianity in India,” says Lord Lawrence, “does
                    not by any means give an adequate result of missionary labours. There are
                    thousands of persons scattered over India who from the knowledge they have
                    acquired either directly or indirectly through dissemination of Christian truth
                    and Christian principles have lost all belief in Hinduism and Mohammedanism, and
                    are in their conduct influenced by higher motives, who yet fear to make an open
                    profession of the change in them lest they should be looked upon as outcasts and
                    lepers by their own people.” To some such a negative result may at first sight
                    appear discouraging; but, read by the light of history, it marks a natural,
                    almost a necessary, stage of transition from an ancient historical religion to
                    Christianity. The Brahma Somaj is not the first instance where a system too
                    vague and shadowy and too deficient in the elements of a permanent religion has
                    filled the interval between the abandonment of the old and the acceptance of a
                    new faith. The cultured classes amongst the Greeks and Romans experienced in
                    their day, after the popular mythology had ceased to satisfy, a period of
                    semi-scepticism before Christianity had secured its hold. Meantime in India the
                    indirect agencies which are at work—the results of war and conquest, of European
                    science and European literature, of the telegraph and the railway, the book and
                    the newspaper, the college and the school, the change of laws hallowed by
                    immemorial usage, the disregard of time-honoured prejudices, the very presence
                    of Europeans in all parts of the country—all these various influences are
                    gradually bringing about results analogous to that to which Sir James Mackintosh
                    referred in a conversation with Henry Martvn, when the</p>
                <p>Oriental world was made Greek by the successors of Alexander in order to make way
                    for the religion of Christ. But when to these indirect influences we add the
                    effects of direct missionary instruction, of training schools like those of the
                    Free Church of Scotland in Madras, of Bishop Sargent in Tinnevelly, of Bishop
                    Cotton in the North-West Provinces, of Zenana missions now carried on on an
                    extensive scale amongst the female population, of the numerous missionary
                    presses at work circulating thousands of copies of the Holy Scriptures and of
                    Christian books, it is obvious that, small and insignificant as these agencies
                    may seem compared with the magnitude of the work required to be done, there has
                    been a great advance made during recent years. The present century of missions
                    may favourably compare with the primitive and mediaeval ages of the church, and
                    the continuity of the missionary spirit operating, as we have seen, after long
                    periods of stagnation and depression is the best guarantee of its ultimate and
                    more complete success at the close of the present epoch, during which, to use
                    Karl Ritter’s expression, “almost all the rivers of the earth have begun to run
                    in double currents, and nearly all the seas and rivers have become the seas and
                    rivers of civilization.” (G. F. Μ.)</p>
