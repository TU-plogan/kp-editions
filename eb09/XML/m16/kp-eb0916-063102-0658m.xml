                    in the diocese of Saragossa, on 21st December 1627. Having entered the
                    priesthood, he settled about his fortieth year in Rome, where he speedily rose
                    to high repute as a father confessor, and gained many distinguished friends,
                    among whom were several cardinals, including Odescalchi (afterwards Innocent
                    XI., 1676). In 1675 he published at Rome a small duodecimo volume entitled <hi

                    perfetta contemplazione e del ricco tesoro della pace</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >interiore,</hi> which was soon afterwards followed by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Breve trattato della cottidiana</hi><hi rend="italic">communione,</hi> usually
                    bound up with it in later editions. The work, which breathes a spirit of simple
                    and earnest piety, is designed to show how inward peace may be found by what may
                    be called contemplative or passive prayer, by obedience, by frequent communion,
                    and by inward mortification; it was widely circulated, and greatly increased the
                    popularity of its author, whom Innocent XI. after his elevation provided with
                    rooms in the Vatican, and is said to have also taken as his spiritual director.
                    Its doctrine of the passivity of the highest contemplation and purest prayer
                    does not appear to have raised the slightest discussion until after the
                    publication, in 1681, of the <hi rend="italic">Concordia tra la fatica e
                    la</hi><hi rend="italic">quiete</hi><hi rend="italic">nell</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">oratione,</hi> by the Jesuit preacher, Paolo Segneri. Although
                    scrupulously refraining from any mention of the name of Molinos, and indeed
                    displaying considerable moderation as a controversialist, Segneri by this tract
                    and by another with which he followed it up brought upon himself much
                    unpopularity; and so great did the excitement become that a committee was at
                    last appointed by the Inquisition to investigate his own views as well as to
                    examine the writings of Molinos and of his friend Petrucci (author of <hi
                    rend="italic">La contemplazione mistica acquistata).</hi> The report (1682) was
                    entirely favourable to the doctrines of the <hi rend="italic">Guida</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Spirituale,</hi> the writings of Segneri being censured as
                    scandalous and heretical; but in 1685, in consequence of representations made to
                    the pope by Louis XIV., under the Jesuit influence of Père La Chaise, both
                    Petrucci and Molinos were laid under arrest, and the papers of the latter,
                    including a voluminous correspondence, seized. Petrucci was soon afterwards
                    liberated, and relieved from further persecution by the gift of a cardinal’s
                    hat; but, after Molinos had languished in confinement for two years, suddenly
                    200 persons, many of them of high rank, were also apprehended by order of the
                    Inquisition for what were then for the first time called “Quietist” opinions. In
                    1687 the pope signified his approval of the condemnation pronounced by the
                    Inquisition on sixty-eight doctrines imputed to Molinos. The “heretic” forthwith
                    “abjured” these, and thus escaped the flames indeed, but did not regain his
                    liberty. Of his later years nothing is known; according to the most probable
                    accounts he languished in imprisonment until 28th December 1696.</p>
                <p>The evidence on which certain charges of immorality against Molinos were based is
                    unknown, and the degree of his responsibility for certain of the condemned
                    propositions is obscure; but a perusal of the <hi rend="italic">Guida</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Spirituale</hi> at least does not disclose to the candid reader
                    any reason wherefore Molinos should not have been tolerated within a church
                    which has canonized St Theresa. The explanation of the treatment to which he was
                    subjected is most probably to be sought rather in the negative than in the
                    positive aspects of his teaching, and still more in the passing exigencies of
                    party politics. As Tholuck remarks, it was hardly to be expected that the
                    Society of Jesus should regard as otherwise than highly dangerous a man who
                    “declared confession and <hi rend="italic">outward</hi> mortification to be work
                    only for beginners, who himself abstained from confessing for twelve years on
                    end, by whose advice countless monks and nuns had thrown aside chaplets, images,
                    and reliques, that they might worship God in the spirit, and who, moreover,
                    stood well with the fashionable world and with the pope himself.” The <hi
                    rend="italic">Guida</hi><hi rend="italic">Spirituale</hi> was published in
                    Spanish at Madrid in 1676, and frequently afterwards; it was also translated
