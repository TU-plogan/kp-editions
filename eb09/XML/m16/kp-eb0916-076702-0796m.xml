                    (1533-1592), essayist, was born, as he himself tells us, between eleven o’clock
                    and noon on 28th February 1533. The patronymic of the Montaigne family, who
                    derived their title from the chateau at which the essayist was born and which
                    had been bought by his grandfather, was Eyquem. It was believed to be of English
                    origin, and the long tenure of Gascony and Guienne by the English certainly
                    provided abundant opportunity for the introduction of English colonists. But the
                    elaborate researches of Μ. Malvézin have proved the existence of a family of
                    Eyquems or Ayquems before the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine to Henry II. of
                    England, though no connexion bétween this family, who were Sieurs de Lesparre,
                    and the essayist’s ancestors can be made out. Montaigne is not far from
                    Bordeaux, and in Montaigne’s time -was in the province of Perigord. It is now in
                    the arrondissement of Bergerac and the department of Dordogne. The Eyquem family
                    had for some time been connected with Bordeaux. Indeed, though they possessed
                    more than one estate in the district, they were of doubtful and certainly very
                    recent nobility. Pierre Eyquem, Montaigne’s father, had been engaged in commerce
                    (a herring-merchant Scaliger calls him), had filled many municipal offices in
                    Bordeaux, and had served under Francis I. in Italy as a soldier. The essayist
                    was not the eldest son, but the third. By the death of his elder brothers,
                    however, he became head of the family. He had also six younger brothers and
                    sisters. His father appears, like many other men of the time, to have made a
                    hobby of education. Michel was not a strong boy, indeed he was all his life a
                    valetudinarian, and this may have especially prompted his father to take pains
                    with him. At a time when the rod was the universal instrument of teaching it was
                    almost entirely spared to Montaigne. He was, according to the French fashion
                    common at all times, put out to nurse with a peasant woman. But Pierre Eyquem
                    added to this the unusual fancy of choosing his son’s sponsors from the same
                    class, and of accustoming him to associate with it. He was taught Latin orally
                    by servants who could speak no French, and many curious fancies were tried on
                    him, as, for instance, that of waking him every morning by soft music. But he
                    was by no means allowed to be idle. A plan of teaching him Greek, still more out
                    of the common way than his Latin course, by some kind of mechanical arrangement,
                    is not very intelligible, and was quite unsuccessful. These details of his
                    education (which, like most else that is known about him, come from his own
                    mouth) are not only interesting in themselves, but remind the reader how, not
                    far from the same time, the other greatest writer of French during the
                    Renaissance was also exercising himself, though not being exercised, in plans of
                    education almost as fantastic. At six years old (for the father’s reforming
                    views in education do not seem to have disgusted him with the extremely early
                    age at which it was then usual to begin school training) Montaigne was sent to
                    the Collège de Guienne at Bordeaux, then at the height of its reputation, having
                    more than double the number of scholars (two thousand) that even the largest
                    English public school has usually boasted. Among its masters were Buchanan,
                    afterwards the teacher of James I., and Muretus, one of the first scholars of
                    the age. These, with their colleague Guérente, composed Latin plays for their
                    pupils to act, and are held to have given no small impulse to the production of
                    the classical French tragedy <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n797/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0797-0768"/> of the Pléiade. Montaigne remained at school
                    seven years, and, like almost all Frenchmen of all times, retained no pleasant
                    or complimentary memory of it. At thirteen he left the Collège de Guienne and
                    began to study law, it is not known where, but probably at Toulouse, the most
                    famous university, despite its religious intolerance, of the south of France. Of
                    his youth, early manhood, and middle life extremely little is known. Allusions
                    to it in the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> are frequent enough, but they are
                    rarely precise. In 1548 he was at Bordeaux during one of the frequent riots
                    caused by the gabelle, or salt tax. Six years afterwards, having attained his
                    majority, he was made a counsellor in the Bordeaux parliament. In 1558 he was
                    present at the siege of Thionville. Like his father, he certainly served in the
                    army, for he has frequent allusions to military experiences. He was also much
                    about the court, and he admits very frankly that in his youth he led a life of
                    pleasure, if not exactly of excess. In 1566 he married Françoise de la
                    Chassaigne, whose father was, like himself, a member of the Bordeaux parliament.
                    Three years later his father died, and he succeeded to the family possessions.
                    Finally, in 1571, as he tells us in an inscription still extant, he retired to
                    Montaigne to take up his abode there. This was the turning-point of his
                    life.</p>
                <p>It has been said that his health was never strong, and it had been further
                    weakened by the hard living (in both senses of that phrase) which was usual at
                    the time. He resolved, accordingly, to retire to a life of study and
                    contemplation, though he did not in the least seclude himself, and indulged in
                    no asceticism except careful diet. Montaigne was a large country house
                    unfortified (in which circumstance its astute possessor saw rather safety than
                    danger from the turbulence of the religious wars), and its owner’s revenues,
                    without being large, appear to have been easy. He neither had nor professed any
                    enthusiastic affection for his wife, but he lived on excellent terms with her,
                    and bestowed some pains on the education of the only child (a daughter) who
                    survived infancy. In his study, which he has minutely described, he read, wrote,
                    dictated, meditated, inscribed moral sentences, which still remain on the walls
                    and rafters, and in other ways gave himself up to learned ease. He was not new
                    to literature. In his father’s lifetime, and at his request, he had translated
                    the <hi rend="italic">Theologia Naturalis</hi> of Raymond de Sebonde, a Spanish
                    schoolman. On first coming to live at Montaigne he edited the works of his
                    deceased friend Étienne de la Boétie, who had been the comrade of his youth, who
                    died early, and who, with poems of real promise, had composed a declamatory and
                    schoolboyish theme on republicanism, entitled the <hi rend="italic">Contr</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">Un,</hi> which is one of the most overestimated books in
                    literature. But the years of his studious retirement were spent on a work of
                    infinitely greater importance. Garrulous after a fashion, as Montaigne is, he
                    gives us no clear idea of any original or definite impulse leading him to write
                    the famous <hi rend="italic">Essays.</hi> It is very probable that if they were
                    at first intended to have any special form at all it was that of a table-book or
                    journal, such as was never more commonly kept than in the 16 th century. But the
                    author must have been more or less conscious of an order existing in the
                    disorder of his thoughts, and this may have induced him to keep them apart in
                    chapters, or at least under chapter-headings, and at the same time not to cut
                    them up into mere <hi rend="italic">pensées.</hi> It is certainly very
                    noticeable that the earlier essays, those of the first two books, differ from
                    the later in one most striking point, in that of length. Speaking generally, the
                    essays of the third book average fully four times the length of those of the
                    other two. This of itself would suggest a difference in the system of
                    composition. For the present, however, we may confine ourselves to the first two
                    books. These appeared in 1580, when their author was forty-seven years old.</p>
                <p>They contain, as at present published, no less than ninety-three essays, besides
                    an exceedingly long apology for the already-mentioned Raymond Sebonde, which
                    amounts to about a quarter of the whole in bulk, and differs curiously from its
                    companions in matter no less than in scale. The book begins with a short <hi
                    rend="italic">avis</hi> (address to the reader), opening with the well-known
                    words, “C’est icy un livre de bon foy lecteur,” and sketching in a few lively
                    sentences the character of meditative egotism which is kept up throughout. His
                    sole object, the author says, is to leave for his friends and relations a mental
                    portrait of himself, defects and all; he cares neither for utility nor fame. The
                    essays then begin without any attempt to explain or classify their subjects.
                    Their titles are of the most diverse character. Sometimes they are proverbial
                    sayings, or moral adages, such as: “Par divers moyens on arrive à pareille fin
                    ”, “Qu’il ne faut juger de notre heur qu’après la mort ”, “Le profit de l’on est
                    le dommage de Γaultre.” Sometimes they are headed like the chapters of a
                    treatise on ethics: “De la tristesse ”, “De l’oisiveté ”, “De la peur”, “De
                    l’amitié.” Sometimes a fact of some sort which has awaked a train of
                    associations in the mind of the writer serves as a title, such as: “On est puni
                    de s’opiniastrer à une place sans raison ”, “De la bataille de Dreux ”, &amp;c.
                    Occasionally the titles seem to be deliberately fantastic, as: “Des puces ”, “De
                    Γusage de se vestir.” Sometimes, though not very often, the sections are in no
                    proper sense essays, but merely commonplace book entries of singular facts or
                    quotations with hardly any comment. These point to the haphazard or indirect
                    origin of them which has been already suggested. But generally the
                    essay-character—that is to say, the discussion of a special point, it may be
                    with wide digressions and divergences—displays itself. The digressions are
                    indeed constant, and sometimes have the appearance of being absolutely wilful.
                    The nominal title, even when most strictly observed, is rarely more than a
                    starting-point; and, though the brevity of these first essays for the most part
                    prevents the author from journeying very far, he contrives to get to the utmost
                    range of his tether. Quotations are very frequent. These are the principal
                    external characteristics of the book; its internal spirit had better be treated
                    when it can be spoken of completely.</p>
                <p>Between the publication of the first two books of essays in 1580 and the
                    publication of the third in 1588, Montaigne’s life as distinguished from his
                    writings becomes somewhat better known, and somewhat more interesting. He had,
                    during the eight years of composition of his first volume, visited Paris
                    occasionally and travelled for health or pleasure to Cauterets, Eaux Chaudes,
                    and elsewhere. Charles IX., apparently, had made him one of his gentlemen in
                    ordinary, and perhaps conferred on him the order of St Michael. The fiercest
                    period of the religious wars, save that yet to come of the League, passed over
                    him without harming him, though not without subjecting him to some risks. But
                    his health grew worse and worse, and he was tormented by stone and gravel. He
                    accordingly resolved to journey to the baths of Lucca. Late in the 18th century
                    a journal was found in the chateau of Montaigne, giving an account of this
                    journey, and it was published in 1774; part of it is written in Italian and part
                    dictated in French, the latter being for the most part the work of a secretary
                    or servant. Whatever may be the biographical value of this work, which has
                    rarely been reprinted with the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> themselves, it is
                    almost entirely destitute of literary interest. Written, moreover, according to
                    its own showing merely for the author’s own eye, it contains abundance of
                    details as to the medicinal effect of the various baths which he visited,
                    details which may be said to be superfluous to a medical reader, and disgusting
                    to any other. The course of the journey was first northwards to Plombières, then
                    by Basel to Augsburg and Munich, then through Tyrol to Verona and Padua in
                    Italy. Montaigne visited most of the famous cities of the north and centre,
                    staying five months at Rome, and finally establishing himself at the baths of
                    Lucca for nearly as long a time. There he received news of his election as mayor
                    of Bordeaux, and after some time journeyed homewards. The tour contains much
                    minute information about roads, food, travelling, &lt;fcc., but the singular
                    condition in which it exists, and the absence of a really good critical <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n798/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0798-0769"/> edition hitherto, make it rather difficult to use
                    it as a document. The freak of writing part of it in a strange dog-Italian is
                    not uncharacteristic of Montaigne, but the words of his last and best editors,
                    MM. Courbet and Royer, who speak of the letters as “l’unique complément des
                    essais,” seem to indicate that they are not of those who accept the published
                    <hi rend="italic">Voyage</hi> as authentic. Of the fact of the journey there is
                    no doubt whatever.</p>
                <p>Montaigne (as was not unnatural in a man of his temperament, who had for some
                    years, if not for the greater part of his life, lived solely to please himself)
                    was not altogether delighted at his election to the mayoralty, which promised
                    him two years of responsible if not very hard work. The memory of his father,
                    however, and the commands of the king, which seem to have been expressed in a
                    manner rather stronger than a mere formal confirmation, induced him to accept
                    it; and he seems to have discharged it neither better nor worse than an average
                    magistrate. Indeed, he gave sufficient satisfaction to the citizens to be
                    re-elected at the close of his term, and it may be suspected that the honour of
                    the position, which was really one of considerable dignity and importance, was
                    not altogether indifferent to him. Unfortunately, it cannot be said that nothing
                    in his office became him like the leaving of it, for it was at the close of his
                    second tenure that he gave the only sign of the demoralizing effect which is
                    sometimes alleged by severe moralists to come of the half epicurean, half
                    sceptical philosophy which he undoubtedly professed. It was his business, if not
                    exactly his duty, to preside at the formal election of his successor, the
                    maréchal de Matignon; but there was a severe pestilence in Bordeaux, and
                    Montaigne writes to the jurats of that town, in one of the few undoubtedly
                    authentic letters which we possess, to the effect that he will leave them to
                    judge whether his presence at the election is so necessary as to make it worth
                    his while to expose himself to the danger of going into the town in its then
                    condition, “which is specially dangerous for men coming from a good air as he
                    does.” That is to say, the chief magistrate of one of the greatest towns in
                    France not only declined to visit it because of sickness prevailing there, but
                    had left it to itself at a time when nearly half the population perished, and
                    when, according to the manners of the age, civil disturbance was almost sure to
                    follow accordingly. Attempts have been made to justify Montaigne, and it may be
                    at least said that he at no time pretended to unselfish heroism; but it is to be
                    feared that the facts and the inference drawn from them admit of no dispute. At
                    the least, Montaigne’s conduct must be allowed to contrast very little to his
                    advantage with that of Rotrou in the next century under somewhat similar
                    circumstances though in a position of much less responsibility. It may, however,
                    be urged in Montaigne’s favour that the general circumstances of the time, where
                    they did not produce reckless and foolhardy daring, almost necessarily produced
                    a somewhat excessive caution. The League was on the point of attaining its
                    greatest power; the extreme Calvinist and Navarrese party, on the other side,
                    was (as may be seen in Agrippa d’Aubigné) no less fanatical than the League
                    itself, and the salvation of France seemed to lie in the third party <hi
                    rend="italic">oi</hi><hi rend="italic">politiques,</hi> or trimmers, to which
                    Montaigne belonged. The capital motto of this party was that of the Scotch
                    saying, “Jouk and let the jaw gang by,” and the continual habit of parrying and
                    avoiding political dangers might be apt to extend itself to dangers other than
                    political. However this may be, Montaigne had difficulty enough during this
                    turbulent period, all the more so from his neighbourhood to the chief haunts and
                    possessions of Henry of Navarre. He was able, however, despite the occupations
                    of his journey, his mayoralty, and the pressure of civil war and pestilence,
                    which was not confined to the town, to continue his essay writing, and in 1588,
                    after a visit of some length to Paris, the third book of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essays</hi> was published, together with the former ones considerably revised.
                    The new essays, as has been remarked, differ strikingly from the older ones in
                    respect of length; there being only one which confines itself to the average of
                    those in the first two books. The whimsical unexpectedness of the titles,
                    moreover, reappears in but two of them: “Des coches” and “Des boiteux.” They
                    are, however, identical with the earlier ones in spirit, and make with them a
                    harmonious whole—a book which has hardly been second in influence to any of the
                    modern world.</p>
                <p>This influence is almost equally remarkable in point of matter and in point of
                    form, as regards the subsequent history of thought and as regards the subsequent
                    history of literature. The latter aspect may be taken first. Montaigne is one of
                    the few great writers who have not only perfected but have also invented a
                    literary form. The essay as he gave it had no forerunner in modern literature,
                    and no direct ancestor in the literature of classical times. It is indeed not
                    improbable that it owes something to the body of tractates by different authors
                    and of different dates, which goes under the name of Plutarch’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Morals,</hi> and it also bears some resemblance to the
                    miscellaneous work of Lucian. But the resemblance is in both cases at most that
                    of suggestion. The peculiar desultoriness and tentative character of the essay
                    proper were alien to the orderly character of the Greek mind, as were also its
                    garrulity and the tendency which it has rather to reveal the idiosyncrasy of the
                    writer than to deal in a systematic manner with the peculiarities of the
                    subject. It has been suggested that the form which the essays assumed was in a
                    way accidental, and this of itself precludes the idea of a definite model even
                    if such a model could be found. Beginning with the throwing together of a few
                    stray thoughts and quotations linked by a community of subject, the author by
                    degrees acquires more and more certainty of hand, until he produces such
                    masterpieces of apparent desultoriness and real unity as the essay “Sur des vers
                    de Virgile.” In matter of style and language Montaigne’s position is equally
                    important, but the ways which led him to it are more clearly traceable. His
                    favourite author was beyond all doubt Plutarch, and his own explicit confession
                    makes it undeniable that Plutarch’s translator Amyot was his master in point of
                    vocabulary, and (so far as he took any lessons in it) of style. Amyot was
                    unquestionably one of the most remarkable writers of French in the 16th century,
                    and to him more than to any one else is due the beauty of the prose style which
                    marked the second half of that century, a style which, though unequal and
                    requiring to be modified for general use, is at its best the very flower, of the
                    language. Montaigne, however, followed with the perfect independence that
                    characterized him. He was a contemporary of Ronsard, and his first essays were
                    published when the innovations of the Pléiade had fully established themselves.
                    He adopted them to a great extent, but with much discrimination, and he used his
                    own judgment in Latinizing when he pleased. In the same way he retained archaic
                    and provincial words with a good deal of freedom, but by no means to excess. In
                    the arrangement as in the selection of his language he is equally original.
                    There is little or no trace in him of the interminable sentence which is the
                    drawback of early prose in all languages when it has to deal with anything more
                    difficult to manage than mere narrative. He has not the excessive classicism of
                    style which mars even the fine prose of Calvin, and which makes that of some of
                    Calvin’s followers intolerably stiff. As a rule he is careless of definitely
                    rhythmical cadence, though his sentences are always pleasant to the ear. But the
                    principal characteristic of Montaigne’s prose style is its remarkable ease and
                    flexibility. These peculiarities, calculated in themselves to exercise a
                    salutary influence on a language as yet somewhat undisciplined, acquired by
                    accident an importance of an extraordinary kind. A few years after Montaigne’s
                    death a great revolution, as is generally known, passed over French. The
                    criticism of Malherbe, followed by the establishment of the Academy, the minute
                    grammatical censures of Vaugelas, and the severe literary censorship of Boileau
                    turned French in less than three-quarters of a century from one of the freest
                    languages in Europe to one of the most restricted. The Latinisms and Graecisms
                    of the Pléiade were tabooed at the same time with the most picturesque
                    expressions of the older tongue. The efforts of the reformers were directed
                    above all things to weed and to refine, to impose additional difficulties in the
                    way of writing exquisitely, at the same time that, by holding out a
                    strictly-defined model, they assisted persons of little genius and imagination
                    to write tolerably. During this revolution only two writers of older date held
                    their ground, and those two were Rabelais and Montaigne,— Montaigne being of his
                    nature more generally readable than Rabelais. The <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi>
                    the popularity of which no academic censorship could touch, thus kept before the
                    eyes of the 17th and 18th centuries a treasury of French in which every
                    generation could behold <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0799-0770"/> the riches of their ancestors. The study of them
                    influenced all the great prose writers of France, and they could not fail to be
                    influenced in the direction which it was most important that they should take by
                    the racy phrase, the quaint and picturesque vocabulary, and the unconstrained
                    constructions of Montaigne.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible, however, for the stoutest defender of the importance of
                    form in literature to assign the chief part in Montaigne’s influence to style.
                    It is the method or rather the manner of thinking of which that style is the
                    garment which has in reality exercised influence on the world. Like all writers
                    except Shakespeare, Montaigne thoroughly and completely exhibits the
                    intellectual and moral complexion of his own time. When he reached manhood the
                    French Renaissance (which was perhaps on the whole the most characteristic
                    example of that phenomenon, the religious element being neither in excess as it
                    was in England and Germany, nor in defect as it had been in Italy) was at high
                    water, and the turn of the tide was beginning. Rabelais, who died when Montaigne
                    was still in early manhood, exhibits the earlier and rising spirit, though he
                    needs to be completed on the poetical side. The Renaissance had, as all revolts
                    against authority must have, a certain sceptical element, but it was not at
                    first by any means eminently sceptical. Despite the half ironical, half warning
                    termination of <hi rend="italic">Pantagruel,</hi> an immense confidence and
                    delight, as of the invader of a promised land, fills the pages of Rabelais. He
                    rejoices in his strength, in his knowledge, in nis freedom, in the pleasures of
                    the flesh and the spirit. With Montaigne begins the age of disenchantment. By
                    the time at least when he began to meditate his essays in the retirement of his
                    country house it was tolerably certain that no golden <hi rend="italic">age</hi>
                    was about to return. The Reformation had brought not peace but a sword, and the
                    Calvinists were as intolerant as the Catholics. The revival of learning had,
                    whatever its benefits, merely changed the outward guise of pedants instead of
                    extirpating pedantry. The art of printing had multiplied rubbish as well as
                    valuable matter. The discovery of America had brought ruin to the discovered,
                    and disease and discord to the discoverers. The honors of a disputed succession
                    were already threatening France. These things were enough to make thoughtful men
                    dubious about the blessings of progress and reform; but the extreme
                    dissoluteness which characterized the private life of the time also brought
                    about its natural result of satiety. Physical science had hardly yet emerged to
                    occupy some active minds; scholasticism was dead, while Bacon and Descartes had
                    not arisen; nothing like a theory of politics had been evolved, though Bodin and
                    a few others were feeling after one. As the earlier Renaissance had specially
                    occupied itself with the practical business and pleasures of life, so the later
                    Renaissance specially mused on the vanity of this business and these pleasures.
                    The predisposing circumstances which affected Montaigne were thus likely to
                    incline him to scepticism, to ethical musings on the vanity of life and the
                    like. But to all this there had to be added the peculiarity of his own
                    temperament. This was a decidedly complicated one, and neglect of it has led
                    some readers to adopt a more positive idea of Montaigne’s scepticism than is
                    fully justified by all the facts. The municipality of Rome has put up a tablet
                    on the house occupied by Montaigne during his visit there, which speaks of him
                    as a “founder of the new philosophy.” In Italian mouths at the present day this
                    is equivalent to an assertion that Montaigne was an enemy of Christianity. No
                    assumption can be more gratuitous or less borne out by the text of his works and
                    the reasonable inferences to be drawn from them. The attitude which he assumed
                    was no doubt ephectic and critical chiefly. He decorated his study at Montaigne
                    with inscriptions (still, by dint of accidental preservation and restoration not
                    accidental, legible there), most of which are of the most pessimist and
                    sceptical character. Ecclesiastes, Ecclesiasticus, Horace, Lucretius, Sextus
                    Empiricus, the fragments of the Greek dramatists and philosophers, are ransacked
                    for epigraphs indicating the vanity of human reason, human wishes, human belief,
                    human thoughts and actions of every kind. In one curious essay (if indeed it is
                    to be called an essay), the “Apologie de Raymond Sebonde,” he has apparently
                    amused himself with gathering together, in the shape of quotations as well as of
                    reflexions, all that can be said against certainty in aesthetics as well as in
                    dogmatics. But the general tenor of the essays is in complete contrast with this
                    sceptical attitude, at least in its more decided form, and it is worth notice
                    that the motto “Que scai-je ?” does not appear on the title page till after the
                    writer’s death. The general disposition, moreover, manifested in these famous
                    writings is very far from being determinedly Pyrrhonist or despairingly
                    misanthropic. Montaigne is far too much occupied about all sorts of the minutest
                    details of human life to make it for a moment admissible that he regarded that
                    life as a whole but as smoke and vapour. He is much too curious of the varieties
                    of belief, and too keenly interested in following them out, to leave himself in
                    peril of the charge that all belief was to him a matter of indifference. The
                    reason of the misapprehension of him which is current is due very mainly to the
                    fact that he was eminently a humorist in the midst of a people to whom, since
                    his time, humour has been nearly unknown. But there is more than this. The
                    humorist as a recognized genus almost always passes into the satirist. The
                    temper which has been admirably defined as thinking in jest while feeling in
                    earnest naturally throws itself into opposition, though it may not always take
                    the irreconcilable form of the opposition of Swift. Perhaps the only actual
                    parallel to Montaigne in literature is Lamb. There are differences between them,
                    arising naturally enough from differences of temperament and experience; but
                    both agree in their attitude—an attitude which is sceptical without being
                    negative, and humorist without being satiric. There is hardly any writer in whom
                    the human comedy appears treated with such completeness as it is in Montaigne.
                    There is discernible in his essays no attempt to map out a complete plan, and
                    then to fill up its outlines. But in the desultory and haphazard fashion which
                    distinguishes him there are few parts of life on which he does not touch. The
                    exceptions are chiefly to be found in the higher and more poetical strains of
                    feeling to which the humorist temperament lends itself with reluctance and
                    distrust, though it by no means excludes them. The French disposition, by a
                    change which has never been sufficiently accounted for, and of which the most
                    accurate examination of documents fails fully to detect the reason, had become,
                    after being strongly idealist in the earlier Middle Ages, absolutely positive in
                    the later, and from this positiveness it has never since quite freed itself.
                    This positiveness is already noticeable in Rabelais; it becomes more noticeable
                    still in Montaigne. He is always charming, but he is rarely inspiring, except in
                    a very few passages where the sense of vanity and nothingness possesses him with
                    unusual strength. As a general rule, an agreeable grotesque of the affairs of
                    life (a grotesque which never loses hold of good taste sufficiently to be called
                    burlesque) occupies him. There is a kind of anticipation of the scientific
                    spirit in the careful zeal with which he picks up odd aspects of mankind, and
                    comments upon them as he places them in his museum. Such a temperament is most
                    pleasantly shown when it is least personal. The letter to the Bordeaux jurats
                    does not, as has been said, show Montaigne in his best light, nor does another
                    letter to his wife, in which he condoles with her on the death of one of their
                    children in a strain which must have drawn from any woman of sensibility and
                    spirit a torrent of indignant tears. But what is almost offensive in immediate
                    and private relationships becomes not only tolerable but delightful in the
                    impersonal and irresponsible relationship of author to reader. A dozen
                    generations of men have rejoiced in the gentle irony with which Montaigne
                    handles the <hi rend="italic">ludicrum humani saeculi,</hi> in the quaint
                    felicity of his selection of examples, and in the real though sometimes
                    fantastic wisdom of his comment on his selections.</p>
                <p>Montaigne did not very long survive the completion of his book. His sojourn at
                    Paris for the purpose of getting it printed was by no means uneventful, and on
                    his way he stayed for some time at Blois, where he met De Thou. In Paris itself
                    he had a more disagreeable experience, being for a short time committed to the
                    Bastille by the Leaguers, as a kind of hostage, it is said, for a member of
                    their party who had been arrested at Rouen by Henry of Navarre. But he was in no
                    real danger. He was well known to and favoured by both Catherine de’ Medici and
                    the Guises, and was very soon released. In Paris, too, at this time he made a
                    whimsical but pleasant friendship. Marie le Jars, Demoiselle de Gournay, one of
                    the most learned ladies of the 16th and 17 th centuries, had conceived such a
                    veneration for the author of the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> that, though a
                    very young girl and connected with many noble families, she travelled to the
                    capital on purpose to make his acquaintance. He gave her the title of his “fille
                    d’alliance” (adopted daughter), which she bore proudly for the rest of her long
                    life. She lived far into the 17 th century, and became a character and something
                    of a laughing-stock to the new generation; but her services to Montaigne’s
                    literary memory were, as will be seen, great. Of his other friends in these last
                    years of his life the most important were Étienne Pasquier and Pierre Charron.
                    The latter, indeed, was more than a friend, he was a disciple; and Montaigne,
                    just as he had constituted Mademoiselle de Gournay his “fille d’alliance,”
                    bestowed on Charron the rather curious compliment of desiring that he should
                    take the arms of the family of Montaigne. It has been thought from these two
                    facts, and from an expression in one of the later essays, that the marriage of
                    his daughter Léonore had not turned out to his satisfaction. But family
                    affection, except towards his father, was by no means Montaigne’s strongest
                    point.</p>

                <p>Not much is known of him in these later years, and indeed, despite the laborious
                    researches of many biographers, of whom one, Dr Payen, has never been excelled
                    in persevering devotion, it cannot be said that the amount of available
                    information about Montaigne is large at any time of his life. It would seem that
                    the essayist had returned to his old life of study and meditation and working up
                    his <hi rend="italic">Essays.</hi> No new ones were found after his death, but
                    many alterations and insertions. His various maladies grew worse; yet they were
                    not the direct cause of his death. He was attacked with quinsy, which rapidly
                    brought about paralysis of the tongue, and he died on the 11th of September
                    1592, under circumstances which, as Pasquier reports them, completely disprove
                    any intention, at least on his part, of displaying anti-Christian or
                    antiCatholic leanings. Feeling himself on the point of death, he summoned divers
                    of his friends and neighbours to his chamber, had mass said before him, and
                    endeavoured to raise himself and assume a devotional attitude at the elevation
                    of the host, dying almost immediately afterwards. He was buried, though not till
                    some months after his death, in a church in Bordeaux, which after some
                    vicissitudes became the chapel of the Collège. During the Revolution the tomb
                    and, as it was supposed, the coffin were transferred with much pomp to the town
                    museum; but it was discovered that the wrong coffin had been taken, and the
                    whole was afterwards restored to its old position. Montaigne’s widow survived
                    him, and his daughter left posterity which became merged in the noble houses of
                    Ségur and Lur-Saluces. But it does not appear that any male representative of
                    the family survived, and the chateau is not now in the possession of any
                    descendant of it.</p>
                <p>When Mademoiselle de Gournay heard of the death of Montaigne she undertook with
                    her mother a visit of ceremony and condolence to the widow, which had important
                    results for literature. Madame de Montaigne gave her a copy of the edition of
                    1588, annotated copiously; at the same time, apparently, she bestowed another
                    copy, also annotated by the author, on the convent of the Feuillants in
                    Bordeaux, to which the church in which his remains lay was attached.
                    Mademoiselle de Gournay thereupon set to work to produce a new and final edition
                    with a zeal and energy which would have done credit to any editor of any date.
                    She herself worked with her own copy, inserting the additions, marking the
                    alterations, and translating all the quotations. But when she had got this to
                    press she sent the proofs to Bordeaux, where a poet of some note, Pierre de
                    Brach, revised them with the other annotated copy. The edition thus produced has
                    with justice passed as the standard even in preference to those which appeared
                    in the author’s lifetime. Unluckily, Mademoiselle de Gournay’s original does not
                    appear to exist, and her text was said, until the appearance of MM. Courbet and
                    Royer’s edition, to have been somewhat wantonly corrupted, especially in the
                    important point of spelling. The Feuillants copy is in existence, being the only
                    manuscript or partly manuscript authority for the text. It was edited in 1803 by
                    Naigeon, the disciple of Diderot; but, according to later inquiries,
                    considerable liberties were taken with it. The first edition of 1580, with the
                    various readings of two others which appeared during the author’s lifetime, was
                    reprinted by MM. Dezeimeris and Burck-hausen. Hitherto the edition of Le Clerc
                    (3 vols., Paris, 1826-28) and in a more compact form that of Louandre (4 vols.,
                    Paris, 1854) have been the most useful. The edition, however, of MM. Courbet and
                    Royer, which is based on that of 1595, will undoubtedly be the standard; but,
                    though the text is complete (Paris, Lemerre, 1873- 1877), the fifth volume,
                    containing the biography∣and all the editorial apparatus, has unluckily yet
                    (1883) to make its appearance. The editions of Montaigne in France and
                    elsewhere, and the works upon him during the past three centuries, are
                    innumerable. His influence upon his successors has already been hinted at, and
                    cannot here be traced in detail. In one case, however,—that of Pascal—it is of
                    sufficient importance to deserve mention. Pascal, who has left a special
                    discourse on Montaigne, was evidently profoundly influenced by him, and the
                    attitude towards his teacher is an interesting one. The sceptical method of the
                    essayist is at once tempting and terrible to him. He accepts it in so far as it
                    demolishes the claims of human reason and heathen philosophy, but evidently
                    dreads it in so far as it is susceptible of being turned against religion
                    itself. In England Montaigne was early popular. It was long supposed that the
                    autograph of Shakespeare in a copy of Florio’s translation shoιved his study of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Essays.</hi> The autograph has been disputed, but divers
                    passages, and especially one in <hi rend="italic">The Tempest,</hi> show tl»t at
                    first or second hand the poet was acquainted with the essayist. Towards the
                    latter end of the 17th century, Cotton, the friend of Isaac Walton, executed a
                    complete translation, which, though not extraordinarily faithful, possesses a
                    good deal of rough vigour. It has been frequently reprinted with additions and
                    alterations. The most noteworthy critical handling of the subject in English is
                    unquestionably Emerson’s in <hi rend="italic">Representative Men.</hi> (G.
                    SA.)</p>
