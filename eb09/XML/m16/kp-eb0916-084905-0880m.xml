                    from the simplest, almost monochromatic, geometrical pattern to the most
                    elaborate picture, with figure-subjects represented in colours of countless
                    gradations.</p>
                <p>The earliest existing specimens of mosaic belong to one of the less important
                    branches of the art — namely, the ornamentation on a small scale of jewellery,
                    ivory thrones, and other furniture, or more rarely of some elaborate
                    architectural ornament. Most of this earliest sort of mosaic resembles in
                    execution what are called <hi rend="italic">cloisonnée</hi> enamels. In the
                    Louvre and in the British Museum are preserved some very beautiful ivory
                    carvings in low relief, some from Nineveh and others from Egypt, in which
                    figures of deities, ornaments formed of the lotus and papyrus plants, and royal
                    cartouches are enriched by small pieces of glass or lapis-lazuli and other
                    gem-like stones, which are let into holes made in the ivory. Each minute piece
                    is separated from the next by a thin wall or <hi rend="italic">cloison</hi> of
                    ivory, about as thick as cardboard, which thus forms a white outline, and sets
                    off the brilliance of the coloured stones. The favourite pattern in this sort of
                    work for decorating the larger surfaces appears to have been suggested by the
                    feathers on a bird’s wing. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Ivory,</hi> vol. xiii. pl.
                    vii. fig. 3.</p>
                <p>Recent excavations at Tel al-Yâhudfya in Lower Egypt have brought to light some
                    mosaics on a larger scale, but treated in the same way. These are caps of
                    columns, wall tiles, and other objects, either of white limestone or
                    earthenware, in which designs, chiefly some forms of the papyrus, are formed by
                    brilliantly-coloured bits of glass or enamelled earthenware, let into a sinking
                    in the tile or column. This form of mosaic was employed by the Greeks: the
                    Erechtheum at Athens, built in the middle of the 5th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> had the bases of some of its white marble columns
                    ornamented with a plait-like design, in which pieces of coloured glass were
                    inserted to emphasize the main lines of the pattern.</p>
                <p>Another, quite different sort of mosaic was known to the Egyptians of the
                    Ptolemaic and Roman periods. This is made entirely of glass, and is extremely
                    minute. The finest known specimen is in the British Museum: it is a small tablet
                    about three-eighths of an inch square, apparently the bezel of a ring, on which
                    is represented the sacred hawk,—every feather on the bird’s wing being produced
                    with a great number of colours and tints, each quite distinct, and so minute
                    that a strong magnifying glass is required to distinguish its details.</p>
                <p>The way in which this wonderful little mosaic was produced is extremely
                    ingenious. Numbers of long sticks of various-coloured glass were arranged in
                    such a way that their ends produced the figure of the hawk; other sticks of blue
                    glass were placed all round so as to form the ground. The whole bundle of sticks
                    of glass when looked at endwise now presented the figure of the hawk with a blue
                    background, immensely larger than it afterwards became. The bundle was then
                    heated till the sticks melted together, and the whole thick rod, softened by
                    fire, was then drawn out to a greatly-diminished thickness. In this process the
                    relative positions of the sticks of coloured glass forming the design were not
                    altered. A slice of the rod was then cut off, and its faces polished,—the
                    design, much reduced in size, of course being equally visible at both sides of
                    the slice; and thus the microscopic minuteness of the mosaic was produced, with
                    astonishing delicacy and refinement; many slices, each showing the same mosaic,
                    could be cut from the same rod.</p>
                <p>The more important use of mosaic has been on a large scale either for pavements
                    or for walls and vaulted ceilings. Mosaic for these purposes has by many
                    writers, both ancient and modern, been divided on various systems into classes;
                    perhaps the simplest classification is thefollowing:— I. <hi rend="italic">For
                    Pavements</hi>: — (a) <hi rend="italic">Tesselated,</hi> in which the design is
                    formed of small cubes, generally of marble, more rarely of glass or clay; (δ)
                    <hi rend="italic">Sectile,</hi> formed of larger pieces of marble, shaped and
                    cut so as to fit accurately one with another. II. <hi rend="italic">For Walls
                    and Vaults·.—Fictile or vermiculated;</hi> pieces of opaque glass, in small
                    cubes, arranged so as to form complicated pictures.</p>
                <p>This classification is not altogether satisfactory, more than one method often
                    being employed in the same mosaic^ as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the “opus
                    Alexandrinum” of mediaeval writers,, which is often partly tesselated and partly
                    sectile.</p>
                <p>Until Roman times we know but little of these kinds of mosaic. There is some
                    evidence (in Pliny and other writers) to show that elaborate mosaic pavements,
                    λι0o- στpωτov or λι0oλoγψια, were made by the Greeks in the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> or even earlier; but most of the numerous fine
                    specimens of tesselated work still existing in Greece, such as those at Sparta
                    and Athens, must be referred to the time of the Roman occupation. The best
                    examples of Hellenic mosaic are some pavements discovered during the recent
                    excavations at Olympia (sea fig. 1 and <hi rend="italic">Ausgrabungen zu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Olympia,</hi> 1877-82).</p>
                <p>Among the Romans the use of mosaic, both of marble· and opaque glass, was very
                    extensive. According to· Pliny <hi rend="italic">(1I.N.,</hi> xxxvi. 25), they
                    derived this art from the. Greeks, but not until the time of the Third Punic
                    War, 146- <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> while glass mosaics for walls,
                    “vitreae parietes,’” were a recent invention in his time. Many of these have,
                    been found at Pompeii; most commonly they are used to. decorate niches for
                    fountains or statuettes. Judging from the description given by Vitruvius (vii.
                    1), and an examination of numerous specimens of Roman tesselated mosaics,.</p>
                <p>the process of manufacture was the following. The earth was first carefully
                    rammed down to a firm and even surface;: on this was laid a thick bed of stones,
                    dry rubbish, and lime,, called “rudus,” from 6 to 9 inches deep, and above this,
                    another layer, 4 to 6 inches thick, called “nucleus,” of one part of lime to
                    three of pounded brick, mixed with water “on this, while still soft, the pattern
                    could be sketched out with a wooden or metal point, and the tesserae or small
                    bits of marble stuck into it, with their smoothest side uppermost. Lime, pounded
                    white marble, and water were then mixed to the consistency of cream, forming a
                    very hard-setting cement, called “marmoratum.” This cement, while fluid, was
                    poured over the marble surface, and well brushed into all the interstices
                    between the tesserae. When the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n882/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0882-0851"/> concrete and cement were both set, the surface of
                    the pavement was rubbed down and polished. This kind of mosaic was largely used
                    for floors of hypocausts; the concrete bed was then supported on large tiles
                    resting on numbers of short pillars.</p>
                <p>If used for upper floors very strong joists were required, and both Pliny (xxxvi.
                    25) and Vitruvius (vii. 1) recommend a <hi rend="italic">double</hi> layer of
                    boards, one crossing the other, on which the concrete and cement bedding was to
                    be laid.</p>
                <p>The usual Roman pavement was made of pieces of marble, averaging from a half to a
                    quarter of an inch square, but rather irregular in shape. A few other, but quite
                    exceptional, kinds of mosaic pavements have been found, such as that at the
                    Isola Farnese, 9 miles from Rome, made of tile-like slabs of green glass, and a
                    fine “sectile” pavement on the Palatine Hill, made of various-shaped pieces of
                    glass, in black, white, and deep yellow. In some cases— <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> in the “House of the Faun” at Pompeii—glass tesserae in small
                    quantities have been mixed with the marble ones, for the sake of greater
                    brilliance of colour. Pompeii is especially rich in its mosaics both on floor
                    and walls, almost every house having at least its vestibule paved in this
                    way.</p>
                <p>In addition to graceful flowing patterns and geometrical designs, picture-like
                    subjects of great elaboration frequently occur: of these the most important is
                    the large and minutely-executed scene of the battle of Issus, found in the
                    “House of the Faun.” It is of special value as being the chief classical
                    historical picture still existing. It is a well-designed though somewhat crowded
                    composition, representing the moment of Alexander’s victorious charge against
                    the cavalry of Darius. The expression of the faces and the characteristic
                    dresses of the Greeks and Persians are represented with great skill (see fig.
                    2). The tesserae, as was always the case in this sort of work, are not all the
                    same size, the smallest (only about one-tenth of an inch square) being reserved
                    for the faces, where greatest refinement of detail was required. This was a
                    floormosaic, though generally these minutely-executed works were affixed to
                    walls.</p>
                <p>The most skilfully-executed of all existing mosaics of this pictorial kind is
                    that known as “Pliny’s Doves,” found in Hadrian’s villa at Tivoli, and now in
                    the Capitoline Museum. It may possibly be the one so highly praised by Pliny
                    (xxxvi. 25) as the work of Sosus, for, although he describes it as being at
                    Pergamum, yet it was a common practice with the Romans to transport these
                    mosaics from one place to another, and this very celebrated one may well have
                    been brought to Tivoli to adorn the emperor’s villa. It is treated in a very
                    realistic way: the light on the gold bowl, the plumage of the doves, and
                    especially the reflexion in the water of the drinking dove, are represented with
                    wonderful skill. It is, in fact, far too pictorial, and, like the late mosaics
                    in St Peter’s, Rome, is more remarkable for its technical skill than for any
                    real artistic merit. This excessive realism, produced with great difficulty and
                    cost, is a not uncommon fault of the more elaborate Roman mosaics, and was the
                    inevitable result of the luxury and ostentation of imperial Rome, which made art
                    the bond-slave of the wealthy, rather than the free and natural expression of a
                    whole people, as it was among the earlier Greeks.</p>
                <p>Another interesting mosaic from the wall of a house at Pompeii, of extremely
                    delicate work, is a rehearsal scene in a Greek theatre, where the choregus is
                    instructing the actors: it is specially remarkable from its being signed as the
                    work of Dioscorides of Samos. Other figure-subjects are not uncommon, such as
                    various representations of the victory of Theseus over the Minotaur, others of
                    Achilles in Scyros, many hunting scenes, and the like.</p>
                <p>Throughout England, Germany, France, Spain, Asia Minor, and Northern Africa in no
                    way have signs of Roman occupation been left so clearly and in so conspicuous a
                    form as by the numerous large and generally well-preserved mosaic pavements
                    which have at various times been discovered in all these countries. In many
                    cases, long after all traces of the walls of the buildings have disappeared,
                    owing to their being dug up and removed for building purposes, the mosaics still
                    remain to testify of the artistic power and mechanical skill of the Roman
                    colonists.</p>
                <p>Few countries are richer than England in these remains; the great pavements of
                    York, Woodchester, Cirencester, and many other places are as elaborate in design
                    and as skilfully executed as any that now exist even in Rome itself. In whatever
                    country these mosaics are found, their style and method of treatment are always
                    much the same; the materials only of which the tesserae are made vary according
                    to the stone or marble supplied by each country. In England, for instance,
                    limestone or chalk often takes the place of the white marble so common in
                    Italian and North African mosaics; while, instead of red marble, a fine sort of
                    burnt clay or red sandstone is generally used; other makeshifts had to be
                    resorted to, and many of the Anglo-Roman mosaics are made entirely without
                    marble. It is perhaps partly owing to the great wealth of Northern Africa in
                    marbles of many colours and of varying shades that the finest of all Roman
                    mosaics have been found in Algeria and Tunis, especially those from Carthage,
                    some of which have been brought to the British Museum. See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archaeologia,</hi> vol. xxxviii. p. 202.</p>
                <p>The range of colour in the marble tesserae is very great, and is made use of with
                    wonderful taste and skill: there are three or four different shades of red, and
                    an equal number of yellows and greens, the last colour in all its tints being
                    almost peculiar to this part of Africa, and one of the most pleasant and
                    harmonious in almost any combination. Deep black, browns, and bluish-greys are
                    also abundant. The white marble which forms the ground of nearly all the designs
                    is often not pure white, but slightly striated with grey, giving great softness
                    and beauty of texture to the surface, and doing away with too great monotony of
                    tone. The Roman practice, common to all their mosaics, of not fitting the
                    tesserae quite closely together, but allowing the cement joints to show freely,
                    was also of great value in giving effect to the general texture of the surface—a
                    point quite forgotten by some later mosaic-workers, who thought that the closer
                    their tesserae were fitted together the better the mosaic would be. This remark
                    does not apply to sectile mosaic, in which sufficient variety can be given by
                    the markings and veins in each piece of marble. To return to the mosaics from
                    Carthage, they are no less excellent in design than in the richness and beauty
                    of their materials. Large spaces <pb break="no"

                    and other leaves, drawn with wonderful boldness and freedom of hand, and varied
                    with great wealth of invention. Without the use of very small tesserae, much
                    richness of effect is given by gradations of tints, suggesting light and shade,
                    without a painful attempt to represent actual relief. The colours of the marbles
                    used here and elsewhere by the Romans are so quiet and harmonious that it would
                    have been almost impossible to produce with them a harsh or glaring design, and
                    when used with the skill and strong artistic feeling of the mosaic-workers at
                    Carthage the result is a real masterpiece of decorative design. In Rome, and in
                    the Roman colonies of Europe, this kind of marble tesselated mosaic was largely
                    produced, with but little alteration in style or method of treatment, till the
                    4th century. In Syria and Asia Minor the art survived some centuries later.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the latest existing example in Rome is that which decorates the vault of
                    the ambulatory of the circular church of S. Costanza, built by Constantine the
                    Great (320), outside the walls of Rome. This very interesting mosaic might from
                    its style and materials have been executed in the 1st century, and is equal in
                    beauty to any work of the kind in Italy. It shows no trace whatever of the
                    Byzantine influence which, in the next century, introduced into Italy a novel
                    style of mosaic, in materials of the most glittering splendour. These S.
                    Costanza mosaics are almost unique in Italy as an application of the old
                    classical marble mosaic to the decoration of a Christian church. On the main
                    compartment of the vault the surface is covered by vine branches, laden with
                    grapes, twining in graceful curves over the space. In the centre is a large
                    medallion with life-sized male bust, and at the lower part are vintage
                    scenes—oxen carts bringing the grapes, and boys treading them in a vat. Other
                    more geometrical designs, of circles framing busts and full-length figures, with
                    graceful borders, cover other parts of the vault. Farther east this classical
                    style of mosaic appears to have lasted till the 6th century. At Kabr-Hiram, near
                    Tyre, Μ. Renan discovered among the ruins of a small three-apsed Christian
                    church a fine mosaic pavement, covering the nave and aisles, thoroughly
                    classical in style. The design, consisting of circles enclosing figures
                    emblematic of the seasons, the months, aud the winds, is almost the same as that
                    of some mosaics discovered on the site of the Roman Italica near Seville, and
                    others at Ephesus and Halicarnassus in Asia Minor. No trace of other than
                    classical influence is visible, and yet it is pretty clear, from the evidence of
                    an inscription, inlaid among the marble tesserae, that the date of this pavement
                    is not earlier than the latter part of the 6th century. A very similar mosaic,
                    of about the same date, was discovered at Neby Yûnas, near Sidon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mediaeval</hi><hi rend="italic">Mosaics.—</hi> These may be
                    divided into four principal classes :—(1) those used to decorate walls and
                    vaults, made of glass cubes; (2) those for pavements, made of marble, partly in
                    large shaped pieces, and partly in small tesserae; (3) glass in small pieces,
                    either rectangular or triangular, used to enrich marble pulpits, columns, and
                    other architectural features; (4) wood mosaics.</p>
                <p>1. The wall mosaics were, in their origin, purely Byzantine, and appear to date
                    from the beginning of the 5th century. They are made of coloured glass, rendered
                    opaque by the addition of oxide of tin. The melted glass was cast into flat
                    slabs, generally about half an inch thick, and then broken into small cubes.
                    Every possible colour and gradation of tint was produced by the mediaeval
                    glassmakers. Tesserae of gold (which were very largely used) and of silver were
                    made thus :—the metal leaf was spread over one of the glass slabs, the colour of
                    which did not matter, as it was hidden by the gold or silver; over this
                    metal-coated slab a skin of colourless glass was fused, so as to protect the
                    metal leaf from injury or tarnish; and then the slab was broken up into cubes,
                    the <hi rend="italic">ψi</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">φoι
                    χpvσcoι</hi> of Byzantine writers.</p>
                <p>The method of putting together the mosaic was much the same as that employed by
                    the Romans in their tesselated pavements. A thick coat of cement was applied to
                    the wall or vault, the outline indicated with a metal point, and the cubes stuck
                    one by one into the cement while it was yet soft,—the main difference being that
                    no rubbing down and polishing were required, the faces of the glass tesserae
                    showing the natural surface of the fracture, which was not quite level, and by
                    this slight inequality of surface great additional lustre and brilliance of
                    effect were given to the whole picture.</p>
                <p>Owing to the intense conservatism of Byzantine art, no regular stages of
                    progression can be traced in this class of mosaic. Some of the 5th century
                    mosaics at Ravenna are, in every way, as fine as those of the 12th, and it was
                    not till the end of the 13th century that any important change in style took
                    place, when Cimabue, and more especially his pupils Jacopo da Turrita and Taddeo
                    Gaddi, applied their increased knowledge of the human form and of the harmonies
                    of colour to the production of the most beautiful of all mosaics, such as those
                    in the apse of S. Maria Maggiore in Rome. It must not, however, be supposed that
                    during all this time (from the 5th to the 14th century) one steady level of
                    excellence was kept up. The mosaics of the 9th century are inferior in drawing
                    and general treatment to those both of the earlier and later time, while in
                    Italy at least this art was almost entirely extinct during the 10th and 11th
                    centuries. Extreme splendour of colour and jewel-like brilliance combined with
                    the most stately grandeur of form are the main characteristic of this sort of
                    decoration. Its most frequent application is to the sanctuary arch and apse of
                    the early basilicas.</p>
                <p>A “majesty,” or colossal central figure of Christ with saints standing on each
                    side, is the most frequent motive. In many cases, especially in the 5th and 6th
                    centuries, Christ was represented as a lamb, to whom the twelve apostles, in the
                    form of sheep, are paying adoration. Christ, the Good Shepherd, is sometimes
                    depicted as a beardless youth, seated among a circle of sheep—the treatment of
                    the motive being obviously taken from pagan representations of Orpheus playing
                    to the beasts. The tomb of Galla Placidia has a good example of this subject,
                    with much of the old Roman grace in the drawing and composition. Frequently the
                    Virgin Mary, or the patron saint of the church, occupies the central space in
                    the apse, with ranges of other saints on each side.</p>
                <p>The “Doom,” or Last Judgment, is a favourite subject for domes and sanctuary
                    arches; the Florence baptistery has one of the grandest mosaic pictures of this
                    subject, executed in the 13th century. The earlier baptisteries usually have the
                    scene of Christ’s baptism,—the river Jordan being sometimes personified in a
                    very classical manner, as an old man with flowing beard, holding an urn from
                    which a stream pours forth. S. Vitale at Ravenna has in the sanctuary a very
                    interesting representation of Justinian and his empress Theodora (see fig. 3),
                    attended by a numerous suite of courtiers and ladies; these mosaics are
                    certainly of the 6th century, and may be contemporary with Justinian, though the
                    fact that he and Theodora are each represented with a circular nimbus appears to
                    indicate that they were not then alive. Scenes from both Old and New Testaments
                    or the lives of the saints are also represented in almost endless
                    variety,—generally on the walls of the body of the church, in square-shaped
                    pictures, arranged in one or more tiers over the nave columns or arcade.</p>
                <p>In mosaics of the best periods the treatment of the forms and draperies is broad
                    and simple, a just amount of relief being expressed by delicate gradations of
                    tints. In mosaics of the 9th century the drawing is very awkward, and the folds
                    of the robes are rudely expressed in outline, with no suggestion of light and
                    shade.</p>
                <p>A further application of this work was to the decoration of broad bands over the
                    columns of the nave, as at S. Maria Maggiore in Rome, 5th century, and in the
                    two churches of S. Apollinare at Ravenna, 6th century. In some cases almost the
                    whole interior of the church was encrusted in this magnificent way, as at
                    Monreale Cathedral, the Capella Palatina of Palermo, and S. Mark’s at Venice,
                    the magnificence of which no words can describe; it is quite unrivalled by that
                    of any other buildings in the world. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Monreale.</hi></p>
                <p>In these churches the mosaics cover soffits and angles entirely, and give the
                    effect of a mass of solid gold and colour producing the utmost conceivable
                    splendour of <pb break="no"

                    type="authorial"><p>Unfortunately the world-wide fame of S. Mark’s and the other
                    great churches of Italy has subjected these extraordinary works to the fatal
                    process of “restoration,” and wherever any sign of decay in the cement backing
                    (the tesserae themselves are quite indestructible) has given the least excuse
                    the ‘ ‘ restorers” have destroyed whole masses of ancient work, and supplied its
                    place with worthless modern copies. The mosaics of the S. Mark’s baptistery, and
                    of the apses at S. Miniato, at Pisa, and many other places have in this way been
                    wantonly renewed within the last few years.</p></note> In many cases vaulted
                    ceilings were covered with these mosaics, as the tomb of Galla Placidia, 450
                    A.D., and the two baptisteries at Ravenna, 5th and 6th centuries. For exteriors,
                    the large use of mosaic was usually confined to the west façade, as at S.
                    Miniato, Florence, S. Maria Maggiore, Rome, and S. Mark’s, Venice. In almost all
                    cases the figures are represented on a gold ground, and gold is freely used in
                    the dresses and ornaments—rich jewels and embroidery being represented in gold,
                    silver, sparkling reds, blues, and other colours, so as to give the utmost
                    splendour of effect to the figures and their drapery.</p>
                <p>The revival of the art of painting in Italy and the introduction of fresco work
                    in the 14th century gave the deathblow to the true art of wall-mosaics. Though
                    at first the simple and archaic style of Cimabue and his pupils Jacopo da
                    Turrita, Giotto, and Taddeo Gaddi was equally applicable to painting or mosaic,
                    yet soon the development of art into greater realism and complexity required a
                    method of expression unfettered by the necessities and canons of mosaic-work.
                    Pietro Cavallini, a Roman artist, was one of the last who worked according to
                    the old traditions. His mosaic of the birth of the Virgin in S. Maria in
                    Cosmedin, Rome, executed about the middle of the 14th century, is not without
                    merit, though his superior knowledge of form has only caused his composition to
                    be somewhat feeble and insipid compared with the works of the earlier artists.
                    Even in the 15th century a few good mosaics were produced at Venice and
                    elsewhere. Since then many large pictures have been copied in glass mosaic,
                    generally attempts to imitate oil paintings, executed with great skill and
                    wonderful patience, but all utterly worthless as works of art, merely costly
                    monuments of human folly and misapplied labour. The mosaics from Titian’s
                    pictures on the west end of S. Mark’s at Venice, Raphael’s in the Chigi Chapel
                    in S. Maria del Popolo, and many large pictures in S. Peter’s in Rome, are the
                    most striking examples of these.</p>

                    most important mediaeval glass wall-mosaics during the period when
                    mosaic-working was a real art :—</p>

                <p>This list is by no means exhaustive, and only gives some of the best and most
                    typical examples of the mosaic-work of each century.</p>
                <p>The Byzantine origin of these great wall-mosaics, wherever they are found, is
                    amply proved both by internal and documentary evidence. The gorgeous mosaics of
                    S. Sophia and S. Saviour’s in Constantinople, 6th century, and the later ones in
                    the monasteries of Mount Athos, at Salonica and at Daphne near Athens, are
                    identical in style with those of Italy of the same date. Moreover, the even more
                    beautiful mosaic-work in the “Dome of the Rock” at Jerusalem, 7th and 11th
                    centuries, and that in the sanctuary of the great mosque of Cordova, of the 10th
                    century, are known to be the work of Byzantine artists, in spite of their
                    thoroughly Oriental design. The same is the case with the rarer mosaics of
                    Germany, such as those in S∙ Gereon at Cologne and at Parenzo.</p>
                <p>A very remarkable, almost unique, specimen of Byzantine mosaic is now preserved
                    in the “Opera del Duomo,” Florence. This is a diptych of the 11th century, of
                    extremely minute, almost microscopic, work, in tesserae of glass and metal,
                    perhaps the only example of tesserae made of solid metal. It has figures of
                    saints and inscriptions, each tessera being scarcely larger than a pin’s head.
                    This beautiful diptych originally belonged to the imperial chapel in
                    Constantinople, and was brought to Florence in the 14th century.</p>
                <p>2. The second mediaeval class, mosaic pavements, though of great beauty, are of
                    less artistic importance.</p>
                <p>This so-called “opus Alexandrinum” is very common throughout Italy and in the
                    East, and came to greatest perfection in the 13th century. It is made partly of
                    small marble tesserae forming the main lines of the pattern, and partly of large
                    pieces used as a ground or matrix. It is generally designed in large flowing
                    bands which interlace and enclose circles, often of one stone sliced from a
                    column. The finest example is that at S. Mark’s, Venice, of the 12th century.
                    The materials are mainly white marble, with green and red porphyry, and
                    sometimes glass.</p>
                <p>Besides the countless churches in Italy possessing these beautiful pavements,
                    such as S. Lorenzo, S. Marco, S. Maria Maggiore, and S. Maria in Trastevere, in
                    Rome, we have, in the Chapel of the Confessor, and in front of the high altar at
                    Westminster, very fine specimens of this work, executed about 1268 by a Roman
                    artist called Odericus, who was brought to England by Abbot Ware, on the
                    occasion of a visit made by the latter to Rome. Another English example is the
                    mosaic pavement in front of the shrine of Becket at Canterbury; this is probably
                    the work of an Englishman, though the materials are foreign, as it is partly
                    inlaid with bronze, a peculiarity never found in Italy. There are also many fine
                    examples of these pavements in the churches of the East, such as that in S.
                    Sophia at Trebizond, of the most elaborate design and splendid materials, very
                    like the S. Mark’s pavement at Venice. Palermo and Monreale are especially rich
                    in examples of sectile mosaic, used both for pavements and walls,—in the latter
                    case generally for the lower part of the walls, the upper part being covered
                    with the glass mosaics. The designs of these Sicilian works, mostly executed
                    under the Norman kings in the 12th century, are very Oriental in character, and
                    in many cases were actually executed by Moslem workmen. Fig. 4 gives a specimen
                    of this mosaic from Monreale cathedral. Its chief characteristic is the absence
                    of curved lines, so largely used in the splendid opus Alexandrinum of Italy,
                    arising from the fact that this class of Oriental design was mainly used for the
                    delicate panelling in wood on their pulpits, doors, &amp;c.,—wood being a
                    material quite unsuited for the production of large curves.</p>
                <p>3. Glass mosaic, used to ornament ambones, pulpits, tombs, bishops’ thrones,
                    baldacchini columns, architraves, and other marble objects, is chiefly Italian.
                    The designs, when it is used to enrich flat surfaces, such as panels or
                    architraves, are very similar to those of the pavements last described. The
                    white marble is used as a matrix, in which sinkings are made to hold the glass
                    tesserae; twisted columns are frequently ornamented with a spiral band of this
                    glass mosaic, or flutings are suggested by parallel bands on straight columns.
                    The cloisters of S. Giovanni in Laterano and S. Paolo fuori le mura have
                    splendid examples of these enriched shafts and architraves.</p>
                <p>This style of work was largely employed from the 6th to the 14th centuries. One
                    family in Italy, the Cosmati, during the whole of the 13th century, was
                    especially skilled in this craft, and the various members of it produced an
                    extraordinary amount of rich and beautiful work. The pulpit in S. Maria in Ara
                    Coeli, Rome, is one of the finest specimens (see fig. δ), as are also the
                    ambones in S. Clemente and S. Lorenzo, and that in Salerno cathedral. The tomb
                    of Henry III., 1291, and the shrine of the Confessor, 1269, at Westminster are
                    the only examples of this work in England. They were executed by <hi

                    rend="italic">''</hi> probably a pupil of the Cosmati.</p>
                <p>In India, especially during the 17th century, many Mohammedan buildings were
                    decorated with fine marble inlay of the class now called ‘ ‘ Florentine.” This
                    is <hi rend="italic">sectile</hi> mosaic, formed by shaped pieces of
                    various-coloured marbles let into a marble matrix. A great deal of the Indian
                    mosaic of this sort was executed by Italian workmen; the finest examples are at
                    Agra, such as the Taj Mehal.</p>
                <p>The modern so-called “Roman mosaic” is formed of short and slender sticks of
                    coloured glass fixed in cement, the ends, which form the pattern, being finally
                    rubbed down and polished.</p>
                <p>Many not unsuccessful attempts have been made lately to reproduce the Roman
                    tesselated work for pavements; and at Murano, near Venice, glass wall-mosaics
                    are still produced in imitation of the magnificent works of mediaeval times.</p>
                <p>4. Mosaics in wood are largely used in Mohammedan buildings, especially from the
                    14th to the 17th centuries. The finest specimens of this work are at Cairo and
                    Damascus, and are used chiefly to decorate the magnificent pulpits and other
                    woodwork in the mosques. The patterns are very delicate and complicated, worked
                    in inlay of small pieces of various-coloured woods, often further enriched by
                    bits of mother-of-pearl and minutely carved ivory. The general effect is
                    extremely splendid from the combined beauties of the materials and workmanship,
                    as well as from the marvellous grace and fancy of the designs. This art was also
                    practised largely by the Copts of Egypt, and much used by them to ornament the
                    magnificent iconostases and other screens in their churches.</p>
                <p>Another application of wood to mosaic-work, called “intarsia-tura,” was very
                    common in Italy, especially in Tuscany and Lombardy, during the 15th and early
                    16th centuries. Its chief use was for the decoration of the stalls and lecterns
                    in the church-choirs. Very small bits of various-coloured woods were used to
                    produce geometrical patterns, while figure-subjects, views of buildings with
                    strong perspective effects, and even landscapes, were very skilfully produced by
                    an inlay of larger pieces. Ambrogio Borgognone, Raphael, and other great
                    painters often drew the designs for this sort of work. The mosaic figures in the
                    panels of the stalls at the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n886/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0886-0855"/> Certosa near Pavia were by Borgognone, and are
                    extremely beautiful. The stalls in Siena cathedral and in S. Pietro de’
                    Casinensi at Perugia, the latter from Raphael’s designs, are among the finest
                    works of this sort, which are very numerous in Italy. It has also been used on a
                    smaller scale to ornament furniture, and especially the “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Cassoni,”</hi> or large trousseau coffers, on which the most costly and
                    elaborate decorations were often lavished. Some traditional skill in this art
                    still lingers in Italy, especially in the city of Siena.</p>
