                <p><label type="entry">MILITARY LAW</label> consists of the statutes, rules of
                    procedure, royal warrants, and orders and regulations which prescribe and
                    enforce the public obligations of the officers, soldiers, and others made
                    subject to its provisions. Its essential purpose is the maintenance of
                    discipline; but it also includes the administrative government of the military
                    forces of the state, more especially in the matters of enlistment, service, and
                    billeting. The term “martial law” sometimes applied to it is, as regards modern
                    times at least, a misnomer. For martial law as it is now understood applies not
                    only to military persons but to the civil community, and may be described
                    generally as the abrogation of ordinary law and the substitution for it of
                    military force uncontrolled save by what, in the discretion of the commanding
                    general, may be considered the necessity of the case.</p>
                <p>The military law of England in early times existed, like the forces to which it
                    applied, in a period of war only.</p>

                <p>Troops were raised for a particular service, and were disbanded upon the
                    cessation of hostilities. The crown, of its mere prerogative, made laws known as
                    Articles of War, for the government and discipline of the troops while thus
                    embodied and serving. Except for the punishment of desertion, which offence was
                    made a felony by statute in the reign of Henry VI., these ordinances or Articles
                    of War remained almost the sole authority for the enforcement of discipline
                    until 1689, when the first Mutiny Act was passed and the military forces of the
                    crown were brought under the direct control of parliament. Even the
                    Parliamentary forces in the time of Charles I. and Cromwell were governed, not
                    by an Act of the legislature, but by articles of war similar to those issued by
                    the king and authorized by an ordinance of the Lords and Commons, exercising in
                    that respect the sovereign prerogative. This ]&gt;ower of law-making by
                    prerogative was, however, held to be applicable during a state of actual war
                    only, and attempts to exercise it in time of peace were ineffectual. Subject to
                    this limitation it existed for considerably more than a century after the
                    passing of the first Mutiny Act. From 1689 to 1803, although in peace time the
                    Mutiny Act was occasionally suffered to expire, a statutory power was given to
                    the crown to make Articles of War to operate in the colonies and elsewhere
                    beyond the seas in the same manner as those made by prerogative operated in time
                    of war. In 1715, in consequence of the rebellion, this power was created in
                    respect of the forces in the kingdom. But these enactments were apart from and
                    in no respect affected the principle acknowledged all this time that the crown
                    of its mere prerogative could make laws for the government of the army in
                    foreign countries in time of war. The Mutiny Act of 1803 effected a great
                    constitutional change in this respect: the power of the crown to make any
                    Articles of War became altogether statutory, and the prerogative merged in the
                    Act of Parliament. So matters remained till the year 1879, when the last Mutiny
                    Act was passed and the last Articles of War were promulgated. The Mutiny Act
                    legislated for offences in respect of which death or penal servitude could be
                    awarded, and the Articles of War, while repeating those provisions of the Act,
                    constituted the direct authority for dealing with offences for which
                    imprisonment was the maximum punishment as well as with many matters relating to
                    trial and procedure. The Act and the Articles were found not to harmonize in all
                    respects. Their general arrangement was faulty, and their language sometimes
                    obscure. In 1869 a royal commission recommended that both should be recast in a
                    simple and intelligible shape. In 1878 a committee of the House of Commons
                    endorsed this view and made certain recommendations as to the way in which the
                    task should be performed. In 1879 the Government submitted to parliament and
                    passed into law a measure consolidating in one Act both the Mutiny Act and the
                    Articles of War, and amending their provisions in certain important respects.
                    This measure was called the “Army Discipline and Regulation Act, 1879.” After
                    one or two years’ experience of its working it also was found capable of
                    improvement, and was in its turn superseded by the Army Act, 1881, which now
                    forms the foundation and the main portion of the military law of England. It
                    contains a proviso saving the right of the crown to make Articles of War, but in
                    such a manner as to render the power in effect a nullity; for it enacts that no
                    crime made punishable by the Act shall be otherwise punishable by such Articles.
                    As the punishment of every conceivable offence is provided for by the Act, any
                    Articles made thereunder can be no more than an empty formality having no
                    practical effect. Thus the history of English military law up to 1879 may be
                    divided into three periods, each having a distinct constitutional aspect :—(1)
                    that prior to 1689, when the army, being regarded as so many personal retainers
                    of the sovereign rather than servants of the state, was mainly governed by the
                    will of the sovereign; (2) that between 1689 and 1803, when the army, being
                    recognized as a permanent force, was governed within the realm by statute and
                    without it by the prerogative of the crown; and (3) that from 1803 to 1879, when
                    it was governed either directly by statute or by the sovereign under an
                    authority derived from and defined and limited by statute. Although in 1879 the
                    power of making Articles of War became in effect altogether inoperative, the
                    sovereign was empowered to make rules of procedure, having the force of law,
                    which regulate the administration of the Act in many matters formerly dealt with
                    by the Articles of War. These rules, however, must not be inconsistent with the
                    provisions of the Army Act itself, and must be laid before parliament
                    immediately after they are made. Thus in 1879 the government and discipline of
                    the army became for the first time completely subject either to the direct
                    action or the close supervision of parliament.</p>
                <p>A further notable change took place at the same time. The Mutiny Act had been
                    brought into force on each occasion for one year only, in compliance with the
                    constitutional theory that the maintenance of a standing army in time of peace,
                    unless with the consent of parliament, is against law. Each session therefore
                    the text of the Act had to be passed through both Houses clause by clause and
                    line by line. The Army Act, on the other hand, is a fixed permanent code. But
                    constitutional traditions are fully respected by the insertion in it of a
                    section providing that it shall come into force only by virtue of an annual Act
                    of Parliament. This annual Act recites the illegality of a standing army in time
                    of peace unless with the consent of parliament, and the necessity nevertheless
                    of maintaining a certain number of land forces (exclusive of those serving in
                    India) and a body of royal marine forces on shore, and of keeping them in exact
                    discipline, and it brings into force the Army Act for one year.</p>
                <p>Military law is thus chiefly to be found in the Army Act and the rules of
                    procedure made thereunder, the Militia Act, 1882, the Reserve Forces Act, 1882,
                    and the Volunteer Act, 1863, together with certain Acts relating to the
                    yeomanry, and various royal warrants and regulations. The Army Act itself is,
                    however, the chief authority. Although the complaint has been sometimes made,
                    and not without a certain amount of reason, that it does not accomplish much
                    that it might in point of brevity, simplicity, and clearness of expression, it
                    is a very comprehensive piece of legislation, and shows some distinct
                    improvements upon the old Mutiny Acts and Articles of War.</p>
                <p>The persons subject to military law are the officers on the active list and the
                    soldiers of the regular forces (including the royal marines), the permanent
                    staff of the auxiliary <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the militia, volunteer, and
                    yeomanry) forces, and the officers of the militia. The above persons are
                    amenable to its provisions at all times except while embarked on board a
                    commissioned ship of the royal navy, when they become subject to the Naval
                    Discipline Act and certain orders in council made under its authority. Those who
                    are subject to military law in certain circumstances only are—officers and men
                    while serving in a force raised out of the United Kingdom and commanded by an
                    officer of the regular forces; pensioners when employed in military service
                    under the command of a regular officer; the non-commissioned officers and men of
                    the militia, during training, when attached to the regulars or when permanently
                    embodied; the officers of the yeomanry and the volunteers when in command of or
                    attached to a body of men subject to military law, or when their corps is on
                    actual military <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0314-0297"/> service, or when ordered on duty with their own
                    consent; the men of the yeomanry when they or their corps are being trained,
                    when they are attached to or acting with the regular forces, when their corps is
                    on actual military service, or when serving in aid of the civil power; the men
                    of the volunteers when they are being trained with or are attached to any body
                    of troops, or when their corps is on actual military service; the men of the
                    army reserve and the militia reserve when called out for training or on duty in
                    aid of the civil power; any person who in an official capacity equivalent to
                    that of an officer accompanies a body of troops on active service beyond the
                    seas; any person accompanying a force on active service holding a pass from the
                    general entitling him to be treated on the footing of an officer. In this last
                    category would of course be included newspaper correspondents, also sutlers and
                    followers. In one or two cases persons are subjected to military law to a
                    limited extent and in respect only of certain offences. Thus a militiaman even
                    when not out for training or not embodied is liable to a military trial and
                    punishment for fraudulent enlistment or making a false answer on attestation. In
                    the same manner an army reserve man may be tried and punished by court martial
                    for neglect to appear at the place where he is bound periodically to report
                    himself, or for insubordination to his superiors on these occasions, or for any
                    fraud in connexion with the receipt of his pay. A man of the army reserve or the
                    militia reserve has the legal status of and in fact becomes a regular soldier
                    when called out on occasions of national danger or emergency under the
                    sovereign’s proclamation.</p>
                <p>When a person subject to military law commits an offence he is taken into
                    military custody, which means either arrest in his own quarters or confinement.
                    He must without unnecessary delay be brought before his commanding officer, who
                    upon investigating the case may dismiss the charge if in his discretion he
                    thinks it ought not to be proceeded with, or may take steps to bring the
                    offender before a court martial. Where the offender is not an officer he may
                    dispose of the case summarily, the limit of his power in this respect being
                    seven days’ imprisonment with hard labour, fines not exceeding 10s. for
                    drunkenness, certain deductions from pay, confinement to barracks for
                    twenty-eight days, this involving severe extra drills, deprivations, and other
                    minor punishments. Where the offence is absence without leave for a period
                    exceeding seven days, the commanding officer may award a day’s imprisonment in
                    respect of each day of such absence up to twenty-one. It is only in the case of
                    the imprisonment exceeding seven days that the evidence before the commanding
                    officer is taken on oath, and then only in the event of the accused so desiring
                    it. The commanding officer is enjoined by regulation not to punish summarily the
                    more serious kind of offences, but his legal jurisdiction in this respect is
                    without limit as regards any soldier brought before him, and when he has dealt
                    summarily with a case the accused is free from any other liability in respect of
                    the offence thus disposed of. In any instance where the commanding officer has
                    summarily awarded imprisonment, fine, or deduction from pay, the accused may
                    claim a district court martial instead of submitting to the award.</p>
                <p>Ordinary courts martial are of three kinds, viz.:—(1) a regimental court martial,
                    usually convened and confirmed by the commanding officer of the regiment or
                    detachment, presided over by an officer not under the rank of captain, composed
                    of at least three officers of the regiment or detachment with not less than one
                    year’s service, and having a maximum power of punishment of forty-two days’
                    imprisonment with hard labour; (2) a district court martial, usually convened by
                    the general of the district, consisting in the United Kingdom. India, Malta, and
                    Gibraltar of not less than five and elsewhere of not less than three officers,
                    each with two years’ service or more, and having a maximum power of punishment
                    of two years’ imprisonment with hard labour; (3) a general court martial, the
                    only tribunal having authority to try a commissioned officer, and with a power
                    of punishment extending to death or penal servitude, for offences for which
                    these penalties are authorized by statute; it consists of not less than nine
                    officers in the United Kingdom, India, Malta, and Gibraltar and of five
                    elsewhere, each of whom must have over three years’ service, five being not
                    under the rank of captain. There is another kind of tribunal incidental to
                    service in the field, or where, in the case of an offence against the person or
                    property of an inhabitant, an ordinary court martial cannot be held, namely, a
                    field general court martial. This court may consist of three officers only, and
                    it has the power of sentencing to death. Another kind of court, called a summary
                    court martial, may be held where an offence has been committed upon active
                    service and an ordinary court cannot be conveniently assembled. In the event of
                    three officers not being available it may consist of two. When thus constituted
                    it can award only a “summary punishment” or imprisonment; where it consists of
                    three officers, however, it can sentence to death. In the case of a field
                    general or a summary court martial many forms and precautions prescribed in the
                    case of ordinary courts are not necessarily observed, the whole proceeding being
                    from the necessity of the case a somewhat rough and ready means of dealing
                    promptly with crime.</p>
                <p>The Army Act prescribes the maximum punishment which may be inflicted in respect
                    of each offence. That of death is incurred by various acts of treachery or
                    cowardice before the enemy, or by when on active service interfering with or
                    impeding authority, leaving without orders a guard or post, or when sentry
                    sleeping or being drunk on a post, plundering or committing an offence against
                    the person or property of an inhabitant, intentionally causing false alarms, or
                    deserting. Whether upon active service or not, a soldier also becomes liable to
                    the punishment of death who mutinies or incites to or joins in or connives at a
                    mutiny, who uses or offers violence to or defiantly disobeys the lawful command
                    of his superior officer when in the execution of his office. Penal servitude is
                    the maximum punishment for various acts and irregularities upon active service
                    not distinctly of a treacherous or wilfully injurious character, for using or
                    offering violence or insubordinate language to a superior, or disobeying a
                    lawful command when upon active service. The same punishment is applicable when
                    not upon active service to a second offence of desertion or fraudulent
                    enlistment <hi rend="italic">(i.c.,</hi> enlistment by one who already belongs
                    to the service), certain embezzlements of public property, wilfully releasing
                    without authority a prisoner or wilfully permitting a prisoner to escape,
                    enlisting when previously discharged from the service with disgrace without
                    disclosing the circumstances of such discharge, or any other offence which by
                    the ordinary criminal law of England is punishable with penal servitude.
                    Imprisonment with hard labour for two years is the maximum punishment for minor
                    forms and degrees of those offences which if committed upon active service would
                    involve death or penal servitude, such as using or offering violence or
                    insubordinate language to a superior or disobeying a lawful command, and for the
                    following offences:—resisting an escort, breaking out of barracks, neglect of
                    orders, a first offence of desertion or attempted desertion or aiding or

                    the unreasonable detention of a person awaiting trial, escaping or attempting to

                    making a false answer to a question put upon attestation, being concerned in
                    unlawful enlistment, using traitorous or disloyal words regarding the sovereign,
                    disclosing any circumstance relating to the numbers, position, movements, or
                    other circumstances of any part of her majesty’s forces so as to produce effects
                    injurious to her majesty’s service, fighting or being concerned in or conniving
                    at a duel, attempting suicide, obstructing the civil authorities in the
                    apprehension of any officer or soldier accused of an offence, any conduct,
                    disorder, or neglect to the prejudice of good order and military discipline, any
                    offence which if committed in England would be punishable by the law of England.
                    There is another offence which can be committed by officers only, namely,
                    “scandalous conduct unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman.” It
                    necessitates cashiering, a punishment which in the case of an officer may be
                    awarded as an alternative to imprisonment in several other instances. There is
                    also an offence peculiar to officers and non-commissioned officers, that of
                    striking or ill-treating a soldier or unlawfully detaining his pay. A sentence
                    of cashiering as distinguished from that of dismissal in the case of an officer
                    involves an incapacity to serve the crown again. An officer may be also
                    sentenced to forfeiture of seniority of rank and to reprimand or severe
                    reprimand. A non-commissioned officer may be sentenced to be reduced to a lower
                    grade or to the ranks, and where sentenced to penal servitude or imprisonment is
                    deemed to be reduced to the ranks. The commander-in-chief at home or the
                    commander-in-chief in India or in either of the presidencies may also cause a
                    non-commissioned officer to be reduced to a lower grade or to the ranks. An
                    acting noncommissioned officer may be ordered by his commanding officer for an
                    offence or for inefficiency or otherwise to revert to his permanent grade,—in
                    other words, to forfeit his acting rank.</p>
                <p>It will have been observed that persons subject to military law are liable to be
                    tried by court martial for offences which if committed in England would be
                    punishable by the ordinary law, and to suffer either the punishment prescribed
                    by the ordinary criminal law or that authorized for soldiers who commit offences
                    to the prejudice of good order and military discipline. The effect of the latter
                    alternative is that for many minor offences for which a civilian is liable to a
                    short term of imprisonment, or perhaps only to a fine, a soldier may be awarded
                    two years’ imprisonment with hard labour. A court martial, however, cannot take
                    cognizance of the crimes of treason, murder, manslaughter, treason-felony, or
                    rape if committed in the United Kingdom. If one of these offences be committed
                    in any place within her majesty’s dominions other than the United Kingdom or
                    Gibraltar, a court martial can deal with it only if it be committed on active
                    service or in a place more than 100 miles from a civil court having jurisdiction
                    to try the offence. With regard to all civil offences the military law, it is to
                    be understood, is subordinate to the ordinary law, and a civilian aggrieved by a
                    soldier in respect of a criminal offence against his property or person does not
                    forfeit his right to prosecute the soldier as if he were a civilian.</p>
                <p>The crimes for which soldiers are most usually tried are desertion, absence
                    without leave, loss of necessaries, violence or insubordination to superiors,
                    drunkenness, and various forms of conduct to the prejudice of discipline. The
                    punishments are generally speaking gauged as much with regard to the character
                    and antecedents of the prisoner as to the particular offence. For a first
                    offence of an ordinary kind a district court martial would give as a rule
                    fifty-six days’ imprisonment with hard labour, for a second or graver crime
                    eighty-four days. There are not many instances in which the period of
                    imprisonment exceeds six months. Corporal punishment, which had been practically
                    limited to offences committed upon active service, and in 1879 to crimes
                    punishable with death, was finally abolished in 1881, and a summary punishment
                    substituted. This summary punishment includes the liability for a term of three
                    months to be kept in iron-fetters and handcuffs, and while so kept to be
                    attached to a fixed object so that the offender may remain in a fixed position
                    for a period not exceeding two hours in the day for not more than three out of
                    any four consecutive days and for not more than twenty-one days in the
                    aggregate. The offender may also be subjected to the like labour and restraint,
                    and may be dealt with in the same manner as if sentenced to hard-labour
                    imprisonment. But these summary punishments are to be inflicted so as not to
                    cause injury to health or leave a permanent mark on the offender. The first
                    instances in which this kind of punishment was inflicted occurred during the
                    campaign of 1882 in Egypt. Estimated by the results, the abolition of flogging
                    does not appear to have injuriously affected discipline, the conduct of the
                    troops in Egypt having been exceptionally good. The practice of marking a
                    soldier with the letters “D” (deserter) or “BO” (bad character), in order to
                    prevent his re-enlistment, was abolished about a dozen years ago in deference to
                    public opinion, which erroneously adopted the idea that the “marking” was
                    effected by red-hot irons or in some other manner involving torture. Military
                    men for the most part regret its abolition, and maintain that if the practice
                    were still in force the army would not be tainted by the presence of many bad
                    characters who find means of eluding the vigilance of the authorities and
                    enlisting after previous discharge.</p>
                <p>The course of procedure in military trials is as follows. When a soldier is
                    remanded by his commanding officer for trial by a district or general court
                    martial, a copy of the charge, together with the statements of the witnesses for
                    the prosecution (called the summary of evidence), is furnished to him, and he is
                    given proper opportunity of preparing his defence, of communicating with his
                    witnesses or legal adviser, and of procuring the attendance of his witnesses.
                    Further, if he desires it, a list of the officers appointed to form the court
                    shall be given him. Any officer is disqualified to sit as a member who has
                    convened the court, who is the prosecutor or a witness for the prosecution, who
                    has made the preliminary inqury into the facts, who is the prisoner’s commanding
                    officer, or who has a personal interest in the case. The prisoner may also
                    object to any officer on the ground of bias or prejudice similarly as a civilian
                    might challenge a juror. Except as regards the delay caused by the writing out
                    of the evidence, the procedure at a court martial is very much the same as that
                    at an ordinary criminal trial,—the examination and cross-examination of the
                    witnesses, addresses of the prosecutor and prisoner, and the rules governing the
                    admission or rejection of evidence being nearly identical. At a general court
                    martial, and sometimes at a district court, a judge advocate representing the
                    judge advocate general officiates, his functions being very much those of a
                    legal assessor to the court. He advises upon all points of law, and sums up the
                    evidence just as a judge charges a jury. When the prisoner pleads guilty the
                    court finds a verdict accordingly, reads the summary of evidence, hears any
                    statement in mitigation of punishment, and takes evidence as to character before
                    proceeding to pass sentence. The sentence is that of the majority of the court,
                    except where death is awarded, when two-thirds of the members in the case of a
                    general court martial and the whole in that of a field general court martial
                    must concur. When an acquittal upon all the charges takes place the verdict is
                    announced in open court, and the prisoner is released without any further
                    proceeding. When the finding is “guilty,” evidence as to character is taken, and
                    the court deliberates in private upon the sentence, but the result is not made
                    known until the proceedings are confirmed and promulgated. No conviction or
                    sentence has any effect until it is thus confirmed by the proper authority. The
                    confirming authority in the case of a regimental court is the commanding
                    officer, in that of a district court martial the general officer commanding the
                    district, and in that of a general court, if held in the United Kingdom her
                    majesty, and if abroad in most cases the general officer commanding. The
                    confirming authority may order the reassembling of the court in order that any
                    question or irregularity may be revised and corrected, but not for the purpose
                    of increasing a sentence. He may, however, of his own discretion, and without
                    further reference to the court, refuse confirmation to the whole or any portion
                    of the finding or sentence, and he may mitigate, commute, or entirely remit the
                    punishment. In the case of a general court martial the proceedings are sent to
                    the judge advocate general, who submits to the queen his opinion as to the
                    legality of the trial and sentence. If they are legal in all respects he sends
                    the proceedings to the commander-in-chief, upon whom rests the duty of advising
                    the queen regarding the exercise of clemency. In addition to confirmation,
                    however, every general or district court martial held out of India has another
                    ordeal to go through. It is reviewed and examined in the office of the judge
                    advocate general, and any illegality that may be disclosed is corrected and the
                    prisoner is relieved of the consequences. To a certain extent a protection
                    against illegality also exists in the case of regimental courts martial. A
                    monthly return of those held in each regiment is laid before the general
                    commanding the district or brigade, by whom any question that might appear to
                    him doubtful would be referred to the adjutant general or the judge advocate
                    general for decision. It is to be noted, however, that the judge advocate
                    general, although fulfilling duties which are in their nature judicial, is only
                    an adviser. He is not actually a judge in an executive sense, and has no
                    authority directly to interfere with or correct an illegal conviction. In many
                    cases the law thus provides no remedy for an officer or soldier who may have
                    been wronged by the finding or sentence of a court martial,—for instance,
                    through a verdict not justified by the evidence or through a non-observance of
                    the rules and practice prescribed for these tribunals. A person who has suffered
                    injustice may appeal to the Queen’s Bench division of the high court of justice.
                    But, speaking generally, that tribunal would not interfere with a court martial
                    exercising its jurisdiction within the law as regards the prisoner, the crime,
                    and the sentence. In most cases, therefore, the virtual protector of an accused
                    person against illegality is the judge advocate general, who personally advises
                    the queen and the military authorities that the law shall be complied with. As a
                    privy councillor and member of the House of Commons that officer is responsible
                    both to the queen and to parliament for the right and due administration of
                    military law; and, notwithstanding his want of direct executive authority, it is
                    not to be contemplated that any military officer would hesitate to act upon
                    advice given by him with reference to a <pb break="no"

                    The department of the judge advocate general consists of the judge advocate
                    general, who is a lawyer, a privy councillor, and a member of parliament, of a
                    permanent deputy judge advocate general who is also a lawyer, and of three
                    military officers as deputy judge advocates having special experience in the
                    working of military law.</p>
                <p>The Army Act applies to European officers and soldiers serving in India in the
                    same manner as to the rest of the army, but natives of India are governed by
                    their own Articles of War, and in the case of civil offences they are dealt with
                    according to the provisions of the Indian penal code. The department of the
                    judge advocate general in India is distinct from and independent of that of the
                    judge advocate general of the army, and courts martial held in that country are
                    not subject to the supervision of a professional lawyer. Certain prominent
                    irregularities led to the appointment of a barrister as judge advocate general
                    in India in 1869, but after a few years that appointment again became filled by
                    a military officer. The staff of the department is, however, far more numerous
                    in India than elsewhere. There are judge advocates general for each of the
                    presidencies, and a deputy judge advocate at each of the more important military
                    centres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Statistics of Crime in the Army.</hi> —Commissioned officers
                    are rarely subjected to trial by court martial. Where an officer commits himself
                    in a military sense, and his misconduct is too serious to be passed over merely
                    with a mark of official displeasure, he is usually given and seldom fails to
                    accept the alternative of resigning his commission. In some instances the crown
                    is advised to exercise its prerogative and remove him from the army on the
                    ground that her majesty has no further occasion for his services. In no
                    circumstances can an officer or soldier claim a court martial as a right. In the
                    result, the annual number of trials of officers does not average more than four
                    of late years. Among the non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the army,
                    however, the trials and summary punishments by commanding officers are
                    exceedingly numerous, as will presently be seen. In India this observation
                    hardly holds good, for in that country desertion is physically almost impossible
                    except at the two or three seaports where troops are stationed. Absence without
                    leave is for a similar reason of rare occurrence, while the fact of the troops
                    living in their own cantonments, and being free from many temptations of life
                    existing in the large towns and garrisons at home, places them outside the
                    influence of certain prevalent causes of crime. For this reason mainly the
                    proportion of courts martial held in 1881 was 107 per 1000 men at home as
                    compared with 76 abroad. Similarly the proportion of minor punishments per 1000
                    was 1449 at home to 1042 abroad. It is also generally found that men engaged
                    upon active service in the field commit less crime than those serving in
                    ordinary circumstances. But the general criminal statistics of the army for 1881
                    show a formidable amount of crime and punishment. Upon an average strength of
                    181,186 n^n-commissioned officers and men there were 16,523 courts martial, of
                    which 179 were general, 8549 district, and 7795 regimental courts. There were
                    also 224,681 minor punishments by commanding officers, including 44,108 fines
                    for drunkenness. These figures generally show an increase of crime as compared
                    with the two years immediately preceding, but these two exhibited a decrease
                    upon previous years. Of the offences tried by court martial in 1881 the
                    following were the principal:—mutiny 7, desertion 1597, offences in relation to
                    enlistment (fraudulently enlisting while already belonging to the service or
                    making false answers upon attestation) 1190, violence to and disobedience of
                    superiors 1650, minor insubordination and neglect of orders 1472, quitting or
                    sleeping on post 681, drunkenness on duty 2661, drunkenness (tried by court
                    martial when the offence has been committed on a fifth occasion within twelve
                    months) 2147, disgraceful conduct of various kinds 660, absence without leave
                    not amounting to desertion 3293, making away with or losing by neglect equipment
                    or necessaries 3768, and miscellaneous offences chiefly of an ordinary criminal
                    character or to the prejudice of discipline 4181. Upon the 16,523 trials there
                    were 349 findings of acquittal. Regarding the punishments awarded, it appears
                    that no soldier was sentenced to death during the year, and the other awards
                    were as follows :—penal servitude 104, imprisonment with or without hard labour
                    (almost invariably the former) 12,125, discharge with ignominy without other
                    punishment 42, stoppages of pay without other punishment 65, flogging (before
                    the abolition of that punishment by the Act of 1881) 15, and the new summary
                    punishment (authorized as a substitute for flogging) 3. Of the non-commissioned
                    officers 3228 were punished by reduction to a lower grade or to the ranks, while
                    591 more suffered imprisonment in addition to loss of grade, the former number
                    being in the proportion of about 12 and the latter of 2 per cent, to strength.

                <p><hi rend="italic">Military Law of other Countries.—</hi> The administration of
                    military law in other countries having large armies harmonizes in many important
                    respects with that of England. In some indeed it is a question whether their
                    systems are not superior and in advance. They have a considerable body of
                    “auditors” or military lawyers who expound the law and do much to secure a
                    uniform and exact administration of justice. Thus in Austria there are about
                    five hundred of these auditors, one being attached to each regiment. In the same
                    country there are also courts of appeal from the courts of first instance, these
                    latter consisting of eight persons including the auditor. Where the prisoner is
                    a non-commissioned officer or a private, that rank is represented on the court.
                    Here also the confirmation of superior authority is required. In the German army
                    there are general and regimental courts. An auditor who is a lawyer is attached
                    to each division, and it is his duty to expound the law, collect the evidence,
                    and read it to the court in the presence of the prisoner, who is asked if he has
                    any thing to say. The court consists of eleven members, of whom upon the trial
                    of a private soldier or non-commissioned officer three are of the rank of the
                    accused. The power of commanding officers in regard to disciplinary punishments
                    is greater than in the British army, especially in relation to officers, who may
                    be placed in arrest for fourteen days. The non-commissioned officers and
                    privates are liable to extra guards, drills, fatigues, and different degrees of
                    arrest, some of a very severe character. Dismissal from the army, which is
                    regarded as a most severe punishment, involving civil disgrace, is often
                    awarded. In Russia there are three kinds of military courts— namely, the
                    regimental court martial, the tribunals of military districts, and the supreme
                    tribunal at St Petersburg. They are permanent courts, are attended by legal
                    persons, and in certain instances have jurisdiction over the civil population as
                    -well as the army. There is a judge advocate general at St Petersburg, where the
                    supreme tribunal consists of general officers and high war-office functionaries
                    who have studied military law or possess a large experience of its working. In
                    Italy there are permanent military tribunals for the trial of non-commissioned
                    officers and soldiers, while special tribunals are appointed to try officers.
                    The court is the absolute judge of the facts, but regarding legal errors or
                    irregularities an appeal lies to the supreme war tribunal, which consists of
                    four civilian judges and three general officers. The French code corresponds in
                    many respects with those of the other great Continental armies, but it tends
                    rather to give individual officers large powers of imprisonment graduated
                    according to their rank. The chief distinctive feature of the French system is
                    the institution of regiments of discipline for refractory characters. When the
                    general officer’s power of imprisonment (two months) is exhausted the offender
                    may be sent before a court of discipline and by them drafted into a <hi
                    rend="italic">compagnie</hi><hi rend="italic">de discipline</hi>; and cases of
                    habitual misconduct are thus dealt with, the man being struck off the strength
                    of his original corps and transferred to one in Algeria. The military law of the
                    United States is founded upon and proceeds much upon the same lines as that of
                    England. (J. C. O’D. )</p>
