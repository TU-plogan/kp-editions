                    settled on the border of the cultivated country eastward of the great depression
                    which extends from the Gulf of Elath to the Dead Sea, and up the valley of the
                    Jordan. According to the book of Genesis, they had come out of Mesopotamia, and
                    so were precursors of the larger wave which followed from the same quarter,
                    forming the most southern outpost of the Aramaean immigration into the lands of
                    Canaan and Heth. Whether the Hebrews were originally Aramaeans is questionable,
                    but it is certain that, like the Aramaeans, they were distinct from the
                    Canaanites, whose conquerors they were. Such was the relation of the old and new
                    inhabitants, not only in Western Palestine after the Israelite occupation, but
                    also, and from a much earlier period, in Eastern Palestine, where the aborigines
                    were Amori tes—that is, Canaanites—and where the Bne Ammon and Moab and the Bne
                    Isaac successively settled in their lands. The old population did not disappear
                    before the conquerors, but continued to subsist among them. Ju a considerable
                    district—namely, in Gilead—the Amorites even remained unsubdued, and thus formed
                    a gap, only imperfectly filled up by the Bne Ammon, between the Hebrew line of
                    immigration on the south and the Aramaean line more to the north,—a gap which
                    did not begin to close until the historical period. From this district they even
                    endeavoured, and with some success, as will be afterwards seen, to recover the
                    territory which had been taken from them in the south. But where they were the
                    subjects of the Hebrews they constituted the basis of the population, the
                    mainstock of the working and trading classes. The extent of their influence over
                    the conquerors may be judged from the fact that it was their speech which gained
                    the upper hand. The Moabites, and doubtless also the Ammonites and Edomites,
                    spoke the language of Canaan as well as the Israelites. They must have learned
                    it from the Canaanites in the land eastward of Jordan, prior to the period at
                    which Jacob immigrated to and returned from Egypt. Our knowledge is extremely
                    imperfect as regards other departments of the Canaanite influence; but in
                    religion it has left a noticeable trace in the cultus of Baal-Peor, which was
                    carried on in Moabite territory, but was certainly of Canaanite origin.</p>
                <p>The assumption that the change of language was first brought about by the
                    Israelites in the land which is called by preference that of Canaan, is rendered
                    untenable by the fact that the Moabites also spoke Canaanitish. It is vain to
                    urge against the identity of Hebrew and Canaanitish the distinction between
                    Phoenician and Hebrew; for doubtless similar distinctions existed between the
                    dialect of the Phoenician coast towns and that of the Hi vites, Amorites, and
                    Canaanites generally, whose language the Hebrews borrowed. That the Aramaeans of
                    Damascus, who also were compelled to mingle with the Hethites in the country of
                    which they had taken possession, nevertheless retained their original tongue is
                    to be explained by the circumstance that they continued to maintain direct
                    relations with the mother-country of Mesopotamia, and moreover had greater
                    internal cohesion. The designation Amorites, usually given in the Old Testament
                    to the original inhabitants of Eastern Palestine, is substantially synonymous
                    with that of Canaanites, although not quite so comprehensive. The Palestine of
                    the Pre-Israelitic period, which in the Pentateuch is called the Land of Canaan,
                    figures in Amos as the Land of the Amorites. While, however, the former name is
                    bestowed chiefly upon that portion of the earlier population which had remained
                    unconquered, the latter is given to the portion against which the Israelites
                    first directed their attack and in whose territory they settled. This took place
                    in the mountain district, first to the east and afterwards to the west of
                    Jordan. For this reason the Amorites, as contrasted with the Canaanites of the
                    cities of the level country, are.a highland race, like the Hebrews themselves,
                    but belong exclusively to the past. In the time of the Biblical narrators, the
                    Canaanites are still living here and there in the land, but the Amorites have
                    once lived where the Israelites now are. This explains the fact that, while in
                    ordinary peaceful circumstances the Canaanites are named as the old inhabitants,
                    the Amorites are immediately substituted for them wherever war and conquest are
                    spoken of. Sihon and Og, with whom Moses does battle, are kings of the Amorites;
                    in like manner it is with the twelve kings of the Amorites that Joshua has to
                    deal westward of the Jordan. The Amorites as an extinct race of course assume a
                    half-mythical character, and are represented as giants, tall as cedars and
                    strong as oaks.</p>

                <p>Just as Israel was the people of Jehovah, and Ammon the people of Milcom, Moab
                    was the people of Chemosh</p>
                <p>Num. xxi. 29). The kingship of Chemosh was regarded as thoroughly national and
                    political in its character, but did not on that account exclude the institution
                    of a human king, which existed in Moab much earlier than in Israel; in the time
                    of Moses the Moabites had a king, and the institution was even then an old one.
                    The capitals of the kingdom were Ar-Moab and Kir-Moab, south from the Arnon;
                    these were not, however, the constant residences of the kings, who continued to
                    live in their native places, as, for example, Mesha in Dibon. Doubtless there
                    were changes of dynasty, and traces exist of a powerful aristocracy (Ariele
                    Moab; 2 Sam. xxiii. 20).</p>
                <p>The land of the Moabites, the Balkâ, is bounded northward and southward by Mount
                    Gilead and Wadi ’l-Ahsâ, westward and eastward by the Dead Sea and the
                    Wilderness; it is divided into two portions by the deep bed of the Arnon, that
                    to the north being the more level (Mishôr), and that to the south being more
                    broken up, and constituting the proper stronghold of the nation. The soil is
                    peculiarly adapted for sheep-farming (2 Kings iii.) and the culture of the vine
                    (Isa. xvi.). <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>The historical importance of the Moabites lies wholly in their contact with
                    Israel, and we have no knowledge of them apart from this. After the Israelites
                    had quitted Egypt and passed a nomadic life for about a generation in the
                    neighbourhood of Kadesh, they migrated thence, still under the leadership of
                    Moses, into northern Moab, dispossessing the Amorites, who had made themselves
                    masters of that district. The interval from Kadesh to the Arnon could be passed
                    only by a good understanding with Edom, Moab, and Ammon,—a proof that the
                    ethnical relationships, which at a later period were expressed only in legend,
                    were at that time still living and practical. In all probability the Moabites
                    called the Israelites to their aid; they were not as yet aware that this little
                    pastoral people was destined one day to become to them a greater danger than the
                    Canaanites by whom they were threatened at the moment. <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi></p>
                <p>As the story of Balaam indicates, the Moabites would willingly have been rid of
                    their cousins after their service had been rendered, but were unable to prevent
                    them from settling in the land of Sihon. The migration of the tribes of Israel
                    into Western Palestine, however, and the dissolution of their warlike
                    confederation soon afterwards made a restoration of the old frontiers possible.
                    If King Eglon took tribute of Benjamin at Jericho, the territory between Arnon
                    and Jordan must also have been subject to him, and</p>
                <p>Reuben must even then have lost his land, or at least his liberty. It would
                    appear that the Moabites next extended their attacks to Mount Gilead, giving
                    their support to the Ammonites, who, during the period of the judges, were its
                    leading assailants. So close was the connexion between Moab and Ammon that the
                    boundary between them vanishes for the narrators (Judges xi.).</p>
                <p>Gilead was delivered from the Ammonites by Saul, who at the same time waged a
                    successful war against Moab; the fact is lightly touched upon in 1 Sam. xiv. <hi
                    rend="italic">47,</hi> as if this were a matter of course. The establishment of
                    the monarchy necessarily involved Israel in feuds with its neighbours and kin.
                    The Moabites being the enemies of the Israelite kingdom, David naturally sent
                    his people for shelter thither when he had broken with Saul; the incident is
                    precisely analogous to what happened when he himself at a later period took
                    refuge from Saul’s persecution in Philistine territory, and needs no explanation
                    from the book of Ruth. As soon as he ceased to be the king’s enemy by himself
                    becoming king, his relations with Moab became precisely those of his
                    predecessor. The war in which apparently casual circumstances involved him with
                    Hanun ben Nahash of Ammon really arose out of larger causes, and thus spread to
                    Moab and Edom as well. The end of it was that all the three Hebrew nationalities
                    were incorporated with the kingdom of Israel; the youngest brother eclipsed and
                    subdued his seniors, as Balaam had foreseen. Through the work of Saul and David
                    the political system of Palestine was altogether changed: the smaller peoples
                    were no longer a match for Israel, which established a decisive preponderance,
                    and transformed what had hitherto been jealousy on the part of Moab and Ammon as
                    well as of Edom into bitter hatred; this hatred did not cease even after nothing
                    but a religious shadow remained of what had once been the political supremacy of
                    the people of Jehovah.</p>
                <p>The struggle with Ammon which David began ultimately assumed larger dimensions,
                    and brought the Aramaeans also into the field against him. He was successful,
                    indeed, against them also, and destroyed their most powerful kingdom; but after
                    his death they recovered themselves, and pressed steadily on from the borders of
                    the wilderness towards the se⅝j at their head were those kings of Damascus who
                    had established themselves on the ruins of Zoba. In presence of these enemies
                    the already fading distinction between the ruling and the subject nationality
                    within the kingdom of Israel now completely disappeared; and even towards the
                    Canaanites outside the relations of the kings became friendly. It is in one
                    instance expressly stated that the common danger threatening from the East had
                    to do with this (2 Sam. viii. 9 <hi rend="italic">sqq.}.</hi> But, conversely,
                    it was natural that Ammon and Moab should make common cause with the Aramaeans;
                    such an attitude was suggested by geographical position and old connexions, but
                    above all by their helpless fury against Israel. Both nationalities must have
                    succeeded in emancipating themselves very soon after David’s death, and only now
                    and then was some strong king of Israel able again to impose the yoke for a
                    time, not upon the Ammonites indeed, but upon Moab. The first to do so was 0mri,
                    who garrisoned a number of their towns and compelled the king to acknowledge
                    Israel’s suzerainty by a yearly tribute of sheep,—a state of matters which
                    continued until the death of Ahab ben 0mri. But when that brave king fell in
                    battle with the Aramaeans at Ramoth Gilead (about 850 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), Mesha of Dibon, then the ruler of Moab, seized the favourable
                    opportunity to make himself and his people independent. In his famous
                    inscription he tells how, through the wrath of Chemosh, the land had fallen into
                    the enemy’s power and endured forty years of slavery, and how by the grace of
                    Chemosh the yoke is now broken and the Israelites ignominiously driven off. In
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> There does not seem to have been any difference
                    in this respect between the northern and southern portions; instead of Heshbon,
                    Sibmah, and Jaezer (Isa. xvi.), the poet Hatim of Tayyi, a little before
                    Mohammed, names Maâb and Zoar as the chief wine centres (Yâkùt, iv. 377,
                    19).</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> The facts as a whole are indubitable; it cannot be
                    an invention that the Israelites settled first in Kadesh, then in northern Moab,
                    and thence passed into Palestine proper. The only doubtful point is whether the
                    song in Num. xxi. 27 <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi> is contemporary evidence of
                    these events. It is certainly not a forgery, but it is a question whether it
                    really refers to the destruction of the kingdom of the Amorites at Heshbon. This
                    reference rests entirely upon the words [ΙΠΌ '"MOK which might very well be
                    omitted as a mere gloss, in which case the song would naturally be understood as
                    directed against the Moabites themselves; it is in this last sense that it is
                    taken by the author of Jer. xlviii. (Comp. E. Meyer in Stade’s <hi rend="italic"

                    did Hadad king of the Edomites vanquish the Midianites on the “field” of Moab
                    (Gen. xxxvi. 35); this took place in Gideon’s time, as is borne out by the fact
                    that between Hadad and the downfall of the ancient Edomite monarchy, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi> to the period of David, there were four reigning
                    princes. Confused recollections of a former settlement of the Midianites in
                    northern Moab are seen in Num. xxii. 4, 7; xxv. 18.</p>

                <p>the Bible we find only the curt statement that Moab rebelled against Israel after
                    the death of Ahab (2 Kings i.); on the other hand, there is a full narrative of
                    a later attempt on the part of Joram ben Ahab to bring Mesha again into
                    subjection—an attempt which promised very well at first, but ultimately failed
                    completely. Joram’s invasion took place not from the north but (probably very
                    unexpectedly to the enemy) from the frontier of Edom over the Wadi Ί-Ahsâ.; he
                    marched through Judah and Edom, and the kings of those countries served as
                    auxiliaries. He defeated a Moabite army on the frontier, penetrated into the
                    country and laid it λvaste; he laid siege to the fortress of Kir-Moab so closely
                    as to reduce it to great straits. But these straits seem to have filled the
                    besieged with a desperate courage, for the fortunes of war suddenly changed. The
                    Israelites were compelled to retire homeward, a great wrath (of Jehovah) having
                    come upon them, that is, a severe disaster having befallen them, which is not
                    described, but, from the nature of the case, must have been a sudden surprise
                    and defeat by the enemy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The narrative of Mesha in his inscription has, strange to say, not
                    unfrequently been regarded as parallel with 2 Kings iii., and the conclusion
                    been drawn that the Biblical narrative completely inverts the true state of the
                    case,—it is difficult to see for what motives, for there is no braggadocio in 2
                    Kings iii. But it is perfectly clear that the narrative of 2 Kings iii.
                    presupposes the revolt of Mesha as an old affair; while, on the other hand,
                    Mesha’s story on the stele in the Louvre is a narrative of this very revolt and
                    its immediate consequences; it is accordingly to be regarded as parallel with 2
                    Kings i. 1. Elisha’s miracle in Wadi Ί-Ahsâ (2 Kings iii. 16) is explained by
                    the locality; Alisa means a sandy ground with moist subsoil, where, by digging
                    trenches, water is always obtainable. The (probably compulsory) participation of
                    the king of Edom in Joram’s expedition against Moab may perhaps be brought into
                    connexion with the fact that the Moabites burned to lime the bones of a king of
                    Edom (Amos ii. 1).</p></note></p>
                <p>As the Moabites owed their liberation from Israelite supremacy to the battle of

                    is the hero and saint, which therefore in its present form is of Moabite origin,
                    although perhaps it has a still older Canaanite nucleus. Of these border wars we
                    learn but little, although from casual notices it can be seen (2 Kings xiii. 20;
                    Amos i. 13; comp. 2 Kings v. 2) that they were long kept up, although not quite
                    uninterruptedly. But when at length the danger from the Aramaeans was removed
                    for Israel by the intervention of the Assyrians, the hour of Moab’s subjection
                    also came; Jeroboam II. extended his frontier over the eastern territory, as far
                    as to the brook of the willows (Wadi Ί-Ahsâ). (Perhaps the song of Num. xxi. 27
                    <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi> has reference to these events.) A vivid picture of
                    the confusion and anguish then prevalent in Moab has been preserved to us in the
                    ancient prophecy of Isa. xv., xvi., which indeed would have greater historical
                    value if we were able to tell precisely what in it -depicts the present, and
                    what is prediction of the future.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In Isa. XV. xvi. it is presupposed that the attack upon Moab
                    has been made from the north, at a time when Judah is a comparatively powerful
                    kingdom, exercising sovereignty over Edom also, and in a position to afford
                    shelter to the fugitive Moabites, thus not being itself at war with them. These
                    marks taken together can only apply to the period of Jeroboam II. and Uzziah.
                    Hitzig will have it that Jonah ben Amittai wrote Isa. xv. xvi.; but according to
                    2 Kings xiv. 25 that prophet preached prosperity to Jeroboam, and not disaster
                    to the Moabites.</p></note></p>
                <p>This utterance of an older prophet was repeated some decennia later by the
                    prophet Isaiah, with the addition of a clause adapting it to his time, to the
                    effect that the Assyrians would carry out in all its fulness the hitherto
                    imperfectly-executed threat. The Assyrians actually subjugated the Moabites, as
                    well as the other small peoples of that region; but the blow was apparently not
                    so grave as Isaiah had predicted. They lay more out of the way than their
                    western neighbours, and perhaps their resistance to the scourge of God was not
                    so obstinate as to demand the sharpest measures. What made it all the easier for
                    them to reconcile themselves to the new situation was the fact that the
                    Israelites suffered much more severely than they. From these their deadly
                    enemies they were henceforth for ever free. They did not on that account,
                    however, give up their old hatred, but merely transferred it from Israel to
                    Judah. The political annihilation of the nation only intensified in Jerusalem
                    the belief in its religious prerogative, and against this belief the hostility
                    of neighbours was aroused more keenly than ever. The deepest offence at the
                    religious exclusiveness of the people of Judaea, which then first began to
                    manifest itself, was, as is easily understood, taken by their nearest relatives,
                    Edom and Moab. They gave terrible expression to their feelings when the
                    Chaldaeans urged them on like uncaged beasts of prey against the rebellious
                    Jews; and they joined loudly in the general chorus of malignant joy which was
                    raised over the burning of the temple and the ruin of the holy city.<note

                    they had no difficulty in seeking alliances with them, when occasions arose on
                    which they could be made useful (Jer. xxvii. 3).</p></note></p>
                <p>“Because Moab saith: Behold the house of Judah is like all the other nations,
                    therefore do I open his land to the Bne Kedem,” says the prophet Ezekiel (xxv. 8
                    <hi rend="italic">sqq.).</hi> His threat against the Moabites as well as against
                    the Edomites and Ammonites is that they shall fall before the approach of the
                    desert tribes. Probably in his day the tide of Arabian invasion was already
                    slowly rising, and of course it had first to overtake the lands situated on the
                    desert border. At all events the Arab immigration into this quarter began at an
                    earlier date than is usually supposed; it continued for centuries, and was so
                    gradual that the previously - introduced Aramaeizing process could quietly go on
                    alongside of it. The Edomites gave way before the pressure of the land-hungry
                    nomads, and settled in the desolate country of Judah; the children of Lot, on
                    the other hand, appear to have amalgamated with them,—the Ammonites maintaining
                    their individuality longer than the Moabites, who soon entirely disappeared.</p>
                <p>Israel and Moab had a common origin, and their early history was similar. The
                    people of Jehovah on the one hand, the people of Chemosh on the other, had the
                    same idea of the Godhead as head of the nation, and a like patriotism derived
                    from religious belief,—a patriotism capable of extraordinary efforts, and which
                    has had no parallel in the West either in ancient or in modern times. The
                    mechanism of the theocracy also had much that was common to both nations; in
                    both the king figures as the deity’s representative, priests and prophets as the
                    organs through whom he makes his communications. But, with all this similarity,
                    how different were the ultimate fates of the two! The history of the one loses
                    itself obscurely and fruitlessly in the sand; that of the other issues in
                    eternity. One reason for the difference (which, strangely enough, seems to have
                    been felt not by the Israelites alone but by the Moabites also) is obvious.
                    Israel received no gentle treatment at the hands of the world; it had to carry
                    on a continual conflict with foreign influences and hostile <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n561/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0561-0536"/> powers; and this perpetual struggle with gods and
                    men was not profitless, although the external catastrophe was inevitable. Moab
                    meantime remained settled on his lees, and was not emptied from vessel to vessel
                    (Jer. xlviii. 11), and corruption and decay were the result. This explanation,
                    however, does not carry us far, for other peoples with fortunes as rude as those
                    of Israel have yet failed to attain historical importance, but have simply
                    disappeared. The service the prophets rendered at a critical time, by raising
                    the faith of Israel from the temporal to the eternal sphere, has already been
                    spoken of in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Israel.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sources.—</hi> The Old Testament (Ruth and Chronicles, however, being of no
                    historical worth in this connexion), and the inscription of Mesha, on the stone
                    of Dibon, discovered in 1868, and now in the Louvre. The Berlin <hi

                    champion of their genuineness, conceding that they are mere scribbling, and do
                    not even form words, much less sentences. The literature of the subject is to be
                    found in the commentaries on the Old Testament books, and in those on the
                    inscription of Mesha. (J. WE.)</p>
