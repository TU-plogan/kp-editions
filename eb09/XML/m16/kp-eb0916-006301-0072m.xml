                    of metals is found in the prehistoric implements of the so-called Bronze and
                    Iron ages. In the earliest periods of written history, however, we meet with a
                    number of metals in addition to these two. The Old Testament mentions six
                    metals—gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead. The Greeks, in addition to
                    these and to bronze, came also to know mercury; and the same set of metals,
                    without additions, forms the list of the Arabian chemists of the 8th and of the
                    Western chemists of the 13th century. During the 15th century Basilius
                    Valentinus discovered antimony; he also speaks of zinc and bismuth, but their
                    individuality was established only at a later period. About 1730-40 the Swede
                    Brand discovered arsenic and cobalt (the former is not reckoned a metal by
                    modern chemists), while the Englishman Ward recognized the individuality of
                    platinum. Nickel was discovered in 1774 by Cronstedt, manganese in 1774 by
                    Scheele. The brothers D’Elhujart, in 1783, prepared tungsten; Hjelm, in 1782,
                    isolated molybdenum from molybdic oxide, where its existence had been
                    conjecturally asserted by Bergmann in 1781. Uranium, as a new element, was
                    discovered by Klaproth in 1789; but his metallic “uranium,” after having been
                    accepted as a metal by all chemists until 1841, was then recognized as an oxide
                    by Péligot, who subsequently isolated the true metal. Tellurium was discovered
                    by Miiller von Reichenbach in 1782 (again by Klaproth in 1798); titanium, by
                    Klaproth in 1795; chromium, by Vauquelin in 1797; tantalum, by Hatchett in 1801,
                    and by Ekeberg in 1802. Palladium, rhodium, iridium, and osmium (which four
                    metals always accompany platinum in its ores) were discovered, the first two by
                    Wollaston in 1803, the other two by a number of chemists; but their peculiarity
                    was established chiefly by Smithson Tennant.</p>
                <p>After Davy, in 1807 and 1808, had recognized the alkalies and alkaline earths as
                    metallic oxides, the existence of metals in all basic earths became a foregone
                    conclusion, which was verified sooner or later in all cases. But the discovery
                    of aluminium by Wöhler in 1828, and that of magnesium by Bussy in 1829, claim
                    special mention. Cadmium, a by no means rare heavy metal, was discovered only in
                    1818, by Stromeyer.</p>
                <p>Of the large number of discoveries of rare metals which have been made in more
                    recent times only a few can be mentioned, as marking new departures in research
                    or offering other special points of interest. In 1861 Bunsen and Kirchhoff, by
                    means of the method of spectrum analysis, which they had worked out shortly
                    before, discovered two new alkali-metals which they called caesium and rubidium.
                    By means of the same method Crookes, in 1861, discovered thallium; Reich and
                    Richter, in 1863, indium; and Lecoq de Boisbaudran, in 1875, gallium. The
                    existence of the last-named metal had been maintained, theoretically, by
                    Mendelejeff, as early as 1871. The existence of vanadium was proved in 1830 by
                    Sefström; but what he, and subsequently Berzelius, looked upon as the element
                    was, in 1867, proved to be really an oxide by Roscoe, who also succeeded in
                    isolating the true metal.</p>
                <p>The development of earlier notions on the constitution of metals and their
                    genetic relation to one another forms the most interesting chapter in the
                    history of chemistry (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Alchemy).</hi> What modern
                    science has to say on the matter is easily stated: all metals properly so called
                    <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> all metals not alloys) are elementary substances;
                    hence, chemically speaking, they are not “constituted” at all, and no two can be
                    related to each other genetically in any way whatever. Our scientific instinct
                    shrinks from embracing this proposition as final; but in the meantime it must be
                    accepted as correctly formulating our ignorance on the subject. All metallic
                    elements agree in this that they form each at least one basic oxide, or, what
                    comes to the same thing, one chloride, stable in opposition to liquid water.
                    This at once suggests an obvious definition of metals as a class of substances,
                    but the definition would be highly artificial and objectionable on principle,
                    because when we speak of metals we think, not of their accidental chemical
                    relations, but of a certain sum of mechanical and physical properties which
                    unites them all into one natural family. What these properties are we shall now
                    endeavour to explain.</p>
                <p>All metals, when exposed in an inert atmosphere to a sufficient temperature,
                    assume the form of liquids, which all present the following characteristic
                    properties. They are (at least practically) non-transparent; they reflect light
                    in a peculiar manner, producing what is called “metallic lustre.” When kept in
                    non-metallic vessels they take the shape of a convex meniscus. These liquids,
                    when exposed to higher temperatures, some sooner others later, pass into
                    vapours. What these vapours are like is not known in many cases, since, as a
                    rule, they can be produced only at <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n73/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0073-0064"/> very high temperatures, precluding the use of
                    transparent vessels. Silver vapour is blue, potassium vapour is green, many
                    others (mercury vapour, for instance) are colourless. The liquid metals, when
                    cooled down sufficiently, some at lower others at higher temperatures, freeze
                    into compact solids, endowed with the (relative) non-transparency and the lustre
                    of their liquids. These frozen metals in general form compact masses consisting
                    of aggregates of crystals belonging to the regular or rhombic or (more rarely)
                    the quadratic system. But in many cases the crystals are so closely packed as to
                    produce an apparent absence of all structure. Compared with non-metallic solids,
                    they in general are good conductors of heat and of electricity. But their most
                    characteristic, though not perhaps their most general, property is that they
                    combine in themselves the apparently incompatible properties of elasticity and
                    rigidity on the one hand and plasticity on the other. To this remarkable
                    combination of properties more than to anything else the ordinary metals owe
                    their wide application in the mechanical arts. In former times a high specific
                    gravity used to be quoted as one of the characters of the genus; but this no
                    longer holds, since we have come to know of a whole series of metals which float
                    on water. Let us now proceed to see to what degree the mechanical and physical
                    properties of the genus are developed in the several individual metals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Non-Transparency.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This, in the
                    case of even the solid metals, is perhaps only a very low degree of
                    transparency. In regard to gold this has been proved to be so; gold leaf, or
                    thin films of gold produced chemically on glass plates, transmit light with a
                    green colour. On the other hand, those infinitely thin films of silver which can
                    be produced chemically on glass surfaces are absolutely opaque. Very thin films
                    of liquid mercury, according to Meisens, transmit light with a violet-blue
                    colour; also thin films of copper are said to be translucent. Other metals, so
                    far as we know, have not been more exactly investigated in this direction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Colour.—</hi> Gold is yellow; copper is red; silver, tin, and
                    some others are pure white; the majority exhibit some modification or other of

                    metallic surfaces, like those of other solids, divide any incident ray into two
                    parts, of which one is refracted while the other is reflected,— with this
                    difference, however, that the former is completely absorbed, and that the
                    latter, in regard to polarization, is quite differently affècted.<note

                    named, is as follows (original intensity = 1) :—</p>

                    the case of repeated reflexion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crystalline Form.—</hi> Most (perhaps all) metals are capable
                    of crystallization, and in most cases isolated crystals can be produced by
                    judiciously managed partial freezing. The crystals belong to the following
                    systems :— <hi rend="italic">regular system</hi> —silver, gold, palladium,
                    mercury, copper, iron, lead; <hi rend="italic">quadratic system—</hi> tin,
                    potassium; <hi rend="italic">rhombic system—</hi> antimony, bismuth, tellurium,
                    zinc, magnesium.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure.—</hi> Perhaps all metals, in the shape which they
                    assume in freezing, are crystalline, only the degree of visibility of the
                    crystalline arrangement is very different in different metals, and even in the
                    same metal varies according to the slowness of solidification and other
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>Of the ordinary metals, antimony, bismuth, and zinc may be mentioned as
                    exhibiting a very distinct crystalline structure: a bar-shaped ingot readily
                    breaks, and the crystal faces are distinctly visible on the fracture. Tin also
                    is crystalline: a thin bar, when bent, “creaks” audibly from the sliding of the
                    crystal faces over one another; but the bar is not easily broken, and exhibits
                    an apparently non-crystalline fracture.—Class I.</p>
                <p>Gold, silver, copper, lead, aluminium, cadmium, iron (pure), nickel, and cobalt
                    are practically amorphous, the crystals (where they exist) being so closely
                    packed as to produce a virtually homogeneous mass.—Class II.</p>
                <p>The great contrast in apparent structure between cooled ingots of Class I. and of
                    Class II. appears, however, to be owing chiefly to the fact that, while the
                    latter crystallize in the regular system, metals of Class I. form rhombic or
                    quadratic crystals. Regular crystals expand equally in all directions; rhombic
                    and quadratic ores expand differently in different directions. Hence, supposing
                    the crystals immediately after their formation to be in absolute contact with
                    one another all round, then, in the case of Class II., such contact will be
                    maintained on cooling, while in the case of Class I. the contraction along a
                    given straight line will in general have different values in any two
                    neighbouring crystals, and the crystals consequently become, however slightly,
                    detached from one another. The crystalline structure which exists on both sides
                    becomes visible only in the metals of the first class, and only there manifests
                    itself as brittleness.</p>
                <p>Closely related to the structure of metals is their degree of “plasticity”
                    (susceptibility of being constrained into new forms without breach of
                    continuity). This term of course includes as special cases the qualities of
                    “malleability” (capability of being flattened out under the hammer) and
                    “ductility” (capability of being drawn into wire); but it is well at once to
                    point out that these two special qualities do not always go parallel to each
                    other, for this reason amongst others that ductility in a higher degree than
                    malleability is determined by the tenacity of a metal. Hence tin and lead,
                    though very malleable, are little ductile. The quality of plasticity is
                    developed to very different degrees in different metals, and even in the same
                    species it depends on temperature, and may be modified by mechanical or physical
                    operations. A bar of zinc, for instance, as obtained by casting, is very
                    brittle; but when heated to 100°or 150° C. it becomes sufficiently plastic to be
                    rolled into the thinnest sheet or to be drawn into wire. Such sheet or wire then
                    remains flexible after cooling, the originally only loosely cohering crystals
                    having got intertwisted and forced into absolute contact with one another,—an
                    explanation supported by the fact that rolled zinc has a somewhat higher
                    specific gravity (7*2) than the original ingot (6 ’ 9). The same metal, when
                    heated to 205° C., becomes so brittle that it can be powdered in a mortar. Pure
                    iron, copper, silver, and other metals are easily drawn into wire, or rolled
                    into sheet, or flattened under the hammer. But all these operations render the
                    metals harder, and detract from their plasticity. Their original softness can be
                    restored to them by “annealing,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by heating them to
                    redness and then quenching them in cold water. In the case of iron, however,
                    this applies only if the metal is perfectly pure. If it contains a few parts of
                    carbon per thousand, the annealing process, instead of softening the metal,
                    gives it a “temper,” meaning a higher degree of hardness and elasticity (see
                    below).</p>
                <p>What we have called plasticity must not be mixed up <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n74/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0074-0065"/> with the notion of softness, which means the
                    degree of facility with which the plasticity of a metal can be discounted. Thus
                    lead is far softer than silver, and yet the latter is by far the more plastic of
                    the two. The now famous experiments of Tresca <hi rend="italic">(Comptes
                    Rendus,</hi> lix. 754) show that the plasticity of certain metals at least goes
                    considerably farther than had before been supposed. He operated with lead,
                    copper, silver, iron, and some other metals. Round disks made of these
                    substances were placed in a closely fitting cylindrical cavity drilled in a
                    block of steel, the cavity having a circular aperture of two or four centimetres
                    below. By means of an hydraulic press, applied to a superimposed piston, a
                    pressure of 100,000 kilos was made to act upon the disks, when the metal was
                    seen to “flow” out of the hole like a viscid liquid. In spite of the immense
                    rearrangement of parts there was no breach of continuity. What came out below
                    was a compact cylinder with a rounded bottom, consisting of so many layers
                    superimposed upon one another. Parallel experiments with layers of dough or sand
                    plus some connecting material proved that the particles in all cases moved along
                    the same tracks as would be followed by a flowing cylinder of liquid. Of the
                    better known metals potassium and sodium are the softest; they can be kneaded
                    between the fingers like wax. After these follow first thallium and then lead,
                    the latter being the softest of the metals used in the arts. Among these the
                    softness decreases in about the following order :—lead, pure silver, pure gold,
                    tin, copper, aluminium, platinum, pure iron. As liquidity might be looked upon
                    as the <hi rend="italic">ne plus ultra</hi> of softness, this is the right place
                    for stating that, while most metals, when heated up to their melting points,
                    pass pretty abruptly from the solid to the liquid state, platinum and iron first
                    assume, and throughout a long range of temperatures retain, a condition of
                    viscous semi-solidity which enables two pieces of them to be “welded” together
                    by pressure into one continuous mass. Potassium and sodium might probably be
                    welded if their surfaces could be kept clear of oxide.</p>
                <p>According to Prechtl, the ordinary metals, in regard to the degree of facility or
                    perfection with which they can be hammered flat on the anvil, rolled out into
                    sheet, or drawn into wire, form the following descending series :—</p>

                <p>To give an idea of what can be done in this way, it may be stated that gold can
                    be beaten out to leaf of the thickness of ¹⁄₅₈₀₀ mm.; and that platinum, by
                    judicious work, can be drawn into wire <hi rend="subscript"> g0</hi> ⅞ <hi

                <p>By the hardness of a metal we mean the resistance which it offers to the file or
                    to the engraver’s tool. Taking it in this sense, it does not necessarily
                    measure, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the resistance of a metal to abrasion by
                    friction. Thus, for instance, 10 per cent, aluminium bronze is scratched by an
                    edge-tool made of ordinary steel as used for knife-blades. And yet it has been
                    found that the sets of needles used for perforating postage stamps last longer
                    if made of aluminium bronze than they do if made of steel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Elasticity. —</hi> All metals are elastic to this extent that a
                    change of form, brought about by stresses not exceeding certain limit values,
                    will disappear on the stress being removed. Strains exceeding the “limit of
                    elasticity” result in permanent deformation or (if sufficiently great) in
                    rupture. Where this limit lies is in no case precisely known. According to

                    any one else) and Hodgkinson, the real law seems to be pretty much as indicated
                    by the two curves on the accompanying diagram, where, in reference to a metallic
                    wire, stretched by an appended weight, the abscissa always means the numerical

                <p>both curves are nearly straight lines, the lower almost coinciding in its
                    beginning with the axis of abscissae; from that point onwards these two curves
                    approach each other, and at a short distance from the point of rupture they
                    rapidly converge towards intersection. For any value of P which lies fairly on
                    the safe side of A, we have approximately <hi rend="italic">IP</hi> λ =—«, <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> where λ means the elastic (or substantially the total)

                    square section of the wire or cylindrical bar operated upon. The reciprocal of
                    «(viz. E —1/«) is called the “modulus of elasticity.”</p>
                <p>Wertheim has determined this constant for a large number of metals and alloys. He
                    used three methods: one was to measure the elongations produced, in a wire of
                    given dimensions, by a succession of charges; the other two consisted in causing
                    a measured bar to give off a musical note by (a) longitudinal and (ft)
                    transversal vibration, and counting the vibrations per second. The following
                    table gives some of his results. Column 2 gives the constant E for millimetre
                    and kilogramme. Hence 1000/E is the elongation in millimetres per metre length
                    per kilo. Column 3 shows the charge causing a permanent elongation of 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 05 mm. per metre,—which, for practical purposes, he
                    takes as giving the limit of elasticity; column 4 gives the breaking strain.
                    Values of E in square brackets [ ] are derived from vibration experiments; the
                    rest from direct measurements of elongations. Numbers in round brackets ( ) do
                    not necessarily refer to the same specimen as the other data.</p>

                    Wertheim executed determinations also at other temperatures; but, as his numbers
                    do not appear to reveal the true <pb break="no"

                    results of Kohlrausch and Loomis, who found the following relations between the
                    modulus E <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> for 0° C. and the value E <hi
                    rend="subscript"> t</hi> for <hi rend="italic">+ t°</hi> C. :—</p>
                <p>Iron: E&lt; =E <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> (l -' 000483 f-∙00000012Z*). Copper:
                    E&lt; =E <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> (l - ' 000572 t-∙00000028f2). Brass: E <hi

                <p>Thus, for these three metals at least, the value of E diminishes, when
                    temperature increases, at pretty much the same rate per degree of
                    temperature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Specific Gravity.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This varies in
                    metals from ‘594 (lithium) to 22'48 (osmium), and in one and the same species is
                    a function of temperature and of previous physical and mechanical treatment. It
                    has in general one value for the powdery metal as obtained by reduction of the
                    oxide in hydrogen below the melting point of the metal, another for the metal in
                    the state which it assumes spontaneously on freezing, and this latter value
                    again, in general, is modified by hammering, rolling, or wire-drawing, &amp;c.
                    These mechanical operations do not necessarily add to the density; stamping, it
                    is true, does so necessarily, but rolling or drawing occasionally causes a
                    diminution of the density. Thus, for instance, chemically pure iron in the ingot
                    has the specific gravity 7'844; when it is rolled out into thin sheet, the value
                    falls to 7'6; when drawn into thin wire, to 7'75 (Berzelius). The following
                    table gives the specific gravities of all metals (except a few very rare ones)
                    according to the most trustworthy modern determinations. Where special
                    statements are not made, the numbers may be assumed to hold for the ordinary
                    temperature (15° to 17° or 20° C. ), referred to water of the same temperature
                    (specific gravity = 1) as a standard, and to hold for the natural frozen
                    metal.</p>

                    heats of most metals have been determined very carefully by Régnault. The
                    general result is that, conformably with Dulong and Petit’s law, the “atomic
                    heats” all come to very nearly the same value (of about 6'4); <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,e.,</hi> atomic weight by specific heat = 6 4. Thus we have for silver by
                    theory 6'4/108= '0593, and by experiment '0570 for 10° to 100° C.</p>

                    Supposing the relative resistance of a metal to be R, the reciprocal 1/R is
                    called its “electric conductivity.” For the same metal R varies with the
                    temperature, the higher temperature corresponding to the higher resistance. The

                    determined by Matthiesen, and the relative internal thermic conductivities of
                    (nominally) the same metals as determined by Wiedemann and Franz, with rods
                    about 5 mm. thick, of which one end was kept at 100° C., the rest of the rod in
                    a “vacuum” (of 5 mm. tension) at 12° C. Matthiesen’s results, except in the two

                    and Franz’s thermic conductivities, which supports an obvious and pretty

                    however, destroy the harmony.</p>

                    metals which are attracted by the magnet and can become magnets themselves. But
                    in regard to their power of retaining their magnetism none of them comes at all

                    rend="italic">Chemical Changes.</hi></p>
                <p>The chemical changes which metals are liable to may be classified according to
                    the loss of metallicity involved in them. We will adopt this principle and begin
                    with the action of metals on metals, which, as experience shows, always leads to
                    the formation of truly metallic compounds.</p>
                <p>Any two or more metals when mixed together in the liquid state unite chemically,
                    or at least molecularly, in this sense that, although the mixture, on standing
                    (hot), may separate into layers, each layer is a homogeneous solution or “alloy”
                    of, in general, all the components in one another. With binary combinations the
                    following two cases may present themselves :—(1) the two metals mix permanently
                    in any proportion; or (2) either of the two metals refuses to take up more than
                    a certain limit-proportion of the other; hence a random mixture of the two
                    metals will, in general, part into two layers,—one a solution of A in B, the
                    other a solution of B in A. The first case presents itself very frequently; it
                    holds, for instance, for gold and silver, gold and copper, copper and silver,
                    lead and tin, and any alloy of these two and bismuth. Many other cases might be
                    quoted. A good example of the second case is lead and zinc, either of which
                    dissolves only a very small percentage of the other. In the preparation of an
                    alloy we need not start with the components in the liquid state; the several
                    metals need only be heated together in the same crucible when, in general, the
                    liquid of the more readily fusible part dissolves the more refractory components
                    at temperatures far below their fusing points. Molten lead, for instance, as
                    many a tyro in chemical analysis has come to learn to his cost, readily runs
                    through a platinum crucible at little more than its own fusing point.</p>
                <p>A homogeneous liquid alloy, when solidified suddenly, say by pouring it drop by
                    drop into cold water, necessarily yields an equally homogeneous solid. But it
                    may not be so when it is allowed to freeze gradually. If, in this case, we allow
                    the process to go a certain way, and then pour off the still liquid portion, the
                    frozen part generally presents itself in the shape of more or less distinct
                    crystals; whether this happens or not, the rule is that its composition differs
                    from that of the mother liquor, and consequently from that of the original
                    alloy. This phenomenon of “liquation,” as it is called, is occasionally utilized
                    in metallurgy for the approximate separation of metals from one another;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A good illustration is
                    afforded bj∙ the process of Pattinson as used for concentrating the silver in

                    manipulation of alloys made to be used as such it may prove very inconvenient.
                    It does so, for instance, in the case of the copper-silver alloy which our coins
                    are made of; in a large ingot of such sterling silver the core may contain as
                    much as 0 ’ 3 per cent, of silver more than the outer shell.</p>
                <p>The existence of crystallized alloys, as the phenomenon of liquation generally,
                    strongly suggests the idea that alloys generally are mixtures, not of their
                    elementary components, but of chemical compounds of these elements with one
                    another, associated possibly with uncombined remnants of these. This notion is
                    strongly supported by the fact that the formation of many alloys involves an
                    obvious evolution of heat and a decided modification in what one would presume
                    to be the properties of the corresponding <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n77/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0077-0068"/> mixture. The case of sodium amalgam may be quoted
                    as a forcible illustration. What goes by this name in laboratories is an alloy
                    of two to three parts of sodium with one hundred parts of mercury, which is
                    easily produced by forcing the two components into contact with each other by
                    means of a mortar and pestle, when they unite, with deflagration, into an alloy
                    which after cooling assumes the form of a grey, hard, brittle solid, although
                    mercury is a liquid, and sodium, though a solid, is softer than wax. Similar
                    evidence of chemical action we have in the cases of brass (copper and zinc),
                    bronze (copper and tin), aluminium bronze (copper and aluminium), and in many
                    others that might be quoted. There are indeed a good many alloys the formation
                    of which is not accompanied by any obvious evolution of heat or any very marked
                    change in the mean properties of the components. But in the absence of all
                    precise thermic researches on the subject we are not in a position to assert the
                    absence of chemical action in any case. Indeed our knowledge of the proximate
                    composition of alloys is in the highest degree indefinite—we do not even know of
                    a single composite metal which has been really proved to be an unitary compound,
                    and hence the important problem of the relation in alloys between properties and
                    composition must be attacked on a purely empirical basis. What has been done in
                    this direction is shortly summarized in the following paragraphs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Colour.—</hi> Most metals are white or grey; so are the alloys
                    of these metals with one another. Gold, alloys generally exhibit something like
                    the shade of yellow which one would expect from their composition; its amalgams,
                    however, are all white, not yellow. Copper shows little tendency to impart its
                    characteristic red colour to its alloys with white or grey metals. Thus, for
                    instance, the silver alloy up to about 30 per cent, of copper exhibits an almost
                    pure white colour. The alloys of copper with zinc (brass) or tin (bronze) are
                    reddish-yellow when the copper predominates largely. As the proportion of white
                    metal increases, the colour passes successively into dark yellow, pale yellow,
                    and ultimately into white. Aluminium bronze, containing from 5 to 10 per cent,
                    of aluminium, is golden-yellow.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plasticity. —</hi> This quality is most highly developed in
                    certain pure metals, notably in gold, platinum, silver, and copper. Of platinum
                    alloys little is known. The other three, on uniting with one another,
                    substantially retain their plasticities, but the addition of any metal outside
                    the group leads to deterioration. Thus, for instance, according to Karsten,
                    copper, by being alloyed with as little as 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6
                    percent, of zinc, loses its capability of being forged at a red heat; it cracks
                    under the hammer. Antimony or arsenic to the extent of 0 ’ 15 per cent, renders
                    it unfit for being rolled into thin sheet or drawn out into fine wire, and makes
                    it brittle in the heat; 0 ’ 1 per cent, of lead prohibits its conversion into
                    leaf.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hardness, Elasticity, Tensile Strength.—</hi> In reference to
                    these qualities, we shall confine ourselves to some very striking changes for
                    the better which the metals (1) gold, (2) silver, (3) copper suffer when alloyed
                    with moderate proportions (10 per cent, or so) of (1) copper, (2) copper, (3)
                    tin, zinc, or aluminium respectively. Any of these five combinations leads to a
                    considerable increase in the three qualities named, although these are by no
                    means highly developed in the added metals; most strikingly it does so in the
                    case of aluminium bronze (copper and aluminium), which is so hard as to be very
                    difficult to file, and is said to be equal in tensile strength to wrought iron.
                    To illustrate this we give in the following table, after Matthiesen, the
                    breaking strains of double wires, No. 23 gauge, in lb avoirdupois, for certain
                    alloys on the one hand and their components on the other.</p>

                <p>In these, as in all the subsequent determinations for the alloys, the weighings
                    were reduced to the vacuum, and the values for S referred to water at 4° C. as
                    unity. From eight metals twenty-eight different kinds of binary alloys can be
                    produced; of these twentyeight combinations eighteen were selected; in each case
                    the two components were fused together in a variety of properly chosen atomic
                    proportions, and the specific gravities of these alloys were determined. The net
                    results are summarized in the following table, which, for each combination A, B,
                    in the first two columns gives the composition in multiplies of the
                    “atomic-weights” given in the table just quoted, while column 3 gives the values
                    of <hi rend="italic">e</hi> as calculated by the writer from Matthiesen’s
                    numbers for S <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> and S. Hence, for example, in the
                    accompanying entries the first line shows that the union into an alloy of twice
                    118 parts of tin and once 197 parts of gold involves an expansion from 1 volume
                    into 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 004; the second that the union of once 118
                    parts of tin with four times 197 parts of gold involves a contraction from 1
                    volume into 1 - ’ 028.</p>

                <p>To make these numbers trustworthy it would be necessary to determine their
                    probable errors; and this Matthiesen has not done. It would appear that any
                    value of e from 0 to (say)± '002 counts for nothing, and anything up to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 004 certainly must be taken as not proving much
                    either way. If this is correct, then</p>
                <p>(1) No contraction or expansion is proved in the cases Sb, Bi; Cd, Bi; Cd, Pb;
                    Au, Ag;</p>
                <p>(2) A contraction (from 0 5 to 47 per cent.) is proved for Sn, Ag; Bi, Ag; Bi,
                    Au; Pb, Au; Pb, Bi; Hg, Sn; Hg, Pb; Sn, Bi (?); Au, Ag (?);</p>
                <p>(3) An expansion (from <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 to 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8 percent.) is proved for Sb, Sn; Sb, Pb; Sn, Cd (?);
                    Sn, Pb (?); certain cases of Sn, Au and Pb, Ag;</p>
                <p>(4) In the two series Sn, Au and Pb, Ag, there are cases both of expansion and of
                    contraction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Thermic and Electric Properties.—</hi> The specific heat of an
                    alloy, so far as we know, is always in approximate accordance with Dulong and
                    Petit’s law. Thus the specific heat of Cu <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> Al <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is</p>
                <p>(5+l)×6∙4 δ×63∙5+l×27 ’</p>
                <p>with about the same degree of correctness as the “constant” 6'4 can claim for
                    itself.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Expansion.—</hi> Matthiesen, from numerous determinations made
                    with alloys and their components, concludes that the expansion of an alloy (from
                    0° to 100° C.) is nearly equal to the sum of the expansions of its components.
                    Supposing, for instance, one volume of gold to expand (from 0° to <hi
                    rend="italic">t)</hi> by α, and one volume of silver by 0; then an alloy of four
                    volumes of gold and three volumes of silver expands by (4α + 3∕3)∕7 per
                    unit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fusibility.—</hi> In the case of an alloy the melting-point and
                    the freezing-point are, in general, separated by a greater or less interval of
                    temperature, and the latter in itself may have two values as shown by Rudberg,
                    who found that when a fused alloy of tin and lead is allowed to freeze the
                    thermometer becomes stationary at two successive points, as shown in the
                    following table, where <hi rend="italic">x</hi> means the number of atomic
                    weights of tin united with <hi rend="italic">y</hi> of lead in the given case,
                    and the temperatures are in centigrade degrees.</p>

                <p>The electric conductivity of alloys <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> alloys has been
                    investigated by Matthiesen. He confined himself to binary alloys derived from a
                    certain set of elementary metals. The main results of his researches are given
                    in <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi> vol. viii. p. 51. For the practical
                    electrician it is important to observe how very much the conductivity of copper
                    is impaired by very minute admixtures even of metals that are good conductors,
                    and also by non-metallic contamination, especially with oxygen (present as Cu

                    being devoid of metallurgic interest, fall better under the heading <hi

                    copper (perhaps also other metals) are capable of dissolving their own oxides
                    with formation of alloys. Mercury, by doing so, becomes viscid and unfit for its
                    ordinary applications. Copper, when pure to start with, suffers considerable
                    deterioration in plasticity. But the presence of moderate proportions of cuprous
                    oxide has been found to correct the evil influence of small contaminations by
                    arsenic, antimony, lead, and other foreign metals. Most commercial coppers owe
                    their good qualities to this compensating influence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arsenic</hi> combines readily with all metals into true
                    arsenides, which latter, in general, are soluble in the metal itself. The
                    presence in a metal of even small proportions of arsenide generally leads to
                    considerable deterioration in mechanical qualities.</p>

                    for phosphorus were it not for the existence of what is called
                    “phosphorus-bronze,” an alloy of copper with phosphorus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> its own phosphide), which possesses valuable properties. According
                    to Abel, the most favourable effect is produced by from 1 to 11 per cent, of
                    phosphorus. Such an alloy can be cast like ordinary bronze, but excels the
                    latter in hardness, elasticity, toughness, and tensile strength. See <hi

                    when in a molten state are capable of dissolving at least small proportions of
                    carbon, which, in general, leads to a deterioration in metallicity, except in
                    the case of iron, which by the addition of small percentages of carbon gains in
                    elasticity and tensile strength with little loss of plasticity (see <hi

                    behaves to metals pretty much like carbon, but our knowledge of facts is
                    limited. What is known as “cast iron” is essentially an alloy of iron proper
                    with 2 to 6 per cent, of carbon and more or less of silicon (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Iron).</hi> Alloys of copper and silicon were prepared by
                    Deville in 1863. The alloy with 12 per cent, of silicon is white, hard, and
                    brittle. When diluted down to 4'8 per cent., it assumes the colour and
                    fusibility of bronze, but, unlike it, is tenacious and ductile like iron.</p>

                <p>To avoid repetition, let us state beforehand that the metals to be referred to
                    are always understood to be given in the compact (frozen) condition, and that,
                    wherever a series of metals are enumerated as being similarly attacked, the
                    degree of readiness in the action is (so far as our knowledge goes) indicated by
                    the order in which the several members are named,—the more readily changed metal
                    always standing first.</p>

                    decomposed more or less readily, with evolution of hydrogen gas and formation of
                    a basic hydrate, by (1) potassium (formation of KH0), sodium (NaHO), lithium

                    slowly attacked, with formation of relatively feebly basylous and practically
                    insoluble hydrates. Disregarding the rarer elements (as we propose to do in this
                    section), the metals not named so far may be said to be proof against the action
                    of pure water in the absence of free oxygen (air).</p>
                <p>By the conjoint action of water and air, thallium, lead, bismuth are oxidized,
                    with formation of more or less sparingly soluble hydrates (ThHO, PbO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, BiO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>), which, in the presence
                    of carbonic acid, pass into still less soluble basic carbonates.</p>
                <p>Iron, as everybody knows, when exposed to moisture and air, “rusts,” that is,
                    undergoes gradual conversion into a brown ferric hydrate, Fe <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> xH <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O; but this process never takes place in the absence of air, and it is
                    questionable whether it ever sets in in the absence of carbonic acid. What is
                    known is that iron never rusts in solutions of caustic alkalies or lime (which
                    reagents preclude the presence of free carbonic acid), while it does so readily
                    in ordinary moist air containing CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. When once
                    started the process proceeds with increasing rapidity, the ferric hydrate
                    produced acting as a carrier of oxygen; it gives up part of its oxygen to the
                    adjoining metal, being itself reduced to (perhaps) Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, which latter again absorbs oxygen from
                    the air to become ferric hydrate and so on (Kuhlmann).</p>
                <p>Copper, in the present connexion, is intermediate between iron and the following
                    group of metals.</p>
                <p>Mercury, if pure, and all the “noble” metals (silver, gold, platinum, and
                    platinum-metals), are absolutely proof against water even in the presence of
                    oxygen and carbonic acid.</p>
                <p>The metals grouped together above under 1 and 2 act on steam pretty much as they
                    do on liquid water. Of the rest, the following are readily oxidized by steam at
                    a red heat, with formation of hydrogen gas,—zinc, iron, cadmium, cobalt, nickel,
                    tin. Bismuth is similarly attacked, but slowly, at a white heat. Aluminium is
                    barely affected even at a white heat, if it is pure; the ordinary impure metal
                    is liable to be very readily oxidized.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Aqueous Sulphuric or Hydrochloric Acid,</hi> of course, readily
                    dissolves groups 1 and 2, with evolution of hydrogen and formation of chlorides
                    or sulphates. The same holds for the following group (A) :—[manganese, zinc,
                    magnesium] iron, aluminium, cobalt, nickel, cadmium. Tin dissolves readily in
                    strong hot hydrochloric acid as SnCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; aqueous
                    vitriol does not act on it appreciably in the cold; at 150° it attacks it more
                    or less quickly, according to the strength of the acid, with evolution of
                    sulphuretted hydrogen or, when the acid is stronger, of sulphurous acid gas and
                    deposition of sulphur (Calvert and Johnson). A group (B), comprising copper,
                    are, substantially, attacked only in the presence of oxygen or air. Lead, in
                    sufficiently dilute acid, or in stronger acid if not too hot, remains unchanged.
                    A group (C) may be formed of mercury, silver, gold, and platinum, which are not
                    touched by either aqueous acid in any circumstances.</p>

                    hydrogen. The most important of these are aluminium and zinc, which are
                    converted into aluminate, A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"

                    and zincate, ZnO.RHO, where R, = K or Na respectively. But of the rest the
                    majority, when treated with boiling sufficiently strong alkali, are attacked at
                    least superficially; of ordinary metals only gold, platinum, and silver are
                    perfectly proof against the reagents under consideration, and these accordingly
                    are used preferably for the construction of vessels intended for analytical
                    operations involving the use of aqueous caustic alkalies. For preparative
                    purposes iron is universally employed and works well; but it is not available
                    analytically, because a superficial oxidation of the empty part of the vessel
                    (by the water and air) cannot be prevented. According to the writer’s experience
                    basins made of pure malleable nickel are free from this drawback; they work as
                    well as platinum, and rather better than silver ones do. There is hardly a
                    single metal which holds out against the alkalies themselves when in the state
                    of fiery fusion; even platinum is most violently attacked. In chemical
                    laboratories fusions with caustic alkalies are always effected in vessels made
                    of gold or silver, these metals holding out fairly well even in the presence of
                    air. Gold is the better of the two. Iron, which stands so well against aqueous
                    alkalies, is most violently attacked by the fused reagents. Yet tons of caustic
                    soda are fused daily in chemical works in iron pots without thereby suffering
                    contamination, which seems to show that (clean) iron, like gold and silver, is
                    attacked only by the conjoint action of fused alkali and air, the influence of
                    the latter being of course minimized in large-scale operations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Oxygen or Air.—</hi> The noble metals (from silver upwards) do
                    not combine directly with oxygen given as oxygen gas (O <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>), although, like silver, they may absorb this gas largely when in the
                    fused condition, and may not be proof against ozone, O <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>. Mercury, within a certain range of temperatures situated close to its
                    boiling point, combines slowly with oxygen into the red oxide, which, however,
                    breaks up again at higher temperatures. All other metals, when heated in oxygen
                    or air, are converted, more or less readily, into stable oxides. Potassium, for
                    example, yields peroxide, K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">

                    converted into their monoxides MeO. Bismuth and antimony give (the latter very
                    readily) sesquioxide (Bi <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">

                    siliceous matter, is only oxidized at a white heat, and then very slowly, into
                    alumina, A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Tin, at

                    vapour, remain unchanged. All the rest, under these circumstances, are converted
                    into sulphides. The metals of the alkalies and alkaline earths, also magnesium,
                    burn in sulphur-vapour as they do in oxygen. Of the heavy meals, copper is the
                    one which exhibits by far the greatest avidity for sulphur, its subsulphide Cu

                    taken up in two instalments, a lower chloride being produced first, to pass
                    ultimately into a higher chloride. Iron, for instance, is converted first into
