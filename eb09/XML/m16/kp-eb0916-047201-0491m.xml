                    advice in the public concerns of the kingdom; the institution of the crown of
                    England and the institution of the privy council are coeval. At the era of the
                    Norman Conquest the king’s council, or as it is now called the privy council,
                    was composed of certain select members of the aristocracy and great officers of
                    state, specially summoned by the crown, with whom the sovereign usually advised
                    in matters of state and government. In the earlier stages of English
                    constitutional history the king’s councillors, as confidential servants of the
                    monarch, were present at every meeting of parliament in order to advise upon
                    matters judicial in the House of Lords; but in the reign of Richard II. the
                    privy council dissolved its judicial connexion with the peers and assumed an
                    independent jurisdiction of its own. It was in the reign of Henry VI. that the
                    king’s council first assumed the name of privy council, and it was also during
                    the minority of this sovereign that a select council was gradually emerging from
                    out of the larger body of the privy council, which ultimately resulted in the
                    institution of the modern cabinet. Since the Revolution of 1688, and the
                    development of the system of parliamentary government, the privy council has
                    dwindled into comparative insignificance when contrasted with its original
                    authoritative position. The power once swayed by the privy council is now
                    exercised by that unrecognized select committee of the council which we call the
                    cabinet. The practice of consulting a few confidential advisers instead of the
                    whole privy council had been resorted to by English monarchs from a very early
                    period; but the first mention of the term cabinet council in contradistinction
                    to privy council occurs in the reign of Charles I., when the burden of state
                    affairs was intrusted to the committee of state which Clarendon says was
                    enviously called the “cabinet council.” At first government by cabinet was as
                    unpopular as it was irregular. Until the formation of the first parliamentary
                    ministry by William III. the ministers of the king occupied no recognized
                    position in the House of Commons; it was indeed a moot point whether they were
                    entitled to sit at all in the lower chamber, and they were seldom of one mind in
                    the administration of matters of importance. Before the Revolution of 1688 there
                    were ministers, but no ministry in the modem sense of the word; colleague
                    schemed against colleague in the council chamber, and it was no uncommon thing
                    to see ministers opposing one another in parliament upon measures that ought to
                    have been supported by a united cabinet. As the exchange from government by
                    prerogative to government by parliament, consequent upon the Revolution of 1688,
                    developed, and the House of Commons became more and more the centre and force of
                    the state, the advantage of having ministers in the legislature to explain and
                    defend the measures and policy of the executive Government began gradually to be
                    appreciated. The public authority of the crown being only exercised in acts of
                    administration, or, in other words, through the medium of ministers, it became
                    absolutely necessary that the advisers of the sovereign, who were responsible
                    for every public act of the crown as well as for the general policy they had
                    been called upon to administer, should have seats in both Houses of Parliament.
                    The presence of ministers in the legislature was the natural consequence of the
                    substitution of government by parliament for the order of things that had
                    existed before 1688. Still nearly a century had to elapse before political
                    unanimity in the cabinet was recognized as a political maxim. From the first
                    parliamentary ministry of William III. until the rise of the second Pitt
                    divisions in the cabinet were constantly occurring, and a prime minister had
                    more to fear from the intrigues of his own colleagues than from the tactics of
                    the opposition. In 1812 an attempt was made to form a ministry consisting of men
                    of opposite political principles, who were invited to accept office, not
                    avowedly as a coalition Government, but with an offer to the Whig leaders that
                    their friends should be allowed a majority of one in the cabinet. This offer was
                    declined on the plea that to construct a cabinet on “a system of counteraction
                    was inconsistent with the prosecution of any uniform and beneficial course of
                    policy.” From that date it has been an established principle that all cabinets
                    are tobe formed on some basis of political union agreed upon by the members
                    composing the same when they accept office together. It is now also distinctly
                    understood that the members of a cabinet are jointly and severally responsible
                    for each other’s acts, and that any attempt to separate between a particular
                    minister and his colleagues in such matters is unfair and unconstitutional.</p>
                <p>The leading members of an administration constitute the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cabinet (⅛</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> ,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    who are not cabinet ministers, are the lord-lieutenant .of Ireland, the
                    vice-president of the council for education, the judge advocate general, and the
                    chief officers of the royal household. The subordinate members of an
                    administration who are never in the cabinet, and who are seldom raised to the
                    distinction of privy councillors, are the junior lords of the treasury, the
                    joint-secretaries to the treasury, the paymaster-general, the junior lords of
                    the admiralty, the parliamentary undersecretaries of state, and the law officers
                    of the crown.</p>
                <p>During the present century the power of ministers has been greatly extended, and
                    their duties more distinctly marked out. Owing to the development of the system
                    of parliamentary government, much of the authority which formerly belonged to
                    English sovereigns has been delegated to the hands of responsible ministers. As
                    now interpreted, the leading principles of the British constitution are the
                    personal irresponsibility of the sovereign, the responsibility of ministers, and
                    the inquisitorial power of parliament. At the head of affairs is the prime
                    minister, and the difference between theory and practice is curiously
                    exemplified by the post he fills. The office is full of anomalies. Like the
                    cabinet council the prime minister is unknown to the law <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n492/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0492-0473"/> and the constitution, for legally and according
                    to the fictions of the constitution no one privy councillor has as such any
                    superiority over another, yet practically the premier is the pivot on which the
                    whole administration turns. He is the medium of intercourse between the cabinet
                    and the sovereign; he has to be cognizant of all matters of real importance that
                    take place in the different departments so as to exercise a controlling
                    influence in the cabinet; he is virtually responsible for the disposal of the
                    entire patronage of the crown; he selects his colleagues, and by his resignation
                    of office dissolves the ministry. Yet, though entrusted with this power, and
                    wielding an almost absolute authority, he is in theory but the equal of the
                    colleagues he appoints and whose opposition he can silence by the threat of
                    dissolution. The prime minister is nominated by the sovereign. “I offered,” said
                    Sir Robert Peel on his resignation of office, “no opinion as to the choice of a
                    successor. That is almost the only act which is the personal act of the
                    sovereign; it is for the sovereign to determine in whom her confidence shall be
                    placed.” Yet this selection by the crown is practically limited. No prime
                    minister could carry on the government of the country for any length of time who
                    did not possess the confidence of the House of Commons; and royal favour, if it
                    were ever invidiously exercised, would ultimately have to yield to a regard for
                    the public interests. As a general rule the prime minister holds the office of
                    first lord of the treasury, either alone or in connexion with that of chancellor
                    of the exchequer. Before 1806 the premiership was occasionally held in connexion
                    with different other offices,—a secretaryship of state, the privy seal, and the
                    like,—but it is now almost invariably associated with the post of first lord of
                    the treasury. With the exception of the premier, whose duties are more general
                    than departmental, the work of the other members of the administration is
                    exemplified by the title of the offices to which they are called. The lord
                    chancellor, in addition to the jurisdiction which he exercises in his judicial
                    capacity, is prolocutor of the House of Lords by prescription, the keeper of the
                    sovereign’s conscience, the general guardian of all infants, idiots, and
                    lunatics, and to him belongs the appointment of all the justices of the peace
                    throughout the kingdom. In former times the lord chancellor was frequently prime
                    minister; the earl of Clarendon in the reign of Charles II., however, was the
                    last who occupied that position. The lord president of the council, who is
                    always a member of the Upper House, presides over the department of the privy
                    council, exercises a general superintendence over the education department, and
                    has to frame minutes of council upon subjects which do not belong to any other
                    department of state. Subordinate to his department are separate establishments
                    in relation to public health, the cattle plague, and quarantine. The post of
                    lord privy seal is one of great trust, though its duties are not very onerous,
                    since they simply consist in applying the privy seal once or twice a week to a
                    number of patents. Ever since the days of Henry VIII. the privy seal has been
                    the warrant of the legality of grants from the crown and the authority of the
                    lord chancellor for affixing the great seal. The lord privy seal is always a
                    member of the cabinet. As his official duties are light he is at liberty to
                    afford assistance to the administration in other ways, and he has often to
                    attend to matters which require the investigation of a member of the
                    Government.</p>
                <p>The secretaries of state are among the most important members of the ministry,
                    and within the present century tneir number has been increased and their duties
                    more specially consolidated. The ancient English monarchs were always attended
                    by a learned ecclesiastic, known at first as*their clerk, and afterwards as
                    secretary, who conducted the royal correspondence; but it was not until the end
                    of the reign of Queen Elizabeth that these functionaries were called secretaries
                    of state. Upon the direction of public affairs passing from the privy council to
                    the cabinet after 1688, the secretaries of state began to assume those high
                    duties which now render their office one of the most influential of an
                    administration. Until the reign of Henry VIII. there was generally only one
                    secretary of state, but at the end of his reign a second principal secretary was
                    appointed. Owing to the increase of business consequent upon the union of
                    Scotland, a third secretary, in 1708, was created, but a vacancy occurring in
                    this office in 1746 the third secretaryship was dispensed with until 1768, when
                    it was again instituted to take charge of the increasing colonial business.
                    However, in 1782 the office was again abolished, and the charge of the colonies
                    transferred to the home secretary; but owing to the war with France in 1794 a
                    third secretary was once more appointed to superintend the business of the war
                    department, and seven years later the colonial business was attached to his
                    department. In 1854 a fourth secretary of state for the exclusive charge of the
                    war department and in 1858 a fifth secretaryship for India were created. There
                    are therefore now five principal secretaries of state, four of whom, with their
                    political under secretaries, occupy seats in the House of Commons. One of these
                    secretaries of state is always a member of the House of Lords. The secretaries
                    of state are the only authorized 'channels through which the royal pleasure is
                    signified to any part of the body politic, and the counter-signature of one of
                    them is necessary to give validity to the sign manual; thus, while the personal
                    immunity of the sovereign is secured, a responsible adviser for every act is
                    provided who has to answer for whatever course the crown has pursued. The
                    secretaries of state constitute but one office, and are coordinate in rank and
                    equal in authority. Each is competent in general to execute any part of the
                    duties of the secretary of state, the division of duties being a mere matter of
                    arrangement. These duties are of the deepest importance to the welfare of the
                    nation. The home secretary controls all matters relating to the internal affairs
                    of the country: he is responsible for the preservation of the public peace and
                    for the security of life and property throughout the kingdom; he exercises
                    extensive powers over the civil and military authorities of the country, and has
                    a direct controlling Eower over the administration of justice and police in the
                    municipal oroughs, over the police in and around London, and over the county
                    constabulary; and he is especially responsible for the exercise of the royal
                    prerogative in the reprieve or pardon of convicted offenders or the commutation
                    of their sentences. The foreign secretary, as his name implies, is the official
                    organ of the crown in all communications between Great Britain and foreign
                    powers: he negotiates all treaties or alliances with foreign states, protects
                    British subjects residing abroad, and demands satisfaction for any injuries they
                    may sustain at the hands of foreigners. The secretary of state for the colonies
                    has to superintend the government of the various colonial possessions of the
                    British crown: he appoints the governors over the different dependencies of the
                    crown, and sanctions or disallows the enactments of the colonial legislatures.
                    This latter power has of late years been much curtailed owing to the
                    establishment of responsible government in most of the colonies; still it is the
                    duty of the secretary of the colonies to correspond with the colonial governors
                    and to offer such suggestions as may be expedient to assist the deliberations of
                    the colonial councils and to promote the welfare of colonial subjects. Until the
                    year 1854 the direction of military affairs was practically divided between the
                    commander-in-chief at the horse guards, the board of ordnance, the secretary at
                    war, and the secretary of state for war and the colonies. Upon the declaration
                    of hostilities, however, against Russia in 1854, the duties of war minister were
                    separated from those of colonial secretary, and a secretary of state for war
                    appointed, in whose hands the supreme and responsible authority over the whole
                    military business of the country formerly transacted by the various departments
                    was placed. The actions of the commander-in-chief are subject to the approval of
                    the secretary of state for war. The duties of the commander-in-chief embrace the
                    discipline and patronage of the army and the direct superintendence of the <hi
                    rend="italic">personnel</hi> of the army; with the exception of those duties,
                    everything connected with the management of the army in peace or war (its <hi
                    rend="italic">matériel</hi> and civil administration, &amp;c. ) remains in the
                    hands of the war minister. The subordinate position of the commander-in-chief is
                    the result of the British system of parliamentary government. The secretary of
                    state for war is the minister of the crown and not of parliament; although he is
                    responsible to parliament for the advice he may give to the sovereign, yet it is
                    in the execution of the royal authority and prerogative that he is superior to
                    the officer commanding in chief. The principle of the constitutional army is
                    that command, preferment, and honour come to it from the crown; but the general
                    principle is equally undisputed that for all pecuniary remuneration it is made
                    to depend on pariiament. By the constitution the crown exercises its authority
                    only through responsible advisers, and lienee it follows that the secretary of
                    state for war is supreme over any authority in the army, including the officer
                    commanding in chief. From 1784 to 1858 the territories belonging to the British
                    crown in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0493-0474"/> the East Indies were governed by a department of
                    state called the board of control in conjunction with the court of directors of
                    the East India Company. In 1858 this double government was abolished, and the
                    entire administration of the British empire in India was assumed by the crown,
                    and all the powers formerly exercised by the East India Company and the board of
                    control were transferred to a fifth principal secretary of state. The secretary
                    for India is responsible for everything connected with the Indian Government at
                    home and abroad; the whole of the Indian revenues are at his disposal, and the
                    governor-general of India is subject to his control. To assist him in his
                    labours, and to act as a check upon the exercise of his otherwise arbitrary
                    administrative powers, this secretary has the aid of a council of state for
                    India, consisting of fifteen persons, of which, however, he is the president.
                    The members of the council for India cannot sit in the House of Commons.</p>
                <p>The duties of the other members of the ministry can be briefly dismissed. The
                    chancellor of the exchequer at present exercises all the powers which formerly
                    devolved upon the treasury board; he lias the entire control of all matters
                    relating to the receipt and expenditure of public money; he frames the annual
                    estimates of the sums required to defray the expenditure of government in every
                    branch of the public service; and it is his duty to lay before the country the
                    annual statement of the estimated expenses of government and of the ways and
                    means by which it is proposed to defray those charges, including the imposition
                    or remission of taxes. The first lord of the admiralty (since the abolition of
                    the office of lord high admiral), with the aid of the junior lords who are
                    called the lords of the admiralty, conducts the administration of the entire
                    naval force of the empire both at home and abroad, and is responsible to
                    parliament for all his political proceedings; as the admiralty is but an
                    executive board, it is, however, subject on certain matters —the number of men
                    required for the naval service, the distribution of the fleet, the strength of
                    foreign squadrons, &amp;c. —to the control of the cabinet. The president of the
                    board of trade takes cognizance of all matters relating to trade and commerce,
                    and has to protect the mercantile interests of the United Kingdom; until 1864 it
                    was not necessary for the president to have a seat in the cabinet, but since
                    that date he has always been a cabinet minister in order to insure for his
                    advice on commercial matters a due consideration; in 1867 the office of
                    vice-president of the board was abolished. The chancellor of the duchy of
                    Lancaster exercises jurisdiction over all matters of equity relating to lands
                    held of the crown in right of the duchy of Lancaster; the office is, however,
                    practically a sinecure, and is usually filled by a leading statesman λvhose time
                    is at the service of the Government for the consideration of such important
                    questions as do not come within the province of other departments. In 1832 the
                    public works and buildings of Great Britain were for the first time placed under
                    the control of a responsible minister of the crown, and were assigned to the
                    charge of the commissioners of woods and forests; but in 1851 the department of
                    public works was separated from the woods and forests and erected into a board
                    under the name of the office of her majesty’s works and public buildings. The
                    first commissioner of works is the head of the board, and in his hands is placed
                    the custody of the royal palaces and parks and of all public buildings not
                    specially assigned to the care of other departments. Since the establishment of
                    his office the first commissioner has frequently had a seat in the cabinet. The
                    duties of the postmaster-general, of the president of the local government
                    board, and of the minor members of the administration are so obvious from the
                    titles of the offices they hold as not to call for any special mention.</p>
                <p>The prime minister is responsible for the distribution of the chief offices of
                    government between the two Houses of Parliament. Owing to the development of the
                    House of Commons within the present century it is now considered advisable that
                    a larger proportion of cabinet ministers should have seats in that chamber than
                    was formerly the case. In the first cabinet of George III. only one of its
                    members was in the House of Commons and thirteen in the House of Lords. In 1783
                    Mr Pitt was the sole cabinet minister in the Commons. In 1801 four cabinet
                    ministers were in the Commons and five in the Lords. In 1804 Mr Pitt and Lord
                    Castlereagh were, out of a cabinet of twelve, the only ministers in the Commons.
                    In the Grenville ministry (“All the Talents”), of a cabinet of eleven, seven
                    were in the Lords and four in the Commons. In 1809, of Mr Perceval’s cabinet,
                    six were peers and four commoners. In 1812, of Lord Liverpool’s cabinet, ten
                    were peers and only two commoners. In 1818, out of a cabinet of fourteen, six
                    were commoners; and in 1822, out of a cabinet of fifteen, nine were peers. Since
                    the Reform Act of 1832, however, the leading members of Government have been
                    more equally apportioned between the two Houses.</p>
