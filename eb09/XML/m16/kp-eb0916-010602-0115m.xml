                    immortal essence, into successive bodily forms, either human or animal. This
                    doctrine, famous in antiquity, and one of the characteristic doctrines of
                    Pythagoras, appears to have originated in Egypt. This indeed is affirmed by
                    Herodotus (ii. 123) “The Egyptians are, moreover, the first who propounded the
                    theory that the human soul is immortal, and that when the body of any one
                    perishes it enters into some other creature that may be born ready to receive
                    it, and that, when it has gone the round of all created forms on land, in water,
                    and in air, then it once more enters a human body born for it; and this cycle of
                    existence for the soul takes place in three thousand years.”</p>
                <p>Plato, in a well-known passage of the <hi rend="italic">Ph&amp;drus,</hi> adapts,
                    as was his wont, the Pythagorean doctrine to his myth or allegory about the soul
                    of the philosopher. That soul, he says, though it may have suffered a fall in
                    its attempt to contemplate celestial things, still is not condemned, in its
                    first entrance into another form, to any bestial existence, but, according to
                    its attainments, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to the progress which it has made
                    in its aspiration for celestial verities, it passes, in nine distinct grades,
                    into the body of some one destined to become a philosopher, a poet, a king, a
                    general, a seer, &amp;c.; or, if very inferior, it will animate a sophist or an
                    autocrat (τύραννος). Plato extends the cycle of existence to ten thousand years,

                    the time of the Trojan War, and had successively inhabited other human bodies,

                    creatures had its origin in the notion that they had been inhabited by souls
                    which might some day claim these bodies for their own. We cannot suppose that
                    Plato or the later Greeks really believed in the transmigration of souls, though
                    there are many allusions to it, generally of a somewhat playful character. Thus
                    Menander, in the play called <hi rend="italic">The Inspired Woman</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Frag. 222,
                    Meineke.</p></note> (Θeoφopoυ∕Λmj), supposes some god to say to an old man,
                    Crato, “When you die, you will have a second existence; choose what creature you
                    would like to be, dog, sheep, goat, horse, or man.” To which he replies, “Make
                    me anything rather than a man, for he is the only creature that prospers by
                    injustice.”</p>
                <p>Absurd and fantastic as such a doctrine as metempsychosis appears at first sight
                    to be, it was in reality a logical deduction from primitive ideas about the
                    nature of the soul. It is necessary to explain these ideas (which have important
                    bearings on other questions) in order to show that metempsychosis was almost a
                    necessary corollary to the belief that the soul was the vital or animating
                    principle,—that the one distinction between organic and inorganic was the
                    existence in the former of a <hi rend="italic">ψυχή.</hi></p>
                <p>The difference between a dead body and a living body —or rather, one principal
                    difference—was that the living animal breathed; and it was observed that, as
                    soon as the breath left the body, not only did warmth and motion cease, but the
                    body began to decay. Life, therefore, was breath, an opinion tacitly expressed
                    by the Greek and Roman vocabulary, <hi rend="italic">animus, anima
                    (avcμoς),</hi><hi rend="italic">ψυχή,</hi><hi rend="italic">τrvcvμa,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">spiritus.</hi> But breath is air, and air is eternal and
                    imperishable in its very nature. Therefore the “soul,” or portion of air which
                    gave animation to the body, did not perish at the dissolution of the body, but
                    it was returned to the element of which it was composed, and out of which it
                    came. It followed that, from the countless millions of “souls” emancipated from
                    bodies in all time, and still flitting about invisibly in space, the air must
                    literally swarm with souls,—a doctrine taught by Pythagoras.<note

                    which had animated some former body. For, although the soul was air, and
                    returned to its kindred element, it was supposed to retain a peculiar character
                    in intelligence <hi rend="italic">(φpovησui),</hi> remembrance of the past, and
                    knowledge and experience gained in some former existence. Any creature which
                    first breathed might or might not inhale this or that soul, just as a net thrown
                    into the water may catch this or that fish, or no fish at all. But if no “soul”
                    was inhaled the creature was believed for that reason to die; and the different
                    degrees of intelligence observed in different men and animals led to the notion
                    that there must have been a difference in the souls that first animated them.
                    Even the belief that the soul, especially near the time of dissolution from the
                    body, could foretell future events was based on the notion of intelligence and
                    consciousness resulting from experiences of the past.<note anchored="true"

                <p>As all the science of modern times cannot say precisely what life is, nor how it
                    first came upon this earth, it is not wonderful that so obvious, though wholly
                    erroneous, an explanation should have presented itself to primitive man when
                    first he began to inquire into the causes of things. The extension of life, by
                    the same term <hi rend="italic">ψυχή,</hi> to plants and apparently
                    non-breathing things, which, however, had birth, growth, and death, was a
                    development of a philosophic age, and we are not surprised to find Aristotle
                    recognizing one form of life as <hi rend="italic">vegetable,

                    while metempsychosis is derided or forgotten, is in reality, perhaps, a less
                    excusable superstition.</p>
                <p>The Romans inherited the doctrine of metempsychosis from Ennius, the poet of
                    Calabria, who must have been familiar with the Greek teachings which had
                    descended to his times from the cities of Magna Graecia. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Annals,</hi> or Roman history in verse, Ennius told how he had
                    seen Homer in a dream, who had assured him that the same soul which had animated
                    both the poets had once belonged to a peacock, a story that might seem to
                    indicate Indian traditions. The <hi rend="italic">Pavo</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Theories suggesting element-worship naturally led to the notion that air and

                    as being but a portion of it, was in itself divine, and therefore immortal. We
                    thus see that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, whether attained by a
                    sound or a vicious course of reasoning, was an inevitable conclusion for early
                    thinkers. Pantheism taught that all the universe was pervaded by a divine mind,
                    and Virgil cites the opinion of some, that the intelligence of bees was due to a
                    portion of this universal mind residing in them, a view closely allied to the
                    doctrine of metempsychosis.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
