                    famous Austrian general, was born at the castle of Montecuculi in Modena, in
                    1608. At the age of nineteen he began his career in a regiment of infantry under
                    his uncle, Ernest, count of Montecuculi; and during the Thirty Years’ War he
                    found many opportunities of displaying his military genius in the imperial
                    service. In 1631, having been severely wounded, he was made prisoner while
                    retreating after the battle of Breitenfeld. Soon after his release he was
                    promoted to the rank of major; and he distinguished himself at the siege of
                    Nördlingen in 1634, and at the storming of Kaiserslautern in 1635. As colonel,
                    he took part in much hard fighting in Pomerania and in Bohemia; and in 1639 at
                    Melnik, where he tried to prevent the Swedes from crossing the Elbe, he was
                    taken prisoner a second time, being compelled on this occasion to spend more
                    than two years in Stettin. The time was not lost, for he devoted it to a
                    thorough study of military science. In 1642 he was again at work in the imperial
                    army, and for eminent services in Silesia he was made a major-general of
                    cavalry. After a brief visit to Italy, during which he entered the service of
                    the duke of Modena, he returned to Germany, and became councillor <pb break="no"

                    supported the archduke Leopold in a campaign against Prince Rakoczy of
                    Transylvania, resisted Marshal Turenne in the Rhine country, and fought with the
                    Swedes in Silesia and Bohemia. The victory at Triebel in Silesia, in 1647, was
                    due chiefly to him, and he was rewarded by being raised to the rank of general
                    of cavalry. After the peace of Westphalia in 1648 he occupied himself for some
                    time with the work of the council of war; and in 1654 he undertook diplomatic
                    missions to Christina, queen of Sweden, and to Cromwell. In 1657 he commanded an
                    expedition against Prince Rakoczy and the Swedes, who had attacked the king of
                    Poland, and Rakoczy was soon forced to withdraw from the Swedish alliance, and
                    to accept terms of peace. As field-marshal he was sent to the aid of Denmark
                    against Sweden; and this war he conducted so successfully that the peace of
                    Oliva was concluded in 1660. In 1663 he resigned the command of an army with
                    which, for about three years, he had been opposing the Turks; but in 1664 he was
                    again made commander-in-chief, and in the same year he defeated the Turks so
                    decisively near the abbey of St Gotthard that they concluded an armistice for
                    twenty years. He had to deal with more formidable enemies in 1672, when, the
                    emperor and the imperial diet having resolved to uphold the Dutch against Louis
                    XIV., Montecuculi, who had been serving as president of the council of war and
                    director of artillery, was appointed commander of the imperial forces. He took
                    Bonn, and, although closely watched by Turenne, contrived to effect a junction
                    with the prince of Orange, thereby overthrowing all the calculations of the
                    French. When the elector of Brandenburg received the supreme command in 1674
                    Montecuculi withdrew from the army; but in 1675, being restored to his former
                    position, he resumed operations against Turenne. The two commanders manoeuvred
                    so brilliantly that for about four months neither could do the other much
                    injury; but, Turenne having been killed by a cannon-ball on the 27 th of July
                    1675, Montecuculi pursued the French into Alsace, and besieged Hagenau and
                    Zabern, retiring from Alsace only when he found himself confronted by Condé.
                    Montecuculi’s last achievement in war was the siege of Philippsburg. During the
                    rest of his life he was president of the council of war. In 1679 the emperor
                    Leopold made him a prince of the empire, and shortly afterwards he received from
                    the king of Naples the dukedom of Melfi. Having accompanied the emperor to Linz
                    during the pestilence, he was injured by the fall of a beam when entering the
                    castle, and died at Linz on the 16th of October 1680.</p>

                    works. The <hi rend="italic">Opere,</hi><hi rend="italic">complete di
