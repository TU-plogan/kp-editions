                    in the Jewish Midrash, particularly as we find it in Josephus and Philo.<note

                    verb ΠB*D to express the fact that he was drawn out of the water, but because
                    the Egyptian word for water was μ∙ω, and <hi rend="smallcaps">wtjç</hi> applies

                    She took care to have him trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians (Acts vii.
                    22) and in that of the Greeks, Assyrians, and Chaldaeans as well (Philo, ii.
                    84). To his great intellectual endowments corresponded his personal beauty, of
                    which Josephus speaks in extravagant terms <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> ii. 9,
                    6-7). It was on account of this beauty that, when on one occasion, as a young
                    man, he led an Egyptian army against Meroe, the Ethiopian princess Tharbis
                    opened the gates of the capital to him in order to make him her husband <hi

                <p>For reasons explained in Exod. ii. 11 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> Moses left the
                    land of Pharaoh and came to Midian to the Kenite priest Jethro (also called
                    Hobab Ben Raguel and Raguel), whose daughter Zipporah he married, becoming by
                    her the father of two sons, Gershom and Eliezer (Exod. ii. 21 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.;</hi> xviii. 2 <hi rend="italic">βq.).</hi> During his stay in Midian he
                    received, at the foot of Sinai (Horeb), the divine revelation at the burning
                    bush whereby he was called to become the liberator of Israel from Egyptian
                    bondage. With much reluctance he at last accepted this vocation, and, already
                    expected by his brother Aaron and the elders, returned to his people.<note

                    Ι'Sj"∣S W∏l, to mark the substitution,—compare the euphemism in Isa. vii.

                    interpreter, being himself no orator, but a man of counsel and action, and
                    appeared before Pharaoh to demand of the king in Jehovah’s name permission for
                    the people to go with flocks and herds into the wilderness to celebrate there a
                    festival (the spring festival of the Passover) in honour of their God. Jehovah
                    gave emphasis to the demand by great signs and wonders,—the plagues of Egypt,
                    which have their explanation for the most part in evils to which Egypt is
                    periodically liable, but are treated by Israelite tradition as the weapons of
                    Jehovah in his ever-intensifying conflict with the king and the gods of Egypt.
                    At length, by the slaying of the first-born, the stubbornness of Pharaoh was
                    broken, so that he consented to, and even urged, the departure of the Hebrews.
                    By and by, however, he changed his mind, and, setting out in pursuit of the
                    Hebrews, overtook them at the Red Sea; but Jehovah fought for them, and
                    annihilated Pharaoh’s chariots and all his host. In order to present themselves
                    in proper festal array at the celebration for the sake of which they were going
                    into the wilderness, the Hebrew women had borrowed dresses and ornaments from
                    those of Egypt; the Egyptians could now only blame themselves and their hostile
                    conduct if those articles were not returned.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>By the miracle wrought at the Red Sea Moses was pointed out to the Hebrews as the
                    man of God, to whom accordingly they now committed the task of caring for their
                    outward life as well as their spiritual guidance. He led them first to Sinai,
                    where the law was revealed and the worship in connexion with the ark of the
                    covenant instituted. When he had communed face to face with the Godhead for
                    forty days on the holy mountain, the skin of his face shone so that he had to
                    wear a veil (hence the horns, properly rays, on his forehead). Driven from Sinai
                    in consequence of their worship of the golden calf, the Israelites removed to
                    Kadesh with the view of entériner</p>
                <p>Palestine. But this plan was defeated by their unbelief and faintheartedness,
                    and, as a punishment, they were compelled to sojourn forty years in the
                    wilderness of Kadesh (Paran, Sin). It was here and now that the people went to
                    school with Moses; here, at the sanctuary of the camp, he declared law and
                    judgment; and here, according to the view of the oldest tradition, the
                    foundations of the Torah were laid (Exod. xviii.). The region of Kadesh was also
                    the scene of almost all the miracles and other circumstances we read about
                    Moses. Here he showed himself to be at once the father and mother of the people,
                    their judge, priest, and seer. It was not till towards the very close of his
                    life that he led the Israelites from Kadesh into northern Moab, which he wrested
                    from the Amorite king, Sihon of Heshbon. Here he died on Mount Pisgah or Nebo,
                    after taking leave of the people in the great legislative address of
                    Deuteronomy. According to Deuteronomy xxxiv. 6, he “was buried in a valley in
                    the land of Moab, . . . but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.”<note

                    leadership, Moses had named Joshua ben Nun, but the real heirs to his position
                    and influence were the priests at the sanctuary of the ark of the covenant. Of
                    his personal character the Bible tells us nothing (for IJV in Numb. xii. 3 means
                    only “heavily burdened”); but later Judaism is all the more at liberty on this
                    account to expatiate upon it (see especially Josephus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ant.,</hi> iv. 8, 49).</p>
                <p>Such in brief <hi rend="italic">résumé</hi> are the accounts of Moses given in
                    the Bible<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Outside of the
                    Hexateuch, however, he is almost never mentioned.</p></note> and the Midrash. In
                    addition to these we have also the statements of Hellenistic writers, preserved
                    chiefly in the <hi rend="italic">Contra</hi><hi rend="italic">Apionem</hi> of
                    Josephus. These are all of an Egyptian complexion, and probably embody no
                    ancient and independent tradition, but, in all that relates to the Hebrews,
                    where they do not rest upon pure conjecture, merely go back upon obscure rumours
                    of Jewish origin and dress them up after the manner of the Midrash—only in a
                    contrary sense, with hatred and not with love—and then seek to fit them as well
                    as may be into the Egyptian history and chronology as known from other sources.
                    The great number of new proper names of places and persons which occur in the
                    writings of Manetho and his like cannot be urged against this view, for the
                    Midrash also is full of them. The very name Osarsiph, given to Moses himself,
                    moreover, suggests a suspicion of dependence on the Asaphsuph, “mixed multitude”
                    of Numb. xi. 4 (comp. Exod. xii. 38); what is said in these places is known to
                    have played a great part in the rise of the idle Egyptian tales about the origin
                    of the Jews and of their lawgiver.</p>
