                    (for which the Linnaean term <hi rend="smallcaps">Metamorphosis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> had formerly been employed), now usually covers the
                    entire science of organic form, and will be employed in this more comprehensive
                    sense in the present article.</p>
                <p>§ 1. <hi rend="italic">Historical Outline.—</hi> If we disregard such vague
                    likenesses as those expressed in the popular classifications of plants by size
                    into herbs, shrubs, and trees, or of terrestrial animals by habit into beasts
                    and creeping things, the history of morphology commences with Aristotle. Founder
                    of comparative anatomy and taxonomy, he established eight great divisions (to
                    which are appended certain minor groups)— <hi rend="italic">Viviparous
                    Quadrupeds, Birds, Oviparous Quadrupeds and Apoda, Fishes, Malakia,
                    Malacostraca, Entoma,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ostracodermata—</hi>
                    distinguishing the first four groups as <hi rend="italic">Enaima</hi> (“with
                    blood”) from the remaining four as <hi rend="italic">Anaima</hi> (“bloodless”).
                    In these two divisions we recognize the Vertebrata and Invertebrata of Lamarck,
                    while the eight groups are identical with the Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fishes,
                    the Cephalopods, Crustaceans, other Articulates, and Testaceans of recent
                    zoology. Far, too, from committing the mistake often attributed to him of
                    reckoning Bats as Birds, or Cetaceans as Fishes, he discerned the true
                    affinities of both, and erected the latter into a special γ∈vos beside the
                    Viviparous Quadrupeds, far more on account of their absence of limbs than of
                    their aquatic habit. Not only is his method inductive, and, as in modern
                    systems, his groups natural, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> founded on the
                    aggregate of known characters, but he foreshadows such generalizations as those
                    of the correlation of organs, and of the progress of development from a general
                    to a special form, long afterwards established by Cuvier and Von Baer
                    respectively. In the correspondence he suggests between the scales of Fishes and
                    the feathers of Birds, or in that hinted at between the fins of Fishes and the
                    limbs of Quadrupeds, the idea of homology too is nascent; and from the
                    compilation of his disciple Nicolaus of Damascus, who regards leaves as
                    imperfectly-developed fruits, he seems almost to have anticipated the idea of
                    the metamorphosis of plants. In short, we find a knowledge of structural facts
                    and a comparative freedom from the errors induced by physiological resemblance,
                    of which his successors such as Theophrastus and Pliny, generally mere
                    classifiers by habit, show little trace, and which the moderns have but slowly
                    regained. Little indeed can be recorded until the 13th century, when the
                    reappearance of Aristotle’s works gave a new impulse to the study of organic
                    nature. Of the works of this period that of Albertus Magnus is far the most
                    important; but they are all no more than revivals of Aristotle, marking the
                    reappearance of scientific method and the reawakening of interest in and
                    sympathy with nature. Meanwhile leech and apothecary, alchemist and witch, were
                    accumulating considerable knowledge of plants, which, after the invention of
                    printing, became collected and extended in the descriptive and well-illustrated
                    folios of Gesner and his successors, Fuchs, Lobel, and others, as well as by the
                    establishment of botanic gardens and scientific academies, while, as Sachs
                    expresses it, “in the sharpest contrast to the naive empiricism of the German
                    fathers of botany came their Italian contemporary Caesalpinus, as the thinker of
                    the vegetable world.” Both made systematic efforts,—the Germans vaguely seeking
                    for natural affinities in mere similarities of habit, the Italian with no
                    inconsiderable success striving towards an intellectual basis of classification.
                    Monographs on groups of plants and animals frequently appeared, those of Belon
                    on Birds and Rondelet on Fishes being among the earliest; and in the former of
                    these (1555) we find a comparison of the <pb break="no"

                    as nearly as possible bone for bone,—an idea which, despite the contemporaneous
                    renaissance of human anatomy initiated by Vesalius, disappeared for centuries,
                    unappreciated save by the surgeon Ambroise Paré. Palissy, like Leonardo before
                    him, discerned the true nature of fossils; and such flashes of morphological
                    insight continued to appear from time to time during the 17th century. Thus,
                    Joachim Jung recognized “the distinction between root and stem, the difference
                    between leaves and foliaceous branches, the transition from the ordinary leaves
                    to the <hi rend="italic">folia</hi><hi rend="italic">floris,”</hi> and Harvey
                    anticipated the generalizations of modern embryology by bis researches on
                    development and his theory of epigenesis.</p>
                <p>The encyclopaedic period of which Gesner is the highest representative was
                    continued by Aldrovandi, Jonston, and others in the 17th century, but, aided
                    powerfully by the Baconian movement, then profoundly influencing all scientific
                    minds, it developed rapidly into one of genuinely systematic aim. At this stage
                    of progress by far the most important part was taken by John Ray, whose
                    classificatory labours both among plants and animals were crowned with
                    marvellous success. He first definitely expelled the fabulous monsters and
                    prodigies of which the encyclopaedists had faithfully handed on the tradition
                    from mediaeval times, and, like his predecessor Morison, classifying in a truly
                    modern spirit by anatomical characters, he succeeded, particularly among plants,
                    in distinguishing many natural groups, for which his very terms sometimes
                    survive, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons,
                    Umbelliferae and Leguminosae. The true precursor of Linnaeus, he introduced the
                    idea of <hi rend="italic">species</hi> in natural history, afterwards to become
                    so rigid, and reformed the practice of definition and terminology. Of the many
                    works which followed up Ray’s systematic and monographic labours, though often,
                    like those of Tournefort and Rivinus, Réaumur and Klein, of great importance,
                    none can be even named until we come to those of his great successor Linnaeus,
                    whose extraordinary grasp of logical method and unparalleled lucidity of thought
                    and expression enabled him to reform and reorganize the whole labours of his
                    predecessors into a compact and definite “systema naturae.” The very genius of
                    order, he established modern taxonomy (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Biology),</hi>
                    not only by the introduction of the binomial nomenclature and the renovation of
                    descriptive terminology and method, but by the subordination of the
                    species—henceforth clearly defined—under the successive higher categories of
                    genus, order, and class, so finally reconciling the analytic and synthetic
                    tendencies of his predecessors. Although the classification of plants by the
                    number of their essential organs (which vastly advanced not only the cultivation
                    of botany but the knowledge of the flora of the globe, and by which he is
                    popularly remembered) is highly artificial, it must be remembered that this
                    artificiality is after all only a question of degree, and that he not only
                    distinctly recognized its provisional character but collected and extended those
                    fragments of the natural system with which Jussieu soon afterwards commenced to
                    build. His classification of animals, too, was largely natural, and, though on
                    the whole he unfortunately lent his authority to maintain “that disastrous
                    philosophic and scientific aberration” inherited from the alchemists through the
                    last encyclopaedist of Gesner’s school—the notion of three kingdoms of nature
                    —he at least at one time discerned the fundamental unity of animals and
                    vegetables, and united them in opposition to the non-living world as <hi
                    rend="italic">Organisata.</hi> At the same time he was still far more a
                    scholastic naturalist than a modern investigator, and his works represent little
                    more than the full completion of the ancient era, and in the hands of fanatical
                    followers served often to retard the commencement of the modern one. So, too,
                    his excessive systematic and descriptive precision, united as it was with
                    comparative inattention to other than superficial characters, established a
                    tendency, even yet not extinct, to rest contented with mere method and
                    nomenclature instead of aiming at complete morphological knowledge.</p>
                <p>While the artificial system was at the zenith of its fame and usefulness, Bernard
                    de Jussieu was arranging his garden on the lines afforded by the fragmentary
                    natural system of Linnaeus. His ideas were elaborated by his nephew and
                    successor Antoine de Jussieu, who for the first time published diagnoses of the
                    natural orders, so giving the system its modern character. Its subsequent
                    elaboration and definite establishment are due mainly to the labours of Pyrame
                    de Candolle and Robert Brown. The former concentrated his own long life and that
                    of his son upon a new “systema naturae,” the colossal <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prodromus systematis naturalis</hi> (20 vols., 1818-1873), in which 80,000
                    species were described and arranged. Meanwhile the penetrative genius of Brown
                    enabled him to unravel such structural complexities as those of Conifers and
                    Cycads, Orchids and Proteaceae, thus demonstrating the possibility of
                    ascertaining the systematic position of even the most highly modified floral
                    types. Both Candolle and Brown were thus no mere systematists, but genuine
                    morphologists of the modern school. The former, as we shall afterwards see,
                    established the theory of floral symmetry on grounds of pure comparative
                    anatomy, and distinguished with greater success than hitherto between
                    fundamental unity of structural type and mere superficial similarity of
                    physiological adaptation. The latter (Humboldt’s “facile princeps botanicorum
                    ”), using the same ideas with even keener insight, made many memorable
                    anatomical researches, such as those on the structure of the ovule and the seed,
                    and indeed by his demonstration of the affinities of the gymnosperms almost
                    anticipated the discoveries of Hofmeister, who stands pre-eminent among his
                    modern successors on account of his elucidation of the secret of phanerogamic
                    reproduction.</p>
                <p>The labours of Bernard and Antoine de Jussieu initiated too a vast parallel
                    advance in zoology, the joint memoir on the classification of mammals with which
                    Cuvier and Geoffroy St-Hilaire almost commenced their career receiving its
                    dominant impulse from the “genera” of Antoine. Cuvier’s works correspond in
                    zoology to those of the whole period from the Jussieus to Brown, and epitomize
                    the results of that line of advance. Although in some respects preceded by
                    Haller and Hunter, who compared, though mainly with physiological aim, the same
                    parts in different organisms, and much more distinctly by Vicq d’Azyr, the only
                    real comparative anatomist of the 18th century, he truly opens the era of
                    detailed anatomical research united with exact comparison and clear
                    generalization. The <hi rend="italic">Règne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal</hi>
                    (1817) and the theory of types (vertebrate, molluscan, articulate, and radiate)
                    are the results of this union of analysis and synthesis (although he himself,
                    exasperated by the aberrations of the Naturphilosophie, was accustomed to
                    proclaim the importance of detailed empiricism alone), and mark the
                    reconstitution of taxonomy on a new basis, henceforth to be no longer a matter
                    of superficial description and nomenclature but a complete expression of
                    structural resemblances and differences. More even than Linnaeus he is the
                    founder of a great school, whose names and labours are imperishable. In Germany,
                    Bojanus, Meckel, Von Siebold, and the illustrious Johannes Müller, with his many
                    living pupils, have carried on the work; in France, too, a succession of
                    brilliant anatomists, such as De Quatrefages, Milne-Edwards, and
                    Lacaze-Duthiers, are his intellectual heirs; and in England he has been
                    admirably represented by Owen.</p>

                <p>The histological movement inaugurated by Bichat will be subsequently discussed;
                    the rise of embryology, how- &lt;ever, may be briefly noted, especially since it
                    supplied the most obvious deficiency of the Cuvierian school. Here the principal
                    figure is Von Baer, who established independently the four types of Cuvier on
                    developmental grounds, so for the first time applying embryology as the
                    touchstone of anatomical classifications, besides establishing his famous law of
                    differentiation from a general towards a special form.</p>
                <p>It is now necessary to return to Linnaeus, whose more speculative writings
                    contain, though encumbered by fantastic hypotheses, the idea of floral
                    metamorphosis (“Principium florum et foliorum idem est,” &amp;c.). About the
                    same time, and quite independently, C. F. Wolff, the embryologist, stated the
                    same theory with greater clearness, for the first time distinctly reducing the
                    plant to an axis bearing appendages—the vegetative leaves—which become
                    metamorphosed into bud-scales or floral parts through diminution of vegetative
                    force. Thirty years later the same view was again independently developed by
                    Goethe in his now well-known pamphlet <hi rend="italic">(Versuch</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">die Metamorphose</hi><hi rend="italic">der Pflanzen zu
                    erklären,</hi> Gotha, 1790). In this brilliant essay the doctrine of the
                    fundamental unity of floral and foliar parts is clearly enunciated, and
                    supported by arguments from anatomy, development, and teratology. All the
                    •organs of a plant are thus modifications of one fundamental organ—the leaf—and
                    all plants are in like manner to be viewed as modifications of a common type—the
                    <hi rend="italic">Urpflanze.</hi> The controversy as to the merits and import-
                    -ance of this essay, and of Goethe’s morphological work in .general, can
                    scarcely be entered upon here. That Goethe discerned and proclaimed, and that
                    more clearly than any of his predecessors or contemporaries, the fundamental
                    idea of all morphology—the unity which underlies the multifarious varieties of
                    organic form—and that he systematically applied this idea to the interpretation
                    of the most important, most complex, and most varied animal and vegetable
                    -structures, is unquestionable. The difficulties arise when we .seek to estimate
                    the importance of his works in the chain of progress, and when we inquire
                    whether, as some historians hold, his “urpflanze” was a mere ideal archetype,
                    bringing forth as its fruit the innumerable metaphysical abstractions •of the
                    Naturphilosophie, and leading his countrymen, to their fall, into all the
                    extravagances of that system; or whether, as Haeckel maintains, it represented a
                    concrete an- •cestral form, so anticipating the view of modern evolutionists.
                    That to him Schelling was largely indebted for the foundation upon which he
                    erected his philosophic edifice, as also that Goethe largely shared the same
                    ideas, is unquestion- .able; but it must be remembered that he lived and made
                    progress for forty years after the publication of this essay, that he was
                    familiar with the whole scientific movement, ÷and warmly sympathized with the
                    evolutionary views of Lamarck and Geoffroy St-Hilaire; it is not therefore to be
                    wondered at that his writings should furnish evidence in favour of each and
                    every interpretation of them. His Other morphological labours must not be
                    forgotten. Independently of Vicq d’Azyr, he discovered the human premaxillary
                    bone; independently of Oken, he proposed the vertebral theory of the skull; and
                    before Savigny, he dis- ∙cerned that the jaws of insects were the limbs of the
                    head.</p>
                <p>In 1813 A. P. de Candolle published his <hi rend="italic">Théorie Élémentaire de
                    la Botanique,</hi> which he developed into the classic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Organographie</hi><hi rend="italic">Végétale</hi> (1827). Although at first
                    unacquainted with Goethe’s essay, and not clearly discerning the homology of
                    leaves and floral parts, he established his theory of symmetry, reducing all
                    flowers to “symmetrical” groupings of appendages on an axis and accounting for
                    their various forms by cohesion and adhesion, by arrested or excessive
                    development. The next great advance was the investigation by Schimper and Braun

                    foliar and floral organs— thus further demonstrating their essential unity.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">morphology</hi> was first introduced by Goethe in
                    1817, in a subsequent essay <hi rend="italic">(Zur Naturwissenschaft überhaupt,
                    besonders zur Morphologie).</hi> It did not come into use in botany until its
                    popularization by Auguste de St-Hilaire in his admirable <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morphologie</hi><hi rend="italic">Végétale</hi> (1841), and in zoology until
                    later, although De Blainville, who also first employed the term <hi
                    rend="italic">type,</hi> had treated the external forms of animals under
                    “morphologie.” Though the Naturphilosophie of Schelling and its countless
                    modifications by his followers, its mystic theories of “polarization” and the
                    like, its apparatus of assumption and abstraction, hypothesis and metaphor,
                    cannot here be discussed, its undoubted services must not be forgotten, since it
                    not only stimulated innumerable reflective minds to the earnest study of natural
                    science, but, by its incessant proclamation of the unity of nature and the free
                    use of Platonic archetypes, gave a most powerful impulse to the study of
                    comparative anatomy, and nobly vindicated the claims of philosophic synthesis
                    over those of merely analytic empiricism. Among its many adherents, some are of
                    more distinctly theological type, others metaphysical, others mystical or
                    poetic, others, again, more especially scientific; but its most typical and
                    picturesque figure is Lorenz Oken, who epitomizes alike the best and the worst
                    features of the school, and among whose innumerable pseudo-morphological dreams
                    there occasionally occurred suggestions of the greatest fruitfulness,—notably,
                    for instance, the independent statement of the vertebral theory of the
                    skull.</p>
                <p>Although Lamarck shared in this movement, his great work (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophie Zoologique,</hi> 1809), being aetiological rather than
                    morphological, scarcely claims discussion here. By far the most distinguished
                    anatomist of the transcendental school is Geoffroy St-Hilaire, who being
                    comparatively free from the extravagances of Oken, and uniting a depth of
                    morphological insight scarcely inferior to that of Goethe with greater knowledge
                    of facts and far wider influence and reputation in the scientific world (which
                    affected to sneer at the poet as necessarily a mere amateur), had enormously
                    greater influence on the progress of science than either. He started from the
                    same studies of anatomical detail as Cuvier, but, profoundly influenced by
                    Buffon’s view of unity of plan and by the evolutionary doctrines of Lamarck, he
                    rapidly diverged into new lines, and again reached that idea of serial homology
                    of which we have so frequently noted the independent origin. His greatest work,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophie Anatomique</hi> (1818-1823), contains his
                    principal doctrines. These are—(1) the theory of unity of organic composition,
                    identical in spirit with that of Goethe; (2) the theory of analogues, according
                    to which the same parts, differing only in form and in degree of development,
                    should occur in all animals; (3) the “principe des connexions,” by which similar
                    parts occur everywhere in similar relative positions; and (4) the “principe du
                    balancement des organes,” upon which he founded the study of teratology, and
                    according to which the high development of one organ is allied to diminution of
                    another. The advance in morphological theory is here obvious; unfortunately,
                    however, in eager pursuit of often deceptive homologies, he wandered into the
                    transcendentalism of the Naturphilosophie, and seems utterly to have failed to
                    appreciate either the type theory of Cuvier or the discoveries of Von Baer. He
                    earnestly defended Buffon’s and Bonnet’s earlier view of unity of plan in
                    nature; and the controversy reached its climax in 1830, when he maintained the
                    unity of structure in Cephalopods and Vertebrates against Cuvier before the
                    Academy of Sciences. On the point of fact he was of course utterly defeated; the
                    type theory was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n871/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0871-0840"/> thenceforward fully accepted and the
                    Naturphilosophie received its deathblow, while a “second empiric period” of
                    exact anatomical and embryological research seemed for ever to replace it. Such
                    was the popular view; only a few, like the aged Goethe, whose last literary
                    effort was a masterly critique of the controversy, discerned that the very
                    reverse interpretation was the deeper and essential one, that a veritable
                    “scientific revolution” was in progress, and that the supremacy of homological
                    and synthetic over descriptive and analytic studies was thenceforward assured.
                    The irreconcilable feud between the two leaders really involved a reconciliation
                    for their followers; theories of homological anatomy had thenceforward to be
                    strictly subjected to anatomical and embryological verification, while anatomy
                    and embryology acquired a homological aim. This union of the solid matter and
                    rigorous method of Cuvier with the generalizing spirit and philosophic aims of
                    Geoffroy is well illustrated in the works of Owen; and, in short, the so-called
                    Cuvierian school is in reality thenceforward also Geoffroyan.</p>
                <p>The further evolution of the idea of homology is sketched below (§ 7), while the
                    extent and rapidity of the subsequent progress of the knowledge of all the
                    structural aspects of plants and animals alike make an historical survey
                    impossible up to the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi>
                    (1859); however, no further <hi rend="italic">qualitative</hi> advance was
                    possible, since, as Sachs has best pointed out, morphology necessarily contains,
                    under the Linnaean dogma of the constancy of species, the same two inconsistent
                    and irreconcilable lines of thought which we saw represented by Caesalpinus and
                    the early German botanists respectively,—on one side the want of strictly
                    scientific classification, and on the other the vaguely-felt existence of a
                    natural relationship. Strict classification of forms supposed constant excludes
                    in fact any <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> relationship. The type theory, the
                    theory of unity of organic composition, and the like, are susceptible indeed of
                    two explanations—they may be regarded as either expressing a creative plan, or
                    taken as purely Platonic and archetypal ideas. Both are tenable on theological
                    and metaphysical grounds respectively, but the fact must not be disguised that
                    of this unity of type no explanation in the least degree scientific, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in terms of the phenomena of the natural world, does or
                    can exist. The needful solution was effected by Darwin. The “urpflanze” of
                    Goethe, the types of Cuvier, and the like, at once became intelligible as
                    schematic representations of ancestral organisms, which, in various and varying
                    environments, have undergone differentiation into the vast multitude of existing
                    forms. All the enigmas of structure become resolved; “representative” and
                    “aberrant,” “progressive” and “degraded,” “synthetic” and “isolated,”
                    “persistent” and “prophetic” types no longer baffle comprehension; conformity to
                    type represented by differentiated or rudimentary organs in one organism is no
                    longer contradicted by their entire disappearance in its near allies, while
                    systematist and morphologist become related simply as specialist and
                    generalizer, all through this escape from the Linnaean dogma of the fixity of
                    species. The phenomena of individual development receive interpretation in terms
                    of ancestral history; and embryology thus becomes divided into ontogeny and
                    phylogeny, the latter, too, coming into intimate relation with palaeontology,
                    while classification seeks henceforth the reconstruction of the genealogical
                    tree. All these results were clearly developed in the most important work of the
                    new period, Haeckel’s <hi rend="italic">Generelle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Morphologie</hi> (1866), while the valuable contemporaneous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principles of Biology</hi> of Herbert Spencer also gave special attention to
                    the relation of morphology to physiology.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>§ 2. <hi rend="italic">Results.—</hi> Though the preceding is but a meagre
                    outline of the rise and progress of the science, no corresponding sketch of its
                    results can be here attempted. A description of the refined applications of the
                    doctrine of floral metamorphosis, an inquiry into the morphology of the
                    Cryptogams, or an account of such beautiful homologies as those presented by the
                    Arthropods or the Echinoderms is alike impossible; least of all can we consider
                    the splendid simplification of the supremely complex problem of vertebrate
                    structure by the elaboration of a new theory of the skull, and by such luminous
                    discoveries as those of the segmental organs, or of the origin and homologies of
                    the spinal and cranial nerves. For these organological conceptions the reader
                    must study such articles as those on <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibia, Birds,
                    Hydrozoa,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >&amp;c.,</hi> and such works as those of Huxley, Gegenbaur and Haeckel, Balfour
                    and Parker, Payer, Eichler, or Asa Gray, and (provided with the needful
                    bibliographical equipment afforded by the various “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Jahresberichte</hi>” and the kindred English publications) must indeed also
                    plunge into the current literature of the science. And there too must be sought
                    the innumerable attempts at taxonomic synthesis which such organological
                    progress is constantly originating (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Kingdom,
                    Biology,</hi> vol. iii. p. 690 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Vegetable Kingdom).</hi> Embryological generalizations, such as
                    Haeckel’s “gastraea theory,” Lankester’s rival “planula theory,” or the
                    ingenious “coelome theory” of Hertwig, have been recently thoroughly criticized
                    in Balfour’s <hi rend="italic">Embryology.</hi> The present article will be
                    confined to a brief discussion of a few main problems, commencing with the cell
                    theory and the problem of organic individuality —these being selected partly
                    because of their special illustrativeness and intrinsic importance, partly
                    because they have somewhat less recently been summarized.</p>
                <p>§ 3. <hi rend="italic">Histology—Cell Theory.—</hi> Although the application of
                    the simple microscope to the minute structure of plants and animals had been in
                    progress since the end of the 17th century, the rise of modern histology really
                    dates from the <hi rend="italic">Anatomie Générale</hi> (1801) of Bichat, which
                    analyses the organism into a series of simple tissues with definite structural
                    characters. This new impulse, together with the improvement of optical
                    appliances, led to much further research. “Fibres” and “globules,” “laminae” and
                    “nuclei,” were described, and even “cells” by Mirbel in 1806, and in 1835
                    Johannes Miiller pointed out the existence of cells resembling those of plants
                    in the vertebrate notochord. The cellular and nucleated structure of epidermis
                    and other tissues was soon demonstrated, while Robert Brown discovered the
                    nucleus of the vegetable cell. In 1838 Schleiden referred all vegetable tissues
                    to the cellular type, and traced back the plant embryo to a single nucleated
                    cell, while in 1839 Schwann boldly extended this conception of plant structure
                    and development to the animal world, and so fully constituted the “cell
                    theory.”</p>
                <p>Schwann’s cells were essentially nucleated vesicles with fluid contents which
                    originated in an intracellular substance; but this view was soon abandoned.
                    Dujardin had discovered that the bodies of Foraminifera were composed of a
                    viscous granular contractile <hi rend="italic">sarcode,</hi> and Von Mohl
                    described independently in similar terms the contents of the vegetable cell as
                    <hi rend="italic">protoplasm.</hi> This was identified by Max Schultze as
                    Dujardin’s sarcode, the newer name surviving; and this living matter, and not
                    the membrane, he showed to be the essential constituent of the cell, since which
                    his amended definition of the cell as a unit-mass of nucleated protoplasm lias
                    been generally accepted. Prevost and Dumas had noticed the segmentation of the
                    ovum into masses as early as 1824, and these were naturally identified as cells
                    immediately after the publication of Schwann’s work. In 1846 Kölliker showed
                    that all tissues arise from these segmentation masses, and that the
                    multiplication of animal and vegetable cells takes place by a continuation of
                    the same process,—that of transverse division already observed in the
                    Protozoa.</p>
                <p>These points gained, the attention of histologists was withdrawn for a
                    considerable time from the scrutiny of the minute structure of the cell itself
                    to be concentrated on the modes of origin of these unit-masses, and their
                    subsequent differentiation and aggregation into tissues and organs. The minute
                    structure and histogenesis of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n872/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0872-0841"/> plants, as well as of at least the higher
                    animals, have been studied with much and ever-increasing accuracy of detail.
                    (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy, Histology, Embryology.)</hi> Both vegetable
                    and animal tissues have been simply classified both according to their adult
                    forms and according to the embryonic layers from which they respectively arise.
                    This scrutiny of plant and animal structure over and above the special
                    generalizations of the botanist and the zoologist has afforded much result to
                    general histology. The improvement of technical methods has of late years
                    largely aided the progress of discovery. A return from the study of the
                    cellaggregate to that of the cell has commenced, and the question of
                    eeS-structure may be said to be again paramount in histology. The process of
                    transverse division has of late been much elucidated, and, although its complex
                    details cannot here be entered upon, the result has been to establish a minute
                    and thorough correspondence in cases so widely dissimilar as pollen-grains from
                    a flower-bud, the epidermis of a tadpole, or the cells of a tumour—a result
                    which obviously enhances the morphological completeness of the cell theory.
                    Minor modes of cell-multiplication also are not without their morphological
                    interest. Gemmation, familiar in the yeast plant, occurs in other low and simple
                    organisms, and may probably l&gt;e identified with the formation of polar
                    vesicles in ova as a modification of transverse division. Schleiden had supposed
                    all new cells to originate within pre-existing cells, and this process, known as
                    free-cell-formation, may really be observed in various plant and animal tissues.
                    The protoplasm groups itself round new nuclei, the new cells being in fact
                    formed much as Schwann had in his turn supposed; but these nuclei have
                    repeatedly been shown to arise from segmentation of the original nucleus, and
                    thus this process too seems a mere modification of the general one of transverse
                    division. Conjugation, too—that coalescence of two similar cells which may be
                    observed in many Algae, Fungi, and Protozoa—is to be considered as the
                    undifferentiated form of that fertilization which occurs in higher animals and
                    plants, the two apparently similar masses having become respectively
                    differentiated into ovum and spermatozoon, or into egg-cell and antherozoid. An
                    indefinite number of amoeboid cells sometimes flow together into a single
                    mass,—a phenomenon regarded by some as multiple-conjugation, or perhaps more
                    probably as an almost mechanical coalescence of exhausted cells, from which
                    conjugation proper and finally fertilization may indeed have originated. The
                    amoeboid cells of higher animals similarly unite when drawn, and this formation
                    of <hi rend="italic">plasmodia,</hi> as these are termed, seems to be a
                    deep-seated property of the amoeboid cell. Similarly, too, the process of
                    rejuvenescence which occurs in many of the lowest plants and animals, such as
                    Protococcus and Amoeba, where the protoplasm passes from a resting and encysted
                    to a naked and mobile stage, has many analogues not only among the Protista but
                    even in the tissues of higher animals, while the phases which the lowest
                    organisms more or less exhibit—the encysted, the ciliated, the amoeboid, and the
                    plasmo-dial—may be regarded as the fundamental forms of a “life-cycle,” fully
                    represented indeed only in such extremely low organisms as Protomyxa and
                    Myxomycètes, yet nowhere completely suppressed. The very highest plants and
                    animals may thus be considered as aggregates of more or less differentiated and
                    variously aιτanged encysted, amoeboid, and ciliated cells, while their
                    development and subsequent changes, their variations normal and pathological, in
                    reality exhibit phases more or less distinct of the ancestral lifecycle.</p>
                <p>The examination of the precise modes of cell-division, particularly in the hands
                    of botanists (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Biology,</hi> and summary in Sachs’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Vorlesungen über Pflanzen</hi><hi rend="italic">Physiologie,</hi>
                    1883), are also constantly throwing the most interesting light upon the
                    structure of the adult organism. Thus then, in our own day as in those of Bichat
                    or Schwann, the labours of the histologist, when inspired by higher aims than
                    that of the mere multiplication of descriptive detail, are of supreme
                    morphological importance, and result in the demonstration of a unity of organic
                    structure deeper even than any which we owe to Linnaeus or Cuvier, Goethe or
                    Geoffroy.</p>
                <p>§ 4. <hi rend="italic">Individuality.—</hi> Probably no subject in the whole
                    range of biology has been more extensively discussed than that of the nature of
                    organic individuality. The history of the controversy is of interest, since
                    besides leading up to solid results it serves, perhaps better than any other
                    case, to illustrate the slow emergence of the natural sciences from the
                    influence of scholastic thought. Starting from the obvious unity and
                    indivisibleness of Man and other higher animals, and adopting some definition
                    such as that of Mirbel (exceptionally unmetaphysical, however), <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ‘ Tout être organise, complet dans ses parties,
                    distinct et séparé des autres êtres, est un individu,” it was attempted times
                    without number to discover the same conception elsewhere in nature, or rather to
                    impose it upon all other beings, plants and animals alike. The results of
                    different inquirers were of course utterly discrepant. It seemed easy and
                    natural to identify a tree or herb corresponding to the individual animal, yet
                    difficulties at once arose. Many apparently distinct plants may arise from a
                    common root, or a single plant may be decomposed into branches, twigs, shoots,
                    buds, or even leaves, all often capable of separate existence. These, again, are
                    decomposable into tissues and cells, the cells into nucleus, &amp;c., and
                    ultimately into protoplasmic molecules, these finally into atoms,—the inquiry
                    thus passing outside organic nature altogether and meeting the old dispute as to
                    the ultimate divisibility of matter. In short, as Haeckel remarks, scarcely any
                    part of the plant can be named which has not been taken by some one for the
                    individual. It is necessary, therefore, briefly to notice some of the principal
                    works on the subject, and these may conveniently be taken in descending
                    order.</p>
                <p>While Cassini practically agreed with Mirbel in attempting to regard separate
                    plants as individuals, the widest interpretation of the individual is that of
                    Gallesio (1816), who proposed to regard as an individual the entire product of a
                    single seed, alike whether this developed into a uni-axial plant extended
                    continuously like a Banyan, or multiplied asexually by natural or artificial
                    means like the Weeping-willow or the Canadian Pondweed, of each of which, on
                    this view, there is only a single individual in Britain, happily
                    discontinuous.</p>
                <p>At once the oldest and most frequently maintained view is that which regards the
                    bud or shoot consisting of a single axis with appendages as the
                    plant-individual, of which the tree represents a colony, like a branched hydroid
                    Polyp. This conception, often attributed to Aristotle, but apparently without
                    foundation, appears distinctly in the writings of Hippocrates and
                    Theophrastus,—the latter saying, “The bud grows on the tree like a plant in the
                    ground.” The aphorism of Linnaeus, ‘ ‘ Gemmae totidem herbae,” is well known;
                    and in this view C. F. Wolff and Humboldt concurred, while Erasmus Darwin
                    supported it by an appeal to the facts of anatomy and development. The most
                    influential advocate of the bud theory during the first half of the present
                    century was, however, Du Petit-Thouars, who, although starting much as usual
                    with a “principe unique d’existence,” supported his theory on extensive though
                    largely incorrect observations on stem structure and growth. For him the tree is
                    a colony of <hi rend="italic">phytons,</hi> each being a bud with its axillant
                    leaf and fraction of the stem and root. Passing over numerous minor authors, we
                    dome to the central work of Alex. Braun (1853), in which, as Sachs has clearly
                    pointed out, the illegitimate combination of Naturphilosophie with inductive
                    morphology reaches its extreme. He reviews, however, all preceding theories,
                    admits the difficulty of fixing upon any as final, since the plant,
                    physiologically considered, is rather a <hi rend="italic">dividuum</hi> than an
                    <hi rend="italic">individuum,</hi> and proposes as a compromise, or indeed as a
                    partial cutting of the knot, the adoption of the shoot as the morphological
                    individual, comparable to an animal, especially because, unlike the cell, leaf,
                    &amp;c., it includes all the representative characters of the species. Darwin
                    and Spencer on the whole also accept the bud or shoot as at any rate the most
                    definite individual.</p>
                <p>The theory of metamorphosis naturally led Goethe, Oken, and others to regard the
                    leaf as the individual, while Johannes Müller, Steenstrup, and others adopted
                    the same view on various physiological grounds. Gaudichaud elaborated a theory
                    intermediate between this view and that of Du Petit-Thouars, according to which
                    the plant was built up of individuals, each consisting of a leaf with its
                    subjacent internode of stem, which was regarded as the leaf-base, and this was
                    supported by Edward Forbes and others, while the nominally converse view—that of
                    the leaf as a mere outward expansion of the stem-segment—was proposed by
                    Hochstetter.</p>
                <p>Though sundry attempts at identifying various tissues, such as the fibro-vascular
                    bundles, as the constituent individuals may be passed over, those associated
                    with the cell theory are of great importance. Schwann decided in favour of the
                    cell and regarded the plant as a cell-community, in which the separate elements
                    were like the bees of a swarm,—a view virtually concurred in in all essential
                    respects by Schleiden, Virchow, and other founders of the cell theory. Yet,
                    although the structure and functions of the plant are ultimately and exclusively
                    cellular, it is impossible to ignore the fact that, save in the very lowest
                    organisms, these are subordinated and differentiated into larger aggregates, and
                    form virtually but the bricks of a building, and hence the later theories
                    outlined above. Of attempts to find the individual in the nucleus or the
                    protoplasm granules it is of course unnecessary to speak further.</p>
                <p>So far the theories of absolute individuality. The conception of relative
                    individuality is well traced by Fisch upwards from the more or less vague
                    suggestions in the writings of Goethe, Roeper, and the elder De Candolle to its
                    clear expression in Alphonse de Candolle and Schleiden, both of whom take the
                    cell, the shoot, and the multi-axial plant as forming three successive and
                    subordinated categories. Nägeli too recognized not only the necessity of
                    establishing such a series (cell, organ, bud, leafy axis, multi-axial plant) but
                    the distinction between morphological and physiological individualities
                    afterwards enunciated by Haeckel.</p>
                <p>Passing over the difficulties which arise even among the Protozoa (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Foraminifera),</hi> we find that a similar controversy (fully
                    chronicled in Haeckel’s <hi rend="italic">Kalkschwämme)</hi> has raged over the
                    individuality of Sponges. While the older observers were content to regard each
                    sponge-mass as an individual, aviewin which Lieberkuhn <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n873/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0873-0842"/> -and other monographers substantially concurred,
                    the application of the microscope led to the view suggested by James Clark, and
                    still stoutly supported by Saville Kent, that the Sponge is a city of -amoeboid
                    or infusorian individuals. Carter looked upon the separate -ampullaceous sacs as
                    the true individuals, while Schmidt, defining the individual by the possession
                    of a single exhalent aperture, distinguishes Sponges into solitary and social.
                    Later, however, he terms them <hi rend="italic">Zoa impersonalia.</hi></p>
                <p>For the higher animals the problem, though perhaps really even more difficult, is
                    less prominent. As Haeckel points out, the earlier discussions and even the
                    comparatively late essay of Johannes Miiller take an almost purely psychological
                    or at least a physiological point of view; and the morphological aspect of the
                    inquiry only came forward when the study of much lower forms, such as Cestoid
                    Worms (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Platyhelminthes)</hi> or Siphonophores (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hydrozoa),</hi> had raised the difficulties with which
                    botanists had so long been familiar. With the rapid progress of embryology, too,
                    arose new problems; and in 1842 Steenstrup introduced the conception of an ‘ ‘
                    alternation of generations’ ’ as a mode of origin of distinct individuals by two
                    methods, for him fundamentally similar, the sexual from impregnated females and
                    the asexual from unimpregnated “nurses,”— <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> view
                    adopted by Edward Forbes and many other naturalists, but keenly criticized by
                    Carpenter and Huxley. In Leuckart’s remarkable essay on polymorphism (1853) the
                    Siphonophora were analysed into colonies, and their varied organs shown to be
                    morphologically equivalent, while the alternate generations of Steenstrup were
                    reduced to a case of polymorphism in development. Leuckart further partly
                    distinguished individuals of different orders, as well as between morphological
                    and physiological individuals.</p>
                <p>In 1852 Huxley proposed the view which he still substantially maintains (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Biology).</hi> Starting from such an undoubted homology as that
                    of the egg-producing process of Hydra with a free-swimming Medusoid, he points
                    out that the title of individual, if applied to the latter, must logically be
                    due to the former also, and avoids this confusion between organ and individual
                    by defining the individual animal, as Gallesio had done the plant, as the entire
                    product of an impregnated ovum,—the swarm of Aphides or free Medusae which in
                    this way might belong to a single individual being termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zooids.</hi></p>
                <p>In Carus’s <hi rend="italic">System of Animal Morphology</hi> (1853) another
                    theory was propounded, but the problem then seems to have fallen into abeyance
                    until 1865, when it formed the subject of a prolonged and fruitful discussion in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Principles of Biology.</hi> Adopting the cell (defined as
                    an aggregate of the lowest order, itself formed of physiological units) as the
                    morphological unit, Spencer points out that these may either exist
                    independently, or gradually exhibit unions into aggregates of the second order,
                    like the lower Algae, of which the individuality may be more or less pronounced.
                    The union of such secondary aggregates or compound units into individuals of a
                    yet higher order is then traced through such intermediate forms as are
                    represented by the higher seaweeds or the Liverworts, from the thallus of which
                    the axes and appendages of Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons are ingeniously
                    derived. The shoot of a floweringplant is thus an aggregate of the third order;
                    it branches into an Aggregate of the fourth or higher order, and finally as a
                    tree “acquires a degree of composition too complex to be any longer defined.”
                    Proceeding to animals, the same method is applied. The Protozoa are aggregates
                    of the first order. These, like plants, exhibit transitions, of which
                    Radiolarians, Foraminifera, and Sponges are taken as examples, to such definite
                    compound wholes as Hydra; and such secondary aggregates multiply by gemmation
                    into permanent aggregates of the third order, which may exhibit .all degrees of
                    integration up to that of the Siphonophora, where the individualities of the
                    Polyps are almost lost in that of the Aggregate form. The whole series of
                    articulated animals are next interpreted as more or less integrated aggregates
                    of the third order, Of which the lower Annelids are the less developed forms,
                    the Arthropods the more highly integrated and individualized. Molluscs and
                    Vertebrates are regarded as aggregates of the second order.</p>
                <p>In 1866 appeared the latest morphological classic, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Generelle Morphologie</hi> of Haeckel. Here pure morphology is distinguished
                    into two sub-sciences,—the first purely structural, <hi rend="italic"
                    >tectology,</hi> which regards the organism as composed of organic individuals
                    of different orders; the second essentially stereometric, <hi rend="italic"
                    >promorphology.</hi> To tectology, defined as the science of organic
                    individuality, a large section of the work is devoted. Dismissing the theory of
                    absolute individuality as a metaphysical figment, and starting from the view of
                    Schleiden, De Candolle, and Nägeli of several successive categories of relative
                    individuals, he distinguishes more clearly than heretofore the physiological
                    individual (or <hi rend="italic">bion),</hi> characterized by definiteness and
                    independence of function, from the morphological individual (or <hi
                    rend="italic">morphon),</hi> characterized similarly by definiteness of form; of
                    the latter he establishes six categories, as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Plastides</hi> (cytodes and cells), or elementary
                    organisms.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Organs</hi> (cell-stocks or cell-fusions), simple or
                    nomoplastic organs (tissues), or heteroplastic organs. Organ-systems,
                    organapparatuses.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Antimeres</hi> (opposite or symmetrical or homotypic parts),
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> rays of radiate animals, “halves of bilaterally
                    symmetrical animals.”</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Metameres</hi> (successive or homodynamous parts), <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> stemsegments of Phanerogams, segments or zoonites of
                    Annelids or Vertebrates.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Personae,</hi> shoots or buds of plants, polyps of
                    Coelenterates, &amp;c., “individuals” in the narrowest sense among the higher
                    animals.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Corms</hi> (stocks or colonies), <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> trees, chains of Salpae, polypstocks, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In his subsequent monograph on calcareous Sponges, and in a final paper, he
                    somewhat modifies these categories by substituting one category of extreme
                    comprehensiveness, that of the <hi rend="italic">idorgan,</hi> in place of the
                    three separate orders of organs, antimeres, and metameres. The idorgan (of
                    course clearly distinguished from the physiological organ or biorgan) is finally
                    defined as a morphological unit consisting of two or more plastids, which does
                    not possess the positive character of the person or stock. These are
                    distinguished into <hi rend="italic">homoplasts</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >homo-organs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">alloplasts</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    and plastidfusions, the latter idomeres, antimeres, and metameres. The former
                    definition of the term antimere, as denoting at once each separate ray of a
                    radiate, or the right and left halves of a bilaterally symmetrical animal, is
                    corrected by terming each ray a <hi rend="italic">paramere,</hi> and its
                    symmetrical halves the antimeres. Thus an ordinary Medusoid has four parameres
                    and eight antimeres, a Star-fish five and ten. The conception of the persona is
                    largely modified, not only by withdrawing the comparison of the animal with the
                    vegetable shoot and by omitting the antimere and metamere as necessary
                    constituents, but by taking the central embryonic form of all the Metazoa—the
                    gastrula (fig. 1) and its assumed ancestral representative, the gastraea—as the
                    simplest and oldest form of persona. The different morphological stages to which
                    it may attain are classified into three series: (1) Monaxonial<note

                    metameres, as in Sponges, or lowest Hydroids; (2) Stauraxonial <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> inarticulate persons with antimeres, but without
                    metameres, <hi rend="italic">e,g.,</hi> Coral, Medusa, Turbellarian, Trematode,
                    Bry-ozoon; (3) Stauraxonial articulate persons with antimeres and metameres, <hi
                    rend="italic">e. g.,</hi> Annelids, Arthropods, Vertebrates.</p>
                <p>The colonies of Protozoa are mere idor-gans. True corms, composed of united
                    personae, occur only among Sponges, Hydroids, Siphonophores, Corals, Bryozoa,
                    Tunicates, and Echinoderms, of which the apparent parameres are regarded as
                    highly centralized personae of a radially-budded worm colony; and these can be
                    classified according to the morphological rank of their constituent personae.
                    They usually arise by gemmation from a single persona, yet in Sponges and Corals
                    occasionally by fusion of several originally distinct persons or corms. The
                    theory of successive subordinate orders of individuality being thus not only
                    derived from historical criticism of previous theories but brought into
                    conformity with the actual facts of development and descent,—various groups of
                    organisms being referred to their several categories,—the remaining problem of
                    tectology, that of the relation of the morphological to the physiological
                    individuality, is finally discussed. Of the latter, three categories are
                    proposed(1) the “actual bion or complete physiological individual,” this being
                    the completely developed organic form which has reached the highest grade of
                    morphological individuality proper to it as a representative of, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> its species; (2) the “virtual bion or potential
                    physiological individual,” including any incompletely developed form of the
                    former from the ovum upwards; and (3) the “partial bion or apparent
                    physiological individual,” such fragments of the actual or virtual bion as may
                    possess temporary independence without reproducing the species—this latter
                    category having, however, inferior importance.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Haeckel’s theory, indeed in its earlier form, has been adopted by Gegenbaur and
                    other morphologists, also in its later form by Jäger, who, however, rejects the
                    category of idorgan on the ground of the general morphological principle that
                    every natural body which carries on any chemical changes with its environment
                    becomes differentiated into more or less concentric layers; but the subject,
                    especially as far as animals are concerned, is again recently discussed in a
                    large work by Perrier. Starting from the cell or plastid, he terms a permanent
                    colony a <hi rend="italic">méride,</hi> and these may remain isolated like
                    Sagitta or Rotifer, or may multiply by gemmation to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0874-0843"/> form higher aggregates which he terms <hi
                    rend="italic">zoides.</hi> Such zoides may be irregular, radiate, or linear
                    aggregates, of which the two former classes especial ly are termed <hi
                    rend="italic">dèmes.</hi> The organ—Haeckel’s idorgan— is excluded, since
                    tissues and organs result from division of labour in the anatomical elements of
                    the mérides, and so have only a secondary individuality, “carefully to be
                    distinguished from the individuality of those parts whose direct grouping has
                    formed the organism, and which live still, or have lived, isolated from one
                    another.” Perrier further points out that undifferentiated colonies are sessile,
                    as Sponges and Corals, while a free state of existence is associated with the
                    concentration and integration of the colony into an individual of a higher
                    order.</p>
                <p>So far the various theories of the subject; detailed criticism is impossible, but
                    some synthesis and reconciliation must be attempted. Starting from the cell as
                    the morphological unit, we find these forming homogeneous aggregates in some
                    Protozoa and in the early development of the ovum. But integration into a whole,
                    not merely aggregation into a mass, is essential to the idea of individuality;
                    the earliest secondary unit, therefore, is the gastrula or méride. This stage is
                    permanently represented by an unbranched Hydra or Sponge or by a Planarian.
                    These secondary units may, however, form aggregates either irregular as in most
                    Sponges, indefinitely branched as in the Hydroids and Actinozoa, or linear as in
                    such Planarians as Catenula. Such aggregations, colonies, or demes, not being
                    aggregated, do not fully reach individuality of the third order. This is
                    attained, however, for the branched series by such forms as Siphonophores among
                    Hydrozoa, or Kenilla or Pennatula among Actinozoa; for linear aggregates again
                    by the higher Worms, and still more fully by Arthropods and Vertebrates.
                    Aggregates of a yet higher order may occur, though rarely. A longitudinally
                    dividing Nais or laterally branched Syllis are obviously aggregates of these
                    tertiary units, which, on Haeckel's view, become integrated in the Echinoderm,
                    which would thus reach a complete individuality of the fourth order. A chain of
                    Salpae or a colony of Pyrosoma exhibits an approximation to the same rank, which
                    is more nearly obtained by a radiate group of Botryllus around their central
                    cloaca, while the entire colony of such an Ascidian would represent the
                    individual of the fifth order in its incipient and unintegrated state,—these and
                    the preceding intermediate forms being, of course, readily intelligible, and
                    indeed, as Spencer has shown, inevitable on the theory of evolution.</p>
                <p>The exclusion of tissues and organs from rank in this series is thus seen to
                    necessarily follow. Ectoderm and endoderm cannot exist alone; they and the
                    organs into which they differentiate arise merely, as Jager expresses it, from
                    that concentric lamination, or, with Perrier, from that polymorphism of the
                    members of the colony, which is associated with organic and social existence.
                    The idea of the antimere is omitted, as being essentially a promorphological
                    conception (for a Medusoid or a Star-fish, though of widely distinct order of
                    individuality, are equally so divisible); that of the metamere is convenient to
                    denote the secondary units of a linear tertiary individual; the term persona,
                    however, seems unlikely to survive, not only on account of its inseparable
                    psychological connotations, but because it has been somewhat vaguely applied
                    alike to aggregates of the second and third order; and the term colony, corm, or
                    deme may indifferently be applied to those aggregates of primary, secondary,
                    tertiary, or quaternary order which are not, however, integrated into a whole,
                    and do not reach the full individuality of the next higher order. The term zooid
                    is also objectionable as involving the idea of individualized organs, a view
                    natural while the medusoid gonophores of a Hydrozoon were looked at. as evolved
                    of its homologue in Hydra, whereas the latter is really a degenerate form of the
                    former. Passing to the vegetable world, here as before the cell is the unit of
                    the first order, while aggregates representing almost every stage in the
                    insensible evolution of a secondary unit are far more abundant than among
                    animals. Complete unity of the second order can hardly be allowed to the
                    thallus, which Spencer proposes to compound and integrate into tertiary
                    aggregates—the higher plants; as in animals the embryological method is
                    preferable, both as avoiding gratuitous hypothesis and as leading to direct
                    results. Such a unit is clearly presented by the embryo of higher plants in
                    which the cell-aggregate is at once differentiated into parts and integrated
                    into a whole. Such an embryo possesses axis and appendages as when fully
                    developed (fig. 2). The latter, however, being as organs mere lateral expansions
                    of the concentric layers into which the plant embryo, like the animal, is
                    differentiated, and so neither stages of evolution nor capable of separate
                    existence, are not entitled to individual rank. The embryo, the bud, shoot, or
                    uni-axial plant, all thus belong to the second order of individuality, like the
                    Hydroid they resemble. Like the lower Coelenterates, too, aggregates of such
                    axes are formed by branching out from their low degree of integration. Such
                    colonies can hardly be termed individuals of the third, much less of higher
                    order, at least without somewhat abandoning that unity of treatment of plants
                    and animals without which philosophical biology disappears. Individuality of the
                    second order is most fully reached by the flower,—the most highly differentiated
                    and integrated form of axes and appendages. Such a simple inflorescence as a
                    raceme or umbel approximates to unity of the third order, to which acomposite
                    flower-head must be admitted to have attained, while a compound inflorescence is
                    on the way to a yet higher stage.</p>
                <p>If, as seems probable, a nomenclature be indispensable for clear expression, it
                    may be simply arranged in conformity with this view. Starting from the unit of
                    the first order, the plastid or <hi rend="italic">monad,</hi> and terming any
                    undifferentiated aggregate a <hi rend="italic">deme,</hi> we have a <hi

                    individuality terminates being a <hi rend="italic">tetrad-deme.</hi> The
                    separate living form, whether monad, dyad, triad, or tetrad, requires also some

                    ultimately be found most appropriate, since such usage is most in harmony with
                    its inevitable physiological and psychological connotations, while the
                    genealogical individual of Gallesio and Huxley, common also to all the
                    categories, may be designated with Haeckel the <hi rend="italic"

                    just as the crystallographer constructs an ideally perfect mathematical form

                    succeeded in showing, by a combination of measurement and mathematical analysis,
                    that the curved surface of any turbinated or discoid shell might be considered
                    as generated by the revolution, about the axis of the shell, of a curve, which
                    continually varied its dimensions according to the law of the logarithmic
                    spiral. For Goodsir this logarithmic spiral, now carved on his tomb, seemed a
                    fundamental expression of organic curvature and the dawn of a new epoch in
                    natural science—that of the mathematical investigation of organic form—and his
                    own elaborate measurements of the body, its organs, and even its component cells
                    seemed to yield, now the triangle, and again the tetrahedron, as the fundamental
                    form. But such supposed results, savouring more of the Naturphilosophie than of
                    sober mathematics, could only serve to discourage further inquiry and interest
                    in that direction. Thus we find that even the best treatises on botany and
                    zoology abandon the subject, satisfied with merely contrasting the simple
                    geometrical ground-forms of crystals with the highly curved and hopelessly
                    complicated lines and surfaces of the organism.</p>
                <p>But there are other considerations which lead up to a mathematical conception of
                    organic form, those namely of symmetry and regularity. These, however, are
                    usually but little developed, botanists since Schleiden contenting themselves
                    with throwing organisms into three groups—first, absolute or regular; second,
                    regular and radiate; third, symmetrical bilaterally or zygomorphic —the last
                    being capable of division into two halves only in a single plane, the second in
                    two or more planes, the first in none at all. Burmeister, and more fully Bronn,
                    introduced the fundamental improvement of defining the mathematical forms they
                    sought not by the surfaces but by axes and their poles; and Haeckel has
                    developed the subject with an elaborateness of detail and nomenclature which
                    seems unfortunately to have impeded its study and acceptance, but of which the

                <p>(δ) Polyhedra, with a definite number of like axes.</p>
                <p>Of these a considerable number occur in nature, for example, many Radiolarians
                    (fig. 3), pollen-grains, &amp;c., and they are again classifiable by the number
                    and regularity of their faces.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pkotaxonia,</hi> where all the parts are arranged round
                    a main axis, and of these we distinguish—</p>
                <p>1. Λ∕onααmzα,with not more than one definite axis. Here are distinguished (a)
                    those with similar poles, spheroid (Coccodiscus) and cylinder (Pyrosoma) and
                    (&amp;) those with dissimilar poles, cone (Conulina).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Stauraxonia,</hi> where, besides the main axes, a definite
                    number of secondary axes are placed at right angles, and the stereometric
                    ground-form becomes a pyramid. Here, again, may be distinguished (a) those with
                    poles similar, <hi rend="italic">Stauraxonia homopola,</hi> where the
                    stereometric form is the double pyramid (fig. 4), and (δ) those with poles
                    dissimilar, <hi rend="italic">Stauraxonia heteropola,</hi> where the
                    stereometric form is the single pyramid, and where we distinguish a basal,
                    usually oral, pole from an apical, aboral, or anal pole. The bases of these may
                    be either regular or irregular polygons, and thus a new classification into <hi
                    rend="italic">Homostaura</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Heterostaura</hi> naturally
                    arises.</p>
                <p>The simpler group, the Homostaura, may have either an even or an odd number of
                    sides, and thus among the Homostaura we have even-sided and odd-sided, single
                    and double pyramids. In those Homostaura with an even number of sides, such as
                    Medusae, the radial and inter-radial axes have similar poles; but in the series
                    with an odd number of sides, like most Echinoderms, each of the transverse axes
                    is half radial and half semi-radial (fig. 5). Of the group of regular double
                    pyramids the twelve-sided pollen-grain of Passiflora (fig. 4) may be taken as an
                    example, having the ground-form of the hexagonal system, the hexagonal
                    dodecahedron. Of the equal even-sided single pyramids (Heteropola homostaura),
                    Alcyonium, Geryonia, Aurelia may be taken as examples of the eight-sided,
                    six-sided, and four-sided pyramids, while those with an odd number of sides may
                    be illustrated by Ophiura or Primula with five sides, and the flower of Lily or
                    Rush with three sides.</p>
                <p>In the highest and most complicated group, the Heterostaura, the basal polygon is
                    no longer regular but amphithect <hi rend="italic">(iμφlθηκτos =</hi>
                    double-edged). Such a polygon has an even number of sides, and can be divided
                    into symmetrical halves by each of two planes intersecting at right angles in
                    the middle point, and thus dividing the whole figure into four congruent
                    polygons. The longer of these axes may be termed lateral, the shorter the
                    equatorial or dorso-ventral; and these two axes, along with the main axes,
                    always define the three dimensions of space. Ctenophores (fig. 6) furnish
                    examples of eight-sided amphithect pyramids, some Madrepore Corals of six-sided,
                    Crucifers, some Medusae, and Cestodes of four-sided amphithect pyramids.</p>
                <p>In these forms the poles of the dorso-ventral and lateral axes are similar, and,
                    as in the preceding Monaxonia and Stauraxonia, the centre of the body is defined
                    by a line; and they are therefore termed <hi rend="italic">Centraxonia,</hi>
                    while the Protaxonia,which are defined by their central point, are called <hi
                    rend="italic">Centrostigma.</hi> There are, however, other forms, and these the
                    most complicated, in which the poles of at least the dorso-ventral axis are
                    unlike, and in which the body is thus defined not with reference to a line but
                    to a median plane, and these have accordingly received the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Centropipeda.</hi> Their ground-form is a polygon with an even
                    number of sides, which can only be divided into two symmetrical halves by the
                    one median plane. It can be obtained by halving an amphithect pyramid of double
                    the number of sides, and is consequently termed a half amphithect pyramid (fig.
                    7). The whole amphithect pyramid may be most conveniently obtained by the
                    reduplication of the ground-form as if in a mirror. Of half amphithect pyramids
                    there are again two forms, termed by Haeckel <hi rend="italic">Amphipleura</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Zygopleura,</hi> the former including the “bilaterally
                    symmetrical” or irregularly radiate forms of previous authors, such as
                    Spatangus, Viola, Orchis, while the Zygopleura include forms bilaterally
                    symmetrical in the strictest sense, in which not more than two radial planes,
                    and these at right angles to each other, are present. The stereometric
                    ground-form is a half rhombic pyramid. Haeckel again divides these, according to
                    the number of antimeres, into <hi rend="italic">Tetrapleura</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Dipleura.</hi></p>
                <p>Promorphology has thus shown that the reigning dogma of the fundamental
                    difference of organic and mineral forms is false, and that a crystallography of
                    organic forms is possible,—the form of the cell or the cell-aggregate differing
                    from the crystal merely by its more or less viscous state of aggregation, its
                    inherited peculiarities, and its greater adaptability to the environment. The
                    classification into <hi rend="italic">bilateral</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >radiate</hi> forms which usually does duty for more precise promorphological
                    conceptions must be abandoned as hopelessly confusing essentially different
                    forms, or at least must be rigidly restricted,—the term radial to regular and
                    double pyramids, the term bilateral to the Centropipeda if not indeed to
                    dipleural forms. Similarly, the topographical and relative terms, anterior and
                    posterior, upper and under, horizontal and vertical, must be superseded by the
                    terms above applied to the axes and their poles, oral and aboral, dorsal and
                    ventral, right and left.</p>
                <p>§ 6. <hi rend="italic">Nature of Morphological Changes.—</hi> The main forms of
                    organic structure being analysed and classified and their stage of individuality
                    being ascertained, the question next arises, by what morphological changes have
                    they arisen, and into what categories can these modes of differentiation be
                    grouped? They at first sight seem innumerable, yet in reality are few. Goethe
                    somewhat vaguely generalized them for the flower as ascending and descending
                    metamorphosis, expansion and contraction of organs, &amp;c.; but the first
                    attempt at careful enumeration seems to be that of Auguste de St-Hilaire, who
                    recognized defects of development, adhérences, excesses of production or
                    “dédoublements,” metamorphosis and displacement of organs. Subsequent authors
                    have variously treated the subject; thus Asa Gray enumerates as modifications of
                    the flower— coalescence, adnation, irregularity, abortion, non-alternation or
                    anteposition, multiplication, enation, unusual development of the axis, and
                    other morphological modifications connected with fertilization. These are
                    obviously too numerous, as may best be shown by a single comparison with the
                    view of an animal morphologist. Thus Huxley, in discussing the arrangement of
                    the Vertebrata, recognizes only three processes of modification, not only in the
                    ancestral evolution of the Equidae, but in the individual development of animals
                    generally; these are “(1) excess of development of some parts in relation to
                    others, (2) partial or complete suppression of certain parts, (3) coalescence of
                    parts originally distinct.” It is probable that this “threefold law of
                    evolution” may include all observed cases of change, even in the flower; thus
                    Chorisis and Peloria may be regarded as peculiar forms of excess, while
                    displacement is probably in all cases only apparent, and really due to adhesion
                    or coalescence (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Biology,</hi> vol. iii. p. 681 <hi

                <p>§ 7. <hi rend="italic">Nature of Morphological Correspondence — Categories of
                    Homology.—</hi> To indicate all the steps by which the idea of morphological has
                    been distinguished from that of physiological resemblance would be to examine
                    the whole history of morphology; it must suffice to discuss the terminology of
                    the subject which has, as ever, served not only as an index but as an engine of
                    progress. For these two distinct forms of resemblance the terms <hi
                    rend="italic">homology</hi> and <hi rend="italic">analogy</hi> gradually became
                    specialized, and were finally established and clearly defined by Owen in
                    1843,—“the former as the same organ in different animals under every variety of
                    form and function <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> fore-limbs of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Draco</hi><hi rend="italic">volans</hi> and wings of Bird); the second as a
                    part or organ in one animal which has the same function <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n876/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0876-0845"/> as another part or organ in a different animal
                    <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> parachute of Draco and wings of Bird).” He further
                    distinguishes three kinds of homology :—(1) <hi rend="italic">special,</hi>
                    being “that above defined, namely, the correspondence of a part or organ
                    determined by its relative position and connexions with a part or organ in a
                    different animal, the determination of which homology indicates that such
                    animals are constituted on a common type,” <hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi> basilar
                    process of human occipital with basi-occipital of fish; (2) <hi rend="italic"
                    >general,</hi> that ‘ ‘ higher relation in which a part or series of parts
                    stands to the fundamental or general type, involving a knowledge of the type on
                    which the group in question is constituted,” <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    same human bone and centrum of the last cranial vertebra; (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >serial</hi> homology, “representative or repetitive relation in the segments of
                    the same skeleton” (demonstrated when general and special homologies have been
                    determined); thus usually the basi-occipital and basi-sphenoid are “homotypes.”
                    These terms were Henceforth accepted by naturalists; but the criterion of
                    analogy and homology became for Agassiz and other embryologists developmental as
                    well as comparative, reference to the ideal archetype becoming less and less
                    frequent. Passing over the discussions of Agassiz and Bronn, of wnich the latter
                    is criticized and partly incorporated by Haeckel, we find the last-named (1)
                    placing serial under general homology; (2) erecting categories of homology
                    partially corresponding to those of individuality,—(a) <hi rend="italic"
                    >homotypy</hi> (of antimeres), hence distinct from that of Owen, (⅛) <hi
                    rend="italic">homodynamy</hi> (of metameres), (c) <hi rend="italic"
                    >homonomy</hi> (of parts arranged on transverse axes); (3) defining special
                    homology in terms of identity of embryonic origin. In 1870 this latter point was
                    more fully insisted upon by Bay Lankester, who, decomposing it into two others,
                    proposed to supersede the term homology by <hi rend="italic">homogeny,</hi>
                    being the correspondence of common descent, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >homoplasy,</hi> denoting any superinduced correspondence of position and
                    structure in parts embryonically distinct. Thus, the fore-limb of a mammal is
                    <hi rend="italic">homogenous</hi> with that of a bird, but the right and left
                    ventricles of the heart in both are only <hi rend="italic">homoplastic,</hi>
                    these having arisen independently since the divergence of both groups from a
                    uni-ventriculate ancestor in relation to similarity of physiological needs.
                    Mivart next proposed to retain homology as a generic term, with homogeny and
                    homoplasy as two species under it, and carried the analysis into great detail,
                    distinguishing at first twenty-five, but later fifteen, kinds of correspondence
                    :—(1) parts similar in function only, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> legs of
                    Lizard and Lobster; (2) parts similar both in function and relative position,
                    wings of Bat and Bird; (3) parts of common descent, fore-limb of Horse and
                    Rhinoceros; (4) parts of similar embryonic origin, whatever be their racial
                    genetic relations, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> occipitals of Panther and Perch;
                    (5) parts of dissimilar embryonic origin, whatever be their racial genetic
                    relations, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> legs of Diptera; (6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
                    laterally, vertically, serially, antero-posteriorly, and radially homologous
                    parts; (11) subordinate serial homologues, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> joints
                    of antenna; (12 and 13) secondary and tertiary subordinate serial homologues;
                    (14 and 15) special and general homologies (in Owen’s sense). In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Kalkschwämme</hi> Haeckel proposed to term <hi rend="italic"
                    >homophyly</hi> the truly phylogenetic homology in opposition to <hi
                    rend="italic">homomorphy,</hi> to which généalogie basis is wanting; and finally
                    Von Jhering has published a repetition of Lankester’s view.</p>
                <p>In this discussion, as in that of individuality, it is evident that we are
                    dealing with numerous logical cross-divisions largely corresponding, no doubt,
                    to the complex web of inter-relations presented by nature, yet remaining in need
                    of disentanglement. Though we must set aside analogies of functional activity,
                    the resemblances in external shape or geometric ground-form which correspond to
                    these, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Hydrozoa and Bryozoa, Fishes and Cetaceans,
                    mimetic organisms, are nevertheless, as our historic survey showed, the first
                    which attract attention; and these homoplastic or homomorphic forms, as Haeckel
                    has shown, come as fairly within the province of the promorphologist as do
                    isomorphic crystals within that of his an-organological colleague the
                    crystallographer. Here, too, would be considered “radial,” “vertical," “lateral”
                    homology, “homotypy of antimeres,” and all questions of symmetry, for which
                    Haeckel’s nomenclature of <hi rend="italic">homaxonial, homopolic,</hi> &amp;c.,
                    is distinctly preferable. Entering the field of tectology or morphology in the
                    ordinary sense, we may next consider whether two organisms compared are of the
                    same category of individuality—are <hi rend="italic">homocategoric;</hi> and
                    under this serial homology, for instance, would come as a minor division, the
                    correspondence between the units or parts of units of a linear dyad-deme or
                    triad. From a third point of view, that of the embryologist, we trace the
                    development of each multicellular organism (1) from the embryonic layers and
                    systems into which the secondary unit (gastrula or plant embryo) differentiates,
                    (2) from a unit-deme or unit of the inferior order or orders of individuality.
                    The parts and units thus recognized by ontogenetic research, respectively or
                    successively <hi rend="italic">homodermic, homosystemic,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">homodem,ic,</hi> may then conveniently be termed (indifferently
                    save for considerations of priority) either “specially homologous, ’
                    “homogenous,” “homophylic,” or “homogenetic,” in the language of phylogenetic
                    theory. These three great classes of morphological
                    correspondence—promorphological, tectological, and embryological —may or may not
                    coincide. But the completest homology, in which all forms of resemblance unite
                    and from which they differentiate, is that expressed in the cell theory, or
                    rather in that ovum theory which underlies it, and which Agassiz therefore riot

                <p>§ 8. <hi rend="italic">Results to Taxonomy.—</hi> The advance and modification of
                    classifications which follow each morphological advance have been pointed out
                    above, and taxonomy thus never quite reaches a level with morphological
                    knowledge. That it requires much reform at present is obvious. Although the
                    dogma of the constancy of species is no longer maintained, its results survive,
                    and perhaps a majority of groups have still to be remonographed in the
                    generalizing spirit with wnich Haeckel has treated the calcareous Sponges, or
                    Carpenter, Parker, and Brady the Foraminifera. The union of the Protophyta and
                    Protozoa into the Protista (a generalization which research is constantly
                    confirming) involves a final abandonment of the mediaeval figment of three
                    kingdoms of nature, and a revival of the Organisata of Linnaeus. Physiological
                    prejudices, too, are not completely expelled; hence, for instance, the constant
                    attempts to separate Animalia and Vegetabilia by physiological characteristics,
                    which would be irrelevant even if in themselves valid. A strictly morphological
                    standard must be applied to the construction of classifications and the pruning
                    of genealogical trees; organisms are “higher” or “lower” not according to their
                    stage of evolution in beauty or intelligence but (as Huxley has most clearly
                    pointed out in the essay referred to under § 6) to the degree of morphological
                    differentiation by excess, suppression, or coalescence wnich they exhibit. Thus
                    the supreme position of Man in classification must be abandoned, since the
                    Primates are simply one of the less specialized, <hi rend="italic">i,e.,</hi>
                    lower orders of Mammals, and the Mammals themselves are on the whole distinctly
                    less specialized than the Birds, or perhaps even some of the higher Reptiles. .
                    The morphological importance of the “vegetable kingdom” sinks when tested by
                    such a standard. The Cormophytes are all nothing more than an axis with
                    appendages, and as such may fairly be compared, not with the entire animal
                    assemblage, but merely to that group which is homomorphic (or rather isomorphic)
                    with them as reducible to axis and appendages too. Such a group we find in the
                    Hydromedusae, which we can easily model in imagination into all the
                    specializations of the floral world, a single genus like Clava or Tubularia
                    affording a starting-point for countless “natural orders.”</p>
                <p>§ 9. <hi rend="italic">Relation of Morphology to Physiology.—</hi> Although the
                    pure morphologist investigates laws of structure only, and rightly eliminates
                    the conceptions of life, environment, and function, yet if kept permanently
                    apart from physiological considerations his labours would be incomplete and his
                    results inexplicable, if not indeed almost illusory. For, however deeply one
                    penetrates through superficial and adaptive characters to an apparently
                    permanent and fundamental morphological type, this is itself but an earlier
                    adaptation, showing the fading traces of an earlier adaptation still. And,
                    conversely, the most superficial of adaptive characters, if transmitted to
                    numerous varying descendants, may attain high morphological importance. The
                    morphological aspect of an organism is merely statical, and, like that of an
                    eddy or a vortex-ring, becomes only truly intelligible when viewed in its
                    dynamic aspect; and thus, though the demonstration of the structural unity of
                    the organic world is in itself a great result, yet the desire of a deeper
                    explanation of form as determined by function and environment is thereby
                    rendered all the more pressing. An example may be taken from botany. Thus Airy
                    beautifully explains the phenomena of phyllotaxis as adaptations to bud-life. Or
                    again, in a common flower, say the Dead-nettle, all the details of form are
                    indeed described by the systematist with equal minuteness (a proceeding which,
                    except in so far as serving for specific identification, is of no further
                    scientific value), but receive separate interpretation from the two distinct
                    standpoints of the morphologist and physiologist. The latter, to whom foπp is
                    important merely so far as explanatory of function, shows how the tough
                    persistent calyx is protective against various dangers, how the corolla serves
                    to lure the fertilizing bees, which find in its lip a landing stage and in each
                    lateral process a hold-fast, while its hood at once protects the pollen against
                    rain and determines the curvature of the stamens,— this curvature, as well as
                    their didynamous arrangement, median position, and linearly arranged
                    anther-lobes being all adaptations through the medium of the hee ’s hairy back
                    to meet the similarly placed stigma of another flower,—and so on. The
                    morphologist, on the other hand, analyses the calyx into its five constituent
                    sepals, reduces the corolla to a regular pentamerous type, ascertains the
                    position of the four stamens, and asserts the loss of a fifth posterior one,
                    finds the ovary to be primitively two-celled, and thus reaches a schematic
                    conception of a not archetypal but ancestral form. This ground-form itself,
                    however, suggests a new train of considerations both morphological and
                    physiological respecting the origin of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0877-0846"/> this primeval flower from a somewhat fern-like
                    Cryptogam, of which the foliage-leaves, the envelopes of the spore-bearing
                    leaves, the micro-and macrosporangiosphores had become permanently
                    differentiated in ascending order; of which the microspores, doubtless through
                    the intervention of a spore-eating insect, had come to germinate upon the
                    macrosporangium instead of upon the ground; and in which this variation
                    (evidently advantageous, since making fertilization at once more certain and
                    more economical) was aided to perpetuate itself by the contemporaneous evolution
                    of those floral colours which are nascent even among the Thallophytes. And thus
                    the morphologist, though excluding teleological and functional considerations
                    from his anatomical researches, has yet a physiological ideal, and enters sooner
                    or later upon a new series of inquiries—those of the interdependence of
                    structure and function. Milne-Edwards’s law of the physiological division of
                    labour, Dohrn’s principle of functional change, the speculations of Claude
                    Bernard, Spencer, and Haeckel, experimental inquiries such as those of Semper,
                    where organisms are subjected to special modifications of their environment, and
                    the like, are all contributions to this newest and evolutionary department of
                    morphology. Such ideas are even applied to the study of cellular morphology.
                    Thus, Spencer points out the relation of the shapes of cells to their
                    environments; James ingeniously explains the occurrence of cell-division by the
                    rapid increase of bulk over surface which the growth of a solid involves, and
                    the corresponding increase of difficulty of nutrition; and the writer has
                    attempted to explain the forms of free and united cells as specializations of a
                    (protomyxoid) cycle in which variations of functional activity are accompanied
                    by the assumption of corresponding forms, the whole series of changes depending
                    upon the properties of protoplasm under the variations in the supply of energy
                    from the environment. Räuber, His, and others have even attempted to explain
                    embryological phenomena in terms of the simplest cellular mechanics, but as yet
                    such speculations are somewhat crude.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of subdividing it cannot be discussed within these limits, although the latter
                    is especially the subject of much disagreement. The position above assumed, that
                    of including under morphology the whole statical aspects of the organic world,
                    is that of Haeckel, Spencer, Huxley, and most recent animal morphologists;
