                    (1798-1874), one of the most voluminous and remarkable writers of France, and
                    one who only lacked a keener power of self-criticism to make him one of the
                    greatest, was born at Paris, August 21, 1798. He belonged to a family which had
                    Huguenot traditions, and which was latterly occupied in the art of printing. His
                    father was a master printer, but seems not to have been very prosperous, and the
                    son at an early age assisted him in the actual work of the press. A place was
                    offered him in the imperial printing office, but his father was able to send him
                    to the famous Collège or Lycée Charlemagne, where he distinguished himself. He
                    passed the university examination in 1821, and was shortly after appointed to a
                    professorship or rather mastership of history in the Collège Rollin. Soon after
                    this, in 1824, he married. The period of the Restoration and the July monarchy
                    was one of the most favourable to rising men of letters of a somewhat scholastic
                    cast that has ever been known in France, and Michelet had powerful patrons in
                    Villemain, Cousin, and others. But, though he was an ardent politician (having
                    from his childhood embraced republicanism and a peculiar variety of romantic
                    free-thought), he was first of all a man of letters and an inquirer into the
                    history of the past. His earliest works were school books, and they were not
                    written at a very early age. Between 1825 and 1827 he produced divers sketches,
                    chronological tables, &lt;fcc., of modern‘history. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Précis</hi> of the subject, published in the last-mentioned year, is a
                    sound and careful book, far better than anything that had appeared before it,
                    and written in a sober yet interesting style. In the same year he was appointed
                    maître de conférences at the École Normale. Four years later, in 1831, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Introduction</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >V</hi><hi rend="italic">Histoire Universelle</hi> showed a very different
                    style, exhibiting no doubt the idiosyncrasy and literary power of the writer to
                    greater advantage, but also displaying the peculiar visionary qualities which
                    make Michelet the most stimulating but the most untrustworthy (not in facts,
                    which he never consciously falsifies, but in suggestion) of all historians. The
                    events of 1830 had unmuzzled him, and had at the same time improved his
                    prospects, and put him in a better position for study by obtaining for him a
                    place in the Record Office, and a deputy-professorship under Guizot in the
                    literary faculty of the university. Very soon afterwards he began his chief and
                    monumental work, the <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                        France,</hi> which occupied him for about forty years, and of which we shall
                    speak presently. But he accompanied this with numerous other works, chiefly of
                    erudition, such as the <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres Choisies</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >de Vico,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                        Templiers.</hi> 1838 was a year of great importance in Michelet’s life. He
                    was in the fulness of his powers, his studies had fed his natural aversion to
                    the principles of authority and ecclesiasticism, and at a moment when the
                    revived activity of the Jesuits caused some real and more pretended alarm he was
                    appointed to the chair of history at the Collège de France. Assisted by his
                    friend Quinet, he began a violent polemic against the unpopular order and the
                    principles which it represented, a polemic which made their lectures, and
                    especially Michelet’s, one of the most popular resorts of the day. He published,
                    in 1839, a History of the Roman Republic, but this was in his graver and earlier
                    manner. The results of his lectures appeared in the volumes <hi rend="italic">Le
                        Prêtre,</hi><hi rend="italic">la Femme,</hi><hi rend="italic">et la
                        Famille</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le Peuple.</hi> These books do not
                    display the apocalyptic style which, borrowed to a certain though no very great
                    extent from Lamennais, characterizes Michelet’s later works, but they contain in
                    miniature almost the whole of his curious ethico-politico-theological creed—a
                    mixture of sentimentalism, communism, and anti-sacerdotalism, supported by the
                    most eccentric arguments, but urged with a great deal of eloquence. The
                    principles of the outbreak of 1848 were in the air, and Michelet was not the
                    least important of those who condensed and propagated them: indeed his original
                    lectures were of so incendiary a kind that the course had to be interdicted. But
                    when the actual revolution broke out Michelet, unlike many other men of letters,
                    did not attempt to enter on active political life, and merely devoted himself
                    more strenuously to his literary work. Besides continuing the great history, he
                    undertook and <pb break="no"

                    downfall of Louis Philippe and the final establishment of Napoleon III., an
                    enthusiastic <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la Révolution Française.</hi> Despite
                    or because of its enthusiasm, this is by no means Michelet’s best book. The
                    events were too near and too well known, and hardly admitted the picturesque
                    sallies into the blue distance which make the charm and the danger of his larger
                    work. In actual picturesqueness as well as in general veracity of picture, the
                    book cannot approach Carlyle’s; while as a mere chronicle of the events it is
                    inferior to half a dozen prosaic histories older and younger than itself. The
                        <hi rend="italic">coup d'etat</hi> lost Michelet his place in the liecord
                    Office, as, though not in any way identified with the republic administratively,
                    he refused to take the oaths to the empire. But the new <hi rend="italic"
                        >régime</hi> only kindled afresh his republican zeal, and his second
                    marriage (with Mademoiselle Adèle Malairet, a lady of some literary capacity,
                    and of republican belongings) seems to have further stimulated his powers. While
                    the history steadily held its way, a crowd of extraordinary little books
                    accompanied and diversified it. Sometimes they were expanded versions of its
                    episodes, sometimes what may be called commentaries or companion volumes. In
                    some of the best of them natural science, a new subject with Michelet, to which
                    his wife is believed to have introduced him, supplies the text. The first of
                    these (by no means the best) was <hi rend="italic">Les Femmes</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">de la Révolution</hi> (1854), in which Michelet’s natural and
                    inimitable faculty of dithyrambic too often gives way to tedious and not very
                    conclusive argument and preaching. In the next, <hi rend="italic">I.’</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Oiseau</hi> (1856), a new and most successful vein was struck.
                    The subject of natural history was treated, not from the point of view of mere
                    science, nor from that of sentiment, nor of anecdote, nor of gossip, but from
                    that of the author’s fervent democratic pantheism, and the result, though, as
                    was to be expected, unequal, was often excellent. <hi rend="italic"
                        >I.’Insecte,</hi> in the same key, but duller, followed. It was succeeded by
                        <hi rend="italic">I.'Amour</hi> (1859), one of the author’s most popular
                    books, and not unworthy of its popularity, but perhaps hardly his best. These
                    remarkable works, half pamphlets half moral treatises, succeeded each other as a
                    rule at the twelve months’ interval, and the succession was almost unbroken for
                    five or six years. <hi rend="italic">I.’Amour</hi> was followed by <hi
                        rend="italic">La Femme</hi> (1860), a book on which a whole critique of
                    French literature and French character might be founded. Then came <hi
                        rend="italic">La Al er</hi> (1861), a return to the natural history class,
                    which, considering the powers of the writer and the attraction of the subject,
                    is perhaps a little disappointing. The next year (1862) the most striking of all
                    Michelet’s minor works, <hi rend="italic">La Sorcière,</hi> made its appearance.
                    Developed out of an episode of the history, it has all its author’s
                    peculiarities in the strongest degree. It is a nightmare and nothing more, but a
                    nightmare of the most extraordinary verisimilitude and poetical power.</p>
                <p>This remarkable series, every volume of which was at once a work of imagination
                    and of research, was not even yet finished, but the later volumes exhibit a
                    certain falling off. The ambitious <hi rend="italic">Bible de l</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Humanite</hi> (1864), an
                    historical sketch of religions, has but little merit. In <hi rend="italic">La
                        Montagne</hi> (1868), the last of the natural history series, the tricks of
                    staccato style are pushed even farther than by Victor Hugo in his less inspired
                    moments, though—as is inevitable in the hands of such a master of language as
                    Michelet—the effect is frequently grandiose if not grand. <hi rend="italic">Nos
                        Fils</hi> (1869), the last of the string of smaller books published during
                    the author’s life, is a tractate on education, written with ample knowledge of
                    the facts and with all Michelet’s usual sweep and range of view, but with
                    visibly declining powers of expression. But in a book published posthumously,
                        <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Banquet,</hi> these powers
                    reappear at their fullest. The picture of the industrious and famishing
                    populations of the Riviera is (whether true to fact or not) one of the best
                    things that Michelet has done. To complete the list of his miscellaneous works,
                    two collections of pieces, written and partly published at different times, may
                    be mentioned. These are <hi rend="italic">Les Soldats</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                        la</hi><hi rend="italic">Révolution</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Légendes
                        Démocratiques du Nord.</hi></p>
                <p>The publication of this series of books, and the completion of his history,
                    occupied Michelet during both decades of the empire. He lived partly in France,
                    partly in Italy, and was accustomed to spend the winter on the Riviera, chiefly
                    at Hyères. At last, in 1867, the great work of his life was finished. As it is
                    now published it fills nineteen volumes. The first of these deals with the early
                    history up to the death of Charlemagne, the second with the flourishing time of
                    feudal France, the third with the 13th century, the fourth, fifth, and sixth
                    with the Hundred Years’ War, the seventh and eighth with the establishment of
                    the royal power under Charles VII. and Louis XI. The 16 th and 17th centuries
                    have four volumes apiece, much of which is very distantly connected with French
                    history proper, especially in the two volumes entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Renaissance</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Réforme.</hi> The last three volumes
                    carry on the history of the 18th century to the ..outbreak of the Revolution.
                    The characteristics which this remarkable history shares with Michelet’s other
                    works will be noted presently. At present it may be remarked that, as the mere
                    division of subjects and space would imply, it is planned on very original
                    principles. Michelet was perhaps the first historian to devote himself to
                    anything like a picturesque history of the Middle Ages, and his account is still
                    the most vivid though far from the most trustworthy that exists. His inquiry
                    into manuscript and printed authorities was most laborious, but his lively
                    imagination, and his strong religious and political prejudices, made him regard
                    all things from a singularly personal point of view. Circumstances which strike
                    his fancy, or furnish convenient texts for his polemic, are handled at
                    inordinate length, while others are rapidly dismissed or passed over altogether.
                    Yet the book is undoubtedly the only history of France which bears the imprint
                    of genius, and in this respect it is not soon likely to meet a rival.</p>
                <p>Uncompromisingly hostile as Michelet was to the empire, its downfall and the
                    accompanying disasters of the country once more stimulated him to activity. Not
                    only did he write letters and pamphlets during the struggle, but when it was
                    over he set himself to complete the vast task which his two great histories had
                    almost covered by a <hi rend="italic">History of the Nineteenth Century.</hi> He
                    did not, however, live to carry it further than Waterloo, and the best criticism
                    of it is perhaps contained in the opening words of the introduction to the last
                    volume—“l’âge me presse.” The new republic was not altogether a restoration for
                    Michelet, and his professorship at the Collège de France, of which he contended
                    that he had never been properly deprived, was not given back to him. He died at
                    Hyères on the 9th of February 1874, and an unseemly legal strife between his
                    representatives took place as to his funeral.</p>
                <p>The literary characteristics of Michelet are among the most clearly marked and
                    also among the most peculiar in French literature. A certain resemblance to
                    Lamennais has been already noted, and to this may be added an occasional
                    reminiscence of the manner of Bossuet. But in the main Michelet, even in the
                    minor details of style, is quite original and individual. His sentences and
                    paragraphs are as different as possible in construction and rhythm from the
                    orderly architecture of French classical prose. A very frequent device of his
                    (somewhat abused latterly) is the omission of the verb, which gives the sentence
                    the air of a continued interjection. Elsewhere he breaks his phrase, not
                    finishing the regular clause at all. In these points and many others the
                    resemblance to bis contemporary Carlyle is very striking; and, different as were
                    their points of view, their manners of seeing were by no means unlike. History
                    to Michelet is always picturesque; it is a series of tableaux. Allusion has been
                    already made to the singular perspective<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n252/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0916-0252-0237"/> iu which these tableaux are drawn, a
                    perspective so strange that a reader unacquainted with the actual size and
                    relation of the objects represented is certain to be deceived. Nothing indeed is
                    further from Michelet’s purpose than deceit. Although a strong republican, an
                    ardent auti-sacerdotalist, and a patriot of fanatical enthusiasm, he is always
                    scrupulously fair as far as he understands what he is doing. For instance, his
                    hatred for England and Englishmen is one of the most comically intense passions
                    in literature. He is never tired of exclaiming against their diabolical pride,
                    their odious jealousy of France, their calculating covetousness, and so forth.
                    In his excited imagination the long drama of European history is a kind of
                    conflict of Ormuzd and Ahriman, in which France, it is needless to say, plays
                    the first part and England the second. Yet he is never unfair to English
                    fortitude and coolness, never (after the childish fashion of some of his
                    countrymen) slurs over English victories, and often expresses genuine admiration
                    (mixed, it is true, with a shudder or tλvo of aversion) for the masterful Λvays
                    and constantly advancing prosperity of the English people. So, with all his
                    dislike to the priesthood, he never is chary of praise to pope or monk whenever
                    it can fairly be given, and, with all his republicanism, he is never weary of
                    worshipping the heroism of a great king. But his poetical fashion of dealing
                    with events, his exaggeration of trivial incidents into great facts of history,
                    his fixed ideas, especially in reference to the intellectual and social
                    condition of mediaeval times, the evils of which he enormously exaggerates, and
                    his abiding prejudices of a general kind combine to distort his accounts in the
                    strangest fashion. A laborious person might pick out of contemporary authors a
                    notable collection of erroneous views of which Michelet is not so much the
                    author as the suggester, for it is when his brilliant exaggerations are torn
                    from their context and set down in some quito other context as sober gospel that
                    they are most misleading to those who do not know the facts, and most grotesque
                    to those who do. This is especially the case in regard to literature. Michelet
                    began his great work too early to enjoy the benefit of the resurrection of old
                    French literature which has since taken place; and though his view of that
                    literature partakes of the amorous enthusiasm which colours his view of
                    everything French, it is astoundingly incorrect in detail. The most remarkable
                    passage of all perhaps is the passage in his <hi rend="italic">Renaissance</hi>
                    relating to Rabelais, Ronsard, and Du Bellay, a passage so widely inconsistent
                    not only with sound criticism but with historic fact that the author (a very
                    rare thing with him) makes a kind of half apology for it elsewhere. Of the work
                    of the age of chivalry proper, the chansons de gestes, the Arthurian romances,
                    the early lyrics and dramas, he evidently knew but little, and chose to
                    subordinate what he did know to his general theories of the time. Even much
                    later his praise and blame, though transparently honest, are quite haphazard.
                    Unless, therefore, the reader be gifted with a very rare faculty of applying the
                    “grain of salt” to what he reads, or unless he be well acquainted with the
                    actual facts before coming to Michelet’s version of them, he will almost
                    certainly be misled. But despite this grave drawback (which attends all
                    picturesque history) the value of Michelet merely as an historian is immense.
                    Not only are his separate tableaux, the wonderful geographical sketch of France
                    in the beginning of the book, the sections devoted to the Templars, to Joan of
                    Arc, to the Renaissance, to the Camisards, almost unequalled, but the
                    inspiriting and stimulating effect of his work is not to be surpassed. If his
                    reconstruction is often hazardous and conjectural, sometimes definitely and
                    demonstrably mistaken, and nearly always difficult to adjust entirely to the
                    ascertained facts, it is always possible in itself, always instinct with genius,
                    and always life-like. There are no dead bones in Michelet; they are if anything
                    only too stirring and lively. These criticisms apply equally to the minor books,
                    though these are necessarily fuller of the author’s somewhat wearisome
                    propaganda, and less full of brilliantly painted facts. The great fault of
                    Michelet as of not a few other modern authors is the comparatively improvised
                    and ephemeral character of too much of his work. His immense volume is, much of
                    it, mere brilliant pamphleteering, much more mere description equally brilliant
                    but equally liable to pass. Nevertheless he is (especially in French, the
                    language <hi rend="italic">γar excellence</hi> of measured and academic
                    perfection) so characteristic and singular a figure in his turbid eloquence and
                    fitful flashing insight that he is never likely to lose a place, and a notable
                    one, in literary history.</p>
                <p>Almost all Michelet’s works, the exceptions being his translations, compilations,
                    &amp;c., are published in uniform size and in about fifty volumes, partly by
                    Marpon and Flammarion, partly by Calmann Lévy. (G. SA.)</p>
