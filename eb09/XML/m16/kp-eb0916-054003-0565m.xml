                    (as Charleton, Ray, and Catesby wrote its name), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mimus</hi><hi rend="italic">polyglottus</hi> of modern ornithologists, and the
                    well-known representative of an American group of birds usually placed among the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Thrushes</hi> (7.v.), <hi rend="italic">Turdidae,</hi>
                    though often regarded as forming a distinct section of that Family, differing by
                    having the tarsus scutellate in front, while the typical Thrushes have it
                    covered by a single horny plate. The Mocking-bird inhabits the greater part of
                    the United States, being in the north only a summer-visitant; but, though
                    breeding yearly in New England, is not common there, and migrates to the south
                    in winter, passing that season in the Gulf States and Mexico. It appears to be
                    less numerous on the western side of the Alleghanies, though found in suitable
                    localities across the continent to the Pacific coast, but not farther northward
                    than Wisconsin, and it is said to be common in Kansas. Audubon states that the
                    Mocking-birds which are resident all the year round in Louisiana attack their
                    travelled brethren on the return of the latter from the north in autumn. The
                    names of the species, both English and scientific, have been bestowed from its
                    capacity of successfully imitating the cry of many other birds, to say nothing
                    of other sounds, in addition to uttering notes of its own which possess a varied
                    range and liquid fulness of tone that are unequalled, according to its admirers,
                    even by those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Nightingale</hi> (7.v.). This opinion
                    may perhaps be correct; but, from the nature of the case, a satisfactory
                    judgment can scarcely be pronounced, since a comparison of the voice of the two
                    songsters can only be made from memory, and that is of course affected by
                    associations of ideas which would preclude a fair estimate. To hear either bird
                    at its best it must be at liberty; and the bringing together of captive
                    examples, unless it could be done with so many of each species as to ensure an
                    honest trial, would be of little avail. Plain in plumage, being greyish-brown
                    above and dull white below, while its quills are dingy black, variegated with
                    white, there is little about the Mocking-bird’s appearance<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n566/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0566-0541"/> beyond its graceful form to recommend it; but the
                    lively gesticulations it exhibits are very attractive, and therein its European
                    rival in melody is far surpassed, for the cock-bird mounts aloft in rapid
                    circling flight, and, alighting on a conspicuous perch, pours forth his
                    everchanging song to the delight of all listeners; while his actions in
                    attendance on his mate are playfully demonstrative and equally interest the
                    observer. The Mocking-bird is moreover of familiar habits, haunting the
                    neighbourhood of houses, and is therefore a general favourite. The nest is
                    placed with little regard to concealment, and is not distinguished by much care
                    in its construction. The eggs, from three to six in number, are of a pale
                    bluish-green, blotched and spotted with light yellowish-brown. They, as well as
                    the young, are much sought after by snakes, but the parents are often successful
                    in repelling these deadly enemies, and are always ready to wage war against any
                    intruder on their precincts, be it man, cat, or hawk. Their food is various,
                    consisting of berries, seeds, and insects.</p>
                <p>Some twelve or fourteen other species of <hi rend="italic">Mimus</hi> have been
                    recognized, mostly from South America; but <hi rend="italic">Μ. orpheus</hi>
                    seems to be common to some of the Greater Antilles, and <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    hilli</hi> is peculiar to Jamaica, while the Bahamas have a local race in <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. bahamensis.</hi> The so-called Mountain Mocking-bird <hi
                    rend="italic">(Orcoscoptcs</hi><hi rend="italic">montanus')</hi> is a form not
                    very distant from <hi rend="italic">Mimus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but,
                    according to Mr. Ridgway, it inhabits exclusively the plains overgrown with <hi
                    rend="italic">Artemisia</hi> of the interior tableland of North America, and is
                    not at all imitative in its notes, so that it is an instance of a misnomer. Of
                    the various other genera allied to <hi rend="italic">Mimus,</hi> those known in
                    the United States as Threshers, and belonging to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Harporhynchus—</hi> of which six or eight species are found in North America,
                    and are very Thrush-like in their habits—must be mentioned; but there is only
                    room here to dwell on the Cat-bird <hi rend="italic">(Galeoscoptcs
                    carolincnsis),</hi> which is nearly as accomplished an imitator of sounds as its
                    more celebrated relative, with at the same time peculiar notes of its own, from
                    one of which it has gained its popular name. The sooty-grey colour that,
                    deepening into blackish-brown on the crown and quills, pervades the whole of its
                    plumage—the lower tail-coverts, which are of a deep chestnut, excepted—renders
                    it a conspicuous object; and though, for some reason or other, far from being a
                    favourite, it is always willing when undisturbed to become intimate with men’s
                    abodes. It has a much wider range on the American continent than the
                    Mocking-bird, and is one of the few species that are resident in Bermuda, while
                    on more than one occasion it is said to have appeared in Europe.</p>
                <p>The name Mocking-bird, or more frequently Mock-Nightingale, is in England
                    occasionally given to some of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Warblers</hi> (ÿ.u),
                    especially the Blackcap <hi rend="italic">(Sylvia atricapilla),</hi> and the
                    Sedge-bird <hi rend="italic">(Acroccphalus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >schoenobaenus).</hi> In India and Australia the same name is sometimes applied
                    to other species. (A. N.)</p>
