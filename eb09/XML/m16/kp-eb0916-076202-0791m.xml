                    rudiments of its form, the term “foetus” being applied to it in the subsequent
                    months during which the organism grows on the lines of development already laid
                    down. It is mostly in the first or embryonic period that those deviations from
                    the normal occur which present themselves as monstrosities at the time of birth;
                    these early traces of deviation within the embryo may be slight, but they “grow
                    with its growth and strengthen with its strength,” until they amount to
                    irreparable defects or accretions, often incompatible with extra-uterine life.
                    The name of “teratology,” introduced by Étienne Geoffroy St-Hilaire (1822), is
                    derived from τepαs, the equivalent of <hi rend="italic">monstrum;</hi>
                    teratology is a term new enough to have none but scientific associations, while
                    the Latin word has a long record of superstitions identified with it. The myths
                    of siren, satyr, Janus, cyclops, and the like, with the corresponding figures in
                    Northern mythology, find a remote anatomical basis in monstrosities which have,
                    for the most part, no life except in the foetal state. The mythology of giants
                    and dwarfs is, of course, better founded. The term monster was originally used
                    in the same sense as portent: Cicero (Z&gt;e <hi rend="italic">Div.,</hi> i.)
                    says, “<hi rend="italic">Monstra,</hi><hi rend="italic">ostenta,

                    a monstrous calf, evidently the subject of contemporary talk, as pointing to
                    some great impending change, and he expresses the hope that the catastrophe
                    might be the Last Day itself. The rise of more scientific views will be sketched
                    at the close of the article.</p>
                <p>Although monstrosities, both in the human species and in other animals, tend to
                    repeat certain definite types of erroneous development, they do not fall readily
                    into classes. It is remarked by Vrolik that a scientific classification is
                    impracticable from being too cumbrous, and that a convenient grouping is all
                    that need be attempted. The most usual grouping (originally suggested by Buffon,
                    1800) is into <hi rend="italic">monstra</hi><hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi

                    and of defect side by side; and it is necessary, above all, to separate the
                    double monsters from the single, the theory of the former being a distinct
                    chapter in teratology.</p>

                    is a finger or toe too many or too few. It is very common for one malformation
                    to be correlated with several others, as in the extreme case of acardiac
                    monsters, in which the non-development of the heart is associated with the

                    measurements, even in the best-proportioned cases, prove, when reduced to a
                    scale, that other parts besides the skull, notably the thigh-bone and the foot,

                    the great stature depends often on the inordinate length of the lower limbs; but
                    in persons over 7 feet the lower limbs are not markedly disproportionate. In
                    many cases the muscles and viscera are not sufficient for the overgrown frame,
                    and the individuals are usually, but not always, of feeble intelligence and
                    languid disposition, and short-lived. The brain-case especially is
                    undersized—the Irish giant in the museum of Trinity College, Dublin, is the
                    single exception to this rule—but the bones of the face, and especially the
                    lower jaw, are on a large scale. Giants are never born of gigantic parents; in
                    fact, sterility usually goes with this monstrosity. Their size is sometimes
                    excessive at birth, but more often the indications of great stature do not
                    appear till later, it may be as late as the ninth year; they attain their full
                    height before the twenty-first year. They have been more frequently male than
                    female; the German giantess lately exhibited (1882) was as tall as any authentic
                    case in the male sex.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dwarfs</hi> are conventionally limited to persons under 4 feet.
                    They are more likely than giants to have the modulus of the body perfect. “In
                    the true dwarf, as far as I have been able to ascertain, the proportions between
                    the several parts of the frame are good, corresponding, or nearly corresponding,
                    with those of the normal adult; and the diminutive stature depends, accordingly,
                    not upon relatively imperfect growth of any particular segments, or even upon
                    the permanence of a foetal or childlike condition, but upon the whole frame
                    being undersized” (Humphry). Where disproportion occurs in the true dwarf it
                    takes the form of a large-sized head, broad shoulders and capacious chest, and
                    undersized lower limbs. Dwarfs with rickets are perhaps to be distinguished from
                    true dwarfs; these are cases in which the spine is curved, and sometimes the
                    bones of the limbs bent and the pelvis deformed. As in the case of giants,
                    dwarfs are seldom the progeny of dwarfs, who are, in fact, usually sterile; the
                    unnatural smallness may be obvious at birth, but is more likely to make itself
                    manifest in the years of growth. Dwarfs are much more easily brought up than
                    giants, and are stronger and longer-lived; they have usually also strong
                    passions and acute intelligence. The legends of the dwarfs and giants are on the
                    whole well based on fact (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Dwarf</hi> and <hi

                    present on one or both hands, or on one or both feet, or in all four
                    extremities, as in the giant of Gath. The want of one, two, or more digits on

                    in the same family. Meckel saw a girl who had an extra digit on each extremity,
                    while a sister wanted four of the fingers of one hand. Where the supernumerary
                    digits are more than one on each extremity, the whole set are apt to be
                    rudimentary or stunted; they look as if two or more of the embryonic buds had
                    been subject to cleavage down the middle, and to arrest of longitudinal growth.
                    There are two or three authentic instances of a whole lower limb appearing at
                    birth as two withered halves, as if from embryonic cleavage.<note

                    redundancies of the skeleton are extra vertebrae (sometimes the coccygeal,
                    giving the appearance of a rudimentary tail), or an extra rib. A double row of
                    teeth is occasionally met with; the most interesting case of this anomaly is
                    that in which the rudiments of a double row exist from the first, but the
                    phenomenon is sometimes produced by the milk teeth persisting along with the
                    second set. One or more extra teeth are occasionally met with in line with the
                    rest. Among redundancies of the soft parts, by far the most frequent is an extra
                    nipple, or pair of nipples. It is only the nipple, or the most external
                    mechanical adjunct of the mammary apparatus, that is repeated, and very seldom,
                    if ever, the breast structure itself. The nipple, although it is the latest
                    addition to the mechanism of lactation, is in the individual mammal developed on
                    the skin before the gland is formed underneath; and that facility, which applies
                    to the development of external characters generally, appears to be the reason
                    why there may be one or more extra nipples but no redundant gland. In the same
                    connexion, it is interesting to observe that the supernumerary nipple has been
                    shown by statistics on a large scale to be twice as common in men as in women,
                    although in the male the mammary function never comes to maturity, and even the
                    structure retrogrades after puberty. Traces of an additional nipple, or pair of
                    them, in more or less symmetrical position below the normal ones, are not very
                    uncommon when carefully looked for. Among the sense organs there is a remarkable
                    instance recorded of doubling of the appendages of the left eye, but not of the
                    eyeball itself; the left half of the frontal bone is double, making two
                    eye-sockets on that side, and the extra orbit has an eyebrow and eyelid.<note

                    always traceable to a more or less complete fissuring or lobation. The ducts or
                    vessels connected with organs, and playing a purely mechanical part, are not
                    unfrequently doubled; thus each kidney may have two ureters, and a similar

                <p><hi rend="italic">Monstrosities from Defective Closure in the Middle Line.—</hi>
                    Under this head come some of the commonest congenital malformations, including
                    slight deficiencies such as harelip, and serious defects such as a gap in the
                    crown of the head with absence of the brain. The embryo is originally a circular
                    flattened disc spread out on one pole of the yolk, and it is formed into a
                    cylindrical body (with four appendages) by the free margins of the disc, or
                    rather its ventral laminae, folding inwards to meet in the middle line and so
                    close in the pelvic, abdominal, thoracic, pharyngeal, and oral cavities.
                    Meanwhile, and indeed rather earlier, two longitudinal parallel ridges on the
                    top or along the back of the disc have grown up and united in the middle line to
                    form the second barrel of the body—the neural canal—of small and uniform width
                    in the lower three-fourths or spinal region, but expanding into a wide chamber
                    for the brain. This division into neural (dorsal) and haemal (ventral) canals
                    underlies all vertebrate development. Imperfect closure along either of those
                    embryonic lines of junction may produce various degrees of monstrosity. The
                    simplest and commonest form, hardly to be reckoned in the present category, is
                    harelip with or without cleft palate, which results from defective closure of
                    the ventral laminae at their extreme upper end. Another simple form, but of much
                    more serious import, is a gap left in the neural canal at its lower end; usually
                    the arches of the lumbar vertebrae are deficient, and the fluid that surrounds
                    the spinal cord bulges out in its membranes, producing a soft tumour under the
                    skin at the lower part of the back. This is the condition known as <hi
                    rend="italic">hydrorhachis,</hi> depending on the osseous defect known as <hi
                    rend="italic">spina bifida.</hi> Children born with this defect are difficult to
                    rear, and are very likely to die in a few days or weeks. More rarely the gap in
                    the arches of the vertebrae is in the region of the neck. If it extend all along
                    the back, it will probably involve the skull also. Deficiency of the crown of
                    the head, and in the spine as well, may be not always traceable to want of
                    formative power to close the canal in the middle line; an over-distended
                    condition of the central water-canal and water-spaces of the cord and brain may
                    prevent the closure of the bones, and ultimately lead to the disruption of the
                    nervous organs themselves; and injuries to the mother, with inflammation set up
                    in the foetus and its appendages, may be the more remote cause. But it is by
                    defect in the middle line that the mischief manifests itself, and it is in that
                    anatomical category that the malformations are included. The osseous deficiency
                    at the crown of the head is usually accompanied by want of the scalp, as well as
                    of the brain and membranes. The bones of the face may be well developed and the
                    features regular, except that the eyeballs bulge forward under the closed lids;
                    but there is an abrupt horizontal line above the orbits where the bones cease,
                    the skin of the brow joining on to a spongy kind of tissue that occupies the
                    sides and floor of the cranium. This is the commonest form of an <hi
                    rend="italic">anencephalous</hi> or brainless monster. There are generally mere
                    traces of the brain, although, in some rare and curious instances, the
                    hemispheres are developed in an exposed position on the back of the neck. The
                    cranial nerves are usually perfect, with the exception sometimes of the optic
                    (and retina). Vegetative existence is not impossible, and a brainless monster
                    has been known to survive sixty-five days. The child is usually a very large
                    one.</p>
                <p>Closely allied, as we have seen, to the anencephalous condition is the condition
                    of congenital <hi rend="italic">hydrocephalus.</hi> The nervous system at its
                    beginning is a neural canal, not only as regards its bony covering, but in its
                    interior; a wide space lined by ciliated epithelium and filled with water
                    extends along the axis of the spinal cord, and expands into a series of
                    water-chambers in the brain. As development proceeds, the walls thicken at the
                    expense of the internal water-spaces, the original tubular or chambered plan of
                    the central nervous system is departed from, and those organs assume the
                    practically solid form in which we familiarly know them. If, however, the
                    water-spaces persist in their embryonic proportions notwithstanding the
                    thickening of the nervous substance forming their walls, there results an
                    enormous brain which is more than half occupied inside with water, contained in
                    spaces that correspond on the whole to the ventricles of the brain as normally
                    bounded. A hydrocephalic foetus may survive its birth, and will be more apt to
                    be affected in its nutrition than in its intelligence. In many cases the
                    hydrocephalic condition does not come on till after the child is born. The <hi
                    rend="italic">microcephalous</hi> condition, where it is not a part of
                    cretinism, is not usually a congenital defect in the strict sense, but more

                <p>Returning to the ventral middle line, there may be defects of closure below the
                    lips and palate, as in the breast-bone (fissure of the sternum), at the navel
                    (the last point to close in any case), and along the middle line of the abdomen
                    generally. The commonest point for a gap in the middle line of the belly is at
                    its lower part, an inch or two above the pubes. At that point in the embryo
                    there issues the allantois, a balloon-like expansion from the ventral cavity,
                    which carries on its outer surface blood-vessels from the embryo to
                    interdigitate with those of the mother on the uterine surface. Having served its
                    temporary purpose of carrying the blood-vessels across a space, the balloon-like
                    allantois collapses, and rolls up into the rounded stem-like umbilical cord
                    through most of its extent; but a portion of the sac within the body of the
                    foetus is retained as the permanent urinary bladder. That economical adaptation
                    of a portion of a vesicular organ, originally formed for purposes of
                    communication between the embryo and the mother, appears to entail sometimes a
                    defect in the wall of the abdomen just above the pubes, and a defect in the
                    anterior wall of the bladder itself. This is the distressing congenital
                    condition of fissure of the urinary bladder, in which its interior is exposed
                    through an opening in the skin; the pubic bones are separated by an interval,
                    and the reproductive organs are ill formed; the urachus is wanting, and the
                    umbilicus is always placed exactly at the upper end of the gap in the skin. A
                    monstrosity recalling the cloacal arrangement of the bird is met with as a more
                    extreme defect in the same parts.</p>

                    anomalous condition does not fall under defective closure in the middle line, it
                    may be said to be due to a similar failure of purpose, or to an uncertainty in
                    the <hi rend="italic">nisus</hi><hi rend="italic">formativus</hi> at a
                    corresponding stage of development. There is a point of time, falling about the
                    eighth week, up to which the embryo may develop either the reproductive organs
                    of the male or the reproductive organs of the female; in the vast majority of
                    cases the future development and growth are carried out on one line or the
                    other, but in a small number there is an ambiguous development leading to
                    various degrees of hermaphroditism or doubtful sex. The primary indecision, so
                    to speak, affects only the ovary or testis respectively, or rather the common
                    germinal ridge out of which either may develop; the uncertainty in this
                    embryonic sexual ridge sometimes leads actually to the formation of a pair of
                    ovaries and a pair of small testes, or to an ovary on one side and a testis on
                    the other; but even when there is no such double sex in the essential organs (as
                    in the majority of hermaphrodites) there is a great deal of doubling and
                    ambiguity entailed in the secondary or external organs and parts of generation.
                    Those parts which are rudimentary or obsolete in the male but highly developed
                    in the female, and those parts which are rudimentary in the female but highly
                    developed in the male tend in the hermaphrodite to be developed equally, and all
                    of them badly. In some cases the external organs of one sex go with the internal
                    organs of the opposite sex. It has been observed that when middle life is
                    reached or passed the predominance in features, voice, and disposition leans
                    distinctly towards the masculine side. The mythological or classical notions of
                    hermaphroditism, like so much else in the traditions of teratology, are
                    exaggerated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cyclops, Siren, Ac.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The same
                    feebleness of the formative energy (the <hi rend="italic">Bildungstrieb</hi> of
                    Blumenbach) which gives rise to some at least of the cases of defective closure
                    in the middle line, and to the cases of undecided sex, leads also to imperfect
                    separation of symmetrical parts. The most remarkable case of the kind is the
                    cyclops monster. At a point corresponding to the root of the nose there is found
                    a single orbital cavity, sometimes of small size and with no eyeball in it, at
                    other times of the usual size of the orbit and containing an eyeball more or
                    less complete. In still other cases, which indicate the nature of the anomaly,
                    the orbital cavity extends for some distance on each side of the middle line,
                    and contains two eyeballs lying close together. The usual nose is wanting, but
                    above the single orbital cavity there is often a nasal process on the forehead,
                    with which nasal bones may be articulated, and cartilages joined to the latter;
                    these form the framework of a short fleshy protuberance like a small proboscis.
                    The lower jaw is sometimes wanting in cyclopeans; the cheek-bones are apt to be
                    small, and the mouth a small round hole, or altogether absent; the rest of the
                    body may be well developed. The key to the cyclopean condition is found in the
                    state of the brain. The olfactory nerves or lobes are usually described as
                    absent, although Vrolik has found them in some instances; the brain is very
                    imperfectly divided into hemispheres, and appears as a somewhat pear-shaped sac
                    with thick walls, the longitudinal partition of dura mater (falx cerebri) being
                    wanting, the surface almost unconvoluted, the corpus callosum deficient, the
                    basal ganglia rudimentary or fused. The optic chiasma and nerves are usually
                    replaced by a single mesial nerve, but sometimes the chiasma and pair of nerves
                    are present. The origin of this monstrosity dates back to an early period of
                    development, to the time when the future hemispheres were being formed as
                    protrusions from the anterior cerebral vesicle or fore-brain; it may be
                    conceived that, instead of two distinct buds from that vesicle, there was only a
                    single outgrowth with imperfect traces of cleavage. That initial defect would
                    carry with it naturally the undivided state of the cerebrum, and with the latter
                    there would be the absence of olfactory lobes and of a nose, and a single
                    eyeball placed where the nose should have been. A cyclops has been known to live
                    for several days. The monstrosity is not uncommon among the domestic animals,
                    and is especially frequent in the pig. There is another congenital malformation,
                    in which an eyeball is wanting from one of the sockets; but in that case there
                    is no defect of development in the bones, and the brain and nose are normal.</p>
                <p>Another curious result of defective separation of symmetrical parts is the siren
                    form of foetus, in which the lower limbs occur as a single tapering prolongation
                    of the trunk like the hinder part of a dolphin, at the end of which a foot (or
                    both feet) may or may not be visible. The defects in the bones underlying this
                    siren form are very various: in some cases there is only one limb (thigh and
                    leg-bones) in the middle line; in others all the bones of each limb are present
                    in more or less rudimentary condition, but adhering at prominent points of the
                    adjacent surfaces. The pelvis and pelvic viscera share in the abnormality. A
                    much more common and harmless case of unseparated symmetrical parts is where the
                    hand or foot has two, three, or more digits fused together. This syndactylous
                    anomaly runs in families.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Limbs Absent or Stunted.—</hi> Allied to these fused or
                    unseparated states of the extremities, or of parts of them, are the class of
                    deformities in which whole limbs are absent, or represented only by stumps. The
                    trunk (and head) may be well formed, and the individual healthy; all four
                    extremities may be reduced to short stumps either wanting hands and feet
                    entirely, or with the latter fairly well developed; or the legs only may be
                    rudimentary or wanting, or the arms only, or one extremity only. Although some
                    of these cases doubtless depend upon aberrant or deficient formative power in
                    the particular directions<pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="italic">A cardiac and Acranial Monsters.—</hi> It sometimes happens in
                    a twin pregnancy that one of the embryos fails to develop a heart and a complete

                    from the placenta of its well-formed twin by means of its umbilical vessels. It
                    grows into a more or less shapeless mass, in which all traces of the human form
                    may be lost. Other viscera besides the heart will be wanting, and no head
                    distinguishable; the most likely parts to keep the line of development are the
                    lumbar region (with the kidneys), the pelvis, and the lower limbs. The twin of

                    and the sigmoid flexure of the colon being attached to the right. This condition

                    >post-mortem</hi> inspection. There are numerous other anomalies in the
                    development of the great vessels. In the heart itself there may be an imperfect
                    septum ventriculorum, and there is more frequently a patency of the foetal
                    communication between the auricles, permitting the venous blood to pass into the
                    arterial system, and producing the livid appearance of the face known as <hi
                    rend="italic">cyanosis.</hi></p>
                <p>The causes of congenital anomalies are difficult to specify. There is no doubt
                    that, in some cases, they are present in the sperm or germ of the parent; the
                    same anomalies recur in several children of a family, and it has been found
                    possible, through a variation of the circumstances, to trace the influence in
                    some cases to the father alone, and in other cases to the mother alone. The
                    remarkable thing in this parental influence is that the malformation in the
                    child may not have been manifested in the body of either parent, or in the
                    grandparents. More often the malformation is acquired by the embryo and foetus
                    in the course of development and growth, either through the mother or in itself
                    independently. Maternal impressions during pregnancy have often been alleged as
                    a cause, and this causation has been discussed at great length by the best
                    authorities. The general opinion seems to be that it is impossible to set aside
                    the influence of subjective states of the mother altogether. The doctrine of
                    maternal impressions has often been resorted to when any other explanation was
                    either difficult or inconvenient; thus, Hippocrates is said to have saved the
                    virtue of a woman who gave birth to a black child by pointing out that there was
                    a picture of a negro on the wall of her chamber. Injuries to the mother during
                    pregnancy have been unquestionably the cause of certain malformations,
                    especially of congenital hydrocephalus. The embryo itself and its membranes may
                    become the subject of inflammations, atrophies, hypertrophies, and the like;
                    this causation, to which Otto traced all malformations of the foetus, is
                    doubtless accountable for a good many of them. But a very large residue of
                    malformations must still be referred to no more definite cause than the erratic
                    spontaneity of the embryonic cells and cell-groups. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >nisus</hi><hi rend="italic">formativus</hi> of the fertilized ovum is always
                    made subject to morphological laws, but, just as in extra-uterine life, there
                    may be deviations from the beaten track; and even a slight deviation at an early
                    stage will carry with it far-reaching consequences. This is particularly
                    noticeable in double monsters.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Double Monsters.—</hi> Twins are the physiological analogy
                    of double monsters, and some of the latter have come very near to being two
                    separate individuals. Triple monsters are too rare to dwell upon, but their
                    analogy would be triplets. The Siamese twins, who died in 1874 at the age of
                    sixty, were joined only by a thick fleshy ligament from the lower end of the
                    breast-bone (xiphoid cartilage), having the common navel on its lower border;
                    the anatomical examination showed, however, that a process of peritoneum
                    extended through the ligament from one abdominal cavity to the other, and that
                    the blood-vessels of the two livers were in free communication across the same
                    bridge. There are one or two cases on record in which such a ligament has been
                    cut at birth, one, at least, of the twins surviving. From the most intelligible
                    form of double monstrosity, like the Siamese twins, there are all grades of
                    fantastic fusion of two individuals into one down to the truly marvellous
                    condition of a small body or fragment parasitic upon a well-grown infant,—the
                    condition known as <hi rend="italic">foetus in foetu.</hi> These monstrosities
                    are deviations, not from the usual kind of twin gestation, but from a certain
                    rarer physiological type of dual development. In by far the majority of cases
                    twins have separate uterine appendages, and have probably been developed from
                    distinct ova; but in a small proportion of (recorded) cases there is evidence,
                    in the placental and enclosing structures, that the twins had been developed
                    from two rudiments arising side by side on a single blastoderm. It is to the
                    latter physiological category that double monsters almost certainly belong; and
                    there is some direct embryological evidence for this opinion. Allen Thomson
                    observed in the blastoderm of a hen’s egg at the sixteenth or eighteenth hour of
                    incubation two “primitive traces” or rudiments of the backbone forming side by
                    side; and in a goose’s egg incubated five days he found on one blastoderm two
                    embryos, each with the rudiments of upper and lower extremities, crossing or
                    cohering in the region of the future neck, and with only one heart between them.
                    Somewhat similar observations had been previously published (four cases in all)
                    by Wolff, Von Baer, and Reichert. Malformations in the earliest stages of the
                    blastoderm have been more frequently observed of late, especially in the ova of
                    the pike; and these point not so much to a symmetrical doubling of the primitive
                    trace as to irregular budding from the margin of the germinal disc. In any case,
                    the perfect physiological type appears to be two rudiments on one blastoderm,
                    whose entirely separate development produces twins (under their rarer
                    circumstances), whose nearly separate development produces such double monsters
                    as the Siamese twins, and whose less separate development produces the various
                    grotesque forms of two individuals in one body. There can be no question of a
                    literal fusion of two embryos; either the individuality of each was at no time
                    complete, or, if there were two distinct primitive traces, the uni-axial type
                    was approximately reverted to in the process of development, as in the formation
                    of the abdominal and thoracic viscera, limbs, pelvis, or head. Double monsters
                    are divided in the first instance into those in which the doubling is
                    symmetrical and equal on the two sides, and those in which a small or
                    fragmentary foetus is attached to or enclosed in a foetus of average
                    development,—the latter class being the so-called cases of “parasitism.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Symmetrical Double Monsters</hi> are subdivided according to
                    the part or region of the body where the union or fusion exists—head, thorax,
                    umbilicus, or pelvis. One of the simplest cases is a Janus head upon a single
                    body, or there may be two pairs of arms with the two faces. Again, there may be
                    one head with two necks and two complete trunks <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n795/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0795-0766"/> and pairs of extremities. Two distinct heads
                    (with more or less of neck) may surmount a single trunk, broad at the shoulders
                    but with only one pair of arms. The fusion, again, may be from the middle of the
                    thorax downwards, giving two heads and two pairs of shoulders and arms, but only
                    one trunk and one pair of legs. In another variety, the body may be double down
                    to the waist, but the pelvis and lower limbs single. The degree of union in the
                    region of the head, abdomen, or pelvis may be so slight as to permit of two
                    distinct organs or sets of organs in the respective cavities, or so great as to
                    have the viscera in common; and there is hardly ever an intermediate condition
                    between those extremes. Thus, in the Janus head there may be two brains, or only
                    one brain. The Siamese twins are an instance of union at the umbilical region,
                    with the viscera distinct in every respect except a slight vascular anastomosis
                    and a common process of peritoneum; but it is more usual for union in that
                    region to be more extensive, and to entail a single set of abdominal and
                    thoracic viscera. The pelvis is one of the commonest regions for double monsters
                    to be joined at, and, as in the head and abdomen, the junction may be slight or
                    total. The Hungarian sisters Helena and Judith (1701-1723) were joined at the
                    sacrum, but had the pelvic cavity and pelvic organs separate; the same condition
                    obtained in the South Carolina negresses Millie and Christina, known as the
                    “two-headed nightingale,” and in the other recent case of the Bohemian sisters
                    Rosalie and Josepha. More usually the union in the pelvic region is complete,
                    and produces the most fantastic shapes of two trunks (each with head and arms)
                    joining below at various angles, and with three or four lower limbs extending
                    from the region of fusion, sometimes in a lateral direction, sometimes
                    downwards. A very curious kind of double monster is produced by two otherwise
                    distinct foetuses joining at the crown of the head and keeping the axis of their
                    bodies in a line. It is only in rare instances that double monsters survive
                    their birth, and the preserved specimens of them are mostly of foetal size.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Unequal Double Monsters, Foetus in Foetu.—</hi> There are some
                    well-authenticated instances of this most curious of all anomalies. The most
                    celebrated of these parasitebearing monsters was a Genoese, Lazarus Johannes
                    Baptista Colloredo, born in 1716, who was figured as a child by Licetus, and
                    again by Bartholinus at the age of twentyeight as a young man of average
                    stature. The parasite adhered to the lower end of his breast-bone, and was a
                    tolerably well-formed child, wanting only one leg; it breathed, slept at
                    intervals, and moved its body, but it had no separate nutritive functions. The
                    parasite is more apt to be a miniature acardiac and acephalous fragment, as in
                    the case of the one borne in front of the abdomen of a Chinaman figured by I.
                    Geoffroy St-Hilaire. Sometimes the parasite is contained in a pouch under the
                    skin of the abdominal wall, and in another class (of which there is a specimen
                    in the Hunterian Museum) it has actually been included, by the closure of the
                    ventral laminae, within the abdominal cavity of the foetus,—a true <hi
                    rend="italic">foetus in foetu.</hi> Shapeless parasitic fragments containing
                    masses of bone, cartilage, and other tissue are found also in the space behind
                    the breast-bone (mediastinal teratoma), or growing from the base of the skull
                    and protruding through the mouth (“epignathous teratoma,” appearing to be seated
                    on the jaw), and, most frequently of all, attached to the sacrum. These last
                    pass by a most interesting transition into common forms of congenital sacral
                    tumours (which may be of enormous size), consisting mainly of one kind of tissue
                    having its physiological type in the curious glandlike body (coccygeal gland) in
                    which the middle sacral artery comes to an end. The congenital sacral tumours
                    have a tendency to become cystic, and they are probably related to the more
                    perfect congenital cysts of the neck region, where there is another minute
                    gland-like body of the same nature as the coccygeal at the point of bifurcation
                    of the common carotid artery. Other tumours of the body, especially certain of
                    the sarcomatous class, may be regarded from the point of view of <hi

                    >excessum</hi>; but such cases suggest not so much a question of aberrant
                    development within the blastoderm as of the indwelling spontaneity of a single
                    post-embryonic tissue; and they fall to be considered more properly, along with
                    tumours in general, in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pathology</hi><hi

                <p>The scientific appreciation of monsters hardly began before the 18th century;
                    even so great a rationalist in surgical practice as Ambroise Paré (1517-1590),
                    although he was attracted as a scholar in later life to the subject, did not
                    advance in it materially beyond the fantastic and credulous standpoint of the
                    time, which is exemplified in the elaborate treatise of Lycosthenes, <hi
                    rend="italic">Prodigiorum ac ostentorum</hi><hi rend="italic">chronicon,</hi>
                    Basel, 1557. Throughout the 17 th century fabulous monsters continued to be
                    described along with actual specimens; the embryological studies of Harvey
                    (1651) were doubtless calculated to help in the growth of rational opinion about
                    monsters, though Harvey himself mentions them only casually. The first
                    systematic discussion of them from a strictly objective or anatomical point of
                    view occurs in various writings of Haller from 1735 to 1753, and the subject
                    continued after that to engage a large amount of precise and philosophical
                    thought on the part of Caspar Friedrich Wolff (1735-1794), who first stated the
                    relation of monstrosities to embryonic deviations in words that even now hardly
                    require to be altered, and of Blumenbach, Sömmering, Autenrieth, Tiedemann, and
                    others. The engrossing interest of the subject in the early part of the 19th
                    century is shown by the fact that J. F. Meckel’s <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der
                    pathologischen Anatomie</hi> (1817) was largely occupied with congenital
                    malformations. Geoffroy St-Hilaire, the father, gave them a prominent place in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Philosophie Anatomique</hi> (Paris, 1822), and his son
                    Isidore made them the subject of a special and very elaborate treatise in 3
                    vols. (Paris, 1832-37), illustrated by a small and inadequate atlas of plates.
                    Monstrosities were at this period a prominent part of all text-books of morbid
                    anatomy. From 1840 to 1850 may be regarded as the period in which human
                    teratology reached its highest point; in 1840-42 the special treatise of Vrolik
                    was published (2 vols., Amsterdam), containing an introduction on the normal
                    development, and his sumptuous and incomparable atlas to the same followed in
                    1849; in 1841 Otto published at Warsaw a description of 600 monsters with 30
                    folio plates; and in 1842 the embryologist Bischoff contributed to Wagner’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Handwörterbuch der Physiologie,</hi> vol. i., an article on
                    teratology as elucidated by the best information on mammalian development. An
                    article by Allen Thomson in the <hi rend="italic">London and Edinburgh Monthly
                    Journal of Medical Science,</hi> July 1844, followed by a critical survey in the
                    next number, is of the first importance for the theory of double monsters, and
                    it is one of the few notable English contributions to animal teratology apart
                    from museum catalogues,—the general article in Todd’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology</hi> having been written by Vrolik, while
                    the special subject of Hermaphroditism is treated of in a long and learned
                    article by J. Y. Simpson (reprinted in his collected works). One of the latest
                    important works on monsters is that by Förster (Jena, 1861), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Missbildungen des Menschen systematisch
                    dargestellt,</hi> with an atlas of 26 4to plates containing 524 figures (on a
                    small scale), of which 162 were drawn from original specimens, mostly in the
                    Würzburg Museum; this work has a very great variety of illustrations from all
                    sources, and most copious bibliographical references. The newest treatise is
                    Ahlfeld’s <hi rend="italic">Missbildungen des Menschen</hi> (Leipsic, 1880-82),
                    with an extensive atlas of folio plates, as comprehensive as Forster’s and on a
                    larger scale. Monsters have of late been assigned a comparatively subordinate
                    position in pathological teaching, owing, doubtless, to the more immediate
                    interest of microscopic and experimental pathology. Among recent pathological
                    text-books that of Peris (Stuttgart, 1877-79) may be named as containing an
                    adequate treatment of the subject. The two most considerable contributors to
                    teratology recently have been Panum (Berlin, 1860), and Dareste (Paris, 1877),
                    both of whom have occupied themselves mainly with producing monstrosities
                    artificially in the bird’s egg by varying the temperature in the hatching oven.
