                    that Morgagni was ambitious of gaining admission into that rank, and it may be
                    inferred that he succeeded from the fact that he is described on a memorial
                    tablet at Padua as “nobilis Forolensis.” At school he was conspicuous for his
                    talents, and he was especially noted for his readiness in classical epigram. At
                    the age of sixteen he went to Bologna to <pb break="no"

                    with much éclat as doctor in both faculties three years later (1701). He acted
                    as prosector to Valsalva (one of the distinguished pupils of Malpighi), who held
                    the office of “demonstrator anatomicus” in the Bologna school. He assisted
                    Valsalva more particularly in preparing his celebrated work on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anatomy and Diseases of the Ear,</hi> which came out in 1704. Many
                    years after (1740), Morgagni edited a collected edition of Valsalva’s writings,
                    with important additions to the treatise on the ear, and with a memoir of the
                    author. When Valsalva was transferred to Parma Morgagni succeeded to his
                    anatomical demonstratorship. At this period he enjoyed a high repute in Bologna;
                    he was made president of the Academia Inquietorum when in his twenty-fourth
                    year, and he is said to have signalized his tenure of the presidential chair by
                    discouraging abstract speculations, and by setting the fashion towards exact
                    anatomical observation and reasoning. He published the substance of his
                    communications to the Academy in 1706 under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adversaria</hi><hi rend="italic">Anatomica,</hi> the first of a series by which
                    he became favourably known throughout Europe as an accurate anatomist; the book
                    included “Observations on the Larynx, the Lachrymal Apparatus, and the Pelvic
                    Organs in the Female.” After a time he gave up his post at Bologna, and occupied
                    himself for the next two or three years at Padua and Venice with anatomical
                    studies (of fishes at the latter city), as well as with chemistry and pharmacy,
                    and with reading in the libraries. He then settled in practice in his native
                    town, and soon attracted a large amount of business; there was hardly a case of
                    much difficulty about which he was not consulted even by the older physicians,
                    “adeo erat in observando attentus, in praedicendo cautus, in curando felix.”
                    Such at least is the contemporary eulogy. After less than three years of this
                    career, which he found fatiguing, he sought an opportunity of returning to more
                    academical work. At Padua he had a friend in the elder Guglielmini, professor of
                    medicine, but better known as a writer on physics and mathematics, whose works
                    he afterwards edited (1719) with a biography. Guglielmini desired to see him
                    settled as a teacher at Padua, and the unexpected death of Guglielmini himself
                    made the project feasible, Vallisnieri being transferred to the vacant chair and
                    Morgagni succeeding to the chair of theoretical medicine. He came to Padua in
                    the spring of 1712, being then in his thirty-first year, and he taught medicine
                    there with the most brilliant success until his death sixty years later (6th
                    December 1771). When he had been three years in Padua an opportunity occurred
                    for his promotion (by the Venetian senate) to the chair of anatomy, in which he
                    became the successor of an illustrious line of scholars, including Vesalius,
                    Fallopius, Fabricius, Gasserius, and Spigelius, and in which he enjoyed a
                    stipend that was increased from time to time by vote of the senate until it
                    reached twelve hundred gold ducats. Shortly after coming to Padua he married a
                    lady of Forli, of noble parentage, who bore him three sons and twelve daughters;
                    of the daughters, four died in infancy, and the other eight took the veil as
                    they grew up; of the sons, one died in boyhood, one entered the Jesuit order,
                    and the eldest settled at Forli, where he married and lived to the age of
                    fifty-two, predeceasing his father by five years and leaving a family to his
                    care. Morgagni enjoyed an unequalled popularity among all classes. He was of
                    tall and dignified figure, with blonde hair and blue eyes, and with a frank and
                    happy expression; his manners were polished, and he was noted for the elegance
                    of his Latin style. He lived in harmony with his colleagues, who are said not
                    even to have envied him his unprecedentedly large stipend; his house and
                    lecture-theatre were frequented “tanquam officina sapientiae” by students of all
                    ages attracted from ail parts of Europe; he enjoyed the friendship and favour of
                    distinguished Venetian senators and of cardinals; successive popes conferred
                    honours upon him; and on two occasions when a hostile army occupied the Aemilia
                    his house was ordered to be treated with the same marked distinction that the
                    great Emathian conqueror showed to the house of Pindar. Before he had been long
                    in Padua the students of the German nation, of all the faculties there, elected
                    him their patron, and he advised and assisted them in the purchase of a house to
                    be a German library and club for all time. No person of any learning came to
                    Padua without seeing and conversing with Morgagni, and no one ever left him
                    without admiring equally his character and his teaching. One of his biographers
                    and editors, the celebrated Tissot of Lausanne, observes that he had met with
                    several Englishmen returning from Italy who told with pleasure and gratitude
                    “quam humaniter illos exceperat, et quantum ex illius colloquiis, doctis,
                    variis, jucundis profecerant.” He was elected into the Imperial
                    Caesareo-Leopoldina Academy in 1708 (originally located at Schweinfurth), and to
                    a higher grade in 1732, into the Royal Society in 1724, into the Paris Academy
                    of Sciences in 1731, the St Petersburg Academy in 1735, and the Berlin Academy
                    in 1754. Among his more celebrated pupils were Scarpa (who died in 1832,
                    connecting the school of Morgagni with the modern era), Cotunnius (Cotugno), and
                    Caldani, the author of the magnificent atlas of anatomical plates published in 4
                    vols, at Venice in 1801-1814.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile he published on a variety of subjects. In his earlier years at Padua he
                    brought out (1717-1719) five more series of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adversaria</hi><hi rend="italic">Anatomica</hi> by which his reputation was
                    first made; but for more than twenty years after the last of these his strictly
                    medical publications were few and casual (on gall-stones, varices of the vena
                    cava, cases of stone, and several memoranda on medico-legal points drawn up at
                    the request of the curia). Classical scholarship in those years occupied his pen
                    more than anatomical observations; and the reason of this appears to have been
                    that he spent the summer months in thecountry for the sake of his health, and
                    occupied his leisure with literary studies. His writings in this class include
                    letters to Lancisi on the manner of Cleopatra’s death, commentaries on Celsus
                    and Sammonicus, notes on Prosper Alpinus, Varro, Vegetius, Columella, and
                    Vitruvius, and antiquarian researches into the topography of the country round
                    Ravenna and his own birthplace (Forum Livii). His edition of the works of
                    Valsalva, published in 1740 (in 2 vols. 4to) with plates, occupied much of his
                    time, being enriched with a life and a commentary, and with many additional
                    observations of his own. It was not until 1761, when he was in his eightieth
                    year, that he brought out the great work which, once for all, made pathological
                    anatomy a science, and diverted the course of medicine into new channels of
                    exactness or precision—the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Sedibus et
                    Causis Morborum</hi><hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">Anatomem
                    indagatis.</hi> He died on 6th December 1771. During the preceding ten years the
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Sedibus,</hi> notwithstanding its
                    bulk, was reprinted several times (thrice in four years) in its original Latin,
                    and was translated into French (1765), English (1769, 3 vols. 4to), and German
                    (1771). Some account of this remarkable work remains now to be given.</p>
                <p>The only special treatise on pathological anatomy previous to that of Morgagni
                    was the work of Théophile Bonet of Neuchatel, <hi rend="italic">Sepulchretum:
                    sive Anatomia</hi><hi rend="italic">practica</hi><hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cadaveribus morbo</hi><hi rend="italic">denatis,</hi> first
                    published (Geneva, 2 vols, folio) in 1679, three years before Morgagni was born;
                    it was republished at Geneva (3 vols, folio) in 1700, and again at Leyden in
                    1709. Although the normal anatomy of the body had been comprehensively, and in
                    some parts exhaustively written by Vesalius and Fallopius, it had not occurred
                    to any one to examine and describe systematically the anatomy of diseased organs
                    and parts. Harvey, a century after Vesalius, naively remarks that there is more
                    to be learned from the dissection of one person who had died of consumption or
                    other chronic malady than from the bodies of ten persons who had been hanged.
                    Glisson indeed (1597-1677) shows, in a passage quoted by Bonet in the preface to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sepulchretum,</hi> that he was familiar with the idea, at
                    least, of systematically comparing the state of the organs in a series of
                    cadavera, and of noting those conditions which invariably accompanied a given
                    set of symptoms. The work of Bonet was, however, the first attempt at a system
                    of morbid anatomy, and, although it dwelt mostly upon curiosities and
                    monstrosities, it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n852/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0852-0823"/> enjoyed much repute in its day; Haller speaks of
                    it as “an immortal work, which may in itself serve for a pathological library.”
                    Morgagni, in the preface to his own work, discusses the defects and merits of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sepulchretum</hi>; it was largely a compilation of other
                    men’s cases, well and ill authenticated; it was prolix, often inaccurate and
                    misleading from ignorance of the normal anatomy, and it was wanting in what
                    would now be called objective impartiality,—a quality which was introduced as
                    decisively into morbid anatomy by Morgagni as it had been introduced two
                    centuries earlier into normal human anatomy by Vesalius. Morgagni has narrated
                    the circumstances under which the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sedibus</hi> took origin. Having finished his edition of Valsalva in 1740, he
                    was taking a holiday in the country, spending much of his time in the company of
                    a young friend who was curious in many branches of knowledge. The conversation
                    turned upon the <hi rend="italic">Sepulchretum</hi> of Bonet, and it was
                    suggested to Morgagni by his dilettante friend that he should put on record his
                    own observations. It was agreed that letters on the anatomy of diseased organs
                    and parts should be written for the perusal of this favoured youth (whose name
                    does not transpire); and they were continued from time to time until they
                    numbered seventy. Those seventy letters constitute the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Sedibus et Causis Morborum,</hi> which was given to
                    the world as a systematic treatise iu 2 vols, folio, Venice, 1761, twenty years
                    after the task of epistolary instruction was begun. The letters are aιτanged in
                    five books, treating of the morbid conditions of the body <hi rend="italic">a
                    capite</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">calcem.</hi> The five
                    books are dedicated respectively to Trew, Bromfield, Senac, Schreiber, and
                    Meckel, as representing the several learned societies of which Morgagni was a
                    foreign member. The five books together contain, according to an enumeration by
                    the present writer, the records of some 640 dissections. Some of these are given
                    at great length, and with a precision of statement and exhaustiveness of detail
                    hardly surpassed in the so-called “protocols” of the German pathological
                    institutes of the present time; others, again, are fragments brought in to
                    elucidate some question that had arisen. The symptoms during the course of the
                    malady and other antecedent circumstances are always prefixed with more or less
                    fulness, and discussed from the point of view of the conditions found after
                    death. Subjects in all ranks of life, including several cardinals, figure in
                    this remarkable gallery of the dead. Many of the cases are taken from Morgagni’s
                    early experiences at Bologna, and from the records of his teachers Valsalva and
                    Albertini not elsewhere published. Those six hundred or more cases are selected
                    and arranged with method and purpose, and they are often (and somewhat casually)
                    made the occasion of a long excursus on general pathology and therapeutics. The
                    range of Morgagni’s scholarship, as evidenced by his references to early and
                    contemporary literature, strikes one with astonishment. It has been contended
                    that he was himself not free from prolixity, the besetting sin of the learned;
                    and certainly the form and arrangement of his treatise are such as to make it
                    difficult to use in the present day, notwithstanding that it is well indexed in
                    the original edition, in that of Tissot (3 vols. 4to, Yverdun, 1779), and in
                    more recent editions. It differs from modern treatises in so far as the symptoms
                    determine the order and manner of presenting the anatomical facts. Although
                    Morgagni was the first to understand and to demonstrate the absolute necessity
                    of basing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment on an exact and comprehensive
                    knowledge of anatomical conditions, he made no attempt (like that of the Vienna
                    school sixty years later) to exalt pathological anatomy into a science
                    disconnected from clinical medicine and remote from practical needs. His
                    orderliness of anatomical method (implying his skill with the scalpel), his
                    precision, his exhaustiveness, and his freedom from bias are his essentially
                    modern or scientific qualities; his scholarship and high consideration for
                    classical and foreign work, his sense of practical ends (or his common sense),
                    and the breadth of his intellectual horizon prove him to have lived before
                    medical science had become largely technical or mechanical. It is clear that
                    Morgagni’s immense personal influence during his lifetime did not alone make his
                    book famous; at a distance of two hundred years from his birth, and more than
                    one hundred from his death, the opinion is unanimous that his treatise was the
                    commencement of the era of steady or cumulative progress in pathology and in
                    practical medicine. Symptoms from that time ceased to be made up into more or
                    less conventional groups, each of which was a disease; on the other hand, they
                    began to be viewed as “the cry of the suffering organs,” and it now became
                    possible to develop Sydenham’s grand conception of a natural history of disease
                    in a catholic or scientific spirit. Laennec’s application of the stethoscope to
                    detect the sounds given out in diseased states of the heart and lungs, and
                    Bright’s application of the test-tube and re-agents to reach the structural and
                    functional conditions of the kidney through the state of the urine, were the
                    direct results of Morgagni’s endeavour to lay bare the seats and causes of
                    disease by anatomy; and those two means oLdiagnosis are the daily and hourly
                    resource of every modem practitioner. In more general terms, Morgagni’s work
                    substituted localization for generalization and precision for vagueness.</p>
