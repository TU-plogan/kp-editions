                    Previous to that time—from the 12th to the end of the 15th century—pocket
                    mirrors or small hand mirrors carried at the girdle were indispensable adjuncts
                    to ladies’ toilets. The pocket mirrors consisted of small circular plaques of
                    polished metal fixed in a shallow circular box, covered with a lid. Mirror cases
                    were chiefly made of ivory, carved with relief representations of love <pb

                    sometimes illustrations of popular poetry or romance. Gold and silver, enamels,
                    ebony, and other costly materials were likewise used for mirror cases, on which
                    were lavished the highest decorative efforts of art workmanship and costly
                    jewelling. The mirrors worn at the girdle had no cover, but were furnished with
                    a short handle. In 625 Pope Boniface IV. sent Queen Ethelberga of Northumbria a
                    present of a silver mirror; and there is ample evidence that in early
                    Anglo-Saxon times mirrors were well known in England. It is a remarkable fact
                    that on many of the sculptured stones of Scotland, belonging probably to the
                    7th, 8th, or 9th century, representations of mirrors, mirror cases, and combs
                    occur.</p>
                <p>The method of backing glass with thin sheets of metal for mirrors was well known
                    in the Middle Ages at a time when steel and silver mirrors were almost
                    exclusively employed. Vincent de Beauvais, writing about 1250, says that the
                    mirror of glass and lead is the best of all “quia vitrum propter transparentiam
                    melius recipit radios.” It is known that small convex mirrors were commonly made
                    in southern Germany before the beginning of the 16th century, and these
                    continued to be in demand under the name of bull’s-eyes <hi rend="italic"
                    >{QchsenrAugen)</hi> till comparatively modern times. They were made by blowing
                    small globes of glass into which while still hot was passed through the pipe a
                    mixture of tin, antimony, and resin or tar. When the globe was entirely coated
                    with the metallic compound and cooled it was cut into convex lenses, which of
                    course formed small but well-defined images. It appears that attention was drawn
                    to this method of making mirrors in Venice as early as 1317, in which year a
                    “Magister de Alemania,” who knew how to work glass for mirrors, broke an
                    agreement he had made to instruct three Venetians, leaving in their hands a
                    large quantity of mixed alum and soot for which they could find no use.</p>
                <p>It was, however, in Venice that the making of glass mirrors on a commercial scale
                    was first developed; and that enterprising republic enjoyed a rich and
                    much-prized monopoly of the manufacture for about a century and a half. In 1507
                    two inhabitants of Murano, representing that they possessed the secret of making
                    perfect mirrors of glass, a knowledge hitherto confined to one German
                    glasshouse, obtained an exclusive privilege of manufacturing mirrors for a
                    period of twenty years. In 1564 the mirrormakers of Venice, who enjoyed peculiar
                    privileges, formed themselves into a corporation. The products of the Murano
                    glass-houses quickly supplanted the mirrors of polished metal, and a large and
                    lucrative trade in Venetian glass mirrors sprang up. They were made from blown
                    cylinders of glass which were slit, flattened on a stone, carefully polished,
                    the edges frequently bevelled, and the backs ‘ <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi>
                    silvered” by an amalgam. The glass was remarkably pure and uniform, the
                    “silvering” bright, and the sheets sometimes of considerable dimensions. In the
                    inventory of his effects made on the death of the great French minister Colbert
                    is enumerated a Venetian mirror 46 by 26 inches, in a silver frame, valued at
                    8016 livres, while a picture by Raphael is put down at 3000 livres.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of glass mirrors, with the aid of Italian workmen, was practised
                    in England by Sir Robert Mansel early in the 17th century, and about 1670 the
                    duke of Buckingham was concerned in a glass-work at Lambeth where flint glass
                    was made for looking-glasses. These old English mirrors, with bevelled edges in
                    the Venetian fashion, are still well known.</p>
                <p>The Venetians guarded with the utmost jealousy the secrets of their varied
                    manufactures, and gave most exceptional privileges to those engaged in such
                    industries. By their statutes any glassmaker carrying his art into a foreign
                    state was ordered to return on the pain of imprisonment of his nearest
                    relatives, and should he disobey the command emissaries were delegated to slay
                    the contumacious subject. In face of such a statute Colbert attempted in 1664,
                    through the French ambassador in Venice, to get Venetian artists transported to
                    France to develop the two great industries of mirror-making and point-lace
                    working. The ambassador, the bishop of Béziers, pointed out that to attempt to
                    send the required artists was to court the risk of being thrown into the
                    Adriatic, and he further showed that Venice was selling to France mirrors to the
                    value of 100,000 crowns and lace to three or four times that value.
                    Notwithstanding these circumstances, however, twenty Venetian glass-mirror
                    makers were sent to France in 1665, and the manufacture was begun under the
                    fostering care of Colbert in the Faubourg St Antoine, Paris. But previous to
                    this the art of blowing glass for mirrors had been actually practised at
                    Tour-la-Ville, near Cherbourg, by Richard Lucas, Sieur de Nehou, in 1653; and by
                    the subsequent combination of skill of both establishments French mirrors soon
                    excelled in quality those of Venice. The art received a new impulse in France on
                    the introduction of the making of plate glass, which was discovered in 1691. The
                    St Gobain Glass Company attribute the discovery to Louis Lucas of Nehou, and
                    over the door of the chapel of St Gobain they have placed an inscription in
                    memory of “Louis Lucas qui inventa in 1691 le methode de couler les glaces et
                    installa la manufacture en 1695 dans le château de Saint Gobain.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufacture.—</hi> The term “silvering,” as applied to the
                    formation of a metallic coating on glass for giving it the properties of a
                    mirror, was till quite recently a misnomer, seeing that till about 1840 no
                    silver was used in the process. Now, however, a large proportion of mirrors are
                    made by depositing on the glass a coating of pure silver, and the old
                    amalgamation process is comparatively little used.</p>
                <p>The process of amalgamation consists in applying a thin amalgam of tin and
                    mercury to the surface of glass, which is done on a perfectly flat and
                    horizontal slab of stone bedded in a heavy, iron-bound wooden frame, with a
                    gutter running round the outer edge. On the surface of this table, which must be
                    perfectly smooth and level, is spread a sheet of thin tin-foil, somewhat larger
                    than the glass to be operated on, and after all folds and creases have been
                    completely removed, by means of stroking and beating with a covered wooden
                    rubber, the process of “quickening” the foil is commenced. A small quantity of
                    mercury is rubbed lightly and quickly over the whole surface, and the scum of
                    dust, impure tin, and mercury is taken off. Mercury is then poured upon the
                    quickened foil, until there is a body of it sufficient to float the glass to be
                    silvered (about I inch deep), and, the edge at one of the sides having been
                    cleared of the scum peculiar to mercury, the glass (scrupulously cleaned
                    simultaneously with the above operations) is slid from that side over the
                    surface of the mercury. Weights are placed over the surface until the greater
                    part of the amalgamated mercury is pressed out, the table is then tilted
                    diagonally, by means of dumb-screws, and all superfluous mercury finds its way
                    to the gutter. The glass is left twenty-four hours under weights; it is then
                    turned over silvered side up, and removed to a drainer with inclining shelves,
                    where by slow degrees, as it dries and hardens, it is brought to a vertical
                    position, which in the case of large sheets may not be arrived at in less than a
                    month. This process yields excellent results, producing a brilliant silver-white
                    metallic lustre which is only subject to alteration by exposure to high
                    temperatures, or by contact rvith damp surfaces; but the mercurial vapours to
                    which the workmen are exposed give rise to the most distressing and fatal
                    affections.</p>
                <p>In 1835 Baron Liebig observed that, on heating aldehyde with an ammoniacal
                    solution of nitrate of silver, in a glass vessel, a brilliant deposit of
                    metallic silver was formed on the surface of the glass. To this observation is
                    due the modern process of silvering glass. In practice the process was
                    introduced about 1840; and it is now carried on, with several modifications, in
                    two distinct ways, called the hot and the cold process respectively. In the
                    former method there is employed a horizontal double-bottomed metallic table,
                    which is heated with steam to from 35° to 40° C. The glass to be silvered is
                    cleaned thoroughly with wet whiting, then washed with distilled water, and
                    prepared for the silver with a sensitizing solution of tin, which is well rinsed
                    off immediately before its removal to the silvering table. The table being
                    raised to the proper temperature, the glass is laid, and the silvering solution
                    at <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n522/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0522-0501"/> once poured over it, before the heat of the table
                    has time to dry any part of the surface of the glass. The solution used is
                    prepared as follows :—in half a litre of distilled water 100 grammes of nitrate
                    of silver are dissolved; to this there is added of liquid ammonia (sp. gr. 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 880) 62 grammes; the mixture is filtered, and made up
                    to 8 litres with distilled water, and 7 ‘5 grammes of tartaric acid dissolved in
                    30 grammes of water are mixed with the solution. About 2 ’ 5 litres are poured
                    over the glass for each superficial metre to be silvered. The metal immediately
                    begins to deposit on the glass, which is maintained at about 40° C. (104° F.),
                    and in little more than half an hour a continuous coating of silver is formed.
                    The silvered surface is then cleaned by very cautiously wiping with a very soft
                    chamois rubber, and treated a second time with a solution like the first, but
                    containing a double quantity of tartaric acid. This solution is applied in two
                    portions, and thereafter the glass is once more carefully cleared of all
                    unattached silver and refuse and removed to a side room for backing up.</p>
                <p>In silvering by the cold process advantage is taken of the power of inverted
                    sugar to reduce the nitrate of silver. This process has been adopted lor the
                    silvering of mirrors for astronomical telescopes, notably for Leverrier’s great
                    telescope in the Paris Observatory. For ordinary mirror silvering the following
                    is the process recommended by H. E. Benrath. Two solutions are prepared, the
                    first of which contains the silver salt, and the second the sugar preparation.
                    For the silver solution 800 grammes of nitrate of silver and 1200 grammes of
                    nitrate of ammonium are dissolved in 10 litres of water, and 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 3 kilos of pure caustic soda in 10 litres of water,
                    and of each of these solutions 1 litre is added to 8 litres of water, which is
                    allowed to rest till the sediment forms and then decanted. The second
                    solution—inverted sugar—is prepared by dissolving 150 grammes of loaf sugar with
                    15 grammes of vinegar in 0'5 litre of water, and boiling the solution for half
                    an hour. After cooling it is made up with water to 4200 cubic centimetres. The
                    silvering is done on horizontal tables in a well-lighted and moderately heated
                    apartment, and the glass is cleaned with scrupulous care. For each square
                    centimetre of glass operated on 15 cubic centimetres of the silver solution
                    above described are measured out, and from 7 to 10 per cent, of the solution of
                    inverted sugar is added, both being quickly stirred together and poured rapidly
                    and evenly over the glass. The reduction immediately begins, and the solution
                    exhibits tints passing through rose, violet, and black, till in about seven
                    minutes it again becomes transparent and the deposit of metal is complete. This
                    first deposit is extremely thin, and allows the transmission of bluish rays. The
                    exhausted solution with floating and unattached dust-like granules of silver is
                    carefully wiped off, the silvered surface washed with distilled water and again
                    treated with the mixed solutions to the extent of half the quantity used in the
                    first application. The finished surface is wiped and washed in the most thorough
                    manner,—for the least trace of caustic soda left would destroy the mirror. The
                    further processes are the same in both methods of silvering.</p>
                <p>The deposit of silver on glass is not so adherent and unalterable under the
                    influence of sunlight and sulphurous fumes as the tin-mercury amalgam, and
                    moreover real silvered glass has a slightly yellowish tinge. These defects have
                    been overcome by a process introduced by Μ. Lenoir, which consists of brushing
                    over the silvered surface with a dilute solution of cyanide of mercury, which
                    instantaneously forming a kind of amalgam renders the deposit at once much
                    whiter and more firmly adherent than before. To protect the thin metallic film
                    from mechanical injury and the chemical action of gases and vapours, it is
                    coated with shellac or copal varnish, over which when dry are applied two
                    coatings of red-lead paint.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Platinum Mirrors.—</hi> A cheap process of preparing mirror
                    glass is to some extent prosecuted in France, whereby a thin but very adherent
                    deposit of platinum is formed on the glass. A solution of chloride of platinum
                    with a proportion of litharge and borate of lead dissolved in essential oil of
                    spike is applied with a brush to well-cleaned glass, which is then placed on
                    edge in a muffle furnace, and the platinum is thus burned in, forming an
                    exceedingly thin but brilliant metallic backing having a somewhat grey lustre.
                    It is used only for the lids of cheap boxes, toys, ornamental letters,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Magic Mirrors.—</hi> Hand mirrors of metal are still in common
                    use in Oriental countries, and especially in Japan and China they continue to be
                    the prevalent form of looking-glass. In the former country indeed bronze mirrors
                    are articles of the greatest importance in the generally meagre furnishing of
                    houses, and besides possess a religious significance. They have been known and
                    used from the most remote period, mention of them being found in Chinese
                    literature of the 9th century. The (reputed) first made Japanese mirror,
                    preserved at Ise, is an object of the highest veneration in Japan, and an
                    ancient mirror, connected with which is a tradition to the effect that is was
                    given by the sun-goddess at the foundation of the empire, is a principal article
                    of the Japanese regalia. The mirrors oι Japan vary in form and size, but in
                    general they consist of thin disks, from 3 to 12 inches in diameter, of speculum
                    metal with handles cast.in one piece. The polished face of the mirror is
                    slightly convex in form, so that a reflected image is seen proportionately
                    reduced in size; the back of the disk is occupied with characteristic Japanese
                    ornamentation and inscriptions in bold relief, and its rim is also raised to the
                    back. Much attention has been attracted to these mirrors by a singular physical
                    peculiarity which in a few cases they are found to possess. These are known as
                    magic mirrors from the fact that when a strong beam of light is reflected from
                    their smooth and polished surface, and thrown on a white screen, an image of the
                    raised ornaments and characters on the back of the mirror is formed with more or
                    less distinctness in the disk of light on the screen. This peculiarity has at no
                    time been specially observed by the Japanese, but in China it attracted
                    attention as early as the 11th century, and mirrors possessed of this property
                    sell among the Chinese at ten or even twenty times the price sought for the
                    ordinary non-sensitive examples. The true explanation of the magic mirror was
                    first suggested by the Frencn physicist Person, who observed that the reflecting
                    surface of the mirrors was not uniformly convex, the portions opposite relief
                    surfaces being plane. Therefore, as he says, “the rays reflected from the convex
                    portion diverge and give but a feebly illuminated image, while, on the contrary,
                    the rays reflected from the plane portions of the mirror preserve their
                    parallelism, and appear on tne screen as an image by reason of their contrast
                    with tne feebler illumination of the rest of the disk.” That such differences of
                    plane in the mirror surface arise is an accidental circumstance due to the
                    manner in which it is prepared, a process explained by Professors Ayrton and
                    Perry, by whom ample details of the history, process of manufacture, and
                    composition of Oriental mirrors have been published. A preliminary operation in
                    polishing the surface consists of scoring the cast disk in every direction with
                    a sharp tool. The thicker portions with relief ornament offer more resistance to
                    the pressure of the tool than the thin flat portions, which tend to yield and
                    form at first a concave surface, but this by the reaction of its elasticity
                    rises afterwards and forms a slightly convex surface while the more rigid thick
                    portions are comparatively little affected. This irregularity of surface is
                    inconspicuous in ordinary light, and does not visibly distort images; but when
                    the mirror reflects a bright light on a screen the unequal radiation renders the
                    minute differences of surface obvious. The ingenious theory of Person has been
                    established by experiments communicated by Μ. Govi to the academy of Turin in
                    1864-65, and more recently by investigations of MM. Bertin and Dubosq. See <hi

                <p>The mirror of classical antiquity (κάτοτττρον, speculum) was a thin disk of
                    bronze slightly convex on one side and polished, usually provided with a handle,
                    sometimes mounted on a stand in the form of a female figure (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Costume,</hi> vol. vi. p. 453, fig. 1), sometimes fixed inside
                    a circular bronze case. The common size is that of an ordinary hand mirror.
                    Examples large enough to take in the whole figure appear to have been rare.
                    Mirrors of glass are mentioned, and though none of them have been found their
                    existence need not be questioned altogether, since the process of silvering
                    occasionally employed on bronze mirrors suggests that an analogous process may
                    have been applied to glass. But the very large number of mirrors still existing
                    from antiquity shows that bronze was the regular material employed. The alloy
                    known as speculum, producing a very hard metal with great reflecting power, is
                    comparatively seldom met with. Silver mirrors are mentioned, but none have as
                    yet been found.</p>
                <p>The principal feature of ancient mirrors, especially those of Etruria, is the
                    design incised on the back (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Etruria,</hi> vol. viii. p.
                    643). While twelve incised specimens are all that are as yet known from Greece,
                    the number found in Etruria must be nearly a thousand. As a rule the subjects
                    incised are taken from Greek mythology and legend, the names of the persons
                    represented being frequently added in Etruscan letters and orthography. In most
                    cases the style of drawing, the types of the figures, and the manner of
                    composing the groups are true to the characteristics of Greek art. Some may have
                    been imported from Greece; but the greater number appear to have been more or
                    less faithfully imitated from such designs as occurred on the almost innumerable
                    printed Greek vases which the Etruscans obtained from Greece. Even where
                    distinctly Etruscan figures are introduced, such as the heroes Aelius and
                    Caelius Vibenna on a mirror in the British Museum, Greek models are followed.
                    The characteristics of Greek art here referred to date from a little before 400
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and last for some time after. In this period
                    would fall the majority of the Etruscan mirrors, and to this period also belong
                    the Greek incised mirrors, among which may be mentioned for their beauty one
                    representing Leucas and Corinthus, inscribed with their names (engraved, <hi
                    rend="italic">Monuments Grecs,</hi> 1873, pl. 3, published by the Association
                    pour l’encouragement des Études Grecques), and another in the British Museum <hi
                    rend="italic">{Gazette Arch.,</hi> ii. pl. 27), on the back of which is a figure
                    of Eros which has been silvered over. With this last-mentioned mirror was found
                    the bronze case used to contain it, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n523/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0523-0502"/> on the back of which is a group of Aphrodite and
                    Eros in repoussée. It was found in Crete. But most of the Greek mirrors and
                    mirrorcases having artistic designs are from Corinth. One bears the name of the
                    artist, Απoλλαs <hi rend="italic">lιroieι</hi> (engraved, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arch.</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeitung,</hi> 1862, pl. 166, fig. 1).</p>
                <p>Archaic art (about 500 B. c. ) is represented by a mirror in the British Museum
                    from Sunium in Attica. The mirror itself is quite plain, but the stand is
                    composed of a draped female figure, above whose head float two cupids. From
                    Etruria there is a comparatively small number with archaic incised designs. It
                    may be concluded that the luxury of mirrors enriched with incised designs was
                    not freely indulged before 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> in Etruria and
                    never to any extent in Greece. A special centre of incised mirrors was the
                    Latian town of Praeneste (Palestrina), and it is of interest in regard to some
                    of the mirrors found there that they have inscriptions in early Latin.
                    Artistically they have a purely Greek character. Plain mirrors are found
                    wherever Greek and Roman civilization spread, and it may be seen from a specimen
                    found in Cornwall, now in the British Museum, that the Celtic population of
                    England had adopted the form and substance of the mirror from their conquerors.
                    This specimen is enriched with a Celtic pattern incised. The shape of the handle
                    testifies to native originality. Mirrors were used in Greece, perhaps rarely,
                    for divination, as appears, for example, from Pausanias (vii. 21, 5), the method
                    being to let the mirror down into a well by means of a string till it reached
                    close to the surface of the water. When it was pulled up after a little it was
                    expected to show the face of the sick person on whose behalf the ceremony was
                    performed. This was at Patras.</p>
