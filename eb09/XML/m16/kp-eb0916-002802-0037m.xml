                    once its protection against the attacks of pirates. Facing the south-east, and
                    sheltered on the north and west by high mountains, the Bay of Menton enjoys a
                    delicious climate, and is on this account much frequented by invalids requiring
                    a mild and equable temperature. The mean for the year is 61° Fahr., exceeding
                    that of Rome or of <pb break="no"

                    on the average only once in ten years; in one particular year the thermometer
                    did not fall below 46° Fahr. In summer the heat is never very great, the
                    temperature rarely exceeding 86° Fahr. Winter and summer are the most agreeable
                    seasons; in autumn the rain storms are accompanied by sudden changes of
                    temperature, and in spring the sea breezes are apt to be violent. Besides the
                    charms of its climate, Menton offers those of an almost tropical vegetation.
                    Lemon-trees, olive-trees, and pines, rising above each other in successive
                    stages, adorn the surrounding slopes. The district produces forty millions of
                    lemons yearly, and this is the principal source of its natural wealth. The
                    olive-trees are remarkable for the great size they have attained in the course
                    of the centuries during which they have continued to bear. Of their wood a
                    multitude of fancy objects are made for sale to strangers.</p>
                <p>The origin of Menton is unknown. During the Middle Ages it was successively
                    occupied by the Saracens, the Genoese, and the princes of Anjou. In the middle
                    of the 14th century it was purchased as a single domain by the Grimaldis, lords
                    of Monaco. During the times of the republic and the first empire it belonged to
                    France; but in 1815 it again became the property of the princes of Monaco, who
                    subjected it to such exactions that in 1848 its inhabitants, weary of finding
                    their reasonable demands put off with empty promises, proclaimed their town free
                    and independent, under the protection of Sardinia. Menton, with the neighbouring
                    commune of Roquebrune, was united to France in 1860, at the same time as Nice
                    and Savoy.</p>
