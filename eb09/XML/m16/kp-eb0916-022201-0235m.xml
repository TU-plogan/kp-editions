                    Clementi. When seven years old he played Mozart’s Concerto in D Minor in public,
                    and at nine he was pronounced the best pianist in Berlin. For composition he was
                    placed under Zelter, whose lessons were soon exchanged for those of Bernard
                    Weber, then director of the Berlin opera, by whom he was introduced to the Abbé
                    Vogler. Struck by his brilliant talent, Vogler invited him to Darmstadt, and in
                    1810 received him into his house, where he formed an intimate friendship with
                    Karl Maria von Weber, who, though his senior by eight years, shared the daily
                    lessons he received from the abbé in counterpoint, fugue, and extempore
                    organ-playing. At the end of two years the grand-duke appointed Meyerbeer
                    composer to the court. His early works, however, were far from successful,—his
                    first opera, <hi rend="italic">Jephtha's</hi><hi rend="italic">Gelübde,</hi>
                    failing lamentably at Darmstadt in 1811, and his second, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wirth</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Gast (AlimeleE),</hi> at
                    Vienna in 1814. These checks discouraged him so cruelly that he feared he had
                    mistaken his vocation. Nevertheless, by advice of Salieri, he determined to
                    study vocalization in Italy, and then to form a new style. But at Venice he was
                    so captivated by the style of Rossini that, renouncing all thought of
                    originality, he produced a succession of seven Italian operas— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Romilda</hi><hi rend="italic">e Costanza,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Semiramide</hi><hi rend="italic">riconosciuta, Edouardo e Cristina, Emma di
                    Rosburgo, Margherita d'Anjou, I.’Esule di</hi><hi rend="italic">Granata,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">II Crociato in Egitto—</hi> which all achieved a success
                    as brilliant as it was unexpected. Against this act of treason to German art
                    Weber protested most earnestly; and before long Meyerbeer himself grew tired of
                    his defection, though the success of <hi rend="italic">II Crociato</hi> was so
                    great that he was crowned upon the stage. An invitation to Paris in 1826 led him
                    to review his position fairly and dispassionately, and he could not conceal from
                    himself the fact that he was wasting in imitation powers which, rightly used,
                    might make his name immortal. For several years after this he produced nothing
                    in public; but, in concert with Scribe, he planned the work which first made
                    known the reality of his transcendent genius—his first French opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Robert</hi><hi rend="italic">le</hi><hi rend="italic">Diable.</hi>
                    This gorgeous drama was produced at the Grand Opéra in 1831, and received with
                    acclamation. It was the first of its race, a grand romantic opera, abounding
                    with scenes of startling interest, with situations more powerfully dramatic than
                    any that had been attempted either by Cherubini or Rossini, with mysterious
                    horrors and chivalric pomp, and with ballet music such as had never yet been
                    heard, even in Paris. Its popularity exceeded all previous expectation; yet for
                    five years after this signal triumph Meyerbeer appeared before the public no
                    more. We cannot doubt that his motive for this retirement was the determination
                    to produce something greater still; and in some respects his next opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Huguenots,</hi> really was greater, though it fell short of
                    the deep romance which rendered <hi rend="italic">Robert</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >le</hi><hi rend="italic">Diable</hi> so incomparably captivating.</p>
                <p>The first performance of <hi rend="italic">Les Huguenots</hi> took place in 1836.
                    In gorgeous colouring, in depth of passion, in consistency of dramatic
                    treatment, and in careful delineation of individual character, it is at least
                    the equal of <hi rend="italic">Robert</hi><hi rend="italic">le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Diable.</hi> In two points only did its interest fall short of
                    that inspired by the earlier work. Meyerbeer had shown himself so great a master
                    in his treatment of the supernatural that one regretted the unavoidable omission
                    of that powerful element in his second grand opera; and, more important still,
                    the fifth act of <hi rend="italic">Les Huguenots</hi> was so arranged by the
                    librettist as to render effective musical treatment impossible. The substitution
                    of a noisy fusillade for a legitimate dramatic situation was fatal to the
                    anticipated climax. The music which accompanies this division of the work is
                    necessarily inferior to all that precedes it. The true interest of the drama
                    culminates at the close of the fourth act, when Raoul, leaping from the window,
                    leaves Valentine fainting upon the ground. The spectator needs not to be told
                    that the former will be shot down the moment he arrives in the street, or that
                    the latter will mourn for him to the end of her days. Neither musically nor
                    dramatically does anything more remain to be said; and therefore it is that
                    those who quit the theatre when the curtain falls for the fourth time carry away
                    with them a far more perfect ideal than those who remain to the end.</p>
                <p>After the production of <hi rend="italic">Les Huguenots</hi> Meyerbeer again
                    retired from public view, and spent many years in the preparation of two of his
                    greatest works—the greatest of all except the two we have already mentioned— <hi
                    rend="italic">I.'Africaine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le Prophète.</hi> The
                    libretti of both these operas were furnished by Scribe; and both were subjected
                    to countless changes of detail before they satisfied the composer’s fastidious
                    taste; in fact, the story of <hi rend="italic">I.'Africaine</hi> was more than
                    once entirely rewritten.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Meyerbeer accepted the appointment of kapellmeister to the king of
                    Prussia, and spent some years at Berlin, where he produced <hi rend="italic">Ein
                    Feldlager</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Schlesien,</hi> a
                    German opera, in which the matchless cantatrice Jenny Lind made her first
                    appearance in Prussia, with unprecedented success. Here also he composed, in
                    1846, the overture to his brother Michael’s drama, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Struensee.</hi> But his chief care at this period was bestowed upon the worthy
                    presentation of the works of others. He began by producing his dead friend
                    Weber’s <hi rend="italic">Euryanthe,</hi> with scrupulous attention to the
                    composer’s original idea. With equal unselfishness he procured the acceptance of
                    <hi rend="italic">Rienzi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Der Fliegende
                    Holländer,</hi> the first two operas of Richard Wagner, who, then languishing in
                    poverty and exile, would, but for him, have found it impossible to obtain a
                    hearing in Berlin. With Jenny Lind as prima donna and Meyerbeer as conductor,
                    the opera flourished brilliantly in the Prussian capital; but the anxieties of
                    this thankless period materially shortened the composer’s life.</p>
                <p>Meyerbeer produced <hi rend="italic">Le Prophète</hi> at Paris in 1849; and, if
                    it did not at first create so great a sensation as <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Huguenots,</hi> this was simply because it needed to be better <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n236/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0236-0223"/> known. In 1854 he brought out <hi rend="italic"
                    >I.'Étoile</hi><hi rend="italic">du Nord</hi> at the Opéra Comique, and in 1859
                    <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Pardon de Ploermel (Dinor ah).</hi>
                    His last great work, <hi rend="italic">I.’</hi><hi rend="italic">Africaine,</hi>
                    was in active preparation at the Académie when, on the 23d of April 1863, he was
                    seized with a sudden illness, of which he died on the 2d of May. <hi
                    rend="italic">I.'Africaine</hi> was produced with pious attention to the
                    composer’s minutest wishes, on April 28, 1865, and fully justified the
                    expectation which had been raised by his long and painstaking consideration of
                    its details. Upon this, in conjunction with <hi rend="italic">Robert</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">le</hi><hi rend="italic">Diable, Les Huguenots,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Prophète,</hi> his fame now almost entirely rests.</p>
                <p>Meyerbeer’s genius has been criticized with widely different results. Mendelssohn
                    thought his style exaggerated; Fétis thought him one of the most original
                    geniuses of the age; Wagner calls him “a miserable music-maker,” and “a Jewish
                    banker to whom it occurred to compose operas.” But the reality of his talent has
                    been recognized throughout all Europe; and, in spite of the acknowledged crudity
                    of his system of phrasing, and the inequality of merit too plainly observable
                    even in his greatest works, his name will live so long as intensity of passion
                    and power of dramatic treatment are regarded as indispensable characteristics of
                    dramatic music. (W. S. R.)</p>
