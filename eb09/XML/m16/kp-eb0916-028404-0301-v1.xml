                <p><label type="entry">MIDNAPUR</label>, a district in the lieutenant-governorship
                    of Bengal, India, between 21° 37' and 22° 57' N. lat., and between 86’ 35' 45"
                    and 88’ 14' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Bànkurâ and Bardwân, on the E. by
                    Hooghly and Howrah, on the S. by the Bay of Bengal, and on the W. by Singbhum
                    and Mânbhùm, with an area of 5082 square miles. Its general appearance is that
                    of a large open plain, of which the greater part is under cultivation. In the
                    northern portion the soil is poor, and there is little wood. The country along
                    the western boundary, known as the Jungle Mahdis, is undulating and picturesque;
                    it is almost uninhabited. The eastern and south-eastern portions are swampy and
                    richly cultivated. The chief rivers of the district are the Hooghly and its
                    three tributaries, the Rûpnârâyan, the Haldi, and the Rasulpur. The Midnapur
                    high-level canal runs almost due east and west from the town of Midnapur to
                    Ulubariâ on the Hooghly 16 miles below Calcutta, and affords a continuous
                    navigable channel 53 miles in length. There is also a tidal canal for
                    navigation, 26 miles in length, extending from the Rùpndrdyan river. The jungles
                    in the west of the district yield lac, <hi rend="italic">tasar</hi> silk, wax,
                    resin, firewood, charcoal, &amp;c., and give shelter to large and small
                    game.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 returned the population of Midnapur at 2,540,963 (1,257,194
                    males and 1,283,769 females), including only 122 Europeans and 157,030
                    Mohammedans. The aboriginal tribes belong chiefly to the jungles and hills of
                    Chutia Nagpur and Ban-kurâ; the most numerous of them are Santals (96,921) and
                    Bhumfjs (35,344). Of high-caste Hindus the returns show 136,500; and the number
                    of Kayasths is given as 101,663. Amon» the semi-Hindu ized aborigines, the most
                    numerous are the Bagdιs, a tribe of cultivators, fishermen, and day-labourers
                    (76,825). Belonging to agricultural castes there are 1,018,686. The four
                    municipalities are Midnapur (31,491), Chandrakona (21,311), Ghatal (15,492), and
                    Tamlιik (5849). Rice is the staple crop. Irrigation is effected chiefly from the
                    high-level canal. Rent rates vary from 10⅛d. an acre for the poorest quality of
                    rice land to 18s. an acre for the best irrigable lands. The district suffers
                    occasionally from drought; floods are common, and very disastrous in their
                    results. The principal exports are rice, silk, and sugar; and the chief imports
                    consist of cotton cloth and twist. Salt, indigo, silk, mats, and brass and
                    copper utensils are manufactured. Apart from the rivers, communication is
                    afforded by 482 miles of road. The total revenue in 1870-71 was £262,578, and
                    the expenditure £53,777. The prevailing diseases are fever, diarrhoea,
                    dysentery, and cholera. The average mean temperature is 80’ Fahr., and the
                    average annual rainfall 66 inches.</p>
                <p>The early history of Midnapur centres round the ancient town of Tamlùk, which in
                    the beginning of the 5th century was an important Buddhist settlement and
                    maritime harbour. The first connexion of the English with the district dates
                    from 1760, when Mir Kasim ceded to the East India Company Midnapur, Chittagong,
                    and Bardwân (then estimated to furnish one-third of the entire revenue of
                    Bengal) as the price of his elevation to the throne of Bengal on the deposition
                    of Mir Jafar.</p>

                    particularly successful among the Santâls, and some of the earliest and most
                    valuable works on their language have issued from the Midnapur mission press. A
                    brisk manufacture of brass and copper utensils takes place in the town; it is
                    also the centre of a large indigo and silk industry.</p>
