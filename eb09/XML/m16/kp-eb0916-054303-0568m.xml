                    Vitebsk and Smolensk on the north and east, Tchernigoff and Minsk on the south
                    and west. In the north it is occupied by the watershed which separates the
                    basins of the Dwina and the Dnieper, an undulating tract from 650 to 900 feet
                    above the sea-level, and covered nearly everywhere with forests. This watershed
                    slopes gently to the south, that is, to the valley of the Dnieper, which enters
                    the province from the northeast and flows west and afterwards due south. The
                    southern part of the province is flat and has much in common with the Polyesie
                    of the province of Minsk; it is, however, more habitable, the marshes being less
                    extensive.</p>
                <p>The province is covered by the Tertiary formation; Devonian sandstone appears in
                    the north, and Carboniferous limestones in the east. The soil is mostly sand,
                    clay (brick-clay and potter’s-clay are not uncommon), and peat-bogs, with a few
                    patches of “blackearth.” The climate is rude and wet, the average yearly
                    temperature at the Gorki meteorological observatory being 40 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 4 Fahr. (14 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 2 in
                    January, and 63°'8 in July); cold nights in summer are often the cause of bad
                    crops. The province has about 1,140,000 inhabitants (947,625 in 1870), mostly
                    White-Russians (78 per cent.), belonging to the Greek Church; Jews are numerous
                    (16 per cent.); Poles, belonging mostly to the nobility, make only 3 per cent,
                    of the population. Agriculture is the chief occupation; nearly one half (46 per
                    cent.) of the surface of the province is under crop; but, except after unusually
                    good harvests, corn is imported, chiefly by the navigable channels of the
                    Dnieper and Sozh. There are many distilleries on the estates of landowners, and
                    wine-spirit is exported. The hemp culture is important; hemp and hempseed oil
                    are exported to Riga. The province has one large papermill, a few iron and
                    copper works, and minor manufactures.</p>
                <p>The province of Moghileff is divided into eleven districts, with the chief towns:
                    Moghileff (40,500 inhabitants), Chausy (4200), Tcherikoff (3900), Gomel
                    (13,030), Gorki, formerly the seat of an agricultural institute (5050),
                    Klimovichi (4000), Mstislavl (6700), Orsha (5350), Rogacheff (7750), Staryi
                    Bykhoff (5200), and Syenno (2550). Of about 80 other municipal towns, we name
                    Shkloff (13,000 inhabitants), Dubrovka (7000), Krieheff (4000).</p>
                <p>This province was inhabited in the 10th century by the Krivichi and Radimichi. In
                    the 14th century it became part of Lithuania and afterwards of Poland. Russia
                    annexed it in 1772.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moghileff on the Dnieper,</hi> a town of Russia, capital of
                    the province of same name. It is situated on both banks of the Dnieper, 40 miles
                    south of the Orsha station of the railway between Moscow and Μ arsaw. A railway
                    along the Dnieper will soon bring Moghileff into railway communication with
                    these capitals.</p>
                <p>Moghileff is mentioned for the first time in the 14th century as a dependency of
                    the Vitebsk, or of the Mstislavl principality. At the beginning of the 15th
                    century it became the personal property of the Polish kings. But it was
                    continually plundered —either by Russians, who attacked it six times during the
                    16th century, or by Cossacks, who plundered it three times. In the 17th century
                    its inhabitants who belonged to the Greek Church suffered much from the
                    persecutions of the Union. In 1654 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n569/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0569-0544"/> it surrendered to Russia, but in 1661 the Russian
                    garrison was massacred by the inhabitants. In the 18th century it was taken
                    several times by Russians and by Swedes, and in 1708 Peter I. ordered it to be
                    destroyed by fire. It was annexed to Russia in 1772. Of 40,500 inhabitants
                    two-thirds are Jews and the remainder White-Russians, with a few Poles (2500).
                    Its manufactures are without importance; but one branch of trade, namely, the
                    preparation of skins, has maintained itself for many centuries. The commerce is
                    mostly in the hands of Jews: corn, salt, sugar, and fish are brought from the
                    south, whilst skins and manufactured ware imported from Germany (partly by
                    smugglers) are sent to the southern provinces.</p>
