                    English general, was the second son of Sir Thomas Monk, a gentleman of good
                    family but in embarrassed circumstances, and was born at Potheridge, near
                    Torrington in Devonshire, on 6th December 1608. An exploit which brought him
                    within the reach of the law compelled him to begin his career as a soldier of
                    fortune at the age of seventeen. He acted under Sir R. Grenville as a volunteer
                    in the expedition to Cadiz, and the next year did notable service at the Isle of
                    Rhé.</p>
                <p>In 1629 Monk went to the Low Countries, the training ground for military men,
                    where in Oxford’s and in Goring’s regiments he obtained a high reputation for
                    courage and for a thorough knowledge of his trade. In 1638 he threw up his
                    commission in consequence of a quarrel with the Dutch civil authorities, came to
                    England, and obtained the lieutenant-colonelcy of Newport’s regiment during the
                    operations on the Scottish border. Here he showed his skill and coolness in the
                    dispositions by which he saved the English artillery at Newborn, though himself
                    destitute of ammunition; and in the councils of war he confidently voted with
                    Strafford for fighting, and against retreat or composition. One of Monk’s
                    biographers relates that he now thought of joining the adventurers who proposed
                    to colonize Madagascar. The Irish rebellion, however, offered <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0779-0752"/> more congenial employment, and in February 1641
                    he landed at Dublin as colonel of Lord Leicester’s regiment. Here he greatly
                    increased his reputation. Under the most difficult circumstances he was ever
                    cool, patient, vigorous. A rigid disciplinarian, he was always attentive to the
                    wants of his men, and completely won their confidence and affection. All the
                    qualities for which he was noted through life, the calculating selfishness which
                    kept him ever on the winning side and by which he accomplished his great
                    historic success, the imperturbable temper and impenetrable secrecy, were fully
                    displayed in this employment. He had but one interest, that of George Monk; and
                    to secure that interest he laboured, while retaining his freedom from party
                    ties, to make himself indispensable as a soldier. The governorship of Dublin was
                    vacant, and Monk was appointed by Leicester. But Charles I. overruled the
                    appointment in favour of Lord Lambert, and Monk, with great shrewdness, gave up
                    his claims. Ormond, however, who viewed him with suspicion as one of the two
                    officers who refused the oath to support the royal cause in England, sent him
                    under guard to Bristol. He now deemed it safest to affect Royalist views. His
                    value caused ' him to be received at once into Charles’s confidence; he was
                    appointed major-general of the Irish brigade, and served under Byron at the
                    siege of Nantwich. Here he was taken prisoner by Fairfax, on 25th January 1644,
                    in one of the most skilful operations of the war. After a short captivity in
                    Hull he was placed in the Tower, where he remained for three years (during which
                    his father died), beguiling his imprisonment by writing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations on Military and Political Affairs.</hi></p>
                <p>So long as the war lasted Monk could not be released. Charles, however, became a
                    prisoner; the troubles in Ireland made the parliament anxious to secure Monk’s
                    services, and he was told that if he would take the Covenant he might have an
                    important command. With some show of hesitation the terms were accepted, and,
                    after a service of two months in Lord Lisle’s abortive expedition, Monk was
                    placed in command of the British forces in the north of Ireland. Compelled in
                    1649 to conclude a pacification with the rebel O’Neill, he returned to England
                    after the king’s execution. In the same year he succeeded, by his elder
                    brother’s death, to the family estate. His idleness lasted but a short while.
                    Cromwell gave him a regiment and the command of the ordnance in the Scotch war
                    of 1650, and after the battle of Dunbar, in which he led the attack, Ee was deft
                    with 6000 men to subdue the country, which, after taking Edinburgh, Tantallon,
                    and Stirling castles, he did most completely in a few weeks. In 1651 he was
                    seized with fever, but recovered at Bath, and in the same year was appointed on
                    the commission for promoting the Union. In 1653, with Admiral Dean, he commanded
                    the British fleet against the Dutch, and on 2d and 3d June and 29th July fought
                    two of the most sanguinary naval battles on record, in which both his colleague
                    and Van Tromp were slain. A peace on very humiliating terms to the Dutch was
                    concluded, but policy shortly led Cromwell to allow milder conditions,—a
                    concession against which Monk strongly remonstrated. On his return he married
                    his mistress, Anne Clarges, a woman of the lowest extraction, “ever a plain
                    homely dowdy,” says Pepys, who, like other writers who mention her, is usually
                    still less complimentary. Monk was now sent to quell the revolt headed by
                    Middleton in Scotland, and, when this service was over, settled down to a steady
                    government of the country for the next five years. For fanaticism in any shape
                    he had no sympathy, and he set himself to diminish the influence of the
                    Presbyterian clergy—Cromwell’s chief opponents,—taking from them the power of
                    excommunication and their general assemblies, but allowing them to retain their
                    presbyteries. Equal repression was exercised against the nobility and gentry.
                    The timely discovery of a plot fomented by Overton for killing Monk on New
                    Year’s Day gave him an excuse for thoroughly purging his army of all
                    Anabaptists, Fifth Monarchy men, and other dangerous enthusiasts. It is doubtful
                    whether at this time Monk had proposed to himself the restoration of the king.
                    He probably had it always in his mind as a possibility, but he would run no
                    risks. His very reticence, however, caused alarm on one side and hope on the
                    other. In 1655 he received a letter from Charles II., a copy of which he at once
                    sent to Cromwell, whom, however, we find writing to him in 1657 in the following
                    terms: “There be that tell me that there is a certain cunning fellow in Scotland
                    called George Monk, who is said to lye in wait there to introduce Charles
                    Stuart; I pray you, use your diligence to apprehend him, and send him up to
                    me.”</p>
                <p>During the confusion which followed Cromwell’s death Monk remained silent and
                    watchful at Edinburgh, careful only to secure his hold on his troops. In July
                    1659 direct and tempting proposals were again made to him by the king. His
                    brother Nicholas, a clergyman, was employed by Sir J. Grenvil to bring to him
                    the substance of Charles’s letter. No bribe, however, could induce him to act
                    one moment before the right time. He bade his brother go back to his books, and
                    refused to entertain any proposal. But when Booth rose in Cheshire for the king,
                    so tempting did the opportunity seem that he was on the point of joining forces
                    with him; and a letter was written to the Rump parliament threatening force if
                    it did not at once fill up its numbers. His habitual caution, however, induced
                    him to wait until the next post from England, and the next post brought news of
                    Booth’s defeat. On 17 th October he heard of Lambert’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >coup</hi><hi rend="italic">d’état.</hi> From that moment his plan of action
                    seems to have been settled. In most vehement language he discarded the idea of
                    restoring Charles, and, with admirable perception of the state of English
                    feeling, took for his principles that in all cases the army must obey the Civil
                    government, and that the civil government must be parliamentary. At present the
                    Rump was crushed by the military party; the first thing, therefore, to be done
                    was to free it. His army underwent a second purging of disaffection, and he then
                    issued a declaration embodying the principles mentioned above, and wrote to
                    Lenthall the speaker, and to the military party to the same effect. In a treaty
                    with the Committee of Safety his commissioners, who were to treat only on the
                    basis of the restoration of parliament, were outwitted. Monk at once refused to
                    accept the terms proposed, and marched to Berwick, having received an offer from
                    Fairfax of assistance if he would promise that the secluded members should be
                    restored. Meanwhile Lambert had marched northwards to oppose his advance.</p>
                <p>Monk’s action gave fresh heart to the adherents of the parliament. The old
                    council of state met, and named him general of all the forces; the fleet and the
                    Irish army, hitherto hostile, came round to his side, and so did Whetham at
                    Portsmouth. Monk now, in the depth of winter, crossed the Tweed at Çoldstream
                    and marched by Morpeth to Newcastle, receiving letters on his way from the lord
                    mayor and corporation of London urging him to declare for a free parliament. On
                    his approach Lambert’s army fell away from their general, and no obstacle
                    remained on the path to London. At York, when urged by Fairfax, he refused to
                    declare for the king, and is said to have caned an officer who affirmed that
                    such was his design. The parliament now ordered him to come to London.
                    Fleetwood’s army which occupied the city was, however, a great obstacle; and it
                    was not until the parliament<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n782/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0782-0753"/>, in accordance with his desire, had arranged for
                    its dispersion that he would enter with his troops. Even now his intentions were
                    strictly concealed; the spies set upon him by the various anxious parties were
                    baffled by his impenetrable reserve. He was careful to appear only as the
                    servant of parliament, but when he was desired to take the oath of abjuration he
                    skilfully evaded the request. The city, always jealous of the Rump, now refused
                    to pay taxes except at the orders of a free parliament. Monk, in consequence,
                    was ordered to march his troops into the city, take down the chains and posts,
                    and unhinge the gates. He obeyed these unpleasant orders to the letter on 10th
                    February, thus permitting the hatred against the Rump to rise to the height,
                    while he showed how unwilling an instrument of its will he was. On the 11 th,
                    however, he threw off the mask, and wrote to the Rump, peremptorily ordering
                    them to admit the secluded members, and to arrange for the dissolution of
                    parliament by 6th May. On 21st February he conducted the secluded members to
                    their seats. At the same time he refused to restore the Lords, and issued an
                    order disowning Charles Stuart to all officers commanding garrisons. Every day
                    brought him fresh opportunities for tact or evasion. His partisans urged him to
                    take the protectorate himself; another party pressed upon him to accomplish the
                    restoration by the army alone; a body of his officers sent him a declaration
                    expressing their fears that his action would lead to the restoration of
                    monarchy; the parliament tried to make him their own by the offer of Hampton
                    Court. His trained habits of dissimulation and evasion, assisted now and again
                    by downright lying, carried him triumphantly through all these dangers, and at
                    length the dissolution of parliament on 17 th March removed his greatest
                    difficulties.</p>
                <p>It was now that, with the utmost secrecy, he gave an interview for the first time
                    to the king’s agent Grenvil, and by him sent to Charles the conditions of his
                    restoration, afterwards embodied in the Declaration of Breda. For himself at
                    present he would accept nothing but a royal commission as captain-general, which
                    he carefully kept to himself. All parties were anxious to gain the credit of the
                    now certain restoration. The Presbyterians in particular, fearful of the king
                    being restored without terms, did their best to discredit Monk and to impose the
                    old Isle of Wight conditions; but in vain. The new parliament was elected, and
                    the House of Lords restored; an insurrection by Lambert, who had escaped from
                    the Tower, was quelled by Monk’s prompt measures, and on the 25th of April he
                    received the solemn thanks of both Houses, and the title of captain-general of
                    the land forces. Even yet the farce was kept up. Monk received with feigned
                    surprise the king’s official letter from Grenvil, denied all knowledge of its
                    contents, and handed it over sealed to the council, who decided to defer opening
                    it until the meeting of parliament on the 1st of May.</p>
                <p>With the Restoration the historic interest of Monk’s career ceases. The rude
                    soldier of fortune had played the game with incomparable dexterity, and had won
                    the stakes. He was made gentleman of the bedchamber, knight of the Garter,
                    master of the horse, commander-in-chief, and duke of Albemarle, and had a
                    pension of &lt;£7000 a year allotted him. His utmost desires were satisfied, and
                    he made no attempt to compete further in a society in which neither he nor his
                    vulgar wife could ever be at home, and which he heartily despised. As long as
                    the army existed of which he was the idol, and of which the last service was to
                    suppress Venner’s revolt, he was a person not to be displeased. But he entirely
                    concurred in the measure for disbanding it, and thenceforward his influence was
                    small, though men’s eyes turned naturally to him in emergency. In the trial of
                    the regicides he was on the side of moderation, and his interposition saved
                    Hazelrig’s life; but his action at the time of Argyll’s trial will always be
                    regarded as the most dishonourable episode in his career. In 1664 he had charge
                    of the admiralty when James was in command of the fleet, and when in 1665 London
                    was deserted on account of the plague, Monk, with all the readiness of a man
                    accustomed to obey without thinking of risk, remained in charge of the
                    government of the city. Once more, at the end of this year, he was called upon
                    to fight, having a joint commission with Prince Rupert against the Dutch. The
                    whole burden of the preparations fell upon him. On 23d April 1666 the admirals
                    joined the fleet, and on the 1st of June began a battle near Dunkirk which
                    lasted four days, followed by another on 23d July, in which Monk showed all his
                    old coolness and skill, and a reckless daring which had seemed hitherto foreign
                    to his character. His last service was in 1667, when the Dutch fleet sailed up
                    the Thames, and Monk, ill as he was, hastened to Chatham to oppose their further
                    progress. From that time he lived much in privacy, and died of dropsy on the 3d
                    of December 1669.</p>
