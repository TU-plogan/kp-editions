                <p><label type="entry">ST LOUIS</label>, a city of the United States, chief city of
                    the State of Missouri, is situated on the west bank of the Mississippi river, 20
                    miles below its confluence with the Missouri river and 200 miles above the
                    influx of the Ohio, in 38° 38' 3"·6 N. lat. and 90° 12' 17" W. long. It is
                    distant by river about 1200 miles from New Orleans, and 729 from St Paul at the
                    head of navigation on the Mississippi, and occupies a position near the centre
                    of the great basin through which the mingled flood of the Mississippi and
                    Missouri and their extensive system of tributaries is carried to the Gulf of
                    Mexico. The site embraces a series of undulations extending westwards with a
                    general direction nearly parallel to the river, which at this point makes a wide
                    curve to the east. The extreme length in a straight line is 17 miles, the
                    greatest width 6·60 miles, the length of river front 19·15 miles, and the area
                    (including considerable territory at present suburban in character) 62½ square
                    miles. The elevation of the city directrix above the waters of the Gulf of
                    Mexico is 428 feet, that of the highest point of ground in the city above the
                    directrix is 203 feet; the extreme high-water mark above the directrix is 7 feet
                    7 inches, and the extreme low-water mark below the same is 33 feet 9¾ inches.
                    The elevated site of the city prevents any serious interruption of business by
                    high water, even in seasons of unusual floods.</p>
                <p>The plan of the city is rectilinear, the ground being laid out in blocks about
                    300 feet square, with the general direction of street lines north-south and
                    east-west. The wharf or river front is known as the Levee or Front Street, the
                    next street west is Main Street, and the next Second, and thence the streets
                    going north-south are, with few exceptions, in numerical order (Third, Fourth,
                    &amp;c.). Fifth Street has recently been named Broadway. The east-west streets
                    bear regular names (Chestnut, Pine, Washington, Franklin, and the like). Market
                    Street is regarded as the middle of the city, and the numbering on the
                    intersecting streets commences at that line, north and south respectively. One
                    hundred house numbers are allotted to each block, and the blocks follow in
                    numerical order. The total length of paved streets in St Louis is 316 miles, of
                    unpaved streets and roads 427, total 743 miles. In the central streets, subject
                    to heavy traffic, the pavement is of granite blocks; wood, asphalt, and
                    limestone blocks and Telford pavements are also used. There are nearly 300 miles
                    of mac-</p>
                <p>adamized streets, including the roadways in the new limits. The length of paved
                    alleys is about 66 miles. The city has an extensive sewer system (total length
                    223 miles), and, owing to the elevation of the residence and business districts
                    above the river, the drainage is admirable. The largest sewer, Mill Creek (20
                    feet wide and 15 feet high), runs through the middle of the city, from west to
                    east, following the course of a stream that existed in earlier days. The
                    water-supply is derived from the Mississippi; the water is pumped into settling
                    basins at Bissell’s Point, and thence into the distributing pipes, the surplus
                    flowing to the storage reservoir on Compton Hill, which has a capacity of
                    60,000,000 gallons. The length of water-pipe is nearly 250 miles; the capacity
                    of the low-service engines which pump the water into the settling basins is
                    56,000,000 gallons in twenty-four hours, and that of the high-service engines
                    which supply the distributing system 70,000,000 gallons. The average daily
                    consumption in twenty-four hours is nearly 28,000,000 gallons. The works, which
                    are owned by the city, cost over 66,000,000. Among the more<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0203-0184"/> important public buildings are the new
                    custom-house and post-office, erected at a cost of over $5,000,000; the
                    merchants’ exchange, which contains a grand hall 221 feet 10 inches in length by
                    62 feet 10 inches in width and 60 feet in height; the court-house, where the
                    civil courts hold their sessions; the four courts and jail, in which building
                    are the headquarters of the police department and the chambers of the criminal
                    courts; the cotton exchange; the new exposition and music-hall building on Olive
                    Street, erected by public subscription; and the Crow Museum of Fine Arts. The
                    present city-hall is a large but hardly ornamental edifice. The mercantile
                    library, on Fifth and Locust Streets, contains nearly 65,000 volumes and also a
                    valuable art collection. The public school library in the polytechnic building
                    has about 55,000 volumes. There are six handsome theatres and various other
                    smaller places of amusement. The public school system of St Louis includes the
                    kindergarten (for which St Louis has become somewhat celebrated), the
                    grammar-schools (including eight grades, of a year each), and a high school,
                    besides the normal school and a school for deaf mutes. The public schools
                    naturally absorb much the largest number of pupils; but the parochial schools
                    and the private schools gathered about the Washington university are also much
                    frequented. The number of pupils in 1883-84 was in the normal school 64, high
                    school 783, grammar-schools 52,280, total in day schools 53,127; total in day
                    and evening schools 56,366. The total number of public school buildings is 104,
                    and the value of property used for school purposes $3,229,148; all the school
                    edifices are substantial and convenient, and many architecturally attractive.
                    The receipts of the public school system for 1884 were $941,332, and the total
                    expenditure $934,609, the amount paid to teachers being $632,873. Of parochial
                    schools there are about 75. The Washington and St Louis universities are old and
                    well-established institutions. There are also the Mary Institute and the manual
                    training school, both connected with Washington university, the college of the
                    Christian Brothers, convent seminaries, and numerous medical colleges. In
                    addition there are art schools, singing and gymnastic societies, and other
                    similar organizations and establishments. There are published in St Louis four
                    daily newspapers in English and four in German, and also a number of weekly
                    publications.</p>
                <p>There are 16 Baptist churches, 8 Congregational, 13 Episcopal, 25 German
                    Evangelical and Lutheran, 6 Hebrew congregations, 18 Methodist Episcopal, 8
                    Methodist Episcopal Church (South), 25 Presbyterian, 45 Roman Catholic, and 3
                    Unitarian. Many of the buildings are of imposing proportions, built of stone,
                    massive in character, and with lofty spires. The Roman Catholic cathedral, built
                    in 1830, is the oldest church now in use. On the high ground in the
                    central-western portion of the city (Stoddard’s Addition) will be found most of
                    the costly church buildings, whilst in the northern and southern portions of the
                    city there are very few indeed.</p>
                <p>The parks and squares of St Louis number 19, covering nearly 2100 acres. Tower
                    Grove Park, in the south-western suburbs, containing about 266 acres, was
                    presented by Mr Henry Shaw. The smaller parks are situated to the east of Grand
                    Avenue, and the driving parks in the suburbs, —O’Fallon Park (158 acres) at the
                    northern extremity of the city, Forest Park (1372 acres) west of the central
                    portion, Tower Grove in the south-west, and Carondelet (180 acres) in the south.
                    In the immediate vicinity of Tower Grove Park are the Missouri Botanical
                    Gardens, established by Mr Henry Shaw, and containing the most extensive
                    botanical collection in the United States. In addition to the parks, the Fair
                    Grounds in the north-west should be mentioned, where the annual fair is held,
                    and where there is a permanent zoological department. An amphitheatre, capable
                    of seating between 20,000 and 30,000 spectators, and a race-course with a most
                    elaborate grand stand, are among the other features. There are various
                    beer-gardens in the city, largely frequented as pleasure-resorts. There are
                    about 120 miles of street railways in operation.</p>

                <p>The figures of the United States census are strictly confined to municipal
                    limits, and do not include the residents of East St Louis and of various
                    suburban localities, properly a part of the city population. In 1880 the
                    population (179,520 males, 170,998 females) was divided as follows:—native,
                    245,505; foreign-born, 105,013. Of the latter 36,309 came from Great Britain
                    (28,536 Irish) and 54,901 from Germany. The death-rate per thousand in 1882 was
                    19·6, in 1883 it was 20·4, and in 1885 (population being estimated at 400,000)
                    it was 19·7.</p>
                <p>The police force, including detectives and employes, numbers about 500 men. The
                    fire brigade numbers 250 men, with 22 enginehouses. The city has three public
                    hospitals, an asylum for the insane, a poorhouse, a workhouse for the
                    confinement and employment of prisoners charged with petty offences, and a house
                    of refuse which is a reformatory institution for juvenile offenders and for the
                    education of children thrown upon the care of the city by abandonment or
                    otherwise. The number of asylums, hospitals, and other institutions supported by
                    private charity is very large.</p>

                    county of the State, but exists as a separate municipality. It was formerly
                    embraced in St Louis county, and was within the jurisdiction anil taxing power
                    of a city and county government. The State constitution was revised in 1875 and
                    two years later the separation of the city and the county government was
                    effected, the former being reorganized under the present charter. The city
                    levies and collects municipal and State revenues within its limits, and manages
                    its own affairs, free from all outside control, except that of the legislature
                    of the State. The voters of the city have the right to amend the charter at
                    intervals of two years at a general or special election, —provided the proposed
                    amendments have been duly sanctioned and submitted to the people by the
                    municipal assem-</p>

                <p>tive power of the city is in the hands of a council and a house of delegates,
                    styled collectively the municipal assem bly. The council is composed of thirteen
                    mem bers, elected for four years by the voters of the city generally, and the
                    house of delegates con sists of one mem ber from each of the twenty-eight wards,
                    elected for two years. The following officers are elected for a term of four
                    years: — mayor, comptroller, au ditor, treasurer, registrar, col lector,
                    recorder of deeds, inspector of weights and measures, sheriff, coroner, marshal,

                    elective officers, including the members of the board of public improvements,
                    are nominated by the mayor and approved by the council, and the appointments are
                    made at the beginning of the third year of the mayor’s term, so as to remove the
                    distribution of municipal patronage from the influences of a general city
                    election. The power of the mayor and council touching appointments to office and
                    removals is subject to certain reciprocal checks.</p>
                <p>The bonded debt of St Louis at the close of the fiscal year, 13th April 1885, was
                    $22,016,000. This debt is reduced each year by the operation of the sinking
                    fund. The city has no floating debt. The receipts for the fiscal year ending
                    13th April 1885, deducting proceeds of revenue bonds and special deposits, were
                    $5,659,086, or with balance in treasury at opening of year $6,514,877. The total
                    expenditure was $5,681,557. The city tax rate for the year 1884 was $1·75 on the
                    $100. During the last few years the rate of interest on the bonded debt has been
                    reduced from 6 and 7 per cent. to 5 per cent., and more recently to 4 per cent.
                    Most of the outstanding bonds are held in England and Germany. All

                    $69,846,845, in 1870 it was $147,969,660, in 1880 $160,493,000, and in 1885

                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> Subjoined are a few of the more important facts
                    and figures respecting the commerce of St Louis. In 1884 there were 6,440,787
                    tons of freight received by rail and 520,350 by river, making a total of
                    6,961,137 tons. In the same year there were shipped by rail 3,611,419 tons and
                    by river 514,910 tons (total 4,126,329). The total receipts of grain for 1884,
                    including wheat reduced to flour, were 52,776,832 bushels, as against 51,983,494
                    bushels in the previous year. During 1884 the amount of flour manufactured was
                    1,960,737 barrels, and the amount that changed hands 4,757,079 barrels; 302,534
                    bales of cotton, 19,426 hogsheads of tobacco, and 118,484,220 lb of sugar were
                    received; and 193,875,479 lb of pork in various forms were shipped. There are
                    thirteen tobacco manufactories, with a production in 1884 of 22,631,104 lb. In
                    live stock, lumber, hides, wool, salt, lead, and a long list of other
                    commodities the business is large and increasing. Extensive stock-yards are
                    established in the northern part of the city, and also in East St Louis, where
                    they are known as the national stock-yards, and cover a space of over 600 acres.
                    In 1884 there were imported— cattle, 450,717; sheep, 380,822; pigs, 1,474,475;
                    horses and mules, 41,870. The shipments in the same year were—cattle, 315,433;
                    sheep, 248,545; pigs, 678,874; horses and mules, 39,544. There are twelve grain
                    elevators, with a total capacity for bulk grain of 10,950,000 bushels and
                    415,000 sacks. The coal received during the year amounted to 52,349,600 bushels.
                    The foreign value of imports for the year was $2,586,876, and the collections at
                    the custom-house were $1,463,495.</p>
                <p>Among the more important manufactures may be mentioned those of iron and steel,
                    glass, flour, sugar, beer, bagging, prepared foods, tobacco, boots and shoes,
                    furniture, planed and sawed lumber, wire and wire-work, carriages and waggons,
                    foundry and machine-shop products, hardware, agricultural implements, &amp;c.
                    Meat packing is also an important industry. The summary of manufactures in the
                    United States census of 1880 shows 2924 establishments, having a capital of
                    $50,832,885; amount paid in wages during the year, $17,743,532; value of
                    materials, $75,379,867; value of products, $114,333,375. These figures ought
                    probably to be largely increased now (1886). In the wholesale grocery trade St
                    Louis is ahead of nearly all the inland cities of the Union. There are between
                    twenty and thirty wholesale houses, and it is estimated that the annual sales
                    exceed $30,000,000. The Belcher sugar-refinery is able to turn out 1200 barrels
                    a day. The capital employed in the wholesale and retail dry goods establishments
                    is estimated at between $10,000,000 and $12,000,000, and the annual amount of
                    business at $35,000,000 to $40,000,000. The brewing business of St Louis has had
                    an astonishing development, and its product is shipped to all parts of the
                    world. It employs over $8,000,000 of capital, and pays out in wages over
                    $2,000,000 per annum. The ale and beer shipments during 1884 numbered 1,834,545
                    packages. The brick-making industry has recently become important, and the hard
                    red brick for building and the fire brick produced in St Louis are among the
                    best to be found in the United States. In 1884 there were eighteen State banks
                    and six national banks representing—capital and surplus, $14,742,123; savings
                    and time deposits, $9,102,021; current deposits, $29,000,691; circulation,
                    $674,150; total, $53,518,985. The clearings for 1884 amount to $785,202,177, and
                    the balances to $125,260,945, making a total of $910,463,122.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> St Louis is one of the most important railroad
                    centres in the United States; the nineteen lines which run trains into the Union
                    depot represent nearly 20,000 miles of railway. The Union passenger depot,
                    contiguous to the business centre of the city, is connected with the bridge over
                    the Mississippi by a tunnel. The buildings are of a temporary character, and are
                    not adequate to the enormous business transacted; a new depot of imposing
                    proportions is now in contemplation. Over 150 passenger trains arrive and depart
                    daily. The tunnel already referred to commences a few hundred yards east of the
                    Union depot. It has double tracks throughout its length, which is about 1 mile,
                    and is supplied with electric lights, ventilating shafts, and the best
                    appliances for safety and convenience. It is leased by the Wabash, St Louis, and
                    Pacific and the Missouri Pacific Railroad Companies, which are also the lessees
                    of the bridge. The bridge across the Mississippi river at St Louis is one of the
                    most remarkable structures in the world in character and magnitude. It consists
                    of three arches, the two side spans being 502 feet in the clear and the centre
                    span 520 feet, and carries a roadway for ordinary traffic 54 feet wide and below
                    this two lines of rail. The dimensions of the abutments and piers are as follows

                <p>The foundations of abutments and piers rest on solid rock. The two piers and the
                    east abutment were sunk by means of pneumatic caissons. The greatest depth below
                    the surface at which work was done was 110 feet, the air-pressure in the caisson
                    being 49 lb. Each arch consists of four equal ribs; each rib is composed of two
                    circular members, 12 feet apart, which are connected by a single system of
                    diagonal braces. The circular members consist of steel tubes, which are 12 feet
                    long and 18 inches in diameter; each tube is composed of 6 steel staves, varying
                    in thickness between 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    16</hi> and 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>
                    inches. These staves are held together by a steel envelope, a quarter of an inch
                    thick. The tubes are joined together by couplings, and the end tubes are rigidly
                    connected with wrought-iron skewbacks, which are fixed to the masonry by long
                    bolts. The arches were erected without using any false work. Work on the bridge
                    was commenced March 1868, and it was opened for traffic on 4th July 1874. The
                    total cost of bridge and approaches was $6,536,730. The traffic across the
                    bridge is rapidly developing. In 1876 the gross earnings were $448,447 (loaded
                    waggons, 45,027; railway passengers, 496,686); in 1884 the gross earnings were
                    $1,520,483 (loaded waggons, 172,730; railway passengers, 1,333,360); a total of
                    2,225,994 tons was carried; and the total number of cars which crossed the
                    bridge was 472,324.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The first permanent settlement on the site of St
                    Louis was made in February 1764, and was in the nature of a trading post,
                    established by Pierre Laclede Liguest. Long prior to this event there had been
                    some exploration of the vast regions of the Mississippi and its tributaries by
                    Marquette, Joliet, La Salle, Hennepin, and others; but, although a few widely
                    separated military and trading posts had been established, there was no accurate
                    knowledge of the character and resources of the country. Laclede’s expedition
                    was nearly contemporaneous with the treaty of Paris, 1763, by which the title of
                    France to the regions in the valley of the Mississippi was practically
                    extinguished, Spain becoming owner of all Louisiana west of the Mississippi, and
                    England of all territory east of that river, excepting New Orleans. The few
                    French forts north of the Ohio were nominally surrendered to the English,
                    including Vincennes, Cahokia, Kaskaskia, and Fort de Chartres; but there was no
                    immediate formal assertion of English control, and French sentiments and manners
                    and customs remained undisturbed. In 1771 St Louis was formally occupied by a
                    small body of Spanish troops, commanded by Don Pedro Piernas, and a period of
                    somewhat over thirty years of Spanish rule followed, during which few local
                    events of noteworthy character occurred. On 25th May 1780—the festival of Corpus
                    Christi—the post, or village, was attacked by Indians, and about thirty of the
                    citizens were killed; but the savages were beaten off and did not renew the
                    attack. In 1800 Spain ceded back to France all her territory of Louisiana, and
                    three years later—30th April 1803—France ceded to the United States all her
                    right, title, and interest in the territory for eighty million francs. At this
                    time St Louis and the adjacent districts had a population of not over 3000, and
                    the total population of Upper Louisiana was between 8000 and 9000, including
                    1300 Negroes. There were not over 200 houses in the embryo city, which consisted
                    mainly of two streets parallel to the river. For fifty or sixty years after the
                    landing of Laclede the progress of the town was necessarily slow. In 1810 the
                    population was less than 1500, and in 1830 it had not reached 6000. From the
                    latter date progress became steady and rapid, and the real growth of the city
                    was compressed within half a century. An extensive conflagration occurred in
                    1849, which destroyed most of the business houses on the Levee and Main Street.
                    During the Civil War the commercial advancement of St Louis was seriously
                    retarded; but the city continued to expand in population owing to its
                    advantageous geographical position. (D. H. M‘A.)<pb break="no"
