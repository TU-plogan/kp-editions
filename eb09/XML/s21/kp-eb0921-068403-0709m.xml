                    support of 1509.</p></note> at Tudela in Navarre (according to his Vienne
                    deposition), his father being Hernando Villanueva, a notary of good family in
                    Aragon. His surname is given by himself as Serveto in his earliest works, “per
                    Michaelem Serueto, alias Reues.” Later he Latinized it into Servetus, and even
                    when writing in French (1553) he signs “Michel Seruetus.”<note anchored="true"

                    of Oecolampadius to the senate of Basel (1531), and is never used by himself.
                    “Servede” is an imaginary form.</p></note> It is not certain that he was related
                    to his contemporary Andres Serveto of Aninon, the Bologna jurist; but it is
                    probable that he was of the same family as the Spanish ecclesiastic Marco
                    Antonio Serveto de Reves (d. 1598), born at Villanueva de Sigena in the diocese
                    of Huesca (Latassa, <hi rend="italic">Biblioteca Nueva,</hi> 1798, i. 609).
                    Servetus, who at Geneva makes “Villeneufve” his birthplace, fixes it in the
                    adjoining diocese of Lerida, in which there are three villages named Vilanova.
                    Having apparently had his early training at the university of Saragossa, he was
                    sent by his father to study law at Toulouse, where he first became acquainted
                    with the Bible (1528). From 1525 he had found a patron in Juan de Quintana (d.
                    1534), a Franciscan promoted in 1530 to be confessor to Charles V. In the train
                    of Quintana he witnessed at Bologna the coronation of Charles in February 1530,
                    visited Augsburg, and perhaps saw Luther at Coburg. The spectacle of the
                    adoration of the pope at Bologna had strongly impressed his mind in an
                    anti-papal direction. He left Quintana, and, after visiting Lyons and Geneva,
                    repaired to Oecolampadius at Basel, whence he pushed on to Bucer and Capito at
                    Strasburg. A crude, but very original and earnest, theological essay, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Trinitatis Erroribus,</hi> printed at Hagenau in 1531,
                    attracted considerable attention; Melanchthon writes “Servetum multum lego.” It
                    was followed in 1532 by a revised presentation of its argument. We next find
                    Servetus at Lyons, in 1535, as an editor of scientific works for the printing
                    firm of Trechsel, under the name of Michel de Villeneufve or Michael
                    Villa-novanus, which he used without interruption till the year<pb break="no"

                    Symphorien Champier (Campegius) (1472-1539), whose profession he resolved to
                    follow. Accordingly he went (1536) to Paris, where he studied medicine under
                    Johann Günther, Jacques Dubois, and Jean Fernel. It was in 1536, when Calvin was
                    on a hurried and final visit to France, that he first met Servetus at Paris,
                    and, as he himself says, proposed to set him right in theological matters.<note

                    Servetus the challenger and the date 1534.</p></note> As assistant to Günther,
                    Servetus succeeded the famous anatomist Vesalius; Günther, who pays the highest
                    tribute to his general culture, describes him as specially skilled in dissection
                    and “vix ulli secundus” in knowledge of Galen. He graduated in arts and asserts
                    that he also graduated in medicine, published a set of lectures on syrups (the
                    most popular of his works), lectured on geometry and astrology, and defended by
                    counsel a suit brought against him (March 1538) by the medical faculty on the
                    ground of his astrological lectures. In June 1538 we find him at the university
                    of Louvain (where he was inscribed on the roll of students as Michael Villanova
                    on 14th December 1537), studying theology and Hebrew, explaining to his father
                    (then resident at San Gil) his removal from Paris, early in September 1537, as a
                    consequence of the death (8th August) of his master (el senor mi maestro), and
                    proposing to return to Paris as soon as peace was proclaimed. After this he
                    practised medicine for a short time at Avignon, and for a longer period at
                    Charlieu (where he contemplated marriage, but was deterred by a physical
                    impediment). In September 1540 he entered himself for further study in the
                    medical school at Montpellier. In 1541 he resumed editorial work for the Lyons
                    booksellers, to whose neighbourhood he had returned.</p>
                <p>Among the attendants upon his Paris lectures had been a distinguished
                    ecclesiastic, Pierre Paulmier, since 1528 archbishop of Vienne. Paulmier invited
                    Servetus to Vienne as his confidential physician. He acted in this capacity for
                    twelve years (1541-53), and made money. Outwardly he conformed to Roman Catholic
                    worship; in private he pursued his theological speculations. It is probable that
                    in 1541 he had been rebaptized. He opened a correspondence with Calvin, and late
                    in 1545, or very early in 1546, he forwarded to Calvin the manuscript of a
                    revised and enlarged edition of his theological tracts, and expressed a wish to
                    visit him at Geneva. Calvin replied on 23d February 1546, in a letter which is
                    lost, but in which, he says, he expressed himself “plus durement que ma coustume
                    ne porte.” On the same day he wrote to Guillaume Farel, “si venerit, modo valeat
                    mea autoritas, vivum exire nunquam patiar,” and to Pierre Viret in the same
                    terms. Servetus had fair warning that if he went to Geneva it was at his peril.
                    In his letter to Abel Pouppin (in or about 1547), after stating that he had
                    failed to recover his manuscript from Calvin, he says, “mihi ob eam rem
                    moriendum esse certo scio.” The volume of theological tracts, again recast, was
                    declined by a Basel publisher in April 1552, but an edition of 1000 copies was
                    secretly printed at Vienne. It was finished on 3d January 1553; the bulk of the
                    impression was privately consigned to Lyons and Frankfort, for the Easter
                    market. But on 26th February a letter, enclosing a sheet of the printed book,
                    and revealing the secret of its authorship, was written from Geneva by Guillaume
                    H. C. de Trye, formerly <hi rend="italic">échevin</hi> of Lyons, to his cousin
                    Antoine Arneys in that city. This letter bears no sign of dictation by Calvin;
                    the history of De Trye shows that it may have been instigated in part by
                    personal ill-feeling towards the Lyons booksellers. But Calvin furnished
                    (reluctantly, according to De Trye) the samples of Servetus’s handwriting
                    enclosed in a subsequent letter, for the express purpose of securing his
                    conviction.</p>
                <p>The inquisitor-general at Lyons, Matthieu Ory, set to work on 12th March;
                    Servetus was interrogated on 16th March and arrested on 4th April. Under
                    examination his defence was that, in correspondence with Calvin, he had assumed
                    the character of Servetus for purposes of discussion. At 4 A.M. on 7th April he
                    escaped from his prison, evidently by connivance. He took the road for Spain,
                    but turned back in fear of arrest. How he spent the next four months is not
                    known; Calvin believed he was wandering in Italy; the idea that he lay concealed
                    in Geneva was first started by Spon. On Saturday 12th August he rode into
                    Louyset, a village on the French side of Geneva. Next morning he walked into
                    Geneva, and ordered a boat, to take him towards Zurich on his way for Naples. He
                    was recognized that day at church and immediately arrested. The process against
                    him lasted from 14th August to 26th October, when sentence “estre brusle tout
                    vyfz” was passed, and carried out next day at Champel (27th October 1553).
                    Calvin would have had him beheaded. Meanwhile the civil tribunal at Vienne had
                    ordered (17th June) that he be fined and burned alive; the sentence of the
                    ecclesiastical tribunal at Vienne was delayed till 23d December. Jacques
                    Charmier, a priest in Servetus’s confidence, was condemned to three years’
                    imprisonment at Vienne. The life of Servetus is full of puzzles; his writings
                    give the impression not only of quick genius but also of transparent sincerity;
                    they throw, however, little light on the mysterious parts of his story. Don
                    Pedro Gonzalez de Velasco (see his <hi rend="italic">Miguel Servet,</hi> 1880)
                    has placed a statue of Servetus in the porch of the Instituto An tropologico at
                    Madrid.</p>
                <p>The opinions of Servetus, marked by strong individuality, are not easily
                    described in the terms of any current system. His anabaptism, with his denial of
                    the tripersonality of the Godhead and of the eternity of the Son, made his views
                    abhorrent to Catholics and Protestants alike; while his intense Biblicism, his
                    passionate devotion to the person of Christ, and the essentially Christocentric
                    character of his view of the universe give him an almost unique place in the
                    history of religious thought. He is sometimes classed with the Arians; but he
                    endorses in his own way the homoousian formula, and speaks contemptuously of
                    Arius as “Christi gloriae incapacissimus.” He has had many critics, some
                    apologists <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Postel and Lincurius), and few
                    followers. The fifteen condemnatory clauses, introducing the sentence of
                    Servetus at Geneva, set forth in detail that he had been found guilty of
                    heresies, expressed in blasphemous language, against the true foundation of the
                    Christian religion. It is curious that one instance of his injurious language is
                    his employment of the term “trinitaires” to denote “ceux qui croyent en la
                    Trinite.” No law, current in Geneva, has ever been adduced as enacting the
                    capital sentence. Claude Rigot, the procureur-général, examined Servetus with a
                    view to show that his legal education must have familiarized him with the
                    provisions of the code of Justinian to this effect; but in 1535 all the old laws
                    on the subject of religion had been set aside at Geneva; the only civil penalty
                    for religion, retained by the edicts of 1543, was banishment. The Swiss
                    churches, while agreeing to condemn Servetus, give no hint of capital punishment
                    in their letters of advice. The extinct law seems to have been arbitrarily
                    revived for the occasion. A valuable controversy followed, on the question of
                    executing heretics, in which Beza (for), Mino Celsi (against), and several
                    caustic anonymous writers took part.</p>
                <p>The works of Servetus are not so rare as is often supposed, but the most common
                    are his earliest, in which he approaches nearer to the position afterwards taken
                    by F. Socinus than he does in his more matured publications. The following is an
                    enumeration of them in the order of their appearance. (1) <hi rend="italic">De

                    of theological tracts written in a nervous and epigrammatic style and with great
                    command of very various learning; the <hi rend="italic">Apologia</hi> addressed

                <p>The literature relating to Servetus is very large, but the following are some of
                    the most important pieces. Calvin’s <hi rend="italic">Defensio Orthodoae

                    misconceptions respecting the opinions of Servetus and his attitude on his
                    trial. De la Roche's <hi rend="italic">Historical Account,</hi> &amp;c. <hi

                    later researches. Trechsel, in <hi rend="italic">Die prot. Antitrinitarier vor
                    F. Socin,</hi> Ac., bk. 1., 1839, 8vo, uses all available materials up to date.
                    Since then the investigations of H. Tollin (published in a series of some forty
                    separate articles in various journals from 1874 to 1885) have thrown light on
                    every portion of the subject. The records of the Geneva trial, first published
                    by De la Roche, and reproduced in Rilliet's <hi rend="italic">Relation,</hi>
                    Ac., 1844, 8vo, and elsewhere, are best given in vol. viii. (1870) of the
                    edition of Calvin’s works by Baum, Cunitz, and Reuss; Roget, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. du Peuple de Genève,</hi> vol. iv., 1877, has a good account
                    of both trials. The passage describing the pulmonary circulation is first
                    noticed by W. Wotton, in <hi rend="italic">Reflections upon Ancient and Mod.
                    Learning,</hi> 1694, and has given rise to a literature of its own;—see
                    especially Tollin’s <hi rend="italic">Die Entdeckung des Blutkreislaufs,</hi>
                    Ac., 1876, Huxley, in <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Rev.,</hi> February 1878;
                    and Tollin’s <hi rend="italic">Kritische Bemerkungen über Harvey und seine
                    Vorgänger,</hi> 1882. Other physiological speculations of Servetus are noted by
                    Sigmond <hi rend="italic">(The Unnoticed Theories of Servetus,</hi> 1826); but
                    it has escaped Sigmond that Servetus had an idea of the composition of water and
                    of air. As a thinker, Servetus is claimed on superficial grounds by Unitarians
                    (see Wallace, <hi rend="italic">Antitrin. Biog.,</hi> 1850, i. 420), who have
                    written several accounts of him, of which R. Wright’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apology,</hi> Ac., 1807, 8vo, is the worst, and J. S. Porter’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Servetus and Calvin,</hi> Ac., 1854, 8vo, perhaps the best.
                    Saisset, in <hi rend="italic">Rev. des Deux Mondes,</hi> 1848, treats Servetus
                    as a pantheist; he is followed by Willis, in his <hi rend="italic">Servetus and
                    Calvin,</hi> 1877, 8vo, a most unsatisfactory book (comp. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theol. Rev.,</hi> April and July 1878). Tollin’s <hi rend="italic">Das
                    Lehrsystem Michael Servers,</hi> 3 vols., 1876-78, 8vo, and Pünjer’s compendious
                    <hi rend="italic">De Michaelis Served Doctrina,</hi> Ac., 1876, 8vo, are
                    valuable digests of his opinions, from different points of view. Of Servetus's
                    personal character the best vindication is Tollin’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characterbild Michael Servers,</hi> 1876, 8vo (in French with additions by
                    Dardier, <hi rend="italic">Portrait Caractère,</hi> 1879, 8vo). His story has
                    been dramatized by Max Ring, <hi rend="italic">Die Genfer</hi> (1850), by José
                    Echegaray, <hi rend="italic">La Muerte en los Labios</hi> (1880), and by Albert
                    Hamann, <hi rend="italic">Servet</hi> (1881). The recent discovery at the Record
                    Office, London, (U. 140) and the British Museum (Cotton MSS., Galba B. x.) of
                    intercepted letters from Servetus at Louvain in 1538 adds considerably to our
                    information about his family and early friends, but introduces new problems as
                    to the details of his fitful career. (A. GO.)</p>
