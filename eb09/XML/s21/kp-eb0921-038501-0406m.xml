                <p><label type="entry">SCHADOW</label>, a distinguished name in the annals of German
                    art.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Johann Gottfried Schadow</hi> (1764-1850), an eminent
                    sculptor, was born in 1764 in Berlin, where his father was a poor tailor. His
                    first teacher was an inferior sculptor, Tassaert, patronized by Frederick the
                    Great; the master offered his daughter in marriage, but the pupil preferred to
                    elope with a girl to Vienna, and the father-in-law not only condoned the offence
                    but furnished money wherewith to visit Italy. The young man made the most of
                    advantages which in those days fell to the lot of few: he gained in competition
                    a prize for a group of Perseus and Andromeda; three years’ study in Rome formed
                    his style, and in 1788 he returned to Berlin to succeed his former master,
                    Tassaert, as sculptor to the court and secretary to the Academy. Prussia in
                    rising into a great kingdom had need for much sculpture, and Schadow brought
                    timely talent and exceptional training. Over half a century, crowded with
                    commissions, he persistently produced upwards of two hundred works, varied in
                    style as in subjects. Among his ambitious efforts are Frederick the Great in
                    Stettin, Blücher in Rostock, and Luther in Wittenberg. His portrait statues
                    include Frederick the Great playing the flute, and the crown-princess Louise and
                    her sister. His busts, which reach a total of more than one hundred, comprise
                    seventeen colossal heads in the Walhalla, Ratisbon; from the life were modelled
                    Goethe, Wieland, and Fichte. Of church monuments and memorial works thirty are
                    enumerated; yet Schadow hardly ranks among Christian sculptors. He is claimed by
                    classicists and idealists: the quadriga on the Brandenburger Thor and the
                    allegorical frieze on the façade of the Royal Mint, both in Berlin, are judged
                    among the happiest growths from the antique. Fauns, nymphs, cupids, and figures
                    of fancy, scattered among plain portrait work, kept alive to an advanced age
                    early associations formed in Italy. Schadow, as director of the Berlin Academy,
                    gave proof of intellectual powers which made him a leader and secured many and
                    devoted followers. Personal influence he extended and fortified by his books. He
                    wrote on the proportions of the human figure, on national physiognomy, &amp;c.;
                    and . many volumes by himself and others describe and illustrate his method and
                    his work. He died, full of honours, at Berlin in 1850.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rudolph Schadow</hi> (1786-1822), sculptor, son of the
                    preceding, was born in Rome in 1786. His father, who returned to Berlin in 1788,
                    was his first master. Rudolph in 1810 obtained the pension for Rome and received
                    kindly help from Canova and Thorwaldsen. His talents were versatile: his first
                    independent work was a figure of Paris, and it had for its companion a spinning
                    girl. Following the example set by leading German artists then settled in Rome,
                    he exchanged the Protestant for the Catholic faith, and gave pledge of his
                    convictions by statues of John the Baptist and of the Virgin and Child. In
                    England he became known by bas-reliefs executed for the duke of Devonshire and
                    for the marquis of Lansdowne. His last composition, commissioned by the king of
                    Prussia, was a colossal group, Achilles with the Body of Penthesilea; the model,
                    universally admired for its antique character and the largeness of its style,
                    had not been carried out in marble when in 1822 the artist died in Rome.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow</hi> (1789-1862), painter,
                    born in 1789 in Berlin, was the second son of Johann Gottfried Schadow the
                    sculptor, from whom he received his earliest instruction. In 1806-7 he served as
                    a soldier; in 1810 he went with his elder brother Rudolph to Rome. He became one
                    of the leaders among the German pre-Raphaelite brethren who eschewed classicism
                    and the Italian Renaissance and sought to rebuild Christian art on the
                    principles and practice of early and purer times. Following the example of
                    Overbeck and others, he joined the Catholic Church, and held that an artist must
                    believe and live out the truths he essays to paint. The sequel showed that
                    Schadow was qualified to shine less as a painter than as a teacher and director.
                    The Prussian consul, General Bartholdi, befriended his young compatriots by
                    giving them a commission to decorate with frescos a room 24 feet square in his
                    house on the Pincian Hill. The artists engaged were Schadow, Cornelius,
                    Overbeck, and Veit; the subject selected was the story of Joseph and his
                    brethren, and two scenes, the Bloody Coat and Joseph in Prison, fell to the lot
                    of Schadow. These well-studied and sound wall-paintings brought renown to the
                    brethren, who were further fortified by the friendship of Niebuhr and Bunsen;
                    the former writes— “They are all men of talent,” and “Schadow is particularly
                    refined and intellectual.” Schadow was in 1819 appointed professor in the Berlin
                    Academy, and his ability and thorough training gained devoted disciples. To this
                    period belong pictures for churches. In 1826 the professor was made director of
                    the Düsseldorf Academy, and so highly were his character and teachings esteemed
                    that some of the best scholars accompanied their master. The<pb break="no"

                    transplanted to Düsseldorf; he reorganized the Academy, which in a few years
                    grew famous as a centre of Christian art to which pupils flocked from all sides.
                    In 1837 the director selected, at request, those of his scholars best qualified
                    to decorate the chapel of St Apollinaris on the Rhine with frescos, which when
                    finished were accepted as the fullest and purest manifestation of the Düsseldorf
                    school on its spiritual side. To 1842 belong the Wise and Foolish Virgins, in
                    the Städel Institute, Frankfort; this large and important picture is carefully
                    considered and wrought, but lacks power. Schadow’s fame indeed rests less on his
                    own creations than on the school he formed; he imparted to others nobility of
                    conception, beauty of form, refinement and delicacy in expression and execution.
                    Yet the master in Düsseldorf encountered opposition: a reaction set in against
                    the spiritual and sacerdotal style he had established; a younger generation rose
                    who stigmatized his system as narrow and bigoted; and in 1859 the party of
                    naturalism and realism after a severe struggle drove the venerable director from
                    his chair. Schadow died at Düsseldorf in 1862, and a monument in the platz which
                    bears his name was raised at the jubilee held to commemorate his directorate.
