                <p><label type="entry">SEMITIC LANGUAGES</label></p>
                <p>THE name “Semitic languages” is used to designate a group of Asiatic and African
                    languages, some living and some dead, namely, Hebrew and Phoenician, Aramaic,
                    Assyrian, Arabic, Ethiopic (Geez and Amharic). The name, which was introduced by
                    Eichhorn,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Einleitung in das A.T.,</hi> 2d ed., i. 45 (Leipsic,
                    1787).</p></note> is derived from the fact that most nations which speak or
                    spoke these languages are descended, according to Genesis, from Shem, son of
                    Noah. But the classification of nations in Genesis X. is founded neither upon
                    linguistic nor upon ethnographical principles: it is determined rather by
                    geographical and political considerations. For this reason Elam and Lud are also
                    included among the children of Shem; but neither the Elamites (in Susiana) nor
                    the Lydians appear to have spoken a language connected with Hebrew. On the other
                    hand, the Phoenicians (Canaanites), whose dialect closely resembled that of
                    Israel, are not counted as children of Shem. Moreover, the compiler of the list
                    in Genesis x. had no clear conceptions about the peoples of south Arabia and
                    Ethiopia. Nevertheless it would be undesirable to give up the universally
                    received terms “Semites” and “Semitic.” There exist large groups of languages
                    and peoples which bear no natural collective appellations, because the peoples
                    grew up unconscious of their mutual relationship; so science must needs give
                    them artificial designations, and it would be well if all such terms were as
                    short and precise as “Semitic.”</p>
                <p>The connexion of the Semitic languages with one another is somewhat close, in any
                    case closer than that of the Indo-European languages. The more ancient Semitic
                    tongues differ from one another scarcely more than do the various Teutonic
                    dialects. Hence even in the 17th century such learned Orientalists as Hottinger,
                    Bochart, Castell, and Ludolf had a tolerably clear notion of the relationship
                    between the different Semitic languages with which they were acquainted; indeed
                    the same may be said of some Jewish scholars who lived many centuries earlier,
                    as, for instance, Jehuda ben Koraish. It is not difficult to point out a series
                    of characteristic marks common to these languages,—the predominance of
                    triconsonantal roots, or of roots formed after the analogy of such, similarity
                    in the formation of nominal and verbal stems, a great resemblance in the forms
                    of the personal pronouns and in their use for the purpose of verbal inflexion,
                    the two principal tenses, the importance attached to the change of vowels in the
                    interior of words, and lastly considerable agreement with regard to order and
                    the construction of sentences. Yet even so ancient a Semitic language as the
                    Assyrian appears to lack some of these features, and in certain modern dialects,
                    such as New Syriac, Mahri, and more particularly Amharic, many of the
                    characteristics of older Semitic speech have disappeared. But the resemblance in
                    vocabulary generally diminishes in proportion to the modernness of the dialects.
                    Still we can trace the connexion between the modern and the ancient dialects,
                    and show, at least approximately, how the former were developed out of the
                    latter. Where a development of this kind can be proved to have taken place,
                    there a relationship must exist, however much the individual features may have
                    been effaced. The question here is not of logical categories but of organic
                    groups.</p>
                <p>All these languages are descendants of a primitive Semitic stock which has long
                    been extinct. Many of its most important features may be reconstructed with at
                    least tolerable certainty, but we must beware of attempting too much in this
                    respect. When the various cognate languages of a group diverge in essential
                    points, it is by no means always possible to determine which of them has
                    retained the more primitive form. The history of the development of these
                    tongues during the period anterior to the documents which we possess is often
                    extremely obscure in its details. Even when several Semitic languages agree in
                    important points of grammar we cannot always be sure that in these particulars
                    we have what is primitive, since in many cases analogous changes have taken
                    place independently. To one who should assert the complete reconstruction of the
                    primitive Semitic language to be possible, we might put the question, Would the
                    man who is best acquainted with all the Romance languages be in a position to
                    reconstruct their common mother, Latin, if the knowledge of it were lost? And
                    yet there are but few Semitic languages which we can know as accurately as the
                    Romance languages are known. As far as the vocabulary is concerned, we may
                    indeed maintain with certainty that a considerable number of words which have in
                    various Semitic languages the form proper to each were a part of primitive
                    Semitic speech. Nevertheless even then we are apt to be misled by independent
                    but analogous formations and by words borrowed at a very remote period.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The more alike two languages
                    are the more difficult it usually is to detect, as borrowed elements, those
                    words which have passed from one language into the other.</p></note> Each
                    Semitic language or group of languages has, however, many words which we cannot
                    point out in the others. Of such words a great number no doubt belonged to
                    primitive Semitic speech, and either disappeared in some of these languages or
                    else remained in use, but not so as to be recognizable by us. Yet many isolated
                    words and roots may in very early times have been borrowed by the Hebrew, the
                    Aramaic, the Ethiopic, &amp;c., perhaps from wholly different languages, of
                    which no trace is left.</p>
                <p>The question which of the known Semitic dialects most resembles the primitive
                    Semitic language is less important than one might at first suppose, since the
                    question is one not of absolute but only of relative priority. After scholars
                    had given up the notion (which, however, was not the fruit of scientific
                    research) that all Semitic languages, and indeed all the languages in the world,
                    were descendants of Hebrew or of Aramaic, it was long the fashion to maintain
                    that Arabic bore a close resemblance to the primitive Semitic language.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This theory is carried to its
                    extreme limit in Olshausen’s very valuable <hi rend="italic">Hebrew Grammar</hi>
                    (Brunswick, 1861).</p></note> But, just as it is now recognized with
                    ever-increasing clearness that Sanskrit is far from having retained in such a
                    degree as was even lately supposed the characteristics of primitive
                    Indo-European<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n667/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0667-0642"/> speech, so in the domain of the Semitic tongues
                    we can assign to Arabic only a relative antiquity. It is true that in Arabic
                    very many features are preserved more faithfully than in the cognate
                    languages,—for instance, nearly all the original abundance of consonants, the
                    short vowels in open syllables, particularly in the interior of words, and many
                    grammatical distinctions which in the other languages are more or less obscured.
                    But, on the other hand, Arabic has coined, simply from analogy, a great number
                    of forms which, owing to their extreme simplicity, seem at the first glance to
                    be primitive, but which nevertheless are only modifications of the primitive
                    forms; whilst perhaps the other Semitic languages exhibit modifications of a
                    different kind. In spite of its great wealth, Arabic is characterized by a
                    certain monotony, which can scarcely have existed from the beginning. Both
                    Hebrew and Aramaic are in many respects more ancient than Arabic. This would no
                    doubt be far more apparent if we knew Hebrew more completely and according to
                    the original pronunciation of its vowels, and if we could discover how Aramaic
                    was pronounced about the 13th century before our era. It must always be borne in
                    mind that we are far more fully and accurately acquainted with Arabic than with
                    the other Semitic languages of antiquity. The opinion sometimes maintained by
                    certain over-zealous Assyriologists, that Assyrian is the “Sanskrit of the
                    Semitic world,” has not met with the approval even of the Assyriologists
                    themselves, and is unworthy of a serious refutation.</p>
                <p>A comparative grammar of the Semitic languages must of course be based upon
                    Arabic, but must in every matter of detail take into consideration all the
                    cognate languages, as far as they are known to us. In the reconstruction of the
                    primitive Semitic tongue Hebrew might perhaps afford more assistance than
                    Ethiopic; but Aramaic, Assyrian, and even the less known and the more modern
                    dialects might furnish valuable materials.</p>
                <p>It is not a formidable undertaking to describe in general terms the character of
                    the Semitic mind, as has been done, for example, by Lassen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Indische Alterthumskunde,</hi> i. 414 sq.) and by Renan in the introduction to
                    his <hi rend="italic">Histoire des Langues Sémitiques.</hi> But still there is a
                    danger of assuming that the most important characteristics of particular Semitic
                    peoples, especially of the Israelites and of the Arabs, are common to all
                    Semites, and of ascribing to the influence of race certain striking features
                    which are the result of the external conditions of life, and which, under
                    similar circumstances, are also developed among non-Semitic races. And, though
                    it is said, not without reason, that the Semites possess but little talent for
                    political and military organization on a large scale, yet we have in the
                    Phoenicians, especially the Carthaginians, in Hamilcar and in Hannibal, a proof
                    that under altered conditions the Semites are not incapable of distinguishing
                    themselves in these domains. It is a poor evasion to deny that the Phoenicians
                    are genuine Semites, since even our scanty sources of information suffice to
                    show that in the matter of religion, which among Semites is of such supreme
                    importance, they bore a close resemblance to the ancient Hebrews and Aramaeans.
                    In general descriptions of this kind it is easy to go too far. But to give in
                    general terms a correct idea of the Semitic languages is a task of very much
                    greater difficulty. Renan’s brilliant and most interesting sketch is in many
                    respects open to serious criticism. He cites, for example, as characteristic of
                    the Semitic tongues, that they still retain the practice of expressing
                    psychological processes by means of distinct imagery. In saying this he is
                    taking scarcely any language but Hebrew into account. But the feature to which
                    he here alludes is owing to the particular stage of intellectual development
                    that had been reached by the Israelites, is in part peculiar to the poetical
                    style, and is to be found in like manner among wholly different races. That the
                    Semitic languages are far from possessing the fixity which Renan attributes to
                    them we shall see below. But, however this may be, certain grammatical
                    peculiarities of the Semitic languages—above all, the predominance of triliteral
                    roots—are so marked that it is scarcely possible to doubt whether any language
                    with which we are tolerably well acquainted is or is not Semitic. Only when a
                    Semitic language has been strongly influenced not only in vocabulary but also in
                    grammar by some non-Semitic speech, as is the case with Amharic, can such a
                    doubt be for a moment entertained.</p>
                <p>Many attempts have been made, sometimes in a very superficial fashion and
                    sometimes by the use of scientific methods, to establish a relationship between
                    the Semitic languages and the Indo-European. It was very natural to suppose that
                    the tongues of the two races which, with the single exceptions of the Egyptians
                    and the Chinese, have formed and moulded human civilization, who have been near
                    neighbours from the earliest times, and who, moreover, seem to bear a great
                    physical resemblance to one another can be nothing else than two descendants of
                    the same parent speech. But all these endeavours have wholly failed. It is
                    indeed probable that the languages, not only of the Semites and of the
                    Indo-Europeans, but also those of other races, are derived from the same stock,
                    but the separation must have taken place at so remote a period that the changes
                    which these languages underwent in prehistoric times have completely effaced
                    what features they possessed in common; if such features have sometimes been
                    preserved, they are no longer recognizable. It must be remembered that it is
                    only in exceptionally favourable circumstances that cognate languages are so
                    preserved during long periods as to render it possible for scientific analysis
                    to prove their relationship with one another.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The following is an instance of the manner in
                    which we may be deceived by isolated cases. “Six” is in Hebrew <hi rend="italic"
                    >shesh,</hi> almost exactly like the Sanskrit and modern Persian <hi
                    rend="italic">shash,</hi> the Latin <hi rend="italic">sex,</hi> &amp;c. But the
                    Indo-European root is <hi rend="italic">sweks,</hi> or perhaps even <hi
                    rend="italic">ksweks,</hi> whereas the Semitic root is <hi rend="italic"
                    >shidth,</hi> so that the resemblance is a purely accidental one, produced by
                    phonetic change.</p></note></p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Semitic languages bear so striking a resemblance in some
                    respects to certain languages of northern Africa that we are forced to assume
                    the existence of a tolerably close relationship between the two groups. We
                    allude to the family of languages known in modern times as the “Hamitic,” and
                    composed of the Egyptian, Berber, Beja (Bishári, &amp;c.), and a number of
                    tongues spoken in Abyssinia and the neighbouring countries (Agaw, Galla,
                    Danḳali, &amp;c.). It is remarkable that some of the most indispensable words in
                    the Semitic vocabulary (as, for instance, “water,” “mouth,” and certain
                    numerals) are found in Hamitic also, and that these words happen to be such as
                    cannot well be derived from triliteral Semitic roots, and are more or less
                    independent of the ordinary grammatical rules. We notice, too, important
                    resemblances in grammar,—for example, the formation of the feminine by means of
                    a <hi rend="italic">t</hi> prefixed or affixed, that of the causative by means
                    of <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> similarity in the suffixes and prefixes of the
                    verbal tenses, and, generally, similarity in the personal pronouns, &amp;c. It
                    must be admitted that there is also much disagreement,—for instance, the widest
                    divergence in the mass of the vocabulary; and this applies to the Semitic
                    languages as compared not only with those Hamitic languages that are gradually
                    becoming known to us at the present day but with the Egyptian, of which we
                    possess documents dating from the fourth millennium before the Christian era.
                    The question is here involved in great difficulties. Some isolated resemblances
                    may, improbable as it appears, have been produced by the bor-<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0668-0643"/> rowing of words. Uncivilized races, as has been
                    proved with certainty, sometimes borrow from others elements of speech in cases
                    where we should deem such a thing impossible,—for example, numerals and even
                    personal suffixes. But the great resemblances in grammatical formation cannot be
                    reasonably explained as due to borrowing on the part of the Hamites, more
                    especially as these points of agreement are also found in the language of the
                    Berbers, who are scattered over an enormous territory, and whose speech must
                    have acquired its character long before they came into contact with the Semites.
                    We are even now but imperfectly acquainted with the Hamitic languages; it is not
                    yet certain into what groups they fall; and the relation in which Egyptian
                    stands to Berber on the one hand and to the south Hamitic languages on the other
                    requires further elucidation. The attempt to write a comparative grammar of the
                    Semitic and Hamitic languages would be, to say the least, very premature.<note

                <p>The connexion between the Semitic languages and the Hamitic appears to indicate
                    that the primitive seat of the Semites is to be sought in Africa; for it can
                    scarcely be supposed that the Hamites, amongst whom there are gradual
                    transitions from an almost purely European type to that of the Negroes, are the
                    children of any other land than “the dark continent.” There seems, moreover, to
                    be a considerable physical resemblance between the Hamites and the Semites,
                    especially in the case of the southern Arabs <hi rend="italic">; we</hi> need
                    mention only the slight development of the calf of the leg, and the sporadic
                    appearance amongst Semites of woolly hair and prominent jaws.<note

                    extent with foreign races, which process must have diminished their mutual
                    similarity. All this, however, is offered not as a definite theory but as a
                    modest hypothesis.</p>
                <p>It was once the custom to maintain that the Semites came originally from certain
                    districts in Armenia. This supposition was founded on the book of Genesis,
                    according to which several of the Semitic nations are descended from Arphachsad,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the eponym of the district of Arrapachitis, now
                    called Albak, on the borders of Armenia and Kurdistan. It was also thought that
                    this region was inhabited by the primitive race from which both the Semites and
                    the Indo-Europeans derived their origin. But, as we saw above, this ancient
                    relationship is a matter of some doubt; in any case, the separation does not
                    date from a period so recent that the Semites can be supposed to have possessed
                    any historical tradition concerning it. There cannot be a greater mistake than
                    to imagine that nations have been able to preserve during long ages their
                    recollection of the country whence their supposed ancestors are said to have
                    emigrated. The fantastic notion once in vogue as to the permanence of historical
                    memories among uncivilized races must be wholly abandoned. The period in which
                    the Hebrews, the Arabs, and the other Semitic nations together formed a single
                    people is so distant that none of them can possibly have retained any tradition
                    of it. The opinion that the Hebrews and the tribes most closely related to them
                    were descendants of Arphachsad is apparently due to the legend that Noah’s ark
                    landed near this district. The notion has therefore a purely mythical origin.
                    Moreover, in Genesis itself we find a totally different account of the matter,
                    derived from another source, which represents all nations, and therefore the
                    Semites among them, as having come from Babylon.</p>
                <p>Scarcely any man of science now believes in the northern origin of the
                    Semites.</p>
                <p>Others, as Sprenger and Schrader,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The former has maintained this view in several of his works,
                    the latter in <hi rend="italic">Z.D.M.G.,</hi> xxvii. 417 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi></p></note> consider the birthplace of the Semitic race to have been in
                    Arabia. There is much that appears to support this theory. History proves that
                    from a very early period tribes from the deserts of Arabia settled on the
                    cultivable lands which border them and adopted a purely agricultural mode of
                    life. Various traces in the language seem to indicate that the Hebrews and the
                    Aramaeans were originally nomads, and Arabia with its northern prolongation (the
                    Syrian desert) is the true home of nomadic peoples. The Arabs are also supposed
                    to display the Semitic character in its purest form, and their language is, on
                    the whole, nearer the original Semitic than are the languages of the cognate
                    races. To this last circumstance we should, however, attach little importance.
                    It is by no means always the case that a language is most faithfully preserved
                    in the country where it originated. The Lithuanians speak the most ancient of
                    all living Indo-European languages, and they are certainly not autochthones of
                    Lithuania; the Romance dialect spoken in the south of Sardinia is far more
                    primitive than that spoken at Rome; and of all living Teutonic languages the
                    most ancient is the Icelandic. It is even doubtful whether the ordinary
                    assumption be correct, that the most primitive of modern Arabic dialects are
                    those spoken in Arabia. Besides, we cannot unreservedly admit that the Arabs
                    display the Semitic character in its purest form; it would be more correct to
                    say that, under the influence of a country indescribably monotonous and of a
                    life ever changing yet ever the same, the inhabitants of the Arabian deserts
                    have developed most exclusively certain of the principal traits of the Semitic
                    race. All these considerations are indecisive; but we willingly admit that the
                    theory which regards Arabia as the primitive seat of all Semites is by no means
                    untenable.</p>
                <p>Finally, one of the most eminent of contemporary Orientalists, Ignazio
                    Guidi,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Della Sede
                    Primitiva dei Popoli Semitici,” in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> of the
                    Accademia dei Lincei, 1878-79.</p></note> has attempted to prove that the home
                    of the Semites is on the lower Euphrates. He contends that the geographical,
                    botanical, and zoological conceptions which are expressed in the various Semitic
                    languages by the same words, preserved from the time of the dispersion,
                    correspond to the natural characteristics of no country but the above-mentioned.
                    Great as are the ingenuity and the caution which he displays, it is difficult to
                    accept his conclusions. Several terms might be mentioned which are part of the
                    common heritage of the northern and the southern Semites, but which can scarcely
                    have been formed in the region of the Euphrates. Moreover, the vocabulary of
                    most Semitic languages is but very imperfectly known, and each dialect has lost
                    many primitive words in the course of time. It is therefore very unsafe to draw
                    conclusions from the fact that the various Semitic tongues have no one common
                    designation for many important local conceptions, such as “mountain.” The
                    ordinary words for “man,” “old man,” “boy,” “tent,” are quite different in the
                    various Semitic languages, and yet all these are ideas for which the primitive
                    Semites must have had names.</p>
                <p>We must therefore for the present confess our inability to make any positive
                    statement with regard to the primitive seat of the original Semitic race.</p>
                <p>It is not very easy to settle what is the precise connexion between the various
                    Semitic languages, considered individually. In this matter one may easily be led
                    to hasty conclusions by isolated peculiarities in vocabulary or<pb break="no"

                    occasionally agrees in grammatical points with some other to which in most
                    respects it bears no very close resemblance, while dialects much more nearly
                    related to it are found to exhibit different formations. Each Semitic tongue
                    also possesses features peculiar to itself. For instance, the Hebrew-Phoenician
                    group and the Arabic have a prefixed definite article (the etymological identity
                    of which is, however, not quite certain); the dialect nearest to Arabic, the
                    Sabaean, expresses the article by means of a suffixed <hi rend="italic">n∙,</hi>
                    the Aramaic, which in general more closely resembles Hebrew than does the Arabic
                    group, expresses it by means of a suffixed <hi rend="italic">ά;</hi> whereas the
                    Assyrian in the north and the Ethiopic in the south have no article at all. Of
                    this termination <hi rend="italic">n</hi> for the definite article there is no
                    trace in either Arabic or Hebrew; the Sabaean, the Ethiopic, and the Aramaic
                    employ it to give emphasis to demonstrative pronouns; and the very same usage
                    has been detected in a single Phoenician inscription.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is not quite certain whether all the

                    occupy in Arabic. In the case of <hi rend="italic">kh—</hi> where Ethiopic
                    agrees with Arabic—this is at least probable, since there seem to be traces of
                    it in Assyrian. But it would appear that in Hebrew and Aramaic the distinction

                    have, independently of one another, lost something which the languages most
                    nearly related to them have preserved. In like manner, the strengthening of the
                    pronoun of the third person by means of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> (or <hi

                    Aramaic alone has no certain trace of the reflexive conjugation formed with
                    prefixed <hi rend="italic">n</hi>; Hebrew alone has no certain trace of the

                    the Semitic languages we can see how the formation of the passive by means of
                    internal vocal change (as <hi rend="italic">kullima,</hi> “he was addressed,” as
                    distinguished from <hi rend="italic">kallama, "</hi> he addressed ”) gradually
                    dropped out of use; in Ethiopic this process was already complete when the
                    language first became literary; but in Aramaic it was not wholly so. In a few
                    cases phonetic resemblances have been the result of later growth. For example,
                    the termination of the plural masculine of nouns is in Hebrew <hi rend="italic"
                    >ím,</hi> in Aramaic <hi rend="italic">ín,</hi> as in Arabic. But we know that
                    Aramaic also originally had <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> whereas the ancient Arabic
                    forms have after the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> an <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, which
                    appears to have been originally a long <hi rend="italic">á (úna, ina)</hi>; in
                    this latter position (that is, between two vowels) the change of <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> into <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is very improbable. These two
                    similar terminations were therefore originally distinct. We must indeed be very
                    cautious in drawing conclusions from points of agreement between the
                    vocabularies of the various Semitic tongues. The Ethiopians and the Hebrews have
                    the same word for many objects which the other Semites call by other names,—for
                    instance, “stone,” “tree,” “enemy,” “enter,” “go out”; and the same may be said
                    of Hebrew as compared with Sabaean. But to build theories upon such facts would
                    be unsafe, since the words cited are either found, though with some change of
                    meaning, in at least one of the cognate languages, or actually occur, perhaps
                    quite exceptionally and in archaic writings, with the same signification. The
                    sedentary habits of the Ethiopians and the Sabaeans may possibly have rendered
                    it easier for them to retain in their vocabulary certain words which were used
                    by the civilized Semites of the north, but which became obsolete amongst the
                    Arabian nomads. To the same cause we may attribute the fact that in religion the
                    Sabaeans resemble the northern Semites more closely than do the tribes of
                    central Arabia; but these considerations prove nothing in favour of a nearer
                    linguistic affinity.</p>
                <p>One thing at least is certain, that Arabic (with Sabaean) and Ethiopic stand in a
                    comparatively close relationship to one another, and compose a group by
                    themselves, as contrasted with the other Semitic languages, Hebraeo-Phoenician,
                    Aramaic, and Assyrian, which constitute the northern group. Only in these
                    southern dialects do we find, and that under forms substantially identical, the
                    important innovation known as the “broken plurals.” They agree, moreover, in
                    employing a peculiar development of the verbal root, formed by inserting an <hi
                    rend="italic">ά</hi> between the first and second radicals <hi rend="italic"
                    >(kátala, takátala),</hi> in using the vowel <hi rend="italic">a</hi> before the
                    third radical in all active perfects—for example, <hi rend="italic">(h)aktala,
                    kattala,</hi> instead of the <hi rend="italic">haḳtil, ḳattil</hi> of the
                    northern dialects—and in many other grammatical phenomena. This is not at all
                    contradicted by the fact that certain aspirated dentals of Arabic <hi
                    rend="italic">(th, dh, th)</hi> are replaced in Ethiopic, as in Hebrew and
                    Assyrian, by pure sibilants—that is, <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (Hebrew and
                    Assyrian <hi rend="italic">sh</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">),</hi> 2, <hi
                    rend="italic">ç—</hi> whereas in Aramaic they are replaced by simple dentals <hi
                    rend="italic">(t, d, t),</hi> which seem to come closer to the Arabic sounds.
                    After the separation of the northern and the southern groups, the Semitic
                    languages possessed all these sounds, as the Arabic does, but afterwards
                    simplified them, for the most part, in one direction or the other. Hence there
                    resulted, as it were by chance, occasional similarities. Even in modern Arabic
                    dialects <hi rend="italic">th, dh</hi> have become sometimes <hi rend="italic"
                    >t, d,</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic">s, z.</hi> Ethiopic, moreover, has
                    kept <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the most peculiar of Arabic sounds, distinct from
                    <hi rend="italic">ç,</hi> whereas Aramaic has confounded it with the guttural '
                    <hi rend="italic">ain,</hi> and Hebrew and Assyrian with <hi rend="italic"
                    >ç.</hi> It is therefore evident that all these languages once possessed the
                    consonant in question as a distinct one. One sound, <hi rend="italic">sin,</hi>
                    appears only in Hebrew, in Phoenician, and in the older Aramaic. It must
                    originally have been pronounced very like <hi rend="italic">sh,</hi> since it is
                    represented in writing by the same character; in later times it was changed into
                    an ordinary s. Assyrian does not distinguish it from <hi rend="italic"
                    >sh</hi>.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Shalhebeth,</hi> “flame,” is borrowed from Aramaic.</p></note> The
                    division of the Semitic languages into the northern group and the southern is
                    therefore justified by facts. Even if we were to discover really important
                    grammatical phenomena in which one of the southern dialects agreed with the
                    northern, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> and that in cases where such
                    phenomena could not be regarded either as remnants of primitive Semitic usage or
                    as instances of parallel but independent development, we ought to remember that
                    the division of the two groups was not necessarily a sudden and instantaneous
                    occurrence, that even after the separation intercourse may have been carried on
                    between the various tribes who spoke kindred dialects and were therefore still
                    able to understand one another, and that intermediate dialects may once have
                    existed, perhaps such as were in use amongst tribes who came into contact
                    sometimes with the agricultural population of the north and sometimes with the
                    nomads of the south (see below). All this is purely hypothetical, whereas the
                    division between the northern and the southern Semitic languages is a recognized
                    fact.</p>
                <p>Although we cannot deny that there may formerly have existed Semitic languages
                    quite distinct from those with which we are acquainted, yet that such was
                    actually the case cannot be proved. Nor is there any reason to think that the
                    domain of the Semitic languages ever extended very far beyond its present
                    limits. Some time ago many scholars believed that they were once spoken in Asia
                    Minor and even in Europe, but, except in the Phoenician colonies, this notion
                    rested upon no solid proof. It cannot be argued with any great degree of
                    plausibility that even the Cilicians, who from a very early period held constant
                    intercourse with the Syrians and the Phoenicians, spoke a Semitic language.<pb

                    Phoenician are but dialects of one and the same language. It is only as the
                    language of the people of Israel that Hebrew can be known with any precision.
                    Since in the Old Testament a few of the neighbouring peoples are represented as
                    being descended from Eber, the eponym of the Hebrews, that is, are regarded as
                    nearly related to the latter, it was natural to suppose that they likewise spoke
                    Hebrew,—a supposition which, at least in the case of the Moabites, has been
                    fully confirmed by the discovery of the Mesha inscription (date, soon after 900
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). The language of this inscription scarcely
                    differs from that of the Old Testament; the only important distinction is the
                    occurrence of a reflexive form (with <hi rend="italic">t</hi> after the first
                    radical), which appears nowhere else but in Arabic. We may remark in passing
                    that the style of this inscription is quite that of the Old Testament, and
                    enables us to maintain with certainty that a similar historical literature
                    existed amongst the Moabites. But it must be remembered that ancient Semitic
                    inscriptions exhibit, in a sense, nothing but the skeleton of the language,
                    since they do not express the vowels at all, or do so only in certain cases;
                    still less do they indicate other phonetic modifications, such as the doubling
                    of consonants, &amp;c. It is therefore very possible that <hi rend="italic">to
                    the ear</hi> the language of Moab seemed to differ considerably from that of the
                    Judaeans.</p>
                <p>The Mesha inscription is the only non-Israelite source from which any knowledge
                    of ancient Hebrew can be obtained. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hebrew Language and
                    Literature.)</hi> Some fragments in the Old Testament belong to the second
                    millennium before our era,—particularly the song of Deborah (Judges v.), a
                    document which, in spite of its many obscurities in matters of detail, throws
                    much light on the condition of the Israelites at the time when the Canaanites
                    were still contending with them for the possession of the country. The first
                    rise of an historical literature may very probably date from before the
                    establishment of the monarchy. Various portions of the Old Testament belong to
                    the time of the earlier kings; but it was under the later kings that a great
                    part of extant Hebrew literature came into shape. To this age also belong the
                    Siloam inscription and a few seals and gems bearing the names of Israelites. The
                    Hebrew language is thus known to us from a very ancient period. But we are far
                    from being acquainted with its real phonetic condition in the time of David or
                    Isaiah. For, much as we owe to the labours of the later Jewish schools, which
                    with infinite care fixed the pronunciation of the sacred text by adding vowels
                    and other signs, it is evident that even at the best they could only represent
                    the pronunciation of the language in its latest stage, not that of very early
                    ages. Besides, their object was not to exhibit Hebrew simply as it was, but to
                    show how it should be read in the solemn chant of the synagogue. Accordingly,
                    the pronunciation of the older period may have differed considerably from that
                    represented by the punctuation. Such differences are now and then indicated by
                    the customary spelling of the ancient texts,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For example, we may conclude with tolerable certainty, from

                    and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> were not pronounced long, and that, on the other

                    were used for the later ó and <hi rend="italic">é.</hi></p></note> and sometimes
                    the orthography is directly at variance with the punctuation.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The very first word of the

                    represented by the point-system ignores.</p></note> In a few rare cases we may
                    derive help from the somewhat older tradition contained in the representation of
                    Hebrew words and proper names by Greek letters, especially in the ancient
                    Alexandrine translation of the Bible (the so-called Septuagint). It is of
                    particular importance to remark that this older tradition still retains an
                    original <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in many cases where the punctuation has the
                    later <hi rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> We have examined
                    this point somewhat in detail, in order to contradict the false but
                    ever-recurring notion that the ordinary text of the Bible represents without any
                    essential modification the pronunciation of ancient Hebrew, whereas in reality
                    it expresses (in a very instructive and careful manner, it is true) only its
                    latest development, and that for the purpose of solemn public recitation. A
                    clear trace of dialectical differences within Israel is found in Judges xii. 6,
                    which shows that the ancient Ephraimites pronounced <hi rend="italic">s</hi>
                    instead of <hi rend="italic">sh.</hi></p>
                <p>The destruction of the Judaean kingdom dealt a heavy blow to the Hebrew language.
                    But it is going too far to suppose that it was altogether banished from ordinary
                    life at the time of the exile, and that Aramaic came into use among all the
                    Jews. In the East even small communities, especially if they form a religious
                    body, often cling persistently to their mother-tongue, though they may be
                    surrounded by a population of alien speech; and such was probably the case with
                    the Jews in Babylonia. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hebrew Language,</hi> vol. xi.
                    p. 597. Even so late as the time of Ezra Hebrew was in all probability the
                    ordinary language of the new community. In Neh. xiii. 24 we find a complaint
                    that the children of Jews by wives from Ashdod and other places spoke half in
                    the “Jewish” language and half in the language of Ashdod, or whatever else may
                    have been the tongue of their mothers. No one can suppose that Nehemiah would
                    have been particularly zealous that the children of Jews should speak an Aramaic
                    dialect with correctness. He no doubt refers to Hebrew as it was then spoken,—a
                    stage in its development of which Nehemiah’s own work gives a very fair idea.
                    And, moreover, the inhabitants of Ashdod spoke Hebrew. G. Hoffmann<note

                    Ashdodites been accustomed to use a dead language on their coins they would
                    certainly have employed the native Semitic writing.</p></note>; nor does the
                    language seem to diverge at all from that of the Old Testament. It is therefore
                    probable that Nehemiah alludes only to a slightly different local dialect. If
                    the Philistines of Ashdod still continued to speak Hebrew about the year 300 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> it cannot be supposed that the Jews had given up
                    this their own language nearly three centuries earlier. We may also conclude
                    that the Philistines from the earliest period spoke the same language as their
                    eastern neighbours, with whom they had so often been at war, but had also lived
                    in close pacific intercourse.</p>
                <p>After the time of Alexander large bodies of the Jewish population were settled in
                    Alexandria and other western cities, and were very rapidly Hellenized. Meanwhile
                    the principal language of Syria and the neighbouring countries, Aramaic, the
                    influence of which may be perceived even in some pre-exilic writings, began to
                    spread more and more among the Jews. Hebrew gradually ceased to be the language
                    of the people and became that of religion and the schools. The book of Daniel,
                    written in 167 or 166 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> begins in Hebrew, then
                    suddenly passes into Aramaic, and ends again in Hebrew. Similarly the redactor
                    of Ezra (or more correctly of the Chronicles, of which Ezra and Nehemiah form
                    the conclusion) borrows large portions from an Aramaic work, in most cases
                    without translating them into Hebrew. No reason can be assigned for the use of
                    Aramaic in Jewish works intended primarily for Jerusalem, unless it were already
                    the dominant speech, whilst, on the other hand, it was very natural for a pious
                    Jew to write in the<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0671-0646"/> ancient “holy” language even after it had ceased
                    to be spoken. Esther, Ecclesiastes, and a few Psalms, which belong to the 3d and
                    2d centuries before our era, are indeed written in Hebrew, but are so strongly
                    tinctured by the Aramaic influence as to prove that the writers usually spoke
                    Aramaic. We are not likely to be far wrong in saying that in the Maccabaean age
                    Hebrew had died out among the Jews, and there is nothing to show that it
                    survived longer amongst any of the neighbouring peoples.</p>
                <p>But in the last period of the history of Jerusalem, and still more after the
                    destruction of the city by Titus, the Jewish schools played so important a part
                    that the life of the Hebrew language was in a manner prolonged. The lectures and
                    discussions of the learned were carried on in that tongue. We have very
                    extensive specimens of this more modern Hebrew in the Mishnah and other works,
                    and scattered pieces throughout both Talmuds. But, just as the “classical”
                    Sanskrit, which has been spoken and written by the Brahmans during the last
                    twenty-five centuries, differs considerably from the language which was once in
                    use among the people, so this “language of the learned” diverges in many
                    respects from the “holy language”; and this distinction is one of which the
                    rabbis were perfectly conscious. The “language of the learned” borrows a great
                    part of its vocabulary from Aramaic,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is a characteristic feature that “my father” and “my
                    mother” are here expressed by purely Aramaic forms. Even the learned did not
                    wish to call their “papas” and “mammas” by any other names than those to which
                    they had been accustomed in infancy.</p></note> and this exercises a strong
                    influence upon the grammatical forms. The grammar is perceptibly modified by the
                    peculiar style of these writings, which for the most part treat of legal and
                    ritual questions in a strangely laconic and pointed manner. But, large as is the
                    proportion of foreign words and artificial as this language is, it contains a
                    considerable number of purely Hebrew elements which do not appear in the Old
                    Testament. Although we may generally assume, in the case of a word occurring in
                    the Mishnah but not found in the Old Testament, that it is borrowed from
                    Aramaic, there are several words of this class which, by their radical
                    consonants, prove themselves to be genuine Hebrew. And even some grammatical
                    phenomena of this language are to be regarded as a genuine development of
                    Hebrew, though they are unknown to earlier Hebrew speech.</p>
                <p>From the beginning of the Middle Ages down to our own times the Jews have
                    produced an enormous mass of writings in Hebrew, sometimes closely following the
                    language of the Bible, sometimes that of the Mishnah, sometimes introducing in a
                    perfectly inorganic manner a great quantity of Aramaic forms, and occasionally
                    imitating the Arabic style. The study of these variations has but little
                    interest for the linguist, since they are nothing but a purely artificial
                    imitation, dependent upon the greater or less skill of the individual. The
                    language of the Mishnah stands in much closer connexion with real life, and has
                    a definite <hi rend="italic">raison d'être;</hi> all later Hebrew is to be
                    classed with mediaeval and modern Latin. Much Hebrew also was written in the
                    Middle Ages by the hostile brethren of the Jews, the Samaritans; but for the
                    student of language these productions have, at the most, the charm attaching to
                    curiosities.</p>
                <p>The ancient Hebrew language, especially in the matter of syntax, has an
                    essentially primitive character. Parataxis of sentences prevails over hypotaxis
                    to a greater extent than in any other literary Semitic language with which we
                    are well acquainted. The favourite method is to link sentences together by means
                    of a simple “and.” There is a great lack of particles to express with clearness
                    the more subtle connexion of ideas. The use of the verbal tenses is in a great
                    measure determined by the imagination, which regards things unaccomplished as
                    accomplished and the past as still present. There are but few words or
                    inflexions to indicate slight modifications of meaning, though in ancient times
                    the language may perhaps have distinguished certain moods of the verb somewhat
                    more plainly than the present punctuation does. But in any case this language
                    was far less suited for the definite expression of studied thought, and less
                    suited still for the treatment of abstract subjects, than for poetry. We must
                    remember, however, that as long as Hebrew was a living language it never had to
                    be used for the expression of the abstract. Had it lived somewhat longer it
                    might very possibly have learnt to adapt itself better to the formulating of
                    systematic conceptions. The only book in the Old Testament which attempts to
                    grapple with an abstract subject in plain prose—namely, Ecclesiastes—dates from
                    a time when Hebrew was dying out or was already dead. That the gifted author
                    does not always succeed in giving clear expression to his ideas is partly due to
                    the fact that the language had never been employed for any scientific purposes
                    whatsoever. With regard to grammatical forms, Hebrew has lost much that is still
                    preserved in Arabic; but the greater richness of Arabic is in part the result of
                    later development.</p>
                <p>The vocabulary of the Hebrew language is, as we have said, known but imperfectly.
                    The Old Testament is no very large work; it contains, moreover, many
                    repetitions, and a great number of pieces which are of little use to the
                    lexicographer. On the other hand, much may be derived from certain poetical
                    books, such as Job. The numerous <hi rend="italic">άπαξ</hi> λ∈γ0p,evα are a
                    sufficient proof that many more words existed than appear in the Old Testament,
                    the writers of which never had occasion to use them. Were we in possession of
                    the whole Hebrew vocabulary in the time of Jeremiah, for example, we should be
                    far better able to determine the relation in which Hebrew stands to the other
                    Semitic languages, the Old Testament would be far more intelligible to us, and
                    it would be very much easier to detect the numerous corrupt passages in our
                    text.</p>

                    and the neighbouring regions (Cyprus, Egypt, and Greece), as well as to the
                    Phoenicians of Africa, especially Carthage. Inscriptions are, however, a very
                    insufficient means for obtaining the knowledge of a language. The number of
                    subjects treated in them is not large; many of the most important grammatical
                    forms and many of the words most used in ordinary life do not occur. Moreover,
                    the “lapidary style” is often very hard to understand. The repetition of obscure
                    phrases, in the same connexion, in several inscriptions does not help to make
                    them more intelligible. Of what use is it to us that, for instance, thousands of
                    Carthaginian inscriptions begin with the very same incomprehensible dedication
                    to two divinities? The difficulty of interpretation is greatly increased by the
                    fact that single words are very seldom separated from one another, and that
                    vowel-letters are used extremely sparingly. We therefore come but too often upon
                    very ambiguous groups of letters. In spite of this, our knowledge of Phoenician
                    has made considerable progress of late. Some assistance is also got from Greek
                    and Latin writers, who cite not only many Phoenician proper names but single
                    Phoenician words: Plautus in particular inserts in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poenulus</hi> whole passages in Punic, some of which are accompanied by a
                    Latin<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n672/mode/1up"

                    however, be used with great caution. It was not the object of Plautus to exhibit
                    the Punic language with precision, a task for which the Latin alphabet is but
                    ill adapted, but only to make the populace laugh at the jargon of the hated
                    Carthaginians. Moreover, he had to force the Punic words into Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">senarii;</hi> and finally the text, being unintelligible to
                    copyists, is terribly corrupt. Much ingenuity has been wasted on the Punic of
                    Plautus; but the passage yields valuable results to cautious investigation which
                    does not try to explain too much.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    grammar Phoenician closely resembles Hebrew. In both dialects the consonants are

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At an early period the
                    Phoenician pronunciation may have distinguished a greater number of original
                    consonants than are distinguished in writing. It is at least remarkable that the
                    Greeks render the name of the city of Çur (Hebrew Çór), which must originally
                    have been pronounced Ṭhurr, with a τ (Tiφos), and the name of Çídón, where the
                    <hi rend="italic">ç</hi> runs through all the Semitic languages, with a <hi
                    rend="italic">σ</hi> (∑ιδωp). Distinctions of this kind, justified by etymology,
                    have perhaps been obscured in Hebrew by the imperfection of the alphabet. In the
                    case of <hi rend="italic">sín</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shín</hi> this can be
                    positively proved.</p></note> As to vowels, Phoenician seems to diverge rather
                    more from Hebrew. The connecting of clauses is scarcely carried further in the
                    former language than in the latter. A slight attempt to define the tenses more
                    sharply appears once at least in the joining of <hi rend="italic">kán</hi>
                    (fuit) with a perfect, to express complete accomplishment (or the
                    pluperfect).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    93).</p></note> One important difference is that the use of <hi rend="italic"
                    >wáw</hi> conversive with the imperfect—so common in Hebrew and in the
                    inscription of Mesha—is wanting in Phoenician. The vocabulary of the language is
                    very like that of Hebrew, but words rare in Hebrew are often common in
                    Phoenician. For instance, “to do” is in Phoenician not ' <hi rend="italic"
                    >asa</hi> but <hi rend="italic">pa'al</hi> (the Arabic <hi rend="italic"
                    >fa'ala),</hi> which in Hebrew occurs only in poetry and elevated language.
                    “Gold” is not <hi rend="italic">zahab</hi> (as in most Semitic languages) but
                    <hi rend="italic">harúç</hi> (Assyrian <hi rend="italic">huráç),</hi> which is
                    used occasionally in Hebrew poetry. Traces of dialectical distinctions have been
                    found in the great inscription of Byblus, the inhabitants of which seem to be
                    distinguished from the rest of the Phoenicians in Josh. xiii. 5 (and 1 Kings v.
                    32? [A.V. v. 18]). It is probable that various differences between the language
                    of the mother-country and that of the African colonies arose at an early date,
                    but our materials do not enable us to come to any definite conclusion on this
                    point. In the later African inscriptions there appear certain phonetic changes,
                    especially in consequence of the softening of the gutturals, —changes which show
                    themselves yet more plainly in the so-called Neo-Punic inscriptions (beginning
                    with the 1st, if not the 2d, century before our era). In these the gutturals,
                    which had lost their real sound, are frequently interchanged in writing; and
                    other modifications may also be perceived. Unfortunately the Neo-Punic
                    inscriptions are written in such a debased indistinct character that it is often
                    impossible to discover with certainty the real form of the words. This dialect
                    was still spoken about 400, and perhaps long afterwards, in those districts of
                    North Africa which had once belonged to Carthage. It would seem that in the
                    mother-country the Phoenician language withstood the encroachment of Greek on
                    the one hand and of Aramaic on the other somewhat longer than Hebrew did.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Aramaic.—</hi> Aramaic is nearly related to Hebraeo-Phoenician;
                    but there is nevertheless a sharp line of demarcation between the two groups. Of
                    its original home nothing . certain is known. In the Old Testament “Aram”
                    appears at an early period as a designation of certain districts in Syria (“Aram
                    of Damascus,” &amp;c.) and in Mesopotamia (“Aram of the Two Rivers”). The
                    language of the</p>
                <p>Aramaeans gradually spread far and wide, and occupied all Syria, both those
                    regions which were before in the possession of the Kheta, probably a non-Semitic
                    people, and those which were most likely inhabited by Canaanite tribes; last of
                    all, Palestine became Aramaized. Towards the east this language was spoken on
                    the Euphrates, and throughout the districts of the Tigris south and west of the
                    Armenian and Kurdish mountains; the province in which the capitals of the
                    Arsacides and the Sásánians were situated was called “the country of the
                    Aramaeans.” In Babylonia and Assyria a large, or perhaps the larger, portion of
                    the population were most probably Aramaeans, even at a very early date, whilst
                    Assyrian was the language of the Government.</p>
                <p>The oldest extant Aramaic documents consist of inscriptions on monuments and on
                    seals and gems. In the Persian period Aramaic was the official language of the
                    provinces west of the Euphrates; and this explains the fact that coins which
                    were struck by governors and vassal princes in Asia Minor, and of which the
                    stamp was in some cases the work of skilled Greek artists, bear Aramaic
                    inscriptions, whilst those of other coins are Greek. This, of course, does not
                    prove that Aramaic was ever spoken in Asia Minor and as far north as Sinope and
                    the Hellespont. In Egypt Aramaic inscriptions have been found of the Persian
                    period, one bearing the date of the fourth year of Xerxes (482 <hi

                    on papyrus, unfortunately in a very tattered condition for the most part, which
                    prove that the Persians preferred using this convenient language to mastering
                    the difficulties of the Egyptian systems of writing. It is, further, very
                    possible that at that time there were considerable numbers of Aramaeans in
                    Egypt, just as there were of Phoenicians, Greeks, and Jews. But probably this
                    preference for Aramaic originated under the Assyrian empire, in which a very
                    large proportion of the population spoke Aramaic, and in which this language
                    would naturally occupy a more important position than it did under the Persians.
                    We therefore understand why it was taken for granted that a great Assyrian
                    official could speak Aramaic (2 Kings xviii. 26; Isa. xxxvi. 11), and for the
                    same reason the dignitaries of Judah appear to have learned the language <hi

                    certain small documents in Semitic writing which date from the Assyrian period,
                    but of which the linguistic character is still very obscure; they contain
                    Aramaic, Phoenician, and probably Assyrian forms. See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Z.D.M.G.,</hi> xxxiii. 321.</p></note> The short dominion of the Chaldaeans
                    very probably strengthened this preponderance of Aramaic. A few ancient Aramaic
                    inscriptions have lately been discovered far within the limits of Arabia, in the
                    palm oasis of Teimá (in the north of the Hijáz); the oldest and by far the most
                    important of these was very likely made before the Persian period. We may
                    presume that Aramaic was introduced into the district by a mercantile colony,
                    which settled in this ancient seat of commerce, and in consequence of which
                    Aramaic may have remained for some time the literary language of the
                    neighbouring Arabs. All these older Aramaic monuments exhibit a language which
                    is almost absolutely identical. One peculiarity which distinguishes it from
                    later Aramaic is that in the relative and demonstrative pronoun the sound
                    originally pronounced <hi rend="italic">dh</hi> is changed into 2, as in Hebrew,
                    not into <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> as is required by a rule universal in the
                    Aramaic dialects.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some

                <p>The Aramaic portions of the Old Testament show us the form of the language which

                    been remodelled by a later writer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The decree which is said to have been sent by Ezra is in its
                    present form a comparatively late production.</p></note> Yet in Ezra we find a
                    few antique forms which do not occur in Daniel. The Aramaic pieces contained in
                    the Bible have the great advantage of being furnished with vowels and other
                    orthographical signs, though these were not inserted until long after the
                    composition of the books, and are sometimes at variance with the text itself.
                    But, since Aramaic was still a living language when the punctuation came into
                    existence, and since the lapse of time was not so very great, the tradition ran
                    less risk of corruption than in the case of Hebrew. Its general correctness is
                    further attested by the innumerable points of resemblance between this language
                    and Syriac, with which we are accurately acquainted. The Aramaic of the Bible
                    exhibits various antique features which afterwards disappeared,—for example, the
                    formation of the passive by means of internal vowel-change, and the causative
                    with <hi rend="italic">ha</hi> instead of with <hi rend="italic"
                    >α</hi>,—phenomena which have been falsely explained as Hebraisms. Biblical
                    Aramaic agrees in all essential points with the language used in the numerous
                    inscriptions of Palmyra (beginning soon before the Christian era and extending
                    to about the end of the 3d century) and on the Nabataean coins and stone
                    monuments (concluding about the year 100). Aramaic was the language of Palmyra,
                    the aristocracy of which were to a great extent of Arabian extraction. In the
                    northern portion of the Nabataean kingdom (not far from Damascus) there was
                    probably a large Aramaic population, but farther south Arabic was spoken. At
                    that time, however, Aramaic was highly esteemed as a cultivated language, for
                    which reason the Arabs in question made use of it, as their own language was not
                    reduced to writing, just as in those ages Greek inscriptions were set up in many
                    districts where no one spoke Greek. That the Nabataeans were Arabs is
                    sufficiently proved by the fact that, with the exception of a few Greek names,
                    almost all the numerous names which occur in the Nabataean inscriptions are
                    Arabic, in many cases with distinctly Arabic terminations. A further proof of
                    this is that in the great inscriptions over the tombs of Hejr (not far from
                    Teimá) the native Arabic continually shows through the foreign disguise,—for
                    instance, in the use of Arabic words whenever the writer does not happen to
                    remember the corresponding Aramaic terms, in the use of the Arabic particle <hi
                    rend="italic">fα</hi>, of the Arabic <hi rend="italic">ghair,</hi> “other than,”
                    and in several syntactic features. The great inscriptions cease with the
                    overthrow of the Nabataean kingdom by Trajan (105); but the Arabian nomads in
                    those countries, especially in the Sinaitic peninsula, often scratched their
                    names on the rocks down to a later period, adding some benedictory formula in
                    Aramaic. The fact that several centuries afterwards the name of “Nabataean” was
                    used by the Arabs as synonymous with “Aramaean” was probably due to the gradual
                    spread of Aramaic over a great part of what had once been the country of the
                    Nabataeans. In any case Aramaic then exercised an immense influence. This is
                    also proved by the place which it occupies in the strange Pahlavf writing,
                    various branches of which date from the time of the Parthian empire (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pahlaví).</hi> Biblical Aramaic, as also the language of the
                    Palmyrene and Nabataean inscriptions, may be described as an older form of
                    Western Aramaic. The opinion that the Palestinian Jews brought their Aramaic
                    dialect direct from Babylon —whence the incorrect name “Chaldee ”—is altogether
                    untenable.</p>
                <p>We may now trace somewhat further the development of Western Aramaic in
                    Palestine; but unhappily few of the sources from which we derive our information
                    can be thoroughly trusted. In the synagogues it was necessary that the reading
                    of the Bible should be followed by an oral “targum” or translation into Aramaic,
                    the language of the people. The Targum was at a later period fixed in writing,
                    but the officially sanctioned form of the Targum to the Pentateuch (the
                    so-called Targum of Onkelos) and of that to the prophets (the so-called
                    Jonathan) was not finally settled till the 4th or 5th century, and not in
                    Palestine but in Babylonia. The redactors of the Targum preserved on the whole
                    the older Palestinian dialect; yet that of Babylon, which differed considerably
                    from the former, exercised a vitiating influence. The punctuation, which was
                    added later, first in Babylonia, is far less trustworthy than that of the
                    Aramaic pieces in the Bible. The language of Onkelos and Jonathan differs but
                    little from Biblical Aramaic. The language spoken some time afterwards by the
                    Palestinian Jews, especially in Galilee, is exhibited in a series of rabbinical
                    works, the so-called Jerusalem Targums (of which, however, those on the
                    Hagiographa are in some cases of later date), a few Midrashic works, and the
                    Jerusalem Talmud. Unfortunately all these books, of which the Midrashím and the
                    Talmud contain much Hebrew as well as Aramaic, have not been handed down with
                    care, and require to be used with great caution for linguistic purposes.
                    Moreover, the influence of the older language and orthography has in part
                    obscured the characteristics of these popular dialects; for example, various
                    gutturals are still written, although they are no longer pronounced. The
                    adaptation of the spelling to the real pronunciation is carried furthest in the
                    Jerusalem Talmud, but not in a consistent manner. Besides, all these books are
                    without vowel-points; but the frequent use of vowel-letters in the later Jewish
                    works renders this defect less sensible.</p>
                <p>Not only the Jews but also the Christians of Palestine retained their native
                    dialect for some time as an ecclesiastical and literary language. We possess
                    translations of the Gospels and fragments of other works in this dialect by the
                    Palestinian Christians dating from about the 5th century, accompanied by a
                    punctuation which was not added till some time later. This dialect closely
                    resembles that of the Palestinian Jews, as was to be expected from the fact that
                    those who spoke it were of Jewish origin.</p>
                <p>Finally, the Samaritans, among the inhabitants of Palestine, translated their
                    only sacred book, the Pentateuch, into their own dialect. The critical study of
                    this translation proves that the language which lies at its base was very much
                    the same as that of the neighbouring Jews. Perhaps, indeed, the Samaritans may
                    have carried the softening of the gutturals a little further than the Jews of
                    Galilee. Their absurd attempt to embellish the language of the translation by
                    arbitrarily introducing forms borrowed from the Hebrew original has given rise
                    to the false notion that Samaritan is a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic. The
                    introduction of Hebrew and even of Arabic words and forms was practised in
                    Samaria on a still larger scale by copyists who lived after Aramaic had become
                    extinct. The later works written in the Samaritan dialect are, from a linguistic
                    point of view, as worthless as the compositions of Samaritans in Hebrew; the
                    writers, who spoke Arabic, endeavoured to write in languages with which they
                    were but half acquainted.</p>
                <p>All these Western Aramaic dialects, including that of the oldest inscriptions,
                    have this feature among others in common, that they form the third person
                    singular masculine and the third person plural masculine and feminine in the
                    imperfect by prefixing <hi rend="italic">y</hi>, as do the other Semitic
                    languages. And in these dialects the termination <hi rend="italic">á</hi> (the
                    so-called “status emphaticus ”) still retained<pb break="no"

                    tolerably late period.</p>
                <p>As early as the 7th century the conquests of the Moslems greatly circumscribed
                    the domain of Aramaic and a few centuries later it was almost completely
                    supplanted in the west by Arabic. For the Christians of those countries, who,
                    like every one else, spoke Arabic, the Palestinian dialect was no longer of
                    importance, and they adopted as their ecclesiastical language the dialect of the
                    other Aramaean Christians, the Syriac (or Edessene). The only localities where a
                    Western Aramaic dialect still survives are a few villages in Anti-Libanus. Our
                    information upon this subject is but slight and fragmentary; but it is hoped
                    that Professors Prym and Socin will soon be able to furnish more ample
                    details.</p>
                <p>The popular Aramaic dialect of Babylonia from the 4th to the 6th century of our
                    era is exhibited in the Babylonian Talmud, in which, however, as in the
                    Jerusalem Talmud, there is a constant mingling of Aramaic and Hebrew passages.
                    To a somewhat later period, and probably not to exactly the same district of
                    Babylonia, belong the writings of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mandaeans</hi> (q.v.)
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">,</hi> a strange sect, half Christian and half heathen, who
                    from a linguistic point of view possess the peculiar advantage of having
                    remained almost entirely free from the influence of Hebrew, which is so
                    perceptible in the Aramaic writings of Jews as well as of Christians. The
                    orthography of the Mandaeans comes nearer than that of the Talmud to the real
                    pronunciation, and in it the softening of the gutturals is most clearly seen. In
                    other respects there is a close resemblance between Mandaean and the language of
                    the Babylonian Talmud. The forms of the imperfect which we have enumerated above
                    take in these dialects <hi rend="italic">n</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi>.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Nöldeke,

                    Babylonia, as in Syria, the language of the Arabic conquerors rapidly drove out
                    that of the country. The latter has long been totally extinct, unless possibly a
                    few surviving Mandaeans still speak among themselves a more modern form of their
                    dialect.</p>
                <p>At Edessa, in the west of Mesopotamia, the native dialect had already been used
                    for some time as a literary ' language, and had been reduced to rule through the
                    influence of the schools (as is proved by the fixity of the grammar and
                    orthography) even before Christianity acquired power in the country in the 2d
                    century. At an early period the Old and New Testaments were here translated,
                    with the help of Jewish tradition. This version (the so-called Peshíṭta or
                    Peshito) became the Bible of Aramaean Christendom, and Edessa became its
                    capital. Thus the Aramaean Christians of the neighbouring countries, even those
                    who were subjects of the Persian empire, adopted the Edessan dialect as the
                    language of the church, of literature, and of cultivated intercourse. Since the
                    ancient name of the inhabitants, “Aramaeans,” just like that of " <hi
                    rend="italic">Eλλνϵς</hi>, had acquired in the minds of Jews and Christians the
                    unpleasant signification of “heathens,” it was generally avoided, and in its
                    place the Greek terms “Syrians” and “Syriac” were used. But “Syriac” was also
                    the name given by the Jews and Christians of Palestine to their own language,
                    and both Greeks and Persians designated the Aramaeans of Babylonia as “Syrians.”
                    It is therefore, properly speaking, incorrect to employ the word “Syriac” as
                    meaning the language of Edessa alone; but, since it was the most important of
                    these dialects, it has the best claim to this generally received appellation. It
                    has, as we have said, a shape very definitely fixed; and in it the
                    above-mentioned forms of the imperfect take an <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> As in
                    the Babylonian dialects, the termination <hi rend="italic">á</hi> has become so
                    completely a part of the substantive to which it is <hi rend="underline">added
                    th</hi> at it has wholly lost the meaning of the definite article, whereby the
                    clearness of the language is perceptibly impaired. The influence exercised by
                    Greek is very apparent in Syriac. From the 3d to the 7th century an extensive
                    literature was produced in this language, consisting chiefly, but not entirely,
                    of ecclesiastical works. In the development of this literature the Syrians of
                    the Persian empire took an eager part. In the Eastern Roman empire Syriac was,
                    after Greek, by far the most important language; and under the Persian kings it
                    virtually occupied a more prominent position as an organ of culture than the
                    Persian language itself. The conquests of the Arabs totally changed this state
                    of things. But meanwhile, even in Edessa, a considerable difference had arisen
                    between the written language and the popular speech, in which the process of
                    modification was still going on. About the year 700 it became a matter of
                    absolute necessity to systematize the grammar of the language and to introduce
                    some means of clearly expressing the vowels. The principal object aimed at was
                    that the text of the Syriac Bible should be recited in a correct manner. But, as
                    it happened, the eastern pronunciation differed in many respects from that of
                    the west. The local dialects had to some extent exercised an influence over the
                    pronunciation of the literary tongue; and, on the other hand, the political
                    separation between Rome and Persia, and yet more the ecclesiastical schism—since
                    the Syrians of the east were mostly Nestorians, those of the west Monophysites
                    and Catholics—had produced divergencies between the traditions of the various
                    schools. Starting, therefore, from a common source, two distinct systems of
                    punctuation were formed, of which the western is the more convenient, but the
                    eastern the more exact and generally the more in accordance with the ancient
                    pronunciation; it has, for example, <hi rend="italic">ci</hi> in place of the
                    western ό, and ó in many cases where the western Syrians pronounce <hi
                    rend="italic">ú.</hi> In later times the two systems have been intermingled in
                    various ways.</p>
                <p>Arabic everywhere put a speedy end to the predominance of Aramaic—a predominance
                    which had lasted for more than a thousand years—and soon began to drive Syriac
                    out of use. At the beginning of the 11th century the learned metropolitan of
                    Nisibis, Elias bar Shinnáyá, wrote his books intended for Christians either
                    entirely in Arabic or in Arabic and Syriac arranged in parallel columns, that
                    is, in the spoken and in the learned language. Thus, too, it became necessary to
                    have Syriac-Arabic glossaries. Up to the present day Syriac has remained in use
                    for literary and ecclesiastical purposes, and may perhaps be even spoken in some
                    monasteries and schools; but it has long been a dead language. When Syriac
                    became extinct in Edessa and its neighbourhood is not known with certainty.</p>
                <p>This language, called Syriac <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> is not the
                    immediate source whence are derived the Aramaic dialects still surviving in the
                    northern districts. In the mountains known as the Túr 'Abdín in Mesopotamia, in
                    certain districts east and north of Mosul, in the neighbouring-mountains of
                    Kurdistan, and again beyond them on the western coast of Lake Urmia, Aramaic
                    dialects are spoken by Christians and occasionally by Jews, and some of these
                    dialects we know with tolerable precision. The dialect of Túr <hi
                    rend="superscript"> '</hi> Abdín seems to differ considerably from all the rest;
                    the country beyond the Tigris is, however, divided, as regards language, amongst
                    a multitude of local dialects. Among these, that of Urmia has become the most
                    important, since American missionaries have formed a new literary language out
                    of it. Moreover, the Roman Propaganda has printed books in two of the Neo-Syriac
                    dialects. All these dialects exhibit a complete transformation of the ancient
                    type, to a degree incomparably greater than is the case, for example, with
                    Mandaean. In particular, the ancient<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n675/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0675-0650"/> verbal tenses have almost entirely disappeared,
                    but have been successfully replaced by new forms derived from participles. There
                    are also other praiseworthy innovations. The dialect of Túr 'Abdín has, for
                    instance, again coined a definite article. By means of violent contractions and
                    phonetic changes some of these dialects, particularly that of Urmia, have
                    acquired a euphony scarcely known in any other of the Semitic languages, with
                    their “stridentia anhelantiaque verba” (Jerome). These Aramaeans have all
                    adopted a motley crowd of foreign words, from the Arabs, Kurds, and Turks, on
                    whose borders they live and of whose languages they can often speak at least
                    one.</p>
                <p>Aramaic is frequently described as a <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> language. This
                    is an opinion which we are unable to share. It is quite possible, even now, to
                    extract a very large vocabulary from the more ancient Aramaic writings, and yet
                    in this predominantly theological literature a part only of the words that
                    existed in the language have been preserved. It is true that Aramaic, having
                    from the earliest times come into close contact with foreign languages, has
                    borrowed many words from them, in particular from Persian and Greek; but, if we
                    leave out of consideration the fact that many Syrian authors are in the habit of
                    using, as ornaments or for convenience (especially in translations), a great
                    number of Greek words, some of which were unintelligible to their readers, we
                    shall find that the proportion of really foreign words in older Aramaic books is
                    not larger, perhaps even smaller, than the proportion of Romance words in German
                    or Dutch. The influence of Greek upon the syntax and phraseology of Syriac is
                    not so great as that which it has exercised, through the medium of Latin, upon
                    the literary languages of modern Europe. With regard to sounds, the most
                    characteristic feature of Aramaic (besides its peculiar treatment of the
                    dentals) is that it is poorer in vowels than Hebrew, not to speak of Arabic,
                    since nearly all short vowels in open syllables either wholly disappear or leave
                    but a slight trace behind them (the so-called shĕwâ). In this respect the
                    punctuation of Biblical Aramaic agrees with Syriac, in which we are able to
                    observe from very early times the number of vowels by examining the metrical
                    pieces constructed according to the number of syllables, and with the Mandaean,
                    which expresses every vowel by means of a vowel-letter. When several distinct
                    dialects so agree, the phenomenon in question must be of great antiquity. There
                    are nevertheless traces which prove that the language once possessed more
                    vowels, and the Aramaeans, for instance, with whom David fought may have
                    pronounced many vowels which afterwards disappeared. Another peculiarity of
                    Aramaic is that it lends itself far more readily to the linking together of
                    sentences than Hebrew and Arabic. It possesses many conjunctions and adverbs to
                    express slight modifications of meaning. It is also very free as regards the
                    order of words. That this quality, which renders it suitable for a clear and
                    limpid prose style, is not the result of Greek influence may be seen by the
                    Mandaean, on which Greek has left no mark. In its attempts to express everything
                    clearly Aramaic often becomes prolix,—for example, by using additional personal
                    and demonstrative pronouns. The contrast between Aramaic as the language of
                    prose and Hebrew as the language of poetry is one which naturally strikes us,
                    but we must beware of carrying it too far. Even the Aramaeans were not wholly
                    destitute of poetical talent. Although the religious poetry of the Syrians has
                    but little charm for us, yet real poetry occurs in the few extant fragments of
                    Gnostic hymns. Moreover, in the modern dialects popular songs have been
                    discovered which, though very simple, are fresh and full of feeling.<note

                    times Aramaic was used in poems which, being contrary to the theological

                    flourished in the regions of the Tigris and on the lower Euphrates which has
                    been preserved to us in the cuneiform inscriptions. It is usually called the
                    Assyrian, after the name of the country where the first and most important
                    excavations were made; but the term “Babylonian” would be more correct, as
                    Babylon was the birthplace of this language and of the civilization to which it
                    belonged. Certain Babylonian inscriptions appear to go back to the fourth
                    millennium before our era; but the great mass of these cuneiform inscriptions

                    be more nearly related to Hebrew than to Aramaic; we may cite, for example, the

                    the genitive, and is identical with the Phoenician <hi rend="italic">ash</hi>

                    between Assyrian and Hebrew in the treatment of the aspirated dentals. On the
                    other hand, Assyrian differs in many respects from all the cognate languages.
                    The ancient perfect has wholly disappeared, or left but few traces, and the

                    smoothed down to a degree which is only paralleled in the modern Aramaic

                    44,—passages all belonging to the 6th century B.C.), the name of the god who was
                    originally called <hi rend="italic">ba'l,</hi> is a confirmation of this; but,
                    on the other hand, the name of the country where Babylon was situated, viz.,
                    Shin'ar, and that of a Babylonian god, 'Anammelekh (2 Kings xvii. 31), as well
                    as those of the tribes Shó'a and Kó'a (Ezek. xxiii. 23) who inhabited the
                    Assyrio-Babylonian territory, seem to militate against this theory, as they are
                    spelt in the Old Testament with ' <hi rend="italic">ain.</hi> The Assyrian
                    system of writing is so complicated, and, in spite of its vast apparatus, is so
                    imperfect an instrument for the accurate representation of sounds, that we are
                    hardly yet bound to regard the transcriptions of contemporary Assyriologists as
                    being in all points of detail the final dictum of science. It is, for example,
                    very doubtful whether the vowels at the end of words and the appended <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> were really pronounced in all cases, as this would
                    presuppose a complete confusion in the grammar of the language. However this may
                    be, the present writer does not feel able to speak at greater length upon
                    Assyrian, not being an Assyriologist himself nor yet capable of satisfactorily
                    distinguishing the certain from the uncertain results of Assyriological
                    inquiry.</p>
                <p>The native cuneiform writing was used in Babylonia not only under the Persian
                    empire but also in the Greek period, as the discovery of isolated specimens
                    proves. It does not of course necessarily follow from this that Assyrian was
                    still spoken at that time. Indeed, this language may possibly have been banished
                    from ordinary life long before the destruction of Nineveh, surviving only as the
                    official and sacerdotal tongue. These inscriptions, in any case, were intended
                    for none but a narrow circle of learned persons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arabic.—</hi> The southern group of Semitic languages consists
                    of Arabic and Ethiopic. Arabic, again, is subdivided into the dialects of the
                    larger portion of Arabia and those of the extreme south (the Sabaean, &amp;c.).
                    At a very much earlier time than we were but lately justified in supposing, some
                    of the northern Arabs reduced their language to writing. For travellers have
                    quite recently discovered in the northern parts of the Hijáz inscriptions in a
                    strange character, which seem to have been written long before our<pb break="no"

                    perhaps represents an earlier stage of graphical development. These inscriptions
                    have been called “Thamudic,” because they were found in the country of the
                    Thamud; but this designation is scarcely a suitable one, because during the
                    period when the power of the Thamúd was at its height, and when the buildings
                    mentioned in the Koran were hewn in the rocks, the language of this country was
                    Nabataean (see above). Unfortunately the inscriptions hitherto discovered are

                    fragmentary, and consequently furnish but little material to the student of
                    languages. But there can be no doubt that they are written in an Arabic dialect.
                    The treatment of the dentals, among other things, is a sufficient proof of this.
                    At least in one point they bear a striking resemblance to Hebrew: they have the
                    article <hi rend="italic">ha</hi> (not <hi rend="italic">hal,</hi> as we might
                    expect). It is possible that the tribes living on Arabian soil which are
                    regarded in the Old Testament as nearly related to Israel, that is, the
                    Ishmaelites, the Midianites, and even the Edomites, may have spoken dialects
                    occupying a middle position between Arabic and Hebrew. They are perhaps traces
                    of some such intermediate link that have been preserved to us in these
                    inscriptions.</p>
                <p>The numerous inscriptions scattered over the north-west of Arabia, especially
                    over the wild and rocky district of Safá, near Damascus, probably date from a
                    later period. They are written in peculiar characters, which, it would seem, are
                    likewise related to those used by the Sabaeans. They are all of them short and
                    indistinct, scratched hurriedly and irregularly upon unhewn stone. What we at
                    present understand of them—they consist almost entirely of proper names—is owing
                    in nearly every case to the ingenuity of Halévy.<note anchored="true"

                    matters of detail, however, much still remains uncertain. To decipher them with
                    absolute certainty will no doubt always be impossible on account of their
                    careless execution. These inscriptions are probably the work of Arab emigrants
                    from the south.</p>
                <p>The Arabs who inhabited the Nabataean kingdom wrote in Aramaic, but, as has been
                    remarked above, their native language, Arabic, often shows through the foreign
                    disguise. We are thus able to satisfy ourselves that these Arabs, who lived a
                    little before and a little after Christ, spoke a dialect closely resembling the
                    later classical Arabic. The nominative of the so-called “triptote” nouns has, as
                    in classical Arabic, the termination <hi rend="italic">u ∙,</hi> the genitive
                    has <hi rend="italic">i</hi> (the accusative therefore probably ended in <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>), but without the addition of <hi rend="italic">n.</hi>
                    Generally speaking, those proper names which in classical Arabic are “diptotes”
                    are here devoid of any inflexional termination. The <hi rend="italic">u</hi> of
                    the nominative appears also in Arabic proper names belonging to more northern
                    districts, as, for example, Palmyra and Edessa. All these Arabs were probably of
                    the same race. It is possible that the two oldest known specimens of
                    distinctively Arabic writing—namely, the Arabic portion of the trilingual
                    inscription of Zabad, south-east of Haleb (Aleppo), written in Syriac, Greek,
                    and Arabic, and dating from 512 or 513 A.D.,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Arabic, of 568 —represent nothing but a somewhat more modern form of this
                    dialect. In both these inscriptions proper names take in the genitive the
                    termination <hi rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">,</hi> which shows that
                    the meaning of such inflexions was no longer felt. These two inscriptions,
                    especially that of Zabad, which is badly written, have not yet been
                    satisfactorily interpreted in all their details.</p>
                <p>During the whole period of the preponderance of Aramaic this language exercised a
                    great influence upon the vocabulary of the Arabs. The more carefully we
                    investigate the more clearly does it appear that numerous Arabic words, used for
                    ideas or objects which presuppose a certain degree of civilization, are borrowed
                    from the Aramaeans. Hence the civilizing influence of their northern neighbours
                    must have been very strongly felt by the Arabs, and contributed in no small
                    measure to prepare them for playing so important a part in the history of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>In the 6th century the inhabitants of the greater part of Arabia proper spoke
                    everywhere essentially the same language, which, as being by far the most
                    important of all Arabic dialects, is known simply as the Arabic language. Arabic
                    poetry, at that time cultivated throughout the whole of central and northern
                    Arabia as far as the lower Euphrates and even beyond it, employed one language
                    only. The extant Arabic poems belonging to the heathen period were not indeed
                    written down till much later, and meanwhile underwent considerable
                    alterations<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comp. the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mo’allaḳát.</hi></p></note>; but the absolute
                    regularity of the metre and rhyme is a sufficient proof that on the whole these
                    poems all obeyed the same laws of language. It is indeed highly probable that
                    the rhapsodists and the grammarians have effaced many slight dialectical
                    peculiarities; in a great number of passages, for example, the poets may have
                    used, in accordance with the fashion of their respective tribes, some other case
                    than that prescribed by the grammarians, and a thing of this kind may afterwards
                    have been altered, unless it happened to occur in rhyme; but such alterations
                    cannot have extended very far. A dialect that diverged in any great measure from
                    the Arabic of the grammarians could not possibly have been made to fit into the
                    metres. Moreover, the Arabic philologists recognize the existence of various
                    small distinctions between the dialects of individual tribes and of their poets,
                    and the traditions of the more ancient schools of Koran readers exhibit very
                    many dialectical <hi rend="italic">nuances.</hi> It might indeed be conjectured
                    that for the majority of the Arabs the language of poetry was an artificial
                    one,— the speech of certain tribes having been adopted by all the rest as a <hi
                    rend="italic">dialectus poetica.</hi> And this might be possible in the case of
                    wandering minstrels whose art gained them their livelihood, such as Nábigha and
                    A'shá. But, when we find that the Bedouin goat-herds, for instance, in the
                    mountainous district near Mecca composed poems in this very same language upon
                    their insignificant feuds and personal quarrels, that in it the proud chiefs of
                    the Taghlibites and the Bekrites addressed defiant verses to the king of Híra
                    (on the Euphrates), that a Christian inhabitant of Híra, Adí b. Zaid, used this
                    language in his serious poems, —when we reflect that, as far as the Arabic
                    poetry of the heathen period extends, there is nowhere a trace of any important
                    linguistic difference, it would surely be a paradox to assume that all these
                    Arabs, who for the most part were quite illiterate and yet extremely jealous of
                    the honour of their tribes, could have taken the trouble to clothe their ideas
                    and feelings in a foreign, or even a perfectly artificial, language. The Arabic
                    philologists also invariably regarded the language of the poets as being that of
                    the Arabs in general. Even at the end of the 2d century after Mohammed the
                    Bedouins of Arabia proper, with the exception of a few outlying districts, were
                    considered as being in possession of this pure Arabic. The most learned
                    grammarians were in the habit of appealing to any uneducated man who happened to
                    have just arrived with his camels from the desert, though he did not know by
                    heart twenty verses of the Koran, and had no conception of theo<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n677/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0677-0652"/>retical grammar, in order that he might decide
                    whether in Arabic it were allowable or necessary to express oneself in this or
                    that manner. It is evident that these profound scholars knew of only one
                    classical language, which was still spoken by the Bedouins. The tribes which
                    produced the principal poets of the earlier period belonged for the most part to
                    portions of the Hijáz, to Nejd and its neighbourhood, and to the region which
                    stretches thence towards the Euphrates. A great part of the Hijáz, on the other
                    hand, plays a very unimportant part in this poetry, and the Arabs of the
                    north-west, who were under the Roman dominion, have no share whatever in it. The
                    dialects of these latter tribes probably diverged further from the ordinary
                    language. The fact that they were Christians does not explain this, since the
                    Taghlibites and other tribes who produced eminent poets also professed
                    Christianity. Moreover, poets from the interior were gladly welcomed at the
                    court of the Ghassanian princes, who were Christian vassals of the emperor
                    residing near Damascus; in this district, therefore, their language was at least
                    <hi rend="italic">understood.</hi> It may be added that most of the tribes which
                    cultivated poetry appear to have been near neighbours at an epoch not very far
                    removed from that in question, and afterwards to have been scattered in large
                    bands over a much wider extent of country. And nearly all those who were not
                    Christians paid respect to the sanctuary of Mecca. It is a total mistake, but
                    one frequently made by Europeans, to designate the Arabic language as “the
                    Koraishite dialect.” This expression never occurs in any Arabic author. True, in
                    a few rare cases we do read of the dialect of the Koraish, by which is meant the
                    peculiar local tinge that distinguished the speech of Mecca; but to describe the
                    Arabic language as “Koraishite” is as absurd as it would be to speak of English
                    as the dialect of London or of Oxford. This unfortunate designation has been
                    made the basis of a theory very often repeated in modern times,— namely, that
                    classical Arabic is nothing else but the dialect of Mecca, which the Koran first
                    brought into fashion. So far from this being the case, it is certain that the
                    speech of the <hi rend="italic">towns</hi> in the Hijáz did not agree in every
                    point with the language of the poets, and, as it happens, the Koran itself
                    contains some remarkable deviations from the rules of the classical language.
                    This would be still more evident if the punctuation, which was introduced at a
                    later time, did not obscure many details. The traditions which represent the
                    Koraish as speaking the purest of all Arabic dialects are partly the work of the
                    imagination and partly compliments paid to the rulers descended from the
                    Koraish, but are no doubt at variance with the ordinary opinion of the Arabs
                    themselves in earlier days. In the Koran Mohammed has imitated the poets,
                    though, generally speaking, with little success; the poets, on the other hand,
                    never imitated him. Thus the Koran and its language exercised but very little
                    influence upon the poetry of the following century and upon that of later times,
                    whereas this poetry closely and slavishly copied the productions of the old
                    heathen period. The fact that the poetical literature of the early Moslems has
                    been preserved in a much more authentic form than the works of the heathen poets
                    proves that our idea of the ancient poetry is on the whole just.</p>
                <p>The Koran and Islam raised Arabic to the position of one of the principal
                    languages of the world. Under the leadership of the Koraish the Bedouins
                    subjected half the world to both their dominion and their faith. Thus Arabic
                    acquired the additional character of a sacred language. But soon it became
                    evident that not nearly all the Arabs spoke a language precisely identical with
                    the classical Arabic of the poets. The north-western Arabs played a particularly
                    important part during the period of the Omayyads. The ordinary speech of Mecca
                    and Medina was, as we have seen, no longer quite so primitive as that of the
                    desert. To this may be added that the military expeditions brought those Arabs
                    who spoke the classical language into contact with tribes from out-of-the-way
                    districts, such as Omán, Bahrain (Bahrein), and particularly the north of Yemen.
                    The fact that numbers of foreigners, on passing over to Islam, became rapidly
                    Arabized was also little calculated to preserve the unity of the language.
                    Finally, the violent internal and external commotions which were produced by the
                    great events of that time, and stirred the whole nation, probably accelerated
                    linguistic change. In any case, we know from good tradition that even in the 1st
                    century of the Flight the distinction between correct and incorrect speech was
                    quite perceptible. About the end of the 2d century the system of Arabic grammar
                    was constructed, and never underwent any essential modification in later times.
                    The theory as to how one should express oneself was now definitely fixed. The
                    majority of those Arabs who lived beyond the limits of Arabia already diverged
                    far from this standard; and in particular the final vowels which serve to
                    indicate cases and moods were no longer pronounced. This change, by which Arabic
                    lost one of its principal advantages, was no doubt hastened by the fact that
                    even in the classical style such terminations were omitted whenever the word
                    stood at the end of a sentence (in pause); and in the living language of the
                    Arabs this dividing of sentences is very frequent. Hence people were already
                    quite accustomed to forms without grammatical terminations.</p>
                <p>Through the industry of Arabic philologists we are able to make ourselves
                    intimately acquainted with the system, and still more with the vocabulary of the
                    language, although they have not always performed their task in a critical
                    manner. We should be all the more disposed to admire the richness of the ancient
                    Arabic vocabulary when we remember how simple are the conditions of life amongst
                    the Arabs, how painfully monotonous their country, and consequently how limited
                    the range of their ideas must be. Within this range, however, the slightest
                    modification is expressed by a particular word. It must be confessed that the
                    Arabic lexicon has been greatly augmented by the habit of citing as words by
                    themselves such rhetorical phrases as an individual poet has used to describe an
                    object: for example, if one poet calls the lion the “tearer” and another calls
                    him the “mangier,” each of these terms is explained by the lexicographers as
                    equivalent to “lion.” One branch of literature in particular, namely, lampoons
                    and satirical poems, which for the most part have perished, no doubt introduced
                    into the lexicon many expressions coined in an arbitrary and sometimes in a very
                    strange manner. Moreover, Arabic philologists have greatly underrated the number
                    of words which, though they occur now and then in poems, were never in general
                    use except among particular tribes. But in spite of these qualifications it must
                    be admitted that the vocabulary is surprisingly rich, and the Arabic dictionary
                    will always remain the principal resource for the elucidation of obscure
                    expressions in all the other Semitic tongues. This method, if pursued with the
                    necessary caution, is a perfectly legitimate one.</p>
                <p>Poems seldom enable us to form a clear idea of the language of ordinary life, and
                    Arabic poetry happens to have been distinguished from the very beginning by a
                    certain tendency to artificiality and mannerism. Still less does the Koran
                    exhibit the language in its spoken form. This office is performed by the prose
                    of the ancient traditions (Hadith). The genuine accounts of the deeds of the
                    Prophet and of his companions, and not less the stories concerning the battles
                    and adventures of the Bedouins in the heathen period and in the earlier days of
                    Islam, are<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n678/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0678-0653"/> excellent models of a prose style, although in
                    some cases their redaction dates from a later time.</p>
                <p>Classical Arabic is rich not only in words but in grammatical forms. The
                    wonderful development of the broken plurals, and sometimes of the verbal nouns
                    must be regarded as an excess of wealth. The sparing use of the ancient
                    terminations which mark the plural has somewhat obscured the distinction between
                    plurals, collectives, abstract nouns, and feminines in general. In its manner of
                    employing the verbal tenses genuine Arabic still exhibits traces of that
                    poetical freedom which we see in Hebrew; this characteristic disappears in the
                    later literary language. In connecting sentences Arabic can go much further than
                    Hebrew, but the simple parataxis is by far the most usual construction. Arabic
                    has, however, this great advantage, that it scarcely ever leaves us in doubt as
                    to where the apodosis begins. The attempts to define the tenses more clearly by
                    the addition of adverbs and auxiliary verbs lead to no very positive result (as
                    is the case in other Semitic languages also), since they are not carried out in
                    a systematic manner. The arrangement of words in a sentence is governed by very
                    strict rules. As the subject and object, at least in ordinary cases, occupy
                    fixed positions, and as the genitive is invariably placed after the noun that
                    governs it, the use of case-endings loses much of its significance.</p>
                <p>This language of the Bedouins had now, as we have seen, become that of religion,
                    courts, and polished society. In the streets of the towns the language already
                    diverged considerably from this, but the upper classes took pains to speak
                    “Arabic.” The poets and the <hi rend="italic">beaux esprits never</hi> ventured
                    to employ any but the classical language, and the “Atticists,” with pedantic
                    seriousness, convicted the most celebrated among the later poets (for instance
                    Motan-abbí) of occasional deviations from the standard of correct speech. At the
                    same time, however, classical Arabic was the language of business and of
                    science, and at the present day still holds this position. There are, of course,
                    many gradations between the pedantry of purists and the use of what is simply a
                    vulgar dialect. Sensible writers employ a kind of <hi rend="italic">κοινή,</hi>
                    which does not aim at being strictly correct and calls modern things by modern
                    names, but which, nevertheless, avoids coarse vulgarisms, aiming principally at
                    making itself intelligible to all educated men. The reader may pronounce or omit
                    the ancient terminations as he chooses. This language lived on, in a sense,
                    through the whole of the Middle Ages, owing chiefly to the fact that it was
                    intended for educated persons in general and not only for the learned, whereas
                    the poetical schools strove to make use of the long extinct language of the
                    Bedouins. As might be expected, this <hi rend="italic">κοινή,</hi> like the <hi
                    rend="italic">κοινή</hi> of the Greeks, has a comparatively limited vocabulary,
                    since its principle is to retain only those expressions from the ancient
                    language which were generally understood, and it does not borrow much new
                    material from the vulgar dialects.</p>
                <p>It is entirely a mistake to suppose that Arabic is unsuited for the treatment of
                    abstract subjects. On the contrary, scarcely any language is so well adapted to
                    be the organ of scholasticism in all its branches. Even the tongue of the
                    ancient Bedouins had a strong preference for the use of abstract verbal nouns
                    (in striking contrast to the Latin, for example); thus they oftener said
                    “Needful is thy sitting” than “It is needful that thou shouldest sit.” This
                    tendency was very advantageous to philosophical phraseology. The strict rules as
                    to the order of words, though very unfavourable to the development of a truly
                    eloquent style, render it all the easier to express ideas in a rigidly
                    scientific form.</p>
                <p>In the meantime Arabic, like every other widely spread language, necessarily
                    began to undergo modification and to split up into dialects. The Arabs are
                    mistaken in attributing this development to the influence of those foreign
                    languages with which Arabic came into contact. Such influences can have had but
                    little to do with the matter; for were it otherwise the language of the interior
                    of Arabia must have remained unchanged, yet even in this region the inhabitants
                    are very far from speaking as they did a thousand years back. A person who in
                    Arabia or elsewhere should trust to his knowledge of classical Arabic only would
                    resemble those travellers from the north who endeavour to make themselves
                    understood by Italian waiters through the medium of a kind of Latin. The written
                    language has, it is true, greatly retarded the development of the dialects.
                    Every good Moslem repeats at least a few short súras several times a day in his
                    prayers, besides being minutely acquainted with the sacred book; and this must
                    have had a powerful influence upon the speech of the people at large. But
                    nevertheless dialects have formed themselves and have diverged considerably from
                    one another. Of these there are indeed but few with which we are tolerably well
                    acquainted; that of Egypt alone is known with real accuracy.<note

                    fifty years, we still possess but imperfect information with respect to the

                    one hand and with that of Tunis on the other. Arabic has long been banished from
                    Spain; but we possess a few literary works written in Spanish Arabic, and just
                    before it became too late Pedro de Alcala composed a grammar and a lexicon of
                    that dialect.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>They were
                    published in 1505, reprinted by Lagarde <hi rend="italic">(Petri Hispani de
                    Lingua Arabica Libri duo,</hi> Göttingen, 1883).</p></note> We have also a few
                    ancient specimens of the Arabic which was once spoken in Sicily. To the western
                    group of dialects belongs the language of Malta, which, cut off as it is from
                    other Arabic dialects and exposed to the influence of Italian, has developed
                    itself in a very strange manner; in it a considerable number of books have
                    already been printed, but with Latin characters. The dialects of Arabia, Syria,
                    and the other Eastern provinces, in spite of many valuable works, are not yet
                    sufficiently well known to admit of being definitely classified.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the development of these dialects is in part the
                    result of older dialectical variations which were already in existence in the
                    time of the Prophet. The histories of dialects which differ completely from one
                    another often pursue an analogous course. In general, the Arabic dialects still
                    resemble one another more than we might expect when we take into consideration
                    the great extent of country over which they are spoken and the very considerable
                    geographical obstacles that stand in the way of communication. But we must not
                    suppose that people, for instance, from Mosul, Morocco, San'á, and the interior
                    of Arabia would be able to understand one another without difficulty. It is a
                    total error to regard the difference between the Arabic dialects and the ancient
                    language as a trifling one, or to represent the development of these dialects as
                    something wholly unlike the development of the Romance languages. No living
                    Arabic dialect diverges from classical Arabic so much as French or Rouman from
                    Latin; but, on the other hand, no Arabic dialect resembles the classical
                    language so closely as the Lugodoric dialect, which is still spoken in Sardinia,
                    resembles its parent speech, and yet the lapse of time is very much greater in
                    the case of the latter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sabaean.—</hi> Long before Mohammed, a peculiar and highly
                    developed form of civilization had flourished in the tableland to the south-west
                    of Arabia. The more we become acquainted with the country of the ancient
                    Sabaeans and with its colossal edifices, and the better we are able to decipher
                    its inscriptions, which are being discovered in ever-increasing numbers, the
                    easier it is for us to account for the haze of mythical glory wherewith the
                    Sabaeans were once invested. The Sabaean inscriptions (which till lately were
                    more often called by the less correct name of “Himyaritic ”) begin long before
                    our era and continue till about the 4th century. The somewhat stiff character is
                    always very distinct; and the habit of regularly dividing the words from one
                    another renders decipherment easier, which, however, has not yet been performed
                    in a very satisfactory manner, owing in part to the fact that the vast majority
                    of the documents in question consist of religious votive tablets with peculiar
                    sacerdotal expressions, or of architectural notices abounding in technical
                    terms. These inscriptions fall into two classes, distinguished partly by
                    grammatical peculiarities and partly by peculiarities of phraseology. One
                    dialect, which forms the causative with <hi rend="italic">ha,</hi> like Hebrew
                    and others, and employs, like nearly<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n679/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0679-0654"/> all the Semitic languages, the termination h <hi
                    rend="italic">(hú)</hi> as the suffix of the third person singular, is the
                    Sabaean properly speaking. The other, which expresses the causative by <hi
                    rend="italic">sa</hi> (corresponding to the Shaphel of the Aramaeans and
                    others), and for the suffix uses <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (like the Assyrian <hi
                    rend="italic">sh</hi>), is the Minaic. To this latter branch belong the numerous
                    South Arabic inscriptions recently found in the north of the Hijaz, near Hejr,
                    where the Minaeans must have had a commercial settlement. The difference between
                    the two classes of inscriptions is no doubt ultimately based upon a real
                    divergence of dialect. But the singular manner in which districts containing
                    Sabaean inscriptions and those containing Minaic alternate with one another
                    seems to point in part to a mere hieratic practice of clinging to ancient modes
                    of expression. Indeed it is very probably due to conscious literary conservatism
                    that the language of the inscriptions remains almost entirely unchanged through
                    many centuries. A few inscriptions from districts rather more to the east
                    exhibit certain linguistic peculiarities, which, however, may perhaps be
                    explained by the supposition that the writers did not, as a rule, speak this
                    dialect, and therefore were but imperfectly acquainted with it.</p>
                <p>As the Sabaean writing seldom indicates the vowels, our knowledge of the language
                    is necessarily very incomplete; and the unvarying style of the inscriptions
                    excludes a great number of the commonest grammatical forms. Not a single
                    occurrence of the first or second person has yet been detected, with the
                    possible exception of one proper name, in which “our god” apparently occurs. But
                    the knowledge which we already possess amply suffices to prove that Sabaean is
                    closely related to Arabic as we are acquainted with it. The former language
                    possesses the same phonetic elements as the latter, except that it has at least
                    one additional sibilant, which appears to have been lost in Arabic. It possesses
                    the broken plural, a dual form resembling that used in Arabic, &amp;c. It is
                    especially important to notice that Sabaean expresses the idea of indefiniteness
                    by means of an appended <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> just as Arabic expresses it by
                    means of an <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> which in all probability is a modification
                    of the former sound. Both in this point and in some others Sabaean appears more
                    primitive than Arabic, as might be expected from the earlier date of its
                    monuments. The article is formed by appending an <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> In
                    its vocabulary also Sabaean bears a great resemblance to Arabic, although, on
                    the other hand, it often approaches more nearly to the northern Semitic
                    languages in this respect; and it possesses much that is peculiar to
                    itself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The literature
                    relating to these inscriptions is widely scattered. Before the Parisian <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus</hi> supplies us with the collected materials, we may hope
                    to see the Sabaean grammar of D. H. Müller, who, with Halévy, has lately
                    rendered the greatest services in this department.</p></note></p>
                <p>Soon after the Christian era Sabaean civilization began to decline, and
                    completely perished in the wars with the Abyssinians, who several times occupied
                    the country, and in the 6th century remained in possession of it for a
                    considerable period. In that age the language of central Arabia was already
                    penetrating into the Sabaean domain. It is further possible that many tribes
                    which dwelt not far to the north of the civilized districts had always spoken
                    dialects resembling central Arabic rather than Sabaean. About the year 600
                    “Arabic” was the language of all Yemen, with the exception perhaps of a few
                    isolated districts, and this process of assimilation continued in later times.
                    Several centuries after Mohammed learned Yemenites were acquainted with the
                    characters of the inscriptions which abounded in their country; they were also
                    able to decipher the proper names and a small number of Sabaean words the
                    meaning of which was still known to them, but they could no longer understand
                    the inscriptions as a whole. Being zealous local patriots, they discovered in
                    those inscriptions which they imagined themselves to be capable of deciphering
                    many fabulous stories respecting the glory of the ancient Yemenites.</p>
                <p>Farther to the east, in the sea-coast districts of Shihr and Mahra, up to the
                    borders of the barren desert of the interior, and also, we are told, in the
                    island of Socotra, dialects very unlike Arabic are still spoken. Allusions to
                    this fact are found in Arabic writers of the 10th century. These dialects depart
                    widely from the ancient Semitic type, but bear some resemblance to the Sabaean,
                    although they cannot be regarded as actually descended from the latter. One
                    feature which they have in common with Sabaean is the habit of appending an <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> to the imperfect. Like the Ethiopic, and probably also the
                    Sabaean, they use <hi rend="italic">k</hi> (instead of t) in the terminations of
                    the first person singular and the second person singular and plural of the
                    perfect tense. In the suffixes of the third person there appears, at least in
                    the feminine, an <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> as in the Minaic. Unfortunately the
                    information which we have hitherto possessed respecting these dialects is meagre
                    and inexact, in part very inexact.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    reduced to writing at an early date. To judge by the few passages communicated
                    by Salt, the back of the inscription of Aeizanas, king of Aksúm about 350,
                    exhibits writing in the Sabaean language, which appears to prove that the
                    development of the Geez character out of the Sabaean, and the elevation of Geez
                    to the rank of a literary language, must have taken place after the year 350.
                    The oldest monuments of this language which are known with certainty are the two
                    great inscriptions of Tázéná, a heathen king of Aksúm, dating from about 500.
                    Hitherto our acquaintance with these inscriptions has been derived from very
                    imperfect drawings<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    book. The English in 1868 did not seize the opportunity to examine thoroughly
                    the antiquities of Aksum, and since then no traveller has taken the trouble to
                    procure accurate copies of these extremely important monuments.</p></note>; but
                    they amply suffice to show that we have here the same language as that in which
                    the Ethiopic Bible is written, with the very same exact indication of the
                    vowels,—a point in which Ethiopic has an advantage over all other Semitic
                    characters. Who introduced this vocalization is unknown. When the
                    above-mentioned inscriptions were made the Bible had probably been already
                    translated into Geez from the Greek, perhaps in part by Jews; for Jews and
                    Christians were at that time actively competing with one another, both in Arabia
                    and in Abyssinia; nor were the former unsuccessful in making proselytes. The
                    missionaries who gave the Bible to the Abyssinians must, at least in some cases,
                    have spoken Aramaic as their mother-tongue, for this alone can explain the fact
                    that in the Ethiopic Bible certain religious conceptions are expressed by
                    Aramaic words. During the following centuries various works were produced by the
                    Abyssinians in this language; they were all, so far as we are able to judge, of
                    a more or less theological character, almost invariably translations from the
                    Greek. We cannot say with certainty when Geez ceased to be the language of the
                    people, but it was probably about a thousand years ago. From the time when the
                    Abyssinian kingdom was reconstituted, towards the end of the 13th century, by
                    the so-called Solomonian dynasty (which was of southern origin), the language of
                    the court and of the Government was Amharic; but Geez remained the
                    ecclesiastical and literary language, and Geez literature even showed a
                    certain<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n680/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0680-0655"/> activity in numerous translations from those
                    Arabic and Coptic works which were in use amongst the Christians of Egypt;
                    besides these a few original writings were composed, namely, lives of saints,
                    hymns, &amp;c. This literary condition lasted till modern times. The language,
                    which had long become extinct, was by no means invariably written in a pure
                    form; indeed even in manuscripts of more ancient works we find many linguistic
                    corruptions, which have crept in partly through mere carelessness and ignorance,
                    partly through the influence of the later dialects. On points of detail we are
                    still sometimes left in doubt, as we possess no manuscripts belonging to the
                    older period. This renders it all the more important that the ancient and
                    authentic inscriptions upon the monuments of Aksúm should be accurately
                    published.</p>
                <p>Geez is more nearly related to Sabaean than to Arabic, though scarcely to such a
                    degree as we might expect. The historical intercourse between the Sabaeans and
                    the people of Aksúm does not, however, prove that those who spoke Geez were
                    simply a colony from Sabaea; the language may be descended from an extinct
                    cognate dialect of south Arabia, or may have arisen from a mingling of several
                    such dialects. And this colonization in Africa probably began much sooner than
                    is usually supposed. In certain respects Geez represents a more modern stage of
                    development than Arabic; we may cite as instances the loss of some inflexional
                    terminations and of the ancient passive, the change of the aspirated dentals
                    into sibilants, Ac. In the manuscripts, especially those of later date, many
                    letters are confounded, namely, <hi rend="italic">h, h,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">kh, s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sh, c</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi>; this, however, is no doubt due only to the influence of the modern
                    dialects. To this same influence, and indirectly perhaps to that of the Hamitic
                    languages, we may ascribe the very hard sound now given to certain letters, <hi
                    rend="italic">ḳ, ṭ, ç,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ḍ,</hi> in the reading of
                    Geez. The last two are at present pronounced something like <hi rend="italic"
                    >ṭs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ts</hi> (the German z). A peculiar advantage
                    possessed by Geez and by all Ethiopic languages is the sharp distinction between
                    the imperfect and the subjunctive: in the former a vowel is inserted after the
                    first radical,—a formation of which there seem to be traces in the dialect of
                    Mahra, and which is also believed to have existed in Assyrian. Geez has no
                    definite article, but is very rich in particles. In the ease with which it joins
                    sentences together and in its freedom as to the order of words it resembles
                    Aramaic. The vocabulary is but imperfectly known, as the theological literature,
                    which is for the most part very arid, supplies us with comparatively few
                    expressions that do not occur in the Bible, whereas the more modern works borrow
                    their phraseology in part from the spoken dialects, particularly Amharic. With
                    regard to the vocabulary, Geez has much in common with the other Semitic
                    tongues, but at the same time possesses many words peculiar to itself; of these
                    a considerable proportion may be of Hamitic origin. Even some grammatical
                    phenomena seem to indicate Hamitic influence; for instance, the very frequent
                    use of the gerundive, a feature which has become still more prominent in the
                    modern dialects, placed as they are in yet closer contact with the Hamitic. We
                    must not suppose that the ancient inhabitants of Aksúm were of pure Semitic
                    blood. The immigration of the Semites from Arabia was in all probability a slow
                    process, and under such circumstances there is every reason to assume that they
                    largely intermingled with the aborigines. This opinion seems to be confirmed by
                    anthropological facts.</p>
                <p>Not only in what is properly the territory of Aksúm (namely,</p>
                <p>Tigré, north-eastern Abys inia), but also in the countries bordering upon it to
                    the north, including the islands of Dahlak, dialects are still spoken which are
                    but more modern forms of the linguistic type clearly exhibited in Geez. The two
                    principal of these are that spoken in Tigré proper and that of the neighbouring
                    countries.</p>
                <p>In reality, the name of Tigré belongs to both, and it would be desirable to
                    distinguish them from one another as Northern and Southern Tigré. But it is the
                    custom to call the northern dialect Tigré simply, whilst that spoken in Tigré
                    itself bears the name of Tigrina, with an Amharic termination. It is generally
                    assumed that Tigré bears a closer resemblance to Geez than does Tigrina,
                    although the latter is spoken in the country where Geez was formed; and this may
                    very possibly be the case, for Tigrina has during several centuries been very
                    strongly influenced by Amharic, which has not been the case with Tigré, which is
                    spoken partly by nomads. Of Tigré, which appears to be divided into numerous
                    dialects, we have several glossaries; but of its grammar we as yet know but
                    little. Written specimens of this language are almost entirely wanting. With
                    Tigrina we are somewhat better acquainted,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the site of the ancient Aksúm, where Amharic happens to be particularly
                    strong,—above all, amongst the more educated classes. In Tigrina the older
                    grammatical forms are often subjected to violent alterations; foreign elements
                    creep in; but the kernel remains Semitic.</p>
                <p>Very different is the case with Amharic, a language of which the domain extends
                    from the left bank of the Takkazé into regions far to the south. Although by no
                    means the only language spoken in these countries, it always tends to displace
                    those foreign tongues which surround it and with which it is interspersed. We
                    here refer especially to the Agaw dialects. Although Amharic has been driven
                    back by the invasions of the Galla tribes, it has already compensated itself to
                    some extent for this loss, as the Yedju and Wollo Gallas, who penetrated into
                    eastern Abyssinia, have adopted it as their language. With the exception, of
                    course, of Arabic, no Semitic tongue is spoken by so large a number of human
                    beings as Amharic. The very fact that the Agaw languages are being gradually,
                    and, as it were, before our own eyes, absorbed by Amharic<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Only an advanced guard of the Agaw languages,

                    chiefly by people who are not of Semitic race. This supposition is confirmed by
                    a study of the language itself. Amharic has diverged from the ancient Semitic
                    type to a far greater extent than any of the dialects which we have hitherto
                    enumerated. Many of the old formations preserved in Geez are completely modified
                    in Amharic. Of the feminine forms there remain but a few traces; and that is the
                    case also with the ancient plural of the noun. The strangest innovations occur
                    in the personal pronouns. And certainly not more than half the vocabulary can
                    without improbability be made to correspond with that of the other Semitic
                    languages. In this, as also in the grammar, we must leave out of account all
                    that is borrowed from Geez, which, as being the ecclesiastical tongue, exercises
                    a great influence everywhere in Abyssinia. On the other hand, we must make
                    allowance for the fact that in this language the very considerable phonetic
                    modifications often produce a total change of form, so that many words which at
                    first have a thoroughly foreign appearance prove on further examination to be
                    but the regular development of words with which we are already acquainted.<note

                    grammatical phenomena with those that occur in Geez.</p></note> But the most
                    striking deviations occur in the syntax. Things which we are accustomed to
                    regard as usual or even universal in the Semitic languages, such as the placing
                    of the verb before the subject, of the governing noun before the genitive, and
                    of the attributive relative clause after its substantive, are here totally
                    reversed. Words which are marked as genitives by the prefixing of the relative
                    particle, and even whole relative clauses, are treated as one word, and are
                    capable of having the objective suffix added to them. It is scarcely going too

                    less difficulty in mastering the Amharic construction than one to whom the
                    Semitic syntax is familiar. What here appears contrary to Semitic analogy is
                    sometimes the rule in Agaw. Hence it is probable that in this case tribes
                    originally Hamitic retained their former modes of thought and expression after
                    they had adopted a Semitic speech, and that they modified their new language
                    accordingly. And it is not certain that the partial Semitization of the southern
                    districts of Abyssinia (which had scarcely any connexion with the civilization
                    of Aksúm during its best period) was entirely or even principally due to
                    influences from the north.</p>
                <p>In spite of its dominant position, Amharic did not for several centuries show any
                    signs of becoming a literary language. The oldest documents which we possess are
                    a few songs of the 15th and 16th centuries, which were not, however, written
                    down till a later time, and are very difficult to interpret. There are also a
                    few Geez-Amharic glossaries, which may be tolerably old. Since the 17th century
                    various attempts have been made, sometimes by European missionaries, to write in
                    Amharic, and in modern times this language has to a considerable extent been
                    employed for literary purposes; nor is this to be ascribed exclusively to
                    foreign influence. A literary language, fixed in a sufficient measure, has thus
                    been formed. Books belonging to a somewhat earlier period contain tolerably
                    clear proofs of dialectical differences. Scattered notices by travellers seem to
                    indicate that in some districts the language diverges in a very much greater
                    degree from the recognized type.</p>
                <p>The Abyssinian chronicles have for centuries been written in Geez, largely
                    intermingled with Amharic elements. This “language of the chronicles,” in itself
                    a dreary chaos, often enables us to discover what were the older forms of
                    Amharic words. A similar mixture of Geez and Amharic is exemplified in various
                    other books, especially such as refer to the affairs of the Government and of
                    the court.</p>
                <p>The languages spoken still farther to the south, that of Gurágué (south of Shoa)
                    and that of Harar, are perhaps more fitly described as languages akin to Amharic
                    than as Amharic dialects. Until we possess more precise information respecting
                    them, and in general respecting the linguistic and ethnographical condition of
                    these countries, it would not be safe to hazard even a conjecture as to the
                    origin of these languages, which, corrupt as they may be, and surrounded by
                    tongues of a wholly different class, must still be regarded as Semitic. It is
                    enough to repeat that the immigration of the Semites into these parts of Africa
                    was probably no one single act, that it may have taken place at different times,
                    that the immigrants perhaps belonged to different tribes and to different
                    districts of Arabia, and that very heterogeneous peoples and languages appear to
                    have been variously mingled together in these regions.</p>

                    effect at the time, in spite of its one-sided character and the actual mistakes
                    that it contains. Even at the present day a <hi rend="italic">scholar</hi> may
                    read it with great interest and profit; but as a whole it has been superseded by
                    the discoveries of the last twenty or thirty years. The remarks of Ewald, in the
                    introduction to his Hebrew grammar, upon the mutual relationship of the Semitic
                    languages are still worthy of perusal, much as they provoke contradiction. A
                    work upon the subject which realizes for the present state of science what Renan
                    endeavoured to realize for his own time unfortunately does not exist. (TH.
