                    by which she may be actuated and the means at command to assist or counteract
                    them; it is a branch of applied mechanics acquired by experience and study. The
                    former can only be obtained thoroughly in many years spent at sea, in personal
                    connexion with the work of the ship and her boats; that such training should
                    commence at an early age is very desirable, if not even imperative. The
                    practical knowledge so gained should be supplemented and improved by reading,
                    conversation, and discussion, as the casualties which befall ships are so varied
                    that a man may pass forty years in seagoing vessels without experiencing
                    one-half of those which might occur. Many of the old maxims are still applicable
                    to every class of vessel and must always remain so.</p>
                <p>The terms “ship” and “vessel” are here intended to embrace all classes, though
                    “ship” is generally applied to the larger without reference to form or
                    description unless such is specified. Though the use of sails has been greatly
                    superseded by the introduction of steam-power both in the navies of all nations
                    and in the mercantile marine, it is still generally admitted that seamanship is
                    best acquired on board a vessel which is dependent upon her sails. The
                    construction and equipment of sailing ships had reached a high point of
                    perfection at the time steam came into general use. The power derived from the
                    steam-engine does not change any of the former conditions, but simply adds
                    another element, confined to propulsion directly ahead or astern (except with
                    reversible wheels or twin screws), which when combined with sails renders a ship
                    much more manageable and safe,—that is to say, assuming all the forces at
                    command to be properly applied. Hence it is very desirable that all ocean-going
                    steam vessels should have sufficient sail-power to turn them round (wear) or to
                    enable them to sail with the wind abeam without steam, especially when fitted
                    with single screws or with paddle wheels which do not work separately. Twin
                    screws, of course, give a double chance as far as the engine is concerned; but
                    even with that advantage the loss of the rudder would leave the ship in a
                    helpless condition if she had not efficient head and after sails to balance her
                    on the desired course.</p>
                <p>At present the excessive desire to make quick passages has greatly augmented the
                    danger unavoidably attending a sea voyage, the risk as well as the violence of a
                    collision<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n615/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0615-0590"/> at high speed in thick weather being thereby much
                    increased. Through the want of masts and sails there is a probability of total
                    loss by drifting helplessly on a lee shore during a gale, or by foundering “in
                    the trough of the sea.” In spite of her monstrous size (22,000 tons), the “Great
                    Eastern,” in 1863 or 1864, with her six comparatively small masts and weak sails
                    was, after the loss of her rudder, very roughly used by the waves striking her
                    full on the side. She was in the position which is expressed by the common
                    sea-phrase “wallowing in the trough of the sea,” from which her crew had no
                    power to extricate her. A smaller vessel deeply laden in such a position would
                    most probably have foundered, leaving no one to tell the tale. Too much stress
                    is laid upon the retardation caused by masts and rigging when steaming head to
                    wind; it is the pitching and plunging motion of the ship into a succession of
                    waves that principally retards her speed. If the waves are approaching at the
                    rate of 10 miles an hour and the ship is steaming against them at a similar
                    rate, they will strike the bows with a force equal to 20 miles an hour. When a
                    ship is steaming through comparatively smooth water (sheltered by land) against
                    a gale of wind, her speed is but little reduced by the force of the wind alone,
                    when other circumstances admit of her working full power. Storm-sails only
                    require short masts, but these and the canvas they support should be strong,
                    which is not the case in the merchant service generally.</p>
                <p>Every seaman is expected to be thoroughly acquainted with the rigging of the
                    vessel in which he serves, and when in charge he should frequently examine every
                    part, to see that it is efficiently performing the duty assigned to it, being
                    neither too taut nor too slack, nor suffering from chafing, wet, or other
                    injury. He should be capable of repairing or replacing any part with his own
                    hand if necessary and of teaching others how to do so. He need not necessarily
                    be a navigator, though a good navigator must be a seaman; nor is it necessary
                    that a seaman should be a shipbuilder, a mast-maker, a rope-maker, or a
                    sail-maker, but he should possess a general knowledge of each art, especially
                    the last; every able seaman should be able to sew a seam and assist the ship’s
                    sail-maker in repairing sails. It is greatly to be regretted that various
                    circumstances have brought about such a change in the system of rigging ships,
                    in both the British navy and the mercantile marine, that those who sail in them
                    seldom see it done. Young officers were in former times frequently entrusted
                    with the charge of day watches, during which they would give the necessary
                    orders for making, shortening, or trimming sails, perhaps even tacking and
                    wearing. That practice gave confidence and quickened the desire to learn more;
                    it was more frequently done in small than in large ships. The general adoption
                    of the steam-engine in ships has not only diminished the value of sail-power but
                    of seamanship also, and has produced such a change in the rig that instead of
                    masts and yards we find only two or three poles. In the British navy so many new
                    sciences have been introduced that seamanship takes but a low place among them
                    at the examination of a midshipman, who has had but little boat duty and
                    probably found the discussion of seamanship in his mess-place contrary to rule.
                    The rapidity with which all sail and mast drill is executed, combined with the
                    perfection of the “station bill,” renders it worse than useless as a means of
                    teaching, as it gives a false confidence which fails in the hour of necessity,
                    when the accustomed routine is thrown out by a sail actually splitting to pieces
                    or a spar snapping. The fact that the same men perpetually do the same thing
                    must tend greatly to render each evolution quick so long as every one is in his
                    accustomed place, but sickness or the absence of a party from duty will
                    disorganize the ship for some time, as the general usefulness of the men has
                    been cramped. Sail drill in harbour is open to grave objections: unless in a
                    tide-way, the ship must be invariably head to wind; for reefing and furling the
                    yards are laid square, consequently flat aback; both earings are hauled out at
                    once, and as it is only for exercise they are only half secured. Even when
                    reefing top-sails at sea either for exercise or of necessity in company with
                    other ships, the yards are laid square to enable the men to get readily on the
                    weather-side; therefore, if on a wind, the sail must remain aback or the ship
                    must be kept away till the wind is on the beam in order to shake the sail.</p>
                <p>The foundation of all teaching of seamanship must be a knowledge of the knots,
                    bends, and splices, and their use in the various parts of the rigging and
                    equipment of a ship.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A

                    two large hawsers, since they cannot jam. When large hawsers have to work
                    through small pipes, good security may be obtained either by passing ten or
                    twelve taut racking turns with a suitable strand and securing each end to a

                    crossing the ends between the hawsers over the seizing and reef-knotting the
                    ends. This should be repeated in three places and the extreme ends well stopped.
                    Connecting hawsers by bowline knots is very objectionable, as the bend is large

                    marling-spikes are taken; two parts of a seizing are twisted like a cat’s-paw
                    (fig. 7), passed round the bar, and hove round till sufficiently taut. In
                    heaving shrouds together to form an eye two round turns are taken with a strand
                    and the two ends hove upon. When a lever is placed between the parts of a long
                    lashing or trapping and hove round, we have what is also called a Spanish
                    windlass <hi rend="italic">Slings</hi> (fig. 18).—This is simply the bight of a
                    rope turned up over its own part; it is frequently made of chain, when a shackle

                    >y,</hi> connecting the two ends with the part which goes round the mast-head.
                    Used to sling lower yards. For boat’s yards it should be a grummet with a

                    to cant forward with the weight of the sail, the part marked by an arrow should
                    be the fore-side,—easily illustrated by a round ruler and a piece of twine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sprit-Sail Sheet Knot</hi> (flg. 19).—This knot consists of a
                    double wall and double crown made by the two ends, consequently with six
                    strands,—with the ends turned down. Used formerly in the clews of sails, now as
                    an excellent stopper, a lashing or shackle being placed at <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Turning in a Dead-Eye Cutter-Stay fashion</hi> (fig. 20).—A
                    bend is made in the stay or shroud round its own part and hove together with a
                    bar and strand; two or three seizings diminishing in size (one round and one or
                    two either round or flat) are hove on taut and snug, the end being at the side
                    of the fellow part. The dead-eye is put in and the eye driven down with a
                    commander.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Turning in a Dead-Eye end up</hi> (fig. 21).—The shroud is
                    measured round the dead-eye and marked where a throat-seizing is hove on; the
                    dead-eye is then forced into its place, or it may be put in first. The end
                    beyond <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is taken up taut and secured with a round
                    seizing; higher still the end is secured by another seizing. As it is important
                    that the lay should always be kept in the rope as much as possible, these eyes
                    should be formed conformably, either right-handed or left-handed. It is easily
                    seen which way a rope would naturally kink by putting a little extra twist into
                    it. A shroud whose dead-eye is turned in end up will bear a fairer strain, but
                    is more dependent on the seizings; the under turns of the throat are the first
                    to break and the others the first to slip. With the cutter-stay fashion the
                    standing part of the shroud gives way under the nip of the eye. A rope will
                    afford the greatest resistance to strain when secured round large thimbles with
                    a straight end and a sufficient number of flat or racking seizings. To splice
                    shrouds round dead-eyes is objectionable on account of opening the strands and
                    admitting water, thus hastening decay. In small vessels, especially yachts, it
                    is admissible on the score of neatness; in<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n617/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0617-0592"/> that case a round seizing is placed between the
                    dead-eye and the splice. The dead-eyes should be in diameter 1 ½ times the
                    circumference of a hemp shroud and thrice that of wire; the lanyard should be
                    half the nominal size of hemp and the same size as wire: thus, hemp-shroud 12
                    inches, wire 6 inches, dead-eye 18, lanyard 6 inches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Short Splice.—</hi> The most common description of splice is
                    when a rope is lengthened by another of the same size, or nearly so. Fig. 22
                    represents a splice of this kind: the strands have been unlaid, married, and
                    passed through with the assistance of a marling-spike, over one strand and under
                    the next, twice each way. The ends are then cut off close. To render the splice
                    neater the strands should have been halved before turning them in a second time,
                    the upper half of each strand only being turned in; then all are cut off smooth.
                    <hi rend="italic">Eye-Splice.—</hi> Unlay the strands and place them upon the
                    same rope spread at such a distance as to give the size of the eye; enter the
                    centre strand (unlaid) under a strand of the rope (as above) and the other two
                    in a similar manner on their respective sides of the first; taper each end and
                    pass them through again. If neatness is desired, reduce the ends and pass them
                    through once more; cut off smooth and serve the part disturbed tightly with
                    suitable hard line. Uses too numerous to mention. <hi rend="italic">Cut
                    Splice.—Made</hi> in a similar manner to an eye-splice, but of two pieces of
                    rope, therefore with two splices. Used for masthead pendants, jib-guys, breast
                    backstays, and even odd shrouds, to keep the eyes of the rigging lower by one
                    part. It is not so strong as two separate eyes. <hi rend="italic">Horse-Shoe
                    Splice.—</hi> Made similar to the above, but one part much shorter than the
                    other, or another piece of rope is spliced across an eye, forming a horseshoe
                    with two long legs. Used for back-ropes on dolphin striker, backstays (one on
                    each side), and cutter’s runner pendants. <hi rend="italic">Long Splice.—</hi>
                    The strands must be unlaid about three times as much as for a short splice and
                    married,— care being taken to preserve the lay or shape of each. Unlay one of
                    the strands still further and follow up the vacant space with the corresponding
                    strand of the other part, fitting it firmly into the rope till only a few inches
                    remain. Treat the other side in a similar manner. There will then appear two
                    long strands in the centre and a long and a short one on each side. The splice
                    is practically divided into three distinct parts; at each the strands are
                    divided and the corresponding halves knotted (as shown on the top of fig. 24)
                    and turned in twice. The half strand may, if desired, be still further reduced
                    before the halves are turned in for the second time. This and all other splices
                    should be well stretched and hammered into shape before the ends are cut off.
                    The long splice alone is adapted to running ropes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shroud Knot</hi> (fig. 23).—Pass a stop at such distance from
                    each end of the broken shroud as to afford sufficient length of strands, when it
                    is unlaid, to form a single wall knot on each side after the parts have been
                    married; it will then appear as represented in the figure, the strands having
                    been well tarred and hove taut separately. The part <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    provides the knot on the opposite side and the ends <hi rend="italic">b, b;</hi>
                    the part c provides the knot and the ends <hi rend="italic">d, d.</hi> After the
                    knot has been well stretched the ends are tapered, laid smoothly between the
                    strands of the shroud, and firmly served ever. This knot is used when shrouds or
                    stays are broken. <hi rend="italic">French Shroud Knot.—</hi> Marry the parts
                    with a similar amount of end as before; stop one set of strands taut up on the
                    shroud (to keep the parts together); and turn the ends back on their own part,
                    forming bights. Make a single wall knot with the other three strands round the
                    said bights and shroud; haul the knot taut first and stretch the whole; then
                    heave down the bights close: it will look like the ordinary shroud knot. It is
                    very liable to slip. If the ends by which the wall knot are made after being
                    hove were passed through the bights, it would make the knot stronger. The ends
                    would be tapered and served.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flemish Eye</hi> (fig. 24).—Secure a spar or toggle twice the
                    circumference of the rope intended to be rove through the eye; unlay the rope
                    which is to form the eye about three times its circumference, at which part
                    place a strong whipping. Point the rope vertically under the eye, and bind it
                    taut up by the core if it is four-stranded rope, otherwise by a few yarns. While
                    doing so, arrange six or twelve pieces of spun-yarn at equal distances on the
                    wood and exactly halve the number of yarns that have been unlaid. If it is a
                    small rope, select two or three yarns from each side near the centre; cross them
                    over the top at <hi rend="italic">a</hi>; and half knot them tightly. So
                    continue till all are expended and drawn down tightly on the opposite side to
                    that from which they came, being thoroughly intermixed. Tie the pieces of
                    spun-yarn which were placed under the eye tightly round various parts to keep
                    the eye in shape when taken off the spar, till they are replaced by turns of
                    marline hove on as taut as possible, the hitches forming a central line outside
                    the eye. Heave on a good seizing of spun-yarn close below the spar and another
                    between six and twelve inches below the first; it may then be parcelled and
                    served; the eye is served over twice, and well tarred each time. As large ropes
                    are composed of so many yarns, a greater number must be knotted over the toggle
                    each time; a 4-inch rope has 132 yarns, which would require 22 knottings of six
                    each time; a 10-inch rope has 834 yarns, therefore, if ten are taken from each
                    side every time, about twice that number of hitches will be required; sometimes
                    only half the yarns are hitched, the others being merely passed over. The chief
                    use of these eyes has been to form the collars of stays, the whole stay in each
                    case having to be rove through it,—a very inconvenient device. It is almost
                    superseded for that purpose by a leg spliced in the stay and lashing eyes abaft
                    the mast, for which it is commonly used at present. This eye is not always
                    called by the same name, but the weight of evidence is in favour of calling it a
                    Flemish eye. <hi rend="italic">Ropemaker's Eye,</hi> which also has alternative
                    names, is formed by taking out of a rope one strand longer by 6 inches or a foot
                    than the required eye, then placing the ends of the two strands a similar
                    distance below the disturbance of the one strand, that is, at the size of the
                    eye; the single strand is led back through the vacant space it left till it
                    arrives at the neck of the eye, with a similar length of spare end to the other
                    two strands. They are all seized together, scraped, tapered, marled, and served.
                    The principal merit is neatness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mouse on a Stay.—</hi> Formed by turns of coarse spun-yarn hove
                    taut round the stay, over parcelling at the requisite distance from the eye to
                    form the collar; assistance is given by a padding of short yarns distributed
                    equally round the rope, which, after being firmly secured, especially at what is
                    to be the under part, are turned back over the first layer and seized down
                    again, thus making a shoulder; sometimes it is formed with parcelling only. In
                    either case it is finished by marling, followed by serving or grafting.</p>
                <p>The use is to prevent the Flemish eye in the end of the stay from slipping up any
                    farther.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rolling Hitch</hi> (fig. 25).—Two round turns are taken round a
                    spar or large rope in the direction in which it is to be hauled and one
                    half-hitch on the other side of the hauling part. This is very useful, as it can
                    be put on and off quickly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Round Seizing</hi> (fig. 26).—So named when the rope it secures
                    does not cross another and there are three sets of turns. The size of the
                    seizing line is about one-sixth (nominal) that of the ropes to be secured, but
                    varies according to the number of turns to be taken. An eye is spliced in the
                    line and the end rove through it, embracing both parts. If either part is to be
                    spread open, commence farthest from that part; place tarred canvas under the
                    seizing; pass the line round as many times (with much slack) as it is intended
                    to have under-turns; and pass the end back through them all and through the eye.
                    Secure the eye from rendering round by the ends of its splice; heave the turns
                    on with a marling-spike (see fig. 8), perhaps seven or nine; haul the end
                    through taut; and commence again the riding turns in the hollows of the first.
                    If the end is not taken back through the eye but pushed up between the last two
                    turns (as is sometimes recommended), the riders must be passed the opposite way
                    in order to follow the direction of the under-turns, which are always one more
                    in number than the riders. When the riders are complete, the end is forced
                    between the last lower turns and two cross turns are taken, the end coming up
                    where it went down, when a wall knot is made with the strands and the ends cut
                    close; or the end may be taken once round the shroud. <hi rend="italic">Throat
                    Seising.—</hi> Two ropes or parts ot ropes are laid on each other parallel and
                    receive a seizing similar to that shown in fig. 21,—that is, with upper and
                    riding, but no cross turns. As the two parts of rope are intended to turn up at
                    right angles to the direction in which they were secured, the seizing should be
                    of stouter line and short, not exceeding seven lower and six riding turns. The
                    end is better secured with a turn round the standing part. Used for turning in
                    dead-eyes and variously. <hi rend="italic">Hat Seizing.—</hi> Commenced

                    crossed back round the first part, and so on for ten to twenty turns according
                    to the expected strain,· every turn being hove as tight as possible, after which
                    round turns are passed to fill the spaces at the back of each rope, by taking
                    the end <hi rend="italic">a</hi> over both parts into the hollow at <hi

                    clove hitch; knot the end and cut it close. When the shrouds ate wire (which is
                    half the size of hemp) and the end turned up round a dead-eye of any kind,
                    wire-seizings are preferable. It appears very undesirable to have wire rigging
                    combined with plates or screws for setting it up, as in case of accident —such
                    as that of the mast going over the side, a shot or collision breaking the
                    ironwork—the seamen are powerless.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diamond Knot</hi> (figs. 28, 29).—The rope must be unlaid as
                    fares the centre if the knot is required there, and the strands handled with
                    great care to keep the lay in them. Three bights are turned up as in fig. 28,
                    and the end of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is taken over 6 and up the bight <hi
                    rend="italic">c.</hi> The end of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is taken over <hi

                    are laid up again it will appear as in fig. 29. Any number of knots may be made
                    on the same rope. They were used on man-ropes, the foot-ropes on the jibboom,
                    and similar places, where it was necessary to give a good hold for the hands or
                    feet. Turk's heads are now generally used. <hi rend="italic">Double
                    Diamond.—Made</hi> by the ends of a single diamond following their own part till
                    the knot is repeated. Used at the upper end of a side rope as an ornamental
                    stopper-knot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stropping-Blocks.—</hi> There are various modes of securing
                    blocks to ropes; the most simple is to splice an eye at the end of the rope a
                    little longer than the block and pass a round seizing to keep it in place; such
                    is the case with jib-pendants. As a general rule, the parts of a strop combined
                    should possess greater strength than the parts of the fall which act against it.
                    The shell of an ordinary block should be about three times the circumference of
                    the rope which is to reeve through it, as a 9-inch block for a 3-inch rope; but
                    small ropes require larger blocks in proportion, as a 4-inch block for a 1-inch
                    rope.</p>
                <p>When the work to be done is very important the blocks are much larger; brace -
                    blocks are more than five times the nominal size of the brace. Leading-blocks
                    and sheaves in racks are generally smaller than the blocks through which the
                    ropes pass farther<pb break="no"

                    power is lost by friction. A clump-block should be double the nominal size of
                    the rope. A single strop may be made by joining the ends of a rope of sufficient
                    length to go round the block and thimble by a common short splice, which rests
                    on the crown of the block (the opposite end to the thimble) and is stretched
                    into place by a jigger; a strand is then passed twice round the space between
                    the block and the thimble and hove taut by a Spanish windlass to cramp the parts
                    together ready for the reception of a small round seizing. The cramping or
                    pinching into shape is sometimes done by machinery invented by a rigger in
                    Portsmouth dockyard. The strop may be made the required length by a long splice,
                    but it would not possess any advantage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Grummet-Strop</hi> (fig. 30).—Made by unlaying a piece of rope
                    of the desired size about a foot more than three times the length required for
                    the strop. Place tlιe centre of the rope round the block and thimble; mark with
                    chalk where the parts cross; take one strand out of the rope; bring the two
                    chalk marks together; and cross the strand in the lay on both sides, continuing
                    round and round till the two ends meet the third time; they are then halved, and
                    the upper halves half-knotted and passed over and under the next strands,
                    exactly as one part of a long splice. A piece of worn or well-stretched rope
                    will better retain its shape, upon which success entirely depends. The object is
                    neatness, and if three or multiples of three strops are to be made it is
                    economical.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Double Strop</hi> (fig. 31).—Made with one piece of rope, the
                    splice being brought as usual to the crown of the block, <hi rend="italic"
                    >t,</hi> the bights fitting into scores some inches apart, converging to the
                    upper part, above which the thimble receives the bights <hi rend="italic">a,

                    s</hi> by a round seizing doubly crossed. If the block be not then on the right
                    slew (the shell horizontal or vertical) a union thimble is used with another
                    strop, which produces the desired effect; thus the fore and main brace-blocks,
                    being very large and thin, are required (for appearance) to lie horizontally; a
                    single strop round the yard vertically has a union thimble between it and the
                    double strop round the block. The double strop is used for large blocks; it
                    gives more support to the shell than the single strop and admits of smaller rope
                    being used. Wire rope is much used for block-strops; the fitting is similar.
                    Metal blocks are also used in fixed positions; durability is their chief
                    recommendation. Great care should be taken that they do not chafe the ropes
                    which pass by them as well as those which reeve through.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Selvagee Strop.—</hi> Twine, rope-yarn, or rope is warped round
                    two or more pegs placed at the desired distance apart, till it assumes the
                    requisite size and strength; the two ends are then knotted or spliced. Temporary
                    firm seizings are applied in several places to bind the parts together before
                    the rope or twine is removed from the pegs, after which it is marled with
                    suitable material. A large strop should be warped round four or six pegs in
                    order to give it the shape in which it is to be used. This description of strop
                    is much stronger and more supple than rope of similar size. Twine strops
                    (covered with duck) are used for boats’ blocks and in similar places requiring
                    neatness. Rope-yam and spun-yarn strops are used for attaching luff-tackles to
                    shrouds and for many similar purposes. To bring to a shroud or hawser the centre
                    of the strop is passed round the rope and each part crossed three or four times
                    before hooking the “luff"; a spun-yarn stop above the centre will prevent
                    slipping and is very necessary with wire rope. As an instance of a large
                    selvagee block-strop being used,—when the “Melville” was hove down at Chusan
                    (China), the main-purchase-block was dpuble stropped with a selvagee containing
                    28 parts of 3-inch rope; that would produce 112 parts in the neck, equal to a
                    breaking strain of 280 tons, which is more than four parts of a 19-inch cable.
                    The estimated strain it bore was 80 tons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stoppers</hi> for ordinary running ropes are made by splicing a
                    piece of rope to a bolt or to a hook and thimble, unlaying 3 or 4 feet, tapering
                    it by cutting away some of the yarns, and marling it down securely, with a good
                    whipping also on the end. It is used by taking a half-hitch round the rope which
                    is to be hauled upon, dogging the end up in the lay, and holding it by hand. The
                    rope can come through it when hauled, but cannot go back.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Whipping and Pointing.—</hi> The end of every working rope
                    should at least be whipped to prevent it fagging out; in ships of war and yachts
                    they are invariably pointed. Whipping is done by placing the end of a piece of
                    twine or knittle-stuff on a rope about an inch from the end, taking three or
                    four turns taut over it (working towards the end); the twine is then laid on the
                    rope again lengthways contrary to the first, leaving a slack bight of twine; and
                    taut turns are repeatedly passed round the rope over the first end and over the
                    bight, till there are in all six to ten turns; then haul the bight taut through
                    between the turns and cut it close. To point a rope, place a good whipping a few
                    inches from the end according to size; open out the end entirely; select all the
                    outer yams and twist them into knittles either singly or two or three together;
                    scrape down; and taper the central part, marling it firmly. Turn every alternate
                    knittle and secure the remainder down by a turn of twine or a smooth yarn
                    hitched close up, which acts as the weft in weaving. The knittles are then
                    reversed and another turn of the weft taken, and this is continued till far
                    enough to look well. At the last turn the ends of the knittles which are laid
                    back are led forward over and under the weft and hauled through tightly, making
                    it present a circle of small bights, level with which the core is cut off
                    smoothly. Hawsers and large ropes have a becket formed in their ends during the
                    process of pointing. A piece of 1 to l ½-inch rope about 1 ½ to 2 feet long is
                    spliced into the core by each end while it is open: from four to seven yarns
                    (equal to a strand) are taken at a time and twisted up; open the ends of the
                    becket only sufficient to marry them close in; turn in the twisted yams between
                    the strands (as splicing) three times; and stop it above and below. Both ends
                    are treated alike; when the pointing is completed a loop a few inches in length
                    will protrude from the end of the rope, which is very useful for reeving it. A
                    hauling line or reeving line should only be rove through the becket as a fair
                    lead. <hi rend="italic">Grafting</hi> is very similar to pointing and frequently
                    done the whole length of a rope, as a side-rope. Pieces of white line more than
                    double the length of the rope, sufficient in number to encircle it, are made up
                    in hanks called foxes; the centre of each is made fast by twine and the weaving
                    process continued as in pointing. Block-strops are sometimes so covered; but, as
                    it causes decay, a small wove mat which can be taken off occasionally is
                    preferable.</p>

                    desirable to keep it in place till the strain is brought on it. Wire rope cannot

                    when a comparatively short piece of junk is to be made into spun-yarn, or large
                    rope into small, which is called twice laid. The end of each yarn is divided,
                    rubbed smooth, and married (as for splicing).</p>
                <p>Two of the divided parts, as c, c and <hi rend="italic">d, d,</hi> are passed in

                    round the opposite side of the cask and two half-hitches made with the end,
                    forming another run ning eye, both of which are beaten down taut as the tackle
                    receives the weight. Slings for smaller casks requiring care should be of this

                    15, red at 7 and 17, and blue at 13. The length of the lead is not usually
                    included. The deep-sea line commences with 2 knots at 20, another knot being
                    added for every 10 fathoms, and a single knot at each intermediate 5. Loglines
                    should have ample stray line (distance between the log-ship and the first mark).
                    The distance of 47 feet and a 28-second-glass were adopted to assimilate the sea
                    furlong to the shore furlong, which was absurd. Fifty feet to half a minute
                    would be more correct and more convenient.</p>
                <p>Since space will not allow of a full description of masting and rigging, only a
                    few of the more important points will be noticed. The masts must be stepped
                    before they are rigged; accordingly we will first describe the manner in which
                    they are put on board in cases where the assistance of shears on hulk or jetty
                    is not available; at an out-port a seaman is still left to his own resources,
                    just as he was in former times. Fixing the masts in a large frigate, such as
                    that shown in fig. 35 below, is a serious consideration, as the mainmast weighs
                    about twenty tons.</p>
                <p>Two suitable spars must be procured about three-fourths the length of the
                    main-mast and about two-thirds its diameter,—the greater the housing the higher
                    the shears. They are towed alongside or under the stern with the thicker ends
                    forward, and parbuckled over the side or hoisted in through the stern-ports by
                    means of a derrick, whichever is most convenient. The smaller ends are rested
                    upon a spar across the gunnel or the break of the poop, crossed, and lashed with
                    strong well-stretched rope (about 4 ½ or 5 inches) passed figure-of-eight
                    fashion, commencing at the centre, returning with riding turns as a racking
                    seizing, and crossed again; the turns at the extreme ends should not be so taut
                    as the others. Care must be taken to place the seizing equidistant from each
                    heel after they have been trimmed to fit flat upon shoes of strong oak planking;
                    they will remain within their full spread by about 2 feet each side till after
                    the head seizing has been secured. Lash a threefold purchase-block to the horns
                    above the lashings, to hang down clear under the cross, so as to correspond with
                    a twofold block to be lashed to the mast. If such blocks cannot be procured two
                    top-blocks may be substituted for the upper block and one on the mast, reserving
                    the fourth top-block as a lead secured to one of the shear legs or near it.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Top-blocks in large ships are
                    26 inches, carrying 9/-inch rope, the breaking strain of which is 25 tons; by
                    taking the standing part down to the mast there are three parts lifting, equal
                    to 75 tons,—a sufficient margin over 20 tons. Twenty-two-inch blocks and an
                    8-inch rope would break at 54 tons. Large ships have one 26-inch and one 24-inch
                    double block for jeers, which would reeve an 8-inch rope. The size of a block
                    implies the length of the shell, of a rope its circumference, and of a chain
                    cable the diameter of the iron.</p></note> Two purchases may be used at the same
                    time with advantage, one block hanging on the fore, the other on the after side.
                    A gird-line is also placed on the highest part of the horns to assist in canting
                    the mast, and another for the purpose of hoisting up a man should anything
                    require alteration. The lashing at the shear-head must be well protected with
                    old canvas and all the decks must be shored up in the vicinity of the places
                    where the shear-legs stand for each mast. The legs must be lashed together at
                    the desired spread and heel tackles led forward and aft from each. To form the
                    four head-guys the central parts of two hawsers are clove-hitched above the
                    lashing and spread as far as is convenient in four directions and set up by
                    tackles. When all is ready and the purchase rove, the lower block should be
                    secured forward as high as can be; and, while the purchase is being hove upon, a
                    light derrick or small shears lifting the shear-head will greatly assist; of
                    course the after heel tackles must be well secured. After the shears are erect
                    and the heels cleated and lashed to the shoes they can be scuffed about by the
                    heel tackles and guys to any desired position,— the hole for the mizzen-mast is
                    first plumbed.</p>
                <p>The mizzen-mast should be brought alongside with its head aft, and a sufficiently
                    strong selvagee strop lashed on the fore side if it<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0619-0594"/> is to be lifted by one purchase, and one on each
                    side if two are used, and as high up as the shears will allow, the limit being
                    from heel to lashing 6 or 8 feet less than from the lower side of the
                    purchase-block to the deck. Old spars having been hung over the side for the
                    mast to rub against and the purchase fall taken round the capstan, the mast is
                    hove up till the head comes above the gunnel; then two single blocks with
                    long-tailed strops are secured round it with the gird-lines of about</p>
                <p>4 inches and twice the length of the mast ready rove.</p>
                <p>The trestle-trees are now usually bolted on in the mast-house. The gird-line from
                    the shear-head must be bent to the head of the mast at a suitable height to act
                    as a topping-lift. As the mast is hove up by the capstan a stout rope from
                    outboard must be timber-hitched round the heel so as to ease it in as it clears
                    the gunnel, and to haul it towards the partners (mast-hole); when it has been
                    lowered to within 2 feet of the step, a slew rope is passed three times round
                    the mast and a “cat’s-paw” formed on each side, through the eyes of which a
                    capstan bar is passed ready to heave either way as required; in the meantime
                    both the heel of the mast and the step should be well coated with white lead or
                    coal-tar. Lower and slew according to directions from below; when the mast is
                    stepped and brought to the desired position, place four temporary wedges, rig a
                    triangle, trice it up by the gird-lines, unlash the purchase or strops, overhaul
                    down, unrig the triangle, and haul the gird-lines taut on each side.</p>
                <p>The shears can be transported forward in nearly an upright position by first
                    pulling the heel-tackles and then the guys, shifting the guys forward one at a
                    time as necessary. The main - mast and the fore-mast are taken in in the same
                    way as the mizzen-mast, described above,—all three abaft the shears; but, being
                    much longer, they require greater hoist and greater care generally.</p>
                <p>To take in the bowsprit the shears are again moved forward, all the heel-tackles
                    being led forward and extra lashings placed on the heels. A purchase nearly as
                    strong as that to be used in lifting the bowsprit should be secured between the
                    fore-mast-head and the shear-head, or two parts of a stout hawser may be used,
                    the middle being clove-hitched over the horns and the ends taken round beams
                    well aft on either side, ready for veering as the shears are drooped (to an
                    angle of about 45°), then to act as the principal support; the fore-guys are
                    also taken aft to assist. The fore-mast must be wedged on both decks and one or
                    more tackles used to keep the head aft. The bowsprit cap is invariably bolted on
                    in the mast-house; the bowsprit is then brought under the bows with the cap end
                    forward and slung for the main purchase a little outside the housing, which is
                    generally about two-fifths of the whole length. The main purchase should plumb
                    nearly the length of the housing outside the bows, and the higher the shear-head
                    the greater the freedom of motion. The outer purchase attached to a strop
                    through the hole in the cap and the guys from the cap to each cat-head alike
                    tend to force in the bowsprit when it is high enough; besides this, a heel rope
                    is put round it before it leaves the water, and a strop with a tackle to the
                    bitts is used to bowse it into the hole and mortise. It is hoisted to about an
                    angle of 45° before the heel is entered.</p>
                <p>A rough sketch made to scale will greatly facilitate such operations and ensure
                    success. When a bowsprit is put in by shears on a hulk or jetty, it is hoisted
                    up ahead of the ship nearly horizontal, or at the angle (steeve) which it is
                    intended to assume, and the ship is moved ahead towards it, till the bowsprit
                    enters in the desired position.</p>
                <p>The directions for masting a large ship are more than sufficient for masting a
                    small one, which is so much easier.</p>
                <p>Gammoning the bowsprit is the most important point in rigging a ship, as the
                    stays of the fore-mast and main-top-mast depend for security on the bowsprit. In
                    large ships there are two distinct lashings (of either new stretched rope or
                    chain) to keep the bowsprit down; they are passed in a similar manner over a
                    long saddle-shaped piece of wood called a gammoning fish and through the holes
                    in the head knees, the outer one first. One end is clinched or shackled round
                    the bowsprit over the fore-part of the hole; the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n620/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0620-0595"/> other, being rove through the after-part of the
                    hole, comes up on the aft side of the first turn on the bowsprit and down inside
                    that part and before the turns in the hole, thus forming a double cross with the
                    first turns outside. Every turn is set up as passed by means of a pendant
                    through the hawse-pipe or bow-port, and a block is secured to the hole for the
                    bobstays, which are attached to the gammoning by a selvagee or toggle, and held
                    while the next turn is being passed by a racking seizing if rope and by nails
                    driven through the links into the fish if chain. When the hole is full of
                    turns—eight or ten—the whole is trapped together as tightly as possible,
                    commencing at the lower part.</p>
                <p>The clothing of a bowsprit of a large ship consists of nine strops for its own
                    security and the fore-stays. A bobstay collar is hove on at one-third the
                    distance between the night-heads and the outer extremity, and close outside it
                    two bowsprit shroud collars and a fore-stay collar, then the second bobstay
                    collar, two bowsprit shroud collars, another fore-stay collar, and the third
                    bobstay collar; in addition to these there is a cap bobstay, which sets up to a
                    bolt close inside the bowsprit cap. The bobstay and bowsprit shroud collars are
                    hove on at right angles to the spar and usually cleated in that position. But
                    this cleating is a mistake; as the strain comes upon each of them very
                    obliquely, it is necessary that they should yield in that direction before the
                    cleats are nailed, or they will give way and slacken the rope when it is most
                    required to be taut. Bobstays are cut to the required length, wormed and
                    parcelled from the centre towards the ends, and served; they are rove through
                    their respective holes in the cutwater before being spliced, which splice is
                    tapered, parcelled, and served over, and rests on the head of the heart when it
                    is seized in. The bobstays and bowsprit shrouds are set up by lanyards half the
                    nominal size if rope and the same size if wire; the standing parts are secured
                    by running eyes round the necks of the collars confining the hearts, and are set
                    up by two luffs, one acting upon the other.</p>
                <p>The cross-trees are swayed up one at a time by the two gird-lines, whose united
                    action and a guy on deck conduct them to their places, where they drop into
                    recesses and are bolted to the trestle-trees. When a whole top is to be got up
                    it is placed abaft the mast (except the mizzen) with the lower side forward and
                    the fore part uppermost; the gird-lines are passed under it, that is, before it,
                    each being rove up through the second hole from aft for the futtock-plates and
                    hitched tightly to its own part as it passes the lubber’s hole, which part is
                    also stopped to the hole at the fore part of the top. If it be a large top each
                    gird-line may be taken down the fore (under) side (as before), rove up through
                    the after-hole for the futtock-plate, down through the lubber’s hole, taut up
                    through the foremost hole, and hitched to the hoisting part, which is stopped
                    firmly to the fore part, where a gird-line leading from the mast abaft is also
                    stopped after the end has been made fast to the centre hole for the top-rail;
                    that gird-line is to keep the top clear of the trestle-trees as it goes up and
                    to assist in placing it. There are several slightly different ways of slinging a
                    whole top; but in all cases the gird-line blocks (after the stop is cut) hoist
                    the fore part higher than themselves, till.it falls over them and hangs as
                    nearly horizontal as could be judged in slinging it. The final adjustment of it
                    in its place is done by hand, and then it is bolted to the cross-trees. The
                    mizzen-top is put over either in a similar manner' with a guy to the taffrail or
                    sent up before the mast with the after part uppermost, a gird-line from the
                    main-mast-head keeping it clear of the trestle-trees, which project much farther
                    on the fore side. Tops are taken off by the reverse process; but it is more
                    difficult to get the hole back over the mast-head.</p>
                <p>Tops are now very seldom made in one part, but in two halves, which is more
                    convenient and equally serviceable. Each half is sent up in a similar manner to
                    the whole top; the gird-lines are bent on precisely the same way, but one half
                    at a time, which falls square at the side of the mast when the stop is cut
                    instead of going over the top of the mast. After the top is bolted, it is
                    advisable to hoist up the lower cap into the top while the whole space of the
                    lubber’s hole is still free, but not to put it on till after the lower rigging
                    is fixed. The cap being placed near the mast with the bolts downwards and the
                    hole for the top-mast forward, both girdlines are brought down through the
                    lubber’s hole on the same side; that which crossed before the mast is bent on to
                    the fore part of the cap, and that which belongs to the side on which the cap is
                    lying is made to sling the after part fairly and is then stopped to the fore
                    part, so that this last is hoisted up by both gird-lines end on till in the top,
                    when, the stop at the fore end being cut, the cap hangs in front of the mast and
                    the round hole can be placed exactly over the space between the trestle-trees
                    where the top-mast will come up. A soft piece of wood called a “bolster” is made
                    to fit into the angle formed by the trestle-tree and the mast on each side, and
                    is bolted in place so as to present a smooth rounded surface along the whole
                    distance required for the rigging to rest upon, and is covered by a padding of
                    tarred canvas five or six parts thick, secured by a row of flat-headed nails
                    along the upper side. Each mast is similarly provided.</p>
                <p>Preparatory to sending up the lower rigging on the masts it is necessary to
                    rearrange the gird-lines, as it is obviously inconvenient to hoist the eye of a
                    shroud over the mast and allow it to fall down over both parts of a heavy rope
                    which would require to be hauled up from the deck or rerove every time;
                    therefore they are lashed to the leads in the trestle-trees for the truss falls,
                    and a small girdline is lashed high up abaft the mast to be worked in the top
                    for both sets of rigging. The starboard tackle-pend ant is put over first, then
                    the port pair, next the starboard foremost pair of shrouds followed by the port
                    pair, and so on alternately till all the shrouds are in place, ending with an
                    odd one called a swifter on each side. Large ships have four pairs of shrouds
                    and a swifter on each side. They are all sent up in a similar manner: the large
                    gird-line from the trestle-tree is secured to the pendant at the extremity and
                    to the shrouds more than the length of the mast-head below the seizing by means
                    of a strop with a slip-rope, toggle, and down-haul; the eye is opened to the
                    shape of the mast-head and the after-port is stopped to the gird-line, which
                    sways it up to the lubber’s hole, when the men in the top bend the eye in the
                    direction it is to go over the mast and make fast their small gird-line a fathom
                    or two below the seizing, with a stop on the after part of the eye, which is cut
                    when the pendant or shroud is fair for going over the masthead. When the shroud
                    is over, each eye is hardened down by a large mallet called a “commander.” Ropes
                    should be rove through the thimbles of the pendants and hauled taut when they
                    are being driven down; then the “up-and-down” tackles should be hooked to the
                    short legs (which are forward), while the long legs are being lashed abaft the
                    mast and the runner-blocks lashed to them for staying the mast by the runners.
                    As each pair of shrouds are put over, they should be temporarily set up by the
                    dead-eyes and lanyards, or by a luff-tackle on each, to prevent their springing
                    up before another pair presses upon them. It is of very great importance to keep
                    each eye taut before others press on it both for preservation and appearance;
                    many an eye has been stripped of its service and parcelling through slipping out
                    from under the weight. A piece of rounding made fast to a bolt in the hounds of
                    the mast with an eye in the other end is very useful for keeping the back of the
                    eye down while it is being made taut, by reeving the short eye end up through
                    the eye of the shroud and hooking a burton from the deck to it, which is pulled
                    upon at the same time that the shroud is set up on the other side of the ship;
                    when finished, that piece of rope will be jammed. The lower stays, after they
                    have been completely fitted and the hearts have been turned in, are stopped
                    together one over the other at the fork of the collar, at the sides, and at the
                    eyes. The gird-lines, having been put back to the mast-head, are sent down
                    through the lubber’s hole, one crossing the fore side of the mast, and are bent
                    to both stays below the fork of collars and stopped to the eyes; they are thus
                    swayed up near their places, the respective eyes being lashed together by rose -
                    lashings low down over the eyes of all the shrouds. The hearts are then carried
                    forward, the fore to the hearts in collars round the bowsprit and the main to
                    hearts provided for the purpose near the fore-partners, while the collars of the
                    stays are suspended from the fore-part of the top, the collars being eased down
                    as required to preserve a straight line between the lashing-eyes and the point
                    where the stay is set up.</p>
                <p>The following is the method employed to set up the rigging on the masts. It is
                    first drawn forward by the runners and tackles (lashed to the long legs of
                    mast-head pendants, which are lashed together abaft the mast) till brought
                    before the position it is intended to stand in, as the strain of the shrouds
                    will draw it aft. Many seamen recommend, with reason, that a strain should be
                    brought on the after-swifters while it is being stayed, to keep it more firm.
                    The propriety of wedging the mast before the rigging is set up may be considered
                    an open question; it was considered lubberly forty years ago, but is now the
                    common practice. The lanyards of the stays are in proportion smaller than those
                    of the shrouds, since many more turns can be passed through hearts than through
                    dead-eyes. The standing parts are made fast round the collar or strop of the
                    lower heart by a running eye; the end is rove up through the heart in the stay
                    and down through the lower one twice and the slack hauled through by the
                    sail-tackle, which must be previously secured for that purpose round the lower
                    mast-head and hung over the fore-part of the top; or the two top-burtons may be
                    used, one for each stay. When the slack of the lanyard is through and racked,
                    the double block of a luff-tackle is attached by turning the bight back over a
                    toggle or glut, as slings are represented in fig. 18. Then a selvagee strop is
                    passed twice round both parts below the bight <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (when the
                    figure is turned up), brought up on the side of the arrow, and hooked to the
                    luff. A cat’s-paw, as shown in fig. 7, may be used with a glut placed at <hi
                    rend="italic">g to</hi> keep the parts open, otherwise a large rope would be
                    injured. The single block of the luff is secured to the stay as high up as it
                    will reach by a long double - tailed selvagee, which is dogged softly at first,
                    but terminates with close-taut turns and a spun-yarn seizing. Care must be taken
                    to prevent kinking the rope, especially if it is wire; if hemp, it should be
                    parcelled to protect the outer yarns. The fall of the luff is connected with
                    the<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n621/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0621-0596"/> sail-tackle (by one of the means described) and
                    the sail-tackle fall led in the direction of the stay; it is pulled up steadily,
                    the nips of the lanyards having been well tarred to make them slip through the
                    hearts, while they are also shaken up by levers. When taut enough the lanyard is
                    securely seized to the next part, another turn rove, set up, and seized, till
                    the scores in the hearts are full; then riding turns are taken. Whilst the first
                    riding turn still bears the strain, all the seizings on the lanyards should be
                    cut off, and others put on when each part has taken over an equal strain. After
                    the riding turns are completed, the end of the lanyard is secured by a
                    clove-hitch and a seizing. Where there is not a sail-tackle a long luff may be
                    used in a similar manner, the double block being secured above the single block
                    of the other luff. It is desirable that both stays on the masts should be set up
                    at the same time, but it is not imperative; care should be taken that they are
                    equally taut.</p>
                <p>A lanyard for rigging with dead-eyes is half the nominal size of rope shrouds and
                    the same size as wire rigging. The knot is inside under the end of the shroud,
                    or is first spliced to a bolt in the chains and then rove through that hole; it
                    is rove full before commencing to set up. The mast having been stayed, luffs are
                    placed on the shrouds with the double block down and brought to the lanyard as
                    above described; the up-and-down tackle from the mast-head pendant is secured to
                    the fall of the luff by a cat’s-paw and strop and pulled up till taut enough,
                    the foremost shroud on the starboard side first, then that on the port side, and
                    so on alternately till they are all nearly taut alike (the after-swifters not
                    quite so taut as the others), which is best ascertained by an experienced man
                    shaking them; if the dead-eyes are not square (even) when finished, it is far
                    better to turn them in afresh than to have an unequal strain on the shrouds. If
                    a pair of shrouds were set up at the same time it would be better for the eye
                    and the seizing. Tar should be used freely on the lanyards as they enter the
                    dead-eyes, whether they are of iron or wood; it causes them to slip quite as
                    well as grease and preserves the rope, while grease causes it to decay. The
                    lanyards are seized to the next part till a clove hitch is taken above the
                    dead-eye and the end seized down; the parts of the lanyard should then be made
                    to bear an equal strain, and afterwards seized together lest any part should be
                    injured. The runners should be kept taut till everything is secured, then eased
                    up gently, to avoid straining the mast. Lower masts generally have an
                    inclination to belly,— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> bend aft. Space will not
                    admit of details being given as to the various parts of the rigging; the main
                    principles follow the lines of that which has been already rather fully
                    described above. The top mast stays and rigging are set up by means of
                    top-burtons and jiggers, the top-gallant-rigging and that of all small vessels
                    by jiggers and light appliances.</p>
                <p>The lower caps were supposed to have been swayed up by the gird-lines and placed
                    in position to receive the top-masts before the lower rigging was put over. To
                    fix one of them in its place, let a top-block be hoisted up lashed to the
                    mast-head close below the square on which the cap is to rest, on the side
                    suitable to the sheave in the top-mast; through the block reeve a suitable
                    hawser (9 inches for a large ship); send the fore end down through the square
                    hole between the trestle-trees; lay it along the top-mast (the spare one if
                    allowed two); reeve it through the live sheave in the heel; and hitch it round
                    the head of the top-mast and hawser, leaving considerable end; also place a good
                    lashing round the mast-head and the hoisting-part of the hawser and seize the
                    two parts of the hawser together about half-way up, strong enough to bear the
                    weight of the mast. If the top-mast be much longer than the space between the
                    deck and the trestle-tree, the lashing must be placed low enough from the head
                    of the mast to allow it, while suspended, to project above the top outside,
                    while the heel is guided down the main hatchway or fore-scuttle. The capstan is
                    used to heave the mast up; when it is pointed between the trestle-trees, remove
                    the lashing round the head, and if landed—i.e., resting its weight on the deck—
                    make the end of the hawser fast round the mast-head, the hitch being on the side
                    opposite to the block, and cast off the racking lashing, leaving the mast ready
                    to be hove up by the two parts of the hawser. If not landed, heave up 3 or 4
                    feet before securing the end of the hawser, so that, when that has been done and
                    well seized, the capstan may be moved back till both parts bear an equal strain;
                    the racking can then be taken off without fear of a jerk. After the head of the
                    top-mast has been hove 3 or 4 feet through the hole in the cap, it is securely
                    lashed, commencing with a clove-hitch round the mast, the ends being passed
                    through the bolts under the cap on one side and repeated on the other, so that
                    it will be sure to hang horizontally. Heave round the capstan till the cap is
                    above the lower mast-head; then steer it by means of a handspike or capstan bar
                    in the fid-hole, while men in the top direct the head of the top-mast by
                    handspikes, till the hole in the cap is exactly over the square of the mast,
                    when by moving back the capstan and beating the cap down with a commander it
                    will fit firmly in its place.</p>
                <p>If the heel of the top-mast rests on the deck before the head is free from the
                    trestle-trees, it is as well to lower it down to that position; but, if it is
                    too short to rest there, the up-and-down tackles must be used to suspend it by
                    strops through the fid-hole, while the top-block is being unlashed and hooked to
                    the afterbolt fixed for that purpose in the cap and the end of the hawser
                    secured to the foremost bolt on the opposite side. In large ships a shore is
                    placed under the fore-part of the cap to support the weight and resist a
                    possible blow from the top-sail-yard. The topmast may now (unless it is blowing
                    hard) be swayed right up and fidded to prove that it will fit when required (an
                    allowance being made for the wood swelling with wet), and sent on deck in
                    exchange for the other mast, which when swayed above the lower cap will have a
                    gird-line lashed round the head and then be raised 15 or 20 feet more. One part
                    of the gird-line should be sent down abaft all and bent on to the fore-part of
                    the top-mast cross-trees; by this, assisted by a guy, they can be swayed up till
                    above the lower cap, upon which the after-part will rest, securely lashed to the
                    bolts to prevent it slipping, while the fore-part will lean against the top-mast
                    at such a distance as to ensure it falling in the right position when the
                    top-mast is lowered and to receive the head of the mast between the
                    trestle-trees as it is swayed up again to a convenient position for receiving
                    the rigging. The rigging is swayed up by gird-lines on the cross-trees, and put
                    over in a similar manner to the lower rigging, the top-burton pendants first,
                    then the shrouds and backstays in succession, and the stays are lashed.</p>
                <p>There is usually a chain necklace round each top-mast-head, sunk in the bolsters;
                    one leg of each is for the top-sail-tye hanging-block to shackle to, and forward
                    there are two other legs for the jib-halyards and fore-ton-mast
                    stay-sail-halyards. After the rigging has been placed over tne top-mast-head,
                    the cap is sent up by two girdlines lashed as high as possible and bent to the
                    foremost part of the cap, with stops to the after-bolts, by which means it goes
                    up before all, with the under-side towards the mast; when it is high enough the
                    after-stops are cut and it slides up on the top of the mast, assisted by men at
                    the mast-head, who get it over the square and beat it down. Directly the
                    top-mast is in position to receive the rigging the top-rope pendants are rove
                    and the tackles secured, first one to relieve the hawser of the weight and then
                    the other in its place. Copper funnels are sometimes used to receive the topmast
                    rigging, similar to those for top-gallant-masts.</p>
                <p>Top-gallant and royal rigging is sometimes stripped of the service and covered
                    with canvas, which is afterwards painted, for the sake of neatness; but the
                    durability of the rope is thereby greatly lessened. Another bad practice is that
                    of taking off one of the topgallant-backstays, thereby directly diminishing the
                    support. But worse still is the trick of forming the eyes of rigging and
                    backstays by two seizings, the ends of each rope going to different sides of the
                    ship; this gives two eyes over the mast instead of four, and makes everything
                    depend on the strength of the seizings. It is now a very common practice to
                    cross the top-gallant rigging and set it up on opposite sides of the top,
                    instead of reeving it through the necklace on the top-mast and setting it up on
                    the same side. This is done entirely for the sake of saving seconds in shifting
                    the spars, either the top-gallant-mast or the top-mast. Shrouds so treated give
                    no support to the mast whatever; probably they act in the reverse way, as may be
                    easily shown by drawing a straight line to represent the masts when standing
                    upright and lines in rough proportion at right angles for the top and
                    cross-trees. Draw the top-gallant rigging on one side from mast to cross-tree
                    and thence to the opposite side of the top. The top-mast, having a little play
                    in the cap and at the heel, is bound to go over some inches at the head, taking
                    the cross-tree with it; it will then be seen that the weather side of the
                    cross-tree has approached the lee side of the top, slacking the weather and
                    tightening the lee topgallant rigging.</p>
                <p>Getting a lower yard on board requires great care to avoid injury to the hammock
                    netting and other things. Spars should be slung over the side for it to rub
                    against and slip-ropes through the ports to ease it over the gunnel. If it is to
                    be hoisted in on the port-side, the starboard yard-arm is towed foremost. A
                    hawser may be rove through the port top-block down through the lubber’s hole and
                    bent round the centre of the yard. The hatch of the lubber’s hole must be open
                    and a strong mat provided. Instead of the hawser the jeers may be partially
                    rove, the standing part being secured to the yard, and also the sail-tackle from
                    the top-masthead to the lower yard-arm and the starboard up-and-down tackle to
                    the starboard yard-arm, also a burton from the fore-mast to the main-yard, or
                    from the bowsprit if it is a fore-yard. The capstan and jeers will heave up the
                    bulk of the weight, while the other tackles cant it and ease it across the
                    gunnel. A derrick is sometimes used to keep it off the ship’s side. When a ship
                    is alongside a jetty, a guy from a strong-hold on shore removes all difficulty,
                    and a list towards the side at which the yard is coming in is desirable. Lower
                    yards are usually rigged while resting across the gunnel; they are swayed up by
                    the jeers, and slung with strong chains—the part round the yard being connected
                    with that round the lower mast-head by a tongue and slip. The yards must be<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n622/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0622-0597"/> prevented from canting forward with the weight
                    and drag of the sail; accordingly the slings, either chain or rope, should be
                    put on with the bight coming up the fore side (see fig. 18, where the arrow
                    indicates the fore side and the direction the sail pulls); they are generally
                    put on the wrong way. Merchant ships are invariably fitted with iron trusses,
                    which are fixtures on the mast, holding the yard at the requisite distance and
                    acting as a universal joint. They are of great advantage where there is not a
                    large crew.</p>
                <p>While the rigging is progressing the disposition of all heavy weights is worthy
                    of serious attention; for not only ought the vessel to be brought to the draught
                    and trim designed by the builder, or that which has by experience been found the
                    best, but there must not be too much strain at any one part, especially the
                    extremities. In ships intended for sailing or steaming rapidly this is of vital
                    importance; the bows and sterns of cutter or schooner yachts should be empty.
                    Placing the weights in the wings of the hold will steady the rolling motion and
                    make the intervals longer; but this may be carried too far for stability,—
                    especially if the vessel has a low free-board. Weights low down close to the
                    keel will increase stability at the expense of a quick uneasy jerking motion. A
                    yacht which carries much ballast low down will be very stiff under canvas and
                    may sail well in the Solent, but would be unfit to go outside the Isle of Wight.
                    When heavy weights are carried in merchant ships as part cargo, they should
                    never be placed as a solid mass; railway bars, for instance, may be stowed
                    gridiron fashion a foot apart, by which means they will occupy as much space and
                    act upon the ship in the same way as an equal weight of provision casks.</p>
                <p>Before bending sails all the ropes are rove ready for use. A yacht’s sails if new
                    should be scrubbed, to take the stiffness out of them. In all cases they should
                    be set when bent and the yards braced each way (unless it is blowing too hard),
                    or there is a risk of something going wrong when they are required for use. In
                    setting them care should be taken that no part is stretched or girt unduly.</p>
                <p>The inner end of a chain cable is usually secured by a tongue-slip and by a short
                    piece of cable which passes round the mast or is shackled to the keelson; it
                    still retains the name of “clinch.” The tongue should not have scope enough to
                    reach the compressor, as it has been known to strip back the ring and slip the
                    cable. It is a good thing to trice up the slip before the cable is stowed, so
                    that it will be accessible at all times, either for slipping, shackling another
                    cable, or bending a hawser. It may be thought that a chain cable would run into
                    the locker and stow itself, but that is a mistake; if care is not taken to
                    spread it evenly, it will form a pyramid with turns round the base, upon which
                    the upper part will fall as soon as the ship leans over; it will then be
                    necessary to haul up several small bights before the cable will run clear.</p>
                <p>A ship should never lie long at single anchor in a tide-way or during variable
                    winds, for fear of fouling her anchor and thereby destroying its holding power.
                    Frequently space is wanted, as ship and cable range over a large circle, with
                    liability to foul other ships or their anchors. A long scope of cable will only
                    keep a ship clear of her anchor during very light winds, unless assisted by
                    close attention and correct judgment on the part of the seaman. The direction of
                    the two streams of tide should be considered in connexion with the wind in order
                    to keep the ship to leeward of her anchor each time she passes it. A strong wind
                    blowing across the direction of the tide and acting on the hull of the ship will
                    secure that effect; but, when the directions of wind and tide are the same or
                    nearly so, precaution is necessary at each turn of the tide; it is then that a
                    buoy watching over the anchor is of great service. When the wind and tide are in
                    the same direction the helm should be kept over to that side which will cause
                    the ship’s head to point in the direction on which she has previously passed the
                    anchor, as the bight of the cable will be dragging that way. The force of the
                    tide alone will cause her to shoot over considerably; but when she is assisted
                    by the fore-top-mast stay-sail (or stay-fore-sail in a small vessel) the sheer
                    will be much greater. The sheet in either case is better to windward and the
                    fore-top-sail braced sharp abox if the wind is light; but, when the tide
                    commences to change, the sail should be allowed to fill, or it should be taken
                    in and the helm placed in midships. If sufficient effect has not been produced
                    by elm and head-sails before the tide ends, the mizzen-top-sail should be set as
                    soon as the ship falls head to wind, first braced abox to turn her stern in the
                    desired direction and then flat aback so as to drag the cable straight. Cutters
                    and schooners have not that advantage; they must depend on the helm and
                    head-sails. At the end of a weather tide the helm and stay-sail will guide the
                    vessel past the anchor. If a ship should break her sheer (pass the wrong way),
                    or during calms and variable winds should approach her anchor, the cable should
                    be hove in, and if there is reason to suspect the clearness of the anchor it
                    should be sighted, since it will be of no use as an anchor if a turn of cable is
                    round the fluke. When anchoring, the state of the tide must be considered in
                    connexion with the depth of water; a vessel was once left high-and-dry by the
                    ebb-tide near Dungeness, and a large iron ship drove her own anchor through her
                    bottom in the Solent, off Lymington.</p>
                <p>The avoidance of the anchors in shallow water is another reason for mooring.</p>
                <p>When a ship is in an exposed position, where it may become necessary to let go
                    two or three anchors through stress of weather, in any part of the northern
                    hemisphere, the bower on the port side should be used first, next the foremost
                    one on the starboard side, and as a third the after one on the starboard side,
                    since the ordinary wind veers with the sun, and at the end of the gale the
                    cables will be clear of each other. In the southern hemisphere the reverse order
                    holds good.</p>
                <p>When a ship is likely to remain many days at an anchorage where there is a tide
                    or variable winds it is better to moor at once on arrival, with a scope of cable
                    each way six or eight times greater than the depth of water, and an open hawse
                    towards the worst wind. The two cables combined should always be much in excess
                    of the distance between the anchors, otherwise they will possess but little
                    strength to resist a rectangular strain,—an error frequently committed. The
                    amount of support which cables will render under such circumstances will be in
                    proportion to the sine of the angle contained between the anchor and the ship’s
                    bow and a line from one anchor to the other. Suppose, for example, a ship moored
                    with anchors east and west of each other, 100 fathoms apart and having 55
                    fathoms on each cable, in 10 fathoms of water. With chain cables the hawse pipes
                    would not be more than 53 fathoms from each anchor, consequently with a south
                    wind the support given to the ship by each cable will only be 33 per cent. of
                    the strain on the cable,—that is, say, 66 tons combined when the cables are
                    strained up to 100 tons each. The support increases rapidly as the cable is
                    veered; an addition of 5 fathoms each way will (under the above circumstances)
                    give 101 tons, and a scope of 80 fathoms each way will give 153 tons. In
                    practice the cables by dragging over the ground, especially soft mud, assume a
                    direction more ahead, particularly when each cable has a long scope. The anchors
                    should be placed sufficiently far apart to prevent fouling with the slack chain,
                    but not farther, unless the water is too shallow to allow the ship to pass over
                    her anchor at low tide. Such an anchorage is not suitable for very long ships
                    unless special moorings are provided, for which purpose Parks’s mooring-blocks
                    are very suitable and inexpensive; they are commonly used in Portsmouth harbour.
                    These blocks are recommended as moorings for the use of yachts and small craft,
                    as being trustworthy and less likely to be stolen than anchors of any kind.
                    Should a ship that is moored with a good scope on each cable have the misfortune
                    to part one of them, her position will be preferable to what it would be if
                    parted from a single anchor, as the bight of cable dragging over the ground will
                    retard her progress, giving more time for another anchor to be let go. In all
                    cases of veering cable either it should be done so freely that the ship will
                    fall off broadside to the wind, when it may be secured while drifting, or it
                    should be done very slowly, a few fathoms, or even a few feet at a time, the
                    ship not being allowed to get any stern way. Veering during a squall should be
                    avoided if possible; it should be done in time, before the violence of the
                    squall is felt; but, if it is intended to pay out freely till broadside on, the
                    head-yards should be braced abox to assist and another anchor should be ready. A
                    cable should never be secured entirely by the bitts or windlass, but the
                    compressor and deck stoppers should participate in the strain. When unmooring,
                    the riding cable should be veered freely to allow the ship to get directly over
                    the lee anchor; if it is embedded, stopper the cable while vertical and heave on
                    the other, which must break it out.</p>
                <p>The laborious operation of clearing hawse was mitigated or avoided by the
                    introduction of chain cables and the invention of the mooring swivel. As the
                    cables unshackle at every 12 ½ or 15 fathoms, the end to be dipped round the
                    other cable need not be long. There are two general methods of holding the
                    weight of the lee cable while the turns are taken out. The simplest is to have a
                    light tongue slip to take the flat link, but only about one-tenth the strength
                    of the cable; in a large ship it should have a roller at the top, so that the
                    end of a hawser may be rove and form a standing part. The slip being fixed on
                    the lee cable close above the turns and the hawser taut, the nearest shackle
                    inboard is taken out, and the short end thus formed is hauled out of the
                    hawse-pipe by the fore-bowline, or else by a rope from the bees of the bowsprit,
                    a hook-rope being also attached for hauling it inboard again. A boat should be
                    in attendance from which to detach the hook-rope from the end of the cable, pass
                    it round the riding-cable, and make it fast again to the end of the cable
                    (hanging by the bowline) for hauling it back through the hawse-pipe; thus an
                    elbow is formed taut round the riding-cable in the reverse direction to the
                    elbows and turns below the slip. That operation must be repeated till the same
                    number of turns is formed above as below the slip,—observing that a cross cannot
                    be removed, but the lee cable can be brought under the other. When the cable is
                    taut in and shackled, the slip is knocked off, which allows the turns to drop
                    clear. The cables will then be as they were when moored, with the addition of
                    one or two fathoms on the lee cable. If the short end of the cable is lowered
                    into a boat and lifted by the bowline only for each turn,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n623/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0623-0598"/> the operation can be performed much quicker. The
                    second method is to lash the two cables together above the turns with a piece of
                    old rope, which acts as the slip and is cut when done with. In rough weather
                    when a boat cannot lie under the bows the lashing must be passed by a man on the
                    cable (if it is not high enough, heave it up), after which both cables are hove
                    into the same hawse-pipe, whence they are easily cleared inboard; if there are
                    many turns a small lashing will suffice in moderately deep water.</p>
                <p>One of the objections made to slack mooring is that turns are formed below water
                    where they are not visible. To meet this objection a piece of paper representing
                    a ship stuck to the glass cover of a compass, with two differently coloured
                    threads attached to paper anchors or inserted into cuts at the edge of the card,
                    in the directions the anchors actually bear from each other, will represent all
                    the turns which the ship makes with the cables.</p>
                <p>There are various ways of putting on a mooring-swivel, but doing it inboard
                    appears to be the safest and easiest. First place it in the riding-cable by
                    shackling the two short legs of the swivel; leave the two linked ends for the
                    second cable, the end of which being hauled out of the hawse by the bowline is
                    hauled into the other pipe by a hook-rope and shackled to the outer long leg;
                    the stopper just inside the hawse (which had been holding the weight outboard of
                    the lee cable) is then slipped and that hawse-pipe is left clear for hauling out
                    the inner end of the lee cable, which is hauled in the other side and shackled
                    to the inner (upper) long leg of the swivel; it then becomes a bridle. There are
                    thus three parts of cable in that hawse-pipe; the last, having no weight, should
                    be stopped here and there to the others so as to be carried out as the swivel is
                    veered towards the water’s edge and the bridle hove up square. Ships constructed
                    as rams take in both bridles on the same side. A mooring-swivel should always be
                    taken off by first heaving it inboard. If moored very slack, turns may form
                    below the swivel during a calm with still water, but they will disappear with a
                    cross strain; and if the ship is about to get under way the swivel and turns may
                    be hove in together. If it becomes desirable to put on a mooring-swivel when
                    turns are in the cables, let it be put on over them; they will soon shake out.
                    One of the bridles is sometimes taken off the swivel for the sake of clearing
                    that side of the deck; the error is obvious on considering that the strength of
                    the remaining part is not equal to the strain which may come upon the span, and
                    the nip in the hawse-pipe is always the part most severely tried. The importance
                    of frequently white-leading and greasing all cable shackles and swivels is
                    obvious, but, being troublesome, it is much neglected. The bow of a cable
                    shackle should always be forward; if the reverse is the case, the shoulder may
                    strike the side of the hawse-pipe or get jammed under the compressor. The shape
                    of a shackle bolt should be such as to prevent it entering the wrong way; they
                    often go half way in and jam.</p>
                <p>It is desirable that every vessel should carry anchors as large as she can stow
                    and work conveniently, and cables to correspond. A wooden-stocked anchor is
                    lighter when under water than an iron-stocked one of similar holding power, and
                    the wooden stock is less liable to foul when let go; but the durability of iron
                    has nearly rendered the wooden stock obsolete. The old-fashioned anchor with
                    long shank, fluke, and stock had greater holding power and certainty of grip
                    than the more compact dumpy anchor now in common use. Backing large anchors by
                    smaller ones is now seldom practised, except when vessels are on shore and the
                    anchor is laid out on a sandy bottom; it is generally better that each anchor
                    should have its own cable and proportionate strain. Floating anchors were
                    formerly used to keep ships’ bows up in a gale; they were made of iron crossbars
                    and three or four thicknesses of strong canvas, or a spar with a heavily
                    weighted sail, spanned with a stout hawser; such a contrivance might frequently
                    be improvised and used to prevent a boat or small vessel from foundering.</p>
                <p>Should an anchor be lost in sand or soft mud after having borne a heavy strain,
                    it may be buried entirely, when it can only be recovered by grappling the chain,
                    if that is of sufficient length. This is best done by a small anchor with a bar
                    of iron to assist the stock and dragged by a long scope of chain. If the anchor
                    is on ordinary ground and only sunk as far as the shank or a little more, as
                    shown in fig. 38, it is easily recovered whether there is any cable on it or
                    not. The full length of a hawser strong enough to weigh the anchor should be
                    used as a sweep, with a boat at each end pulling very slowly or dropping with
                    the tide, in the reverse direction to the strain when it parted, so as to catch
                    the fluke as a hook. Towing a hawser against the tide is generally waste of
                    time, and a chain forms too narrow a bight, unless the anchor is buoyed. When
                    the anchor is felt both boats should close together and their crews pull with
                    all their strength for a minute or two. Then, while one boat remains stationary,
                    keeping her part of the hawser steady, the other should cross her bows with a
                    slack hawser, which thus passes under the tauter part; this second boat, by
                    continuing in a circle round the anchor and returning to the side of the
                    stationary one, will cause a turn to be formed round the fluke, as represented
                    in the figure. Both crews should again pull hard to tighten the turn round the
                    fluke, after which, both parts being held in one boat and made equally taut, an
                    anchor shackle (buoyed) is placed round them and shaken down by a veer-and-haul
                    pull on both parts by the crew of one boat, while the other tows ahead to keep a
                    strain on the hawser till it is nearly vertical, when the anchor is secured. The
                    ship can then take in the two parts of the hawser and weigh it.</p>
                <p>In getting a ship under way there are a few precautions which should necessarily
                    be observed. If the ship is moored, the first anchor to be weighed is that which
                    it would be least convenient to sail from. At the time of unmooring the
                    direction of the tide is very important in the case of sailing ships, and should
                    not be disregarded by steamers. The hauling part of the cat-fall is always
                    through the foremost sheave, to prevent the tackle from fouling owing to the
                    ship’s motion through the water. The cable on the second anchor should always be
                    hove short before making sail. Should there be plenty of room and the wind
                    moderate, there is no caution necessary beyond placing leadsmen in the chains
                    with newly marked lines, and putting the helm hard over each way to ensure its
                    being clear. The after-yards should be braced up on one tack and the head-yards
                    on the other, to pay her head off; in cutters and schooners the stay-fore-sail
                    is used for that purpose. If another vessel is at anchor too close astern to
                    ensure gathering way while ahead of her, it should not be attempted; but, by
                    squaring the after-yards as soon as the anchor is tripped, the ship’s head will
                    pay off till it becomes safe to fill all the sails and pass under the stern of
                    the other vessel. The anchor should have been <hi rend="italic">catted</hi> and
                    perhaps <hi rend="italic">fished</hi> also during the interval; much way should
                    never be on the ship till the anchor is secured, for fear of it slipping or of a
                    man falling overboard. Should rocks or shallow water be inconveniently close
                    astern different means must be adopted. If the wind blows directly on shore,
                    offering no choice of direction, and a current runs parallel to the shore, the
                    ship’s head should be cast against the stream. The yards should be braced abox
                    sharp up, with as much sail set over them as the force of the wind will allow,
                    every means being taken to heave the anchor up quickly; and, in a well-manned
                    ship, as soon as it is out of the ground, haul on board the main-tack and aft
                    with the sheet, set jib and spanker. The helm being alee, keep it so as long as
                    is required, and brace round the head-yards quickly; the ship will soon spring
                    ahead. Then, by keeping close to the wind, the rate of movement will be retarded
                    till the anchor is secured; then set the fore-sail.</p>
                <p>The above is applicable in moderate weather when all or nearly all plain sail
                    could be set. But, should there be a strong wind and a rough sea, it might not
                    be possible to weigh the anchor or to prevent it staving the bows if it were
                    hove up; in that case it must be sacrificed for the safety of the ship by
                    passing the strongest hawser from the after-port (padded with mats) to the
                    cable, making it fast by a rolling-hitch, and hauling it taut; an axe and block
                    should be in readiness, also guys, to prevent the spring of the hawser breaking
                    men’s legs. The courses should be reefed and all ready for setting; the
                    top-sails (double or treble reefed) should be set or sheeted home ready for
                    setting; and all the yards should be braced up on the tack it is intended to go
                    off on. The first opportunity should be taken when the ship is commencing a yaw
                    in the desired direction to slip the cable, set the fore-stay-sail and
                    fore-top-mast stay-sail; as soon as the top-sails fill, cut the spring, set the
                    reefed courses, and the main-and mizzen-try-sails. To veer the cable previous to
                    slipping would be more likely to break the hawser. The expedient of losing an
                    anchor should only be resorted to when there is too much wind and sea to admit
                    of weighing it and not too much to prevent the ship, of whatever description,
                    from gaining something to windward under a press of sail. Otherwise her
                    condition is made worse by the loss of the anchor; it would be better to decide
                    upon riding the gale out, letting go other anchors, veering all the cable
                    available, striking the top-masts, and bracing the yards nearly fore-and-aft.
                    The cutting away of the lower-masts, when necessary, must always be done with
                    great care to avoid killing people or bilging the ship with the wreckage. The
                    lanyards of the lower rigging on one side should be cut as the ship rolls in
                    that direction, and a few notches made in the mast on both sides 3 or 4 feet
                    above the deck, the men running aft out of the way when it is likely to fall,
                    for which operations they would have from eight to fourteen seconds. As soon as
                    the mast has fallen the lanyards of the stays should be cut and the most
                    strenuous efforts made to cut and clear every rope which would still hold the
                    mast to the ship.</p>
                <p>"When weighing in rough weather with sufficient room to drift, it is better to
                    have the anchor fully secured before making any sail; or, if it is intended to
                    run before the wind, the ship can be kept on her course by the jib only till the
                    anchor is stowed. Steaming up to an anchor against strong wind or tide is
                    objectionable, as it requires great attention and judgment to avoid jerks; the
                    same applies to steaming in a gale to ease the strain on the cable; a con-<pb

                    ever becoming slack. Fore-and-aft rigged vessels have much less difficulty in
                    getting under way when close to a lee shore, as their main-sails can be fully
                    set without holding wind, and directly she pays off all the sails draw.</p>
                <p>If the anchors drag and the ship strikes the bottom, especially on rocks, and it
                    is apprehended that she may go to pieces or founder in comparatively deep water,
                    it would be right to select the best place on shore (if there be a choice), and
                    endeavour to thrust her into it by slipping or breaking all the cables and
                    making sail, if there is still the means of doing so, with the view of driving
                    her up as high as possible and so saving life; let it also be at the top of high
                    water, if that can be waited for. When there is a heavy strain on a chain cable
                    it is easily broken by scratching a notch with a common saw on a link that rests
                    firmly on the bitts and then striking it with a maul or sledge-hammer.</p>
                <p>The usual way of testing whether the anchors are holding or not is by dropping
                    the lead over the side and leaving the line slack; but the ship is liable to
                    swing over it, causing it to be disturbed. A grapnel over the bow or from the
                    bowsprit is preferable. Also by sitting on a cable before the bitts a tremulous
                    motion is felt if the anchor is dragging.</p>
                <p>If instead of a dead lee shore we have the wind oblique with the line of coast,
                    and the ship from some cause too close to admit of a stern-board towards it, the
                    head-yards should be braced abox to cast her head inshore, while the after-yards
                    are kept square; this will cause the ship to make a long stern-board from the
                    shore, which will not terminate till the wind is well abaft the beam. The helm
                    up to that time may be kept in midships, as there is no reason to diminish the
                    curve. As the stern-way is lost the helm should be put hard up, the head-yards
                    squared, and the mizzen-top-sail kept shivering till braced up on the desired
                    tack. The main-top-sail should be kept full. If it is necessary to get the ship
                    round as quickly and as shortly as possible, the fore-yard, instead of being
                    squared when about to shake, may be braced entirely round quickly so as to
                    continue paying her bow off till the wind comes aft, then squared to allow her
                    to come to. The jib or the fore-top-mast stay-sail (according to the weather)
                    may be hoisted when the anchor is tripped or not, until the wind is before the
                    beam on the desired tack; if at the former time the sheets should be hauled to
                    windward and kept so till the ship is before the wind, then eased off till the
                    wind comes before the beam. The spanker or mizzen-try-sail should be set as soon
                    as it will draw the right way.</p>
                <p>What has been said about trimming the sails as the ship is turned round after
                    casting with her head inshore is equally applicable to a case of ordinary
                    wearing when it is desirable to turn the ship with as little loss of ground as
                    possible. As a general guide to the position in which the yards should be
                    placed, it may be remembered that the pressure on the sails always acts at right
                    angles to the yards. This may be exemplified by bracing the yards sharp up when
                    the wind is two or three points abaft the beam. As it will then blow directly
                    into the sails they will certainly receive greater strain, but the speed of the
                    ship will be less than when the yards were square; and it may be observed that
                    considerable leeway will be caused by the lateral pressure. In wearing ship all
                    the fore-and-aft sails should be taken in except the head-sails, and when the
                    helm is put up the main-sail should be taken in and the mizzen-top-sail
                    shivered, —the latter continued till it is sharp up for the new tack. A fashion
                    has been adopted of leaving the mizzen-top-sail square till after the head-yards
                    have been squared; hence everything depends for a time upon the action of the
                    rudder, and the ship sails a considerable distance before the wind and loses so
                    much ground. The operation of wearing a cutter requires much more care than with
                    a square-rigged vessel on account of the heavy boom. A schooner is treated
                    similarly, but the spars and sails are lighter in proportion to the size of the
                    vessel. Before putting the helm up, the tack of the main-sail is triced up (the
                    top-sail clewed up), and the peak dropped till it is nearly in a line with the
                    boom topping-lifts, which is called scandalizing the main-sail. Both peak and
                    boom are secured firmly in midships by means of the down-haul and sheets. Not
                    only is the diminution of after-sail necessary to allow the vessel to pay off
                    quickly, but the change of wind from one quarter to the other will only cause a
                    gybe which is perfectly under control. The jib and stay-fore-sail are gybed by
                    hauling the sheets flat just before the wind is aft so as to diminish the jerk
                    as much as possible. The peak of the main-sail is easily rehoisted while the
                    tack is up and the vessel luffed up to the wind. The runners and weather-boom
                    topping-lift should be pulled up while the ship is before the wind and the
                    top-sail-sheet hauled out as soon as the peak is up,—the tack-tackle being
                    shifted to windward and pulled down. In wearing during fine weather, especially
                    in yachts when racing, some risk may be preferable to the loss of time and the
                    main-sail may be kept set. As the main-sheet is usually rove through a treble
                    block on the boom, a double block to move along the horse, and a single block on
                    each quarter, a strong crew can man each part at the same time and haul the boom
                    in midships quickly, belaying the part which was at the lee side and is about to
                    become the weather side directly the boom is over the leading block, while the
                    other part is kept in hand till the gybe has been effected to lessen the
                    jerk.</p>
                <p>The sails of all vessels are most effective when set as nearly flat as
                    practicable, and also each sail, as well as each part of a sail, should be
                    spread at the same angle from the keel. If under that condition too much or too
                    little weather-helm is required, the balance should be established by changing
                    the quantity of canvas at either end or by altering the trim, not by permanently
                    easing off a sheet, for that is as detrimental as dragging the rudder at a large
                    angle. By altering the stand of the masts materially the angle and consequent
                    set of all gaff-sails are thrown out.</p>
                <p>To tack a fore-and-aft-rigged vessel is very simple; by easing off the jib and
                    fore-sheets at the time the helm is eased down and hauling over the main-sheet,
                    the vessel will soon run up to the wind; then if the fore-sheet is hauled flat
                    over as for the former tack it will assist to pay her bow off the right way. The
                    jib-sheet would be hauled aft while shaking, but not too soon to cause it to
                    take the wrong way. The fore-sheet is shifted over as the other sails are about
                    to fill, according to the speed with which the vessel is paying off. In a smart
                    vessel, such as a cutter-yacht in smooth water and with a good breeze, there
                    will be no occasion to retain the fore-sheet, but allow it to shake itself over
                    similarly to the jib. Returning to the idea of tacking with difficulty,—the helm
                    should be put hard over as the speed decreases and reversed directly sternway
                    commences; this remark applies to vessels of all shapes and sizes, as will also
                    the advice not to put the helm over to a large angle while the vessel is going
                    at great speed. At an angle of 10 degrees, more than 98 per cent. of the force
                    on the rudder is applied to turning the vessel and 17 ½ per cent. to retard her;
                    while at 30 degrees one-half the force would retard and 86 ½ per cent. tend to
                    turn. Hence we see the reasons for recommending close fitting, broad, tapering
                    rudders.</p>
                <p>While the vessel is in stays the weather-boom topping-lift should be pulled to
                    take the weight of the boom, the runner-and-tackle on the weather side set up,
                    and the lee one slacked as soon as she is round; also shift the main tack-tackle
                    over to windward and set it up; get a pull of the gaff-top-sail tack if
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>The jib of a cutter, yawl, or schooner with a running bowsprit is a difficult
                    sail to handle when the vessel is under way. If there is sea-room it is better
                    to keep the yacht away before the wind and let go the outhaul, when the
                    traveller will run in, or pull at the same time on the inhaul, which should be
                    fitted with a span to keep it square. Haul the stay-fore-sail sheet over to make
                    room to haul in the jib to leeward of it. Gather in the slack canvas smartly to
                    keep it from getting overboard; get hold of the luff of the sail by the
                    stay-rope, while some hands pull on the downhaul. When the sail is perfectly
                    under control let go the halyards and continue hauling on the stay-rope and
                    downhaul. When there is not room to run before the wind, it is best to heave to
                    with foresheet to windward while taking in or shifting a jib; by letting go the
                    outhaul the traveller will run in and the sail can be handled as before, a good
                    hold being always kept of the weather side, that is, the luff of the sail. If
                    another jib is to be bent it should be laid along the weather side of the deck
                    in readiness, with the tack forward and the head aft. The sheets are then
                    untoggled from the former sail, handed across outside (to windward) of the
                    fore-stay, and toggled to the second jib; also take the tack to the traveller,
                    hook it, and run it out. Hook the halyards and hoist the jib up by them; then
                    tauten the luff by the purchase while the sheet is flowing.</p>
                <p>A jib-headed gaff-top-sail is preferable for use on a wind and commanding breeze,
                    though for light winds a long yard spreads a fine sheet of canvas. Such a yard
                    should be slung at one-third from the fore-end (as a boat’s dipping lug), the
                    clew-line block secured at the length of the leech from the upper end, and the
                    standing part of the clew-line made fast to the lower end,—this last to keep it
                    clear of the cross tree when being hauled down, which must always be done on the
                    side it has been set, a tack being made if necessary to bring it to windward. On
                    the approach of a squall the fore-sail should be hauled down by means of the
                    downhaul and the vessel luffed up; it is dangerous to attempt bearing up at such
                    a time until the main-sail has been scandalized; the effect of the water on the
                    rudder aids greatly in tripping a vessel over.</p>
                <p>As bad weather comes on the main-sail must be reefed (a smaller jib having been
                    already set) by topping up the boom, easing down the peak and throat, and
                    hauling down the reef cringle to the boom by the reef-tackle; lash the tack and
                    tie the points without rolling the slack canvas. The second and third reefs are
                    taken in as the wind increases and the fore-sail reefed again or stowed, during
                    which time the jib-sheet should be hauled flat, the main-tack triced up, and the
                    vessel kept close to the wind to avoid plunging the sea over the bow. To reef
                    the bowsprit,—house the top-mast, let the jib run in, slack the bobstays and
                    bowsprit shrouds, take out the fid, and let the bowsprit run in one or two
                    reefs; then refid it, set taut the gear, and set a small jib. It is at all times

                    one, but especially in a heavy sea, when the mode of treatment must be entirely
                    different. A small vessel should be luffed up to meet every large wave in order
                    to bow it as much as possible. She will have but little way on at the time of
                    meeting it and will drop into it easily; the bow will then fall off, the sails
                    fill, and a run be made parallel to the waves till she is luffed up again. A
                    four-oared gig has been taken through a heavy sea under oars by pulling up to
                    meet every dangerous crest which could not be dodged, and just before it broke
                    over the bow backing away from it. The smallest amount of sail which can be
                    shown by a main-sail is when it is balance-reefed; this is accomplished by
                    close-reefing it and lowering the jaws of the gaff close down to the boom, while
                    the peak stretches up that part of the leech above the close-reef cringle. The
                    plan is more frequently adopted by fishing smacks than by yachts or other
                    well-found vessels; they have a try-sail which, being laced on a smaller gaff,
                    is hoisted by the same peak and throat halyards as the larger sail, and has its
                    sheet secured to a bolt near the stern, while the boom is crutched and secured
                    with the main-sail and the large gaff lashed to it. The try-sail admits of being
                    reefed; it is a safe sail either on or off the wind in rough weather. The
                    greatest care is necessary when running before the wind to keep the vessel on
                    her course and to avoid gybing. A vessel should never get under way without a
                    small boat, and a cutter should never be without her legs for fear of taking the
                    ground unexpectedly. In racing to windward, if the wind is variable, keep nearly
                    dead to leeward of the mark vessel, as every change in the direction of the wind
                    will then be an advantage; unless there is a tidal preference for one direction
                    over the other, that will of course decide it.</p>
                <p>If taken aback by a change of wind, and wishing to remain on the same tack, put
                    the helm up and haul over the fore-sheet. In a ship haul over the head-sheets
                    and brace the head-yards abox. The way to tack a ship under favourable
                    circumstances may here be assumed as well known, and only a few hints relative
                    to doubtful cases given. A few minutes prior to the attempt set all suitable
                    sail, keep steadily “rap-full " with a small helm, so as to get as much way as
                    possible. If the crew is large enough to list the ship, send them over to
                    leeward, ease down the helm slowly, haul the boom in midships, haul down the
                    head-sails, ease off the foresheet, let go the head-bowlines, and check the
                    head-braces. Directly the wind is out of the fore-top-sail, brace the head-yards
                    sharp up again and haul the bowlines. When the wind is entirely out of the
                    main-top-sail, let go the top-gallant bowlines (if those sails are set) and
                    raise tacks and sheets, except the fore-tack, which should be raised after the
                    main-yard has been swung. As soon as the vessel loses her way, shift the helm
                    hard over, and send the men to their stations. If she brings the wind across her
                    bow, hoist the head-sails with the sheets on the same side as before; if the
                    wind takes them well and the ship is still going round, give the order “mainsail
                    haul,” haul down the main-tack, aft the sheet, shift over the head-sails, haul
                    the after-bowlines. As the main-top-sail fills, or before, according to the
                    rapidity with which she pays off, swing the head-yards to the order of ‘‘ haul
                    off all.”</p>
                <p>If when near head to wind it is found that the bow is falling back and stern-way
                    commencing, it is evident that she has “missed stays.” The helm in that case
                    should not be shifted, as with stern-way it will help her to pay her bow off in
                    the direction it was before. The head-sails should be hoisted, the main-sail and
                    spanker taken in, the fore-sheet hauled aft, the after-yards squared. As the
                    wind comes abaft the beam the mizzen-top-sail should be kept shivering and the
                    main-top-sail just full; shift the helm as she gathers headway. When before the
                    wind square the head-yards, shift over the head-sheets, and keep them flowing.
                    Set the spanker when it will take the right way; complete wearing as before
                    described. This is similar to “box-hauling”; it is not necessary to brace the
                    head-yards abox if she will fall off without. The manoeuvre of putting the helm
                    down and letting the ship shoot up in the wind before wearing is sometimes
                    adopted for the sake of diminishing the run to leeward. Hauling all the yards at
                    once is very objectionable; the sails are longer aback and have to be hauled
                    round by main strength against the pressure of the wind.</p>
                <p>“Club-hauling” may occasionally save a ship even in these days of steam, as a
                    paddle-steamer will not turn with her head against a strong gale and a heavy
                    sea, nor will a sailing-ship with an auxiliary screw-propeller. It may be done
                    when the ship is found edging down on a lee shore, too close to wear, and having
                    a depth of water not exceeding 20 fathoms. It will take two or three minutes to
                    open the hawse-pipe, get the cable clear, and procure hammer and punches for
                    unshackling, and mauls for breaking the cable if necessary. Put the helm down
                    and act as in ordinary tacking till she ceases to turn nearer to the wind; then
                    let go the anchor, whether she has entirely lost her way or not, as passing the
                    anchor a little will give a greater swing back when the strain comes and allow
                    more time for slipping the cable, which should be done directly the wind has
                    crossed the bow; at the same time swing the afteryards. If the cable has been
                    slipped successfully, the head-yards may be hauled as soon as the after-yards
                    have been braced up, as she will soon be broadside on. It has been proposed to
                    run a spring from the after-lee-port to the anchor, but that would take too much
                    time.</p>
                <p>“Backing and filling” is practised in a tidal channel which is too narrow to
                    allow a ship to gather way for tacking. One top sail, with the jib and spanker
                    occasionally, is generally sufficient to give slight head or stem way, to avoid
                    either bank or another vessel, while the tide carries her broadside against the
                    wind; the less sail exposed the less the lee way. Fore-and-aft vessels having
                    less power to get stern-way should have a boat in attendance with a line and a
                    small anchor.</p>
                <p>“Hedging” was a frequent performance before steam-tugs were introduced; it
                    consisted of a series of movements from one small anchor to another, previously
                    laid out by boats. For a similar purpose harbours that were much frequented were
                    formerly furnished with a succession of warping buoys. The large ropes used for
                    transporting ships are called hawsers, and by a strange anomaly were formerly
                    cable-laid nine-stranded. Such rope is hard and stiff to handle; it absorbs more
                    wet and retains it longer, therefore is less durable; when new the strength is
                    far inferior to hawser-laid rope of similar size. Manila and coir hawsers float
                    on the water and are therefore very useful.</p>
                <p>Dropping through a narrow tidal channel by means of an anchor just touching the
                    bottom is called “dredging” or clubbing; it can be practised in a passage which
                    is too narrow for backing and filling, such as the upper part of the Thames,
                    where it is done every day. The vessel swings to her anchor and points her stern
                    up (or down) the stream; by heaving in the cable (for which the steam capstans
                    and windlasses afford great facility) the tide takes the ship on as fast as it
                    is running so long as the course remains clear. When it is desirable to approach
                    either side, a few fathoms of cable paid out will cause it to hold; the helm and
                    the action of the tide will then sheer the ship as desired, and by heaving in
                    cable she will go on again, so that a sailing-ship should go up at half the rate
                    of the tide at least. With a screw-steamer it is far easier, as the screw will
                    straighten her as well as the tide, and when fairly pointed through an open
                    space she can make a stern-board at five knots an hour while perfectly under
                    control.</p>
                <p>A few words may be said about making and shortening sail in bad weather. One
                    point holds good in all cases: the sails should never be allowed to flap, as
                    that exposes them to the danger of splitting. The tack or luff is invariably
                    secured first, while the sheet bears a steady strain enough to keep the sail
                    from shaking. Before hoisting fore-and-aft sails the sheets are steadied aft;
                    and, should a sheet carry away, the sail is hauled down or brailed up instantly.
                    Spankers and try-sails should be taken in entirely by the lee-brails, the stack
                    only of the weather-brails being at first taken down. A practice has become
                    general in the British navy of securing the top-sail clew-line blocks to the
                    lower cap instead of round the yard, for the sake of saving time when shifting
                    top-sail-yards; the use of the clew-lines for hauling the yard down and
                    steadying it is thus lost; this is one of many objectionable practices.</p>
                <p>There has been a difference of opinion as to the mode of setting and taking in
                    top-sails and courses; but the same rule should apply to all square sails alike:
                    that which is safest for one will be safest for the others. Experience and the
                    balance of opinion favour the hauling home of the weather top-gallant-sheet,
                    top-sail-sheet, and tack of the fore-sail or main-sail first, with a good strain
                    on the clew-lines, clew-garnets, and bunt-lines, to avoid flapping. The lee
                    sheet may then be hauled and eased down by clew-line and buntline. Each bowline
                    should also be steadied taut in succession to prevent the leech from flapping.
                    There appears to be no advantage in first hauling the lee-sheet partially down.
                    The taking in of these sails has been equally a matter of dispute, and many
                    advocate taking in a top-sail in a different manner from that which they would
                    adopt in taking in a course. Falconer’s rule was often quoted and followed in
                    former times. It runs thus—</p>
                <p>“And be who strives the tempest to disarm,</p>
                <p>Will never first embrail the lee yard-ann.”</p>
                <p>It must be remembered that the decision there supported by the sea-poet was then
                    a novelty, and opposed to the opinion of the practical seaman. A main-sail had
                    been split by “letting fly” the sheet; but that proves nothing, as all sails
                    will split if the clew flies loose in a gale. The lee clew of an eighty-gun
                    ship’s maintop-sail was blown over the yard-arm in consequence of the
                    weather-sheet having carried away; that clew was hauled up first. It might not
                    have happened had the bunt-lines been well manned and had there been a small
                    strain on the lee bowline. Either plan will answer if the bunt-lines are well
                    manned and the sheets eased steadily; but that the weather clew should be set
                    first and taken in last is preferable.</p>
                <p>In taking in top-gallant-sails before the wind both sheets should be kept fast
                    till the yard is down. When a top-sail is to be reefed the yard should be
                    pointed to the wind; and for the first reef the top-gallant-sheets, bunt-line,
                    and bowlines should be hauled taut, for the second reef the top-gallant-sail
                    should be clewed up, to keep the sheets from knocking the men at the yard-arms.
                    In rough<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n626/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0626-0601"/> weather a preventer parrel and rolling-tackle
                    should be put on before the men go on the yards. For a fourth reef the top-sail
                    should be clewed up during the operation; it will then be performed with less
                    difficulty. The long reef-points in top-sails and courses have generally given
                    place to the lighter and more expeditious method of having reef-lines on the
                    sails, with beckets and toggles on the jackstay. The whole strain of the sail is
                    thus thrown on the jackstay and small eyebolts, instead of the points being
                    firmly tied round the yard itself. Also the slab of each reef is usually allowed
                    to hang down and chafe at the fold; but this can be prevented by fastening three
                    or four small slab-lines on each side of each reef. Cunningham’s invention for
                    reefing top-sails is very valuable in all weakly manned ships, but it requires
                    to be kept square upon the yard while rolling up. If it becomes necessary to
                    shift a top-sail during a gale, it should be made up on deck in the shape it
                    would assume if furled on the yard, and stopped with spun-yarn, with the
                    reef-earings and bowline bridles showing near the ends and the clews and
                    bunt-line toggles near the centre, where it would be slung by a slip strop. When
                    the two earings are taken into the centre it will form four parts, and the
                    weather top-mast studding-sail halyards being bent round it will cause it to
                    look like a large bale. In that state it is hoisted into the top by the sail
                    tackle, at the same time being steadied by the studding-sail halyards; there all
                    the ropes are bent, clew-lines and bunt-lines hauled up, reef-tackles hauled
                    out, and the sail bent to the yard before the stops are slipped or cut; then it
                    is reefed as desired before the weather sheet is hauled home. A fore-sail or
                    main-sail is bent in a similar manner, except that the various ropes employed on
                    a course are bent on deck, by which ropes and the burtons it is swayed up.
                    Studding-sails are very useful in long voyages; their disuse on the main-mast is
                    to be regretted, especially in long ships. A top-mast or top-gallant
                    studding-sail is shifted “before all,” by a man on the yard gathering in the
                    sail as it is lowered to him and holding the outer leech till it cants the right
                    way.</p>
                <p>During a coasting voyage the vessel must be within a moderate distance of the
                    shore, therefore the person in charge should constantly be ready to run for
                    shelter when necessary, and have the moral courage to do it in time. In yachting
                    voyages, however distant, there is a natural desire to see the land and all that
                    is worth seeing, and, being well provided with charts, such vessels can enter
                    any harbour, when perhaps a pilot is not able to get out. A ship starting on a
                    foreign voyage should seek “blue water” as soon as possible, and keep a safe
                    distance from all land which is liable to become a lee shore, and not be tempted
                    to edge in because a certain tack is much nearer to the desired course than the
                    other. For the choice of track and for trade winds, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Navigation.</hi></p>
                <p>To heave to for the purpose of stopping is done in a cutter by easing off the
                    jib-sheet, hauling over the weather fore-sheet, and tricing up the tack of the
                    main-sail. A schooner is treated similarly: the top-sail (if she has one) is
                    backed and the gaff-fore-sail is taken in. A ship has her courses hauled up,
                    head-sheets eased off, and either the main or fore yard squared. Upon the latter
                    point opinions differ. If two ships are close together, the one to windward had
                    better back the main-top-sail and the ship to leeward the fore-top-sail; they
                    should always preserve a little headway. Boats invariably board ships on the lee
                    side; small vessels, when drifting fast, on the weather side. A ship at anchor
                    in a tide-way will always present a lee side during some period; but a ‘ ‘
                    weather tide” causes a dangerous sea for boats. A boat’s oars should never be
                    tossed up or forward when there is danger of their fouling, for fear of staving
                    the boat or injuring some one in the after part.</p>
                <p>When in the vicinity of a lee beach and landing by means of a boat is determined
                    on, the oars should be manned to the utmost and the waves watched (as they
                    always vary), and the boat forced in on the top of the third large wave, care
                    being taken to keep her exactly end on to the sea. At the instant of touching
                    the ground every man should jump out and begin to haul up the boat, if she is of
                    reasonable weight; the next wave will probably put them all out of danger. By
                    holding on to the boat they give and receive mutual support, and avoid being
                    sucked back by the receding water or crushed by the boat.</p>
                <p>The term " hove to” as applied to a vessel in a gale of wind is derived from the
                    desire to turn her bow up towards the wind and sea; this under all circumstances
                    of sail should be the point aimed at, since then the seas strike the side
                    obliquely and also the bow, which is the strongest part. The best sails to keep
                    on a ship during a violent gale are the close-reefed main-top-sail, main-and
                    mizzen-try-sails, and fore-stay-sail. The fore-try-sail also may do good, and is
                    far preferable to a main-stay-sail. The pressure of the maintop-sail tends
                    greatly to mitigate the violent motion; also by heeling the ship she presents a
                    higher side to keep the sea out and a sloping deck to aid the water in running
                    off. The helm should be about one turn “a-lee,” never hard down. When north of
                    the equator ships should heave to on the starboard tack, and the reverse in
                    southern latitudes. More sail should be made as soon as the gale moderates, to
                    steady the ship. The violent rolling motion may sometimes be diminished by
                    altering course, so that the period be tween the waves reaching the vessel may
                    be made to disagree with her own period of oscillation, or when running before
                    the wind by bracing the yards up in opposite directions. Steamers at a reduced
                    speed can scarcely be considered as hove to; their masts and sails are too weak
                    to be of any use in a gale and too small in moderate winds; they make the rudder
                    do all the work. The best sail to scud under is close-reefed main-top-sail,
                    reefed fore-sail, and foretop-mast stay-sail.</p>
                <p>Three contingencies should always be anticipated by the captain and officer of
                    the watch, and in some degree by every man in the crew, so that the alarm should
                    lose half its dread and be met by prompt action,—a man falling overboard, fire,
                    and collision. A boat’s crew should be appointed in each watch, who on going on
                    deck should see the boat ready and the plug in. If the ship be on a wind and
                    capable of tacking, on the cry “A man overboard !” the helm should be put down
                    and the ship steered round on the other tack, with either the fore or main yards
                    left square and the courses up; she will then drift down towards the man, while
                    the boat, which was at first on the weather side, is being lowered to pick him
                    up. If the ship is running free the case is worse; she must be brought to the
                    wind instantly with the head-yards square. Various plans have been devised for
                    lowering boats, many of them very good when executed by trustworthy men; the
                    same may be said of the old system with plain blocks and tackles; practice and
                    coolness will render either successful.</p>
                <p>With regard to fire, prevention is better than cure; lights in the hold should
                    never be without a protecting lantern, and passengers’ sleeping-cabins should be
                    lighted by lamps fixed in the bulkhead, inaccessible from the inside. Pumps and
                    engines for extinguishing fire should be on the upper deck, for fear of being
                    cut off by the first outbreak. Fire stations and exercise should be frequent
                    even with the smallest crew. On the first alarm all ports and ventilators should
                    be closed, wind-sails hauled up, hatchways closed as much as practicable,
                    awnings and all lower sails taken in, and the ship kept before the wind, unless
                    the fire is in the after-part, in which case the boats should be lowered at
                    once. Many other things will present themselves to a cool head; perhaps the
                    first order should be “Silence !”</p>
                <p>Collisions may be reckoned among those dangers against which no man can guard
                    himself, be he ever so wise and experienced; it avails not that one ship should
                    do what is right, unless they both do so. The laws upon the subject appear to be
                    all that can be desired (see “Rules of the Road,” under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Navigation,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 277); but the mode of enforcing obedience is
                    very lax and lenient. A purely nautical tribunal is greatly needed, and every
                    unjustifiable deviation should be severely punished, whether followed by an
                    accident or not. It is admitted that in most cases of collision the evidence is
                    so conflicting that a judge must be puzzled where to find the truth. The great
                    increase of speed diminishes the time of approach; the increased length of
                    vessels demands a larger circle to turn in; the want of sail at the extremities
                    diminishes the power of turning, throwing all the work on the rudder, which is
                    proportionately much smaller than it was. The perpendicular stem gives a deadly
                    blow at the flat side, instead of first cutting down the upper works by the
                    sloping cut-water, and probably coming to a state of rest before reaching the
                    water’s edge. Sufficient care is not taken to keep all lights from the upper
                    deck and all places where they may disable the eyes of the officer in charge or
                    the lookout men. Even holes have been made at the back of the bow-light box to
                    enable the officer of the watch to see them burning; of course his eyes are
                    thereby rendered unserviceable for seeing distant objects. Officers in the
                    merchant service are invariably in two watches, which does not allow them
                    sufficient time for sleep, especially in windy weather. If immediate action is
                    not taken the instant a sail or a light is reported, the officer in charge
                    should take bearings by the compass, by which he will soon know if the other
                    vessel is inclined to pass ahead or astern. If it remains stationary by the
                    compass, they must both be converging on the same spot.</p>
                <p>If a ship should spring a leak at sea which may be attributable to straining and
                    is sufficiently serious, she should be run before the wind and sea under small
                    sail. If the pumps then clear out the water, she may run for a port or resume
                    her voyage when the gale ceases. If the leak does not abate, though the motion
                    of the ship is easy, it will be evident that a butt (end of a plank) has started
                    if it is a wooden ship, or that a plate has given way if an iron ship. In that
                    case, two stout hauling-lines should be placed under the bowsprit and head-gear,
                    and the end of one secured to the head-earing, the other to the clew of a spare
                    top-sail or course, also two similar ropes to the other side, each of the four
                    ropes being marked at 10 and 15 fathoms from the sail. Half a hundredweight of
                    iron (shot or furnace bars) should be attached to each clew, the ship’s progress
                    completely stopped, the sail thrown overboard and drawn square across the bows;
                    the hauling-lines on the clews being carried aft and kept square by the marks,
                    while the ropes on the head of the sail are veered, the sail is placed like a
                    large patch over the place desired. Should the position of the leak not be
                    discovered, it might be well to place the sail under the main-mast;<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n627/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0627-0602"/> if this has no effect, place another sail under
                    the fore-mast and the fore-foot. This simple device is no doubt very ancient and
                    was nrob-ably the process called in the book of Acts "undergirding the ship.”
                    Sails have usually been thrummed; but that requires much time, and the utility
                    is questionable. If a large hole has been made by collision a spread sail would
                    be burst by the pressure; but, such a hole being usually at the side and
                    partially visible, a large sail nearly in the form in which it was stowed,
                    having the stops cut, should be thrown over before the hole end downwards, and,
                    when sunk below the supposed depth of the fissure, brought towards it till the
                    bight of the sail enters the vortex, when it will be sucked in violently and
                    either disappear within the ship or block the hole; if the latter, smaller sails
                    can be spread slack over the hole to be sucked iu. The use of sails for the
                    above purposes has been strangely neglected during late years, though much more
                    frequently needed.</p>
                <p>A leak can be stopped from inboard when accessible by placing over it pads of
                    oiled or tarred canvas, tarred coal-sacks, bags of white lead, tallow, paint,
                    clay, or any material which fits close when pressed by boards and shored down
                    firmly,—that or something similar could be done when a ship is on shore. If a
                    ship is on shore with a large hole in one part of her bottom, she might be
                    recovered, especially if ebb-tide recedes many feet, by building a double
                    partition with a space of about 2 feet between on each side of the injured part,
                    filling the space with clay, and shoring it well, —in other words, by
                    improvising two water-tight bulkheads; the water having been pumped out of the
                    sound parts the rising tide would float her. When a ship is on shore with
                    numerous cracks in her bottom, but not a clear hole, she may be floated by
                    constant pumping, even though at first the expedient should fail to prevent the
                    tide from ebbing and flowing in the hold. By maintaining as much as possible an
                    inward flow the small fissures will gradually choke with weed and sand, till the
                    inflow is so reduced as to be within the power of the pumps; hay, oakum, or dirt
                    of any kind should be thrown over where it can be sucked into the leak. The
                    ordinary pumps of a ship may be supplemented by nailing together four common
                    deal boards and fitting two square valves weighted with lead, hinged and lined
                    with leather, to rest on seats 2 feet from one end, which must be weighted on
                    the outside as the bottom. A large hole near the top should be provided with a
                    leather lip to shoot the water over the combings. When slung in the bights of
                    two ropes four men jerk it up and down; the force with which it descends through
                    the water will send a stream up the tube with less labour than baling
                    entails.</p>
                <p>Ships on shore should be secured from driving into a worse position before being
                    freed from any weight. Hard substances such as guns and shot should not be
                    thrown on the lee side or where the ship in hauling off might strike on them.
                    Keep sufficient fresh water for immediate use. An anchor· is usually carried out
                    between two boats, the flukes being hung to a spar across the boats chocked up
                    from the thwarts, while the stock is suspended across the sterns of the boats.
                    The boats should be hauled out to a kedge anchor, while other boats support
                    short bights of hemp cable. Good axes should be used for letting go the
                    anchor.</p>
                <p>A wooden rudder when immersed is very little heavier than water and can be
                    shipped and unshipped by seamen with ordinary appliances; but iron ships have
                    metal rudders sometimes weighing as much as 20 tons. The following remarks apply
                    to wooden rudders only. To unhang a rudder remove the woodlαck,—a chock recessed
                    and nailed to the stern-post close above the upper pintle,— the use of which is
                    to prevent it being unhung by accident. From a beam or chock above the
                    rudder-head suspend two luff-tackles, single blocks, and two leads up, and the
                    double blocks down to strops through the tiller hole. A few men on each
                    luff-fall will easily lift the rudder the length of the pintles; and as they are
                    drawn from the gudgeons it will swing free and may be lowered between two boats
                    provided with spars across their gunnels; the bight of a rope avili bring the
                    heel up to a position similar to that of the head,—nearly horizontal. It can
                    then be taken under the main-yard and hoisted in, or be carried for repair to a
                    wharf or suitable beach at high water. Before a rudder is taken off to be hung,
                    two long guys are rove through holes for the purpose at the fore-part of the
                    heel, one end of each being hitched to the band for the rudder-chains, while the
                    other is in readiness to hand into the ship halfway forward and low down. On the
                    rudder-head being suspended by the luff-tackles a little higher than its
                    position when shipped, the guys will haul it to the exact line with the
                    stern-post; it is then lowered into the gudgeons, the guys unrove by means of
                    the short ends, and the woodlock replaced. Smooth water is desirable for that
                    operation; a little tide in a line with the keel will assist. The tiller should
                    be firmly wedged or secured in the rudder-head so as to prevent any jerking
                    motion; for the same reason, the wheel ropes should be kept moderately taut;
                    they should also be rove in two parts, lashed together on top of the wheel, for
                    convenience in shifting them one part at a time. The rudder-chains are shackled
                    to a band, which embraces the rudder a little above the water, and are attached
                    to a stout rope, usually stopped up round the counter ready to receive tackles,
                    by which the ship may be steered imperfectly after the rudder-head is
                    disabled.</p>
                <p>The construction of a temporary rudder has always been considered an interesting
                    and highly useful piece of seamanship. One easy plan is to pass the end of a
                    large hemp cable out of the rudder-hole or central port, haul it up to the
                    ship’s side, lash to it one or more large spars, sling the whole bundle about
                    the centre of the spars with stout hawsers as guys, throw it overboard, and
                    heave in a part of the cable, leaving the part with the spars lashed to the side
                    of it far enough away not to be lifted out of the water with the pitch of the
                    ship. The guys when rove through blocks on the spare top-sail yard-arms, which
                    are lashed across the gunnel for the purpose, are taken to the capstan; by this
                    means the ship may be steered with the assistance of her sails. If there be not
                    a hemp cable on board, the largest hawser must be used with a spare topmast or
                    the largest spar available.</p>
                <p>Early in the 19th century Captain Edward Pakenham contrived an efficient rudder
                    with the material in his ship. Part of a top-mast heel up formed the rudder-head
                    and main-piece, the fid-hole becoming the tiller-hole. The main-piece passed
                    through the round hole of the lower cap, which was made of elm and lined with
                    leather, and which, being secured by a collar near the lower part, acted for
                    pintles and gudgeons, and was drawn into place by two hawsers A, A, till it
                    embraced the stern-post by the square intended for the mast-head (fig. 39).
                    There should be ropes to the bolts <hi rend="italic">b, b</hi> to keep it
                    horizontal.</p>
                <p>Another top-mast was cut, which with the remainder of the first made four parts
                    in all, flattened and fitted together, woolded and bolted, and so forming the
                    required width. Three pigs of ballast were let into the lower part and the whole
                    planked over and secured with spike nails.</p>
                <p>Fine weather was necessary for shipping it and a collar was built above the
                    rudder-nole to confine the motion and to support the weight The materials
                    carried in modern ships may differ, but a fertile mind will generally find
                    substitutes.</p>
                <p>The “Pique” frigate, commanded by the Hon.</p>
                <p>II. J. Rous, steered across the Atlantic during sixteen days cf almost continuous
                    gales, a distance of 1500 miles, by means of a cable over the stern and a
                    Pakenham rudder during part of the time. She had been on shore in the Gulf of St
                    Lawrence; during the voyage she was making 20 inches of water an hour and she
                    had also two masts sprung; she reached St Helens in the Isle of Wight on the
                    13th of October 1835.</p>
                <p>It is a difficult thing to get a lower yard from the deck into its place without
                    letting go either stays or rigging, and this the following instance will
                    illustrate. The “Thunderer,” an eighty-four gun ship, broke her main-yard, which
                    was 112 feet long, completely in two, 5 feet to leeward of the slings. The
                    broken parts were sent down, and a main-top-sail-yard crossed instead, while a
                    reefed topsail did duty as a course and a mizzen-top-sail over it as a
                    main-topsail. The parts of the main-yard were placed together on deck; the two
                    halves of a spare anchor stock were let in on the fore and aft sides and an oak
                    mast fish on top, with some studding-sail-booms to round it off. All parts were
                    bolted, hooped, and woolded together, making it as strong as ever it was,
                    entirely from the material carried in the ship. The sketch (fig. 40)</p>

                    crossed; the blocks are not shown. In a long ship the operation would be easier.
                    When a fore-yard has to bo got across from the deck, time and trouble can be
                    saved by letting go, half at a time, all the fore-rigging and back-stays which
                    are on that side.</p>
                <p>When feeling the way into harbour during a thick fog, let a boat pretend to tow
                    the ship with the deep-sea lead-line; by this means a margin of 100 fathoms of
                    safety will be secured. Care should be taken that every running rope in the ship
                    be slacked previous to rain or heavy dew.</p>
