                    ropes. In the first experiments for impelling vessels by sails the least
                    complicated form, that of a single square sail erected on a single mast, was no
                    doubt adopted. To the quadrangular the triangular sail would soon be added; and
                    single sails of both these forms are known to have been used at very early
                    periods. Subsequently the trapeziform and trapezoidal sails also came into use.
                    As vessels increased in size, thereby requiring a greater surface of canvas to
                    impel them, it became necessary to use not only more sails but also an increased
                    number of masts; and the number and disposition of the several kinds of sails
                    could be almost indefinitely varied according to the ideas of navigators, the
                    services required of the vessels, the places in which they were employed, and
                    the size of the crews. Thus a great variety of rig naturally arose. Leaving out
                    of account the many nondescript styles adopted in the case of boats and small
                    craft, all modern vessels may, for general purposes, be considered as belonging
                    to one or other of the following categories—cutter, schooner, three-masted
                    schooner, brigantine, brig, barquetine, barque, or full square-rigged ship; but
                    the cardinal distinction is that by which they are classified as <hi
                    rend="italic">square-rigged</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fore-and-aft-rigged</hi>
                    (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Seamanship</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ship).</hi> These expressions can be easily explained by reference to any
                    three-masted ship. The mast nearest the bow or head is known as the fore-mast,
                    the next abaft or nearest the middle of the ship as the main-mast, and the third
                    or that nearest the stern as the mizzen-mast. Each mast consists of several
                    sections, that attached to the hull being called the lower or standing-mast, the
                    next above that the top-mast, the next the topgallant-mast, above which may rise
                    a pole or royal-mast. On each of these masts, and at right angles with it, is a
                    yard denominated “square,” which is hung (slung) by the middle and balanced.
                    These yards are named according to their situation, those placed on the fore and
                    main standing-masts being called respectively the fore and main lower-yards,
                    that on the mizzen the cross-jack-yard; the yards on the top-masts are called
                    the top-sail-yards, those on the top-gallant-masts the top-gallant-yards, and
                    those on the royal-masts the royal-yards. To each of these yards a sail is <hi
                    rend="italic">bent</hi> or attached, taking its name from the yard; thus the
                    principal sail upon the fore-lower-yard is called the fore-course or fore-sail;
                    the next above, upon the fore-top-sail-yard, is the fore-top-sail; above which,
                    upon the fore-top-gallant-yard, is the fore-top-gallant-sail; and above all,
                    upon the fore-royal-yard, is the fore-royal. In like manner on the main-mast we
                    have the main-course or main-sail, main-top-sail, main-top-gallant-sail, and the
                    main-royal. Similar appellations are given to those on the mizzen-mast; in large
                    merchant-ships, by means of a sky-sail-pole, a sail termed “sky-scraper” is
                    sometimes set above the royals, but not so frequently as formerly. Such square
                    sails can be placed at right angles to the direction of the keel of the ship, a
                    position given to them when going before the wind; the same sails can also, by
                    means of braces, be placed obliquely to the keel with a side wind, commonly
                    termed by seamen “on a wind” or “by the wind.” In addition to these there are
                    sails between the masts, set either on gaffs (unbalanced) or on stays, also
                    others beyond the extremities of the ship, extended principally by means of the
                    bowsprit, which, in addition to supporting the fore-mast by a stay, also
                    supports the jib and flying-jib-booms for extending the sails still farther
                    forwards; the means for extending the after-sail are the driver or spanker-boom
                    and the gaff. Sails extended or set on gaffs and on stays are called
                    “fore-and-aft,” and are generally or approximately in a vertical plane passing
                    through the keel; but a certain degree of obliquity can be given them by easing
                    off the sheet or aft lower corner of the sail. A ship fitted as above described
                    would be termed “square-rigged,” the square sails predominating both in
                    importance and in number. A square-rigged lineof-battle ship would be supplied
                    with the following descriptions of sails<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Some ships (merchant-liners) have two jibs, inner and outer,
                    and <pb corresp="kp-eb0921-0171-0154" xml:id="pbn9154"/> their top-sails also in
                    two parts, upper and lower or cap-top-sails, an arrangement which makes it
                    easier to reduce or shorten sail; they also have a mizzen course (cross-jack),
                    and carry several light stay-sails so as to catch every breath of
                    wind.</p></note>:—</p>

                <p>To the casual observer sails when spread and in use appear merely as so many
                    large pieces of cloth; but some of them are of very considerable size: it is not
                    at all unusual in full square-rigged ships for a main-course or main-sail to
                    contain 1000 yards of canvas (24 inches wide), and a main-top-sail nearly as
                    much,—the single suit for such a vessel comprising upwards of 10,000 yards.
                    Courses and top-sails are made reducible; in the British navy they are reduced
                    by means of reefs (two in courses, four in top-sails), each fitted with
                    spilling, slab, and reef lines and becket, and toggles on the yard (reef-points
                    throughout being now obsolete). In the merchant service double top-sails—upper
                    and lower—are much in use on account of handiness in reducing sail; there is
                    also “patent reefing gear,” such as Cunningham’s, which allows reefing to be
                    done as much as possible from deck. The dimensions of masts and yards, quantity
                    of canvas or area of sail, centre of gravity of each sail (from which the moment
                    of sail is obtained and compared with the moment of stability), centre of effort
                    of the sails, and other important calculations necessary in relation to the body
                    of the vessel are made by constructors and naval architects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sailcloth</hi> is obtainable from any description of fibrous
                    material capable of being woven into cloth, having sufficient compactness and
                    closeness of texture, and possessing the requisite strength for sustaining the
                    heavy pressure which sails often have to bear in severe weather. Several
                    descriptions of fibre might be enumerated which would to a certain extent serve
                    for sailcloth but for the absence of quality of endurance or resistance; hemp
                    has been and is now occasionally used, as also a mixture of cotton and linen
                    yarn, or cotton only,—especially in America; but in the United Kingdom <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Flax</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> is the usual staple
                    material, since, when well manufactured, it possesses the qualities of
                    flexibility and lightness, and, what is still more important, the element of
                    strength in a very large degree.</p>
                <p>The following points may be regarded as of primary importance for securing
                    sailcloth or canvas of a superior quality and durability. Whatever flax is used,
                    it is absolutely necessary that the “warp” and “weft” of the canvas be spun
                    wholly from the “longs,” be free from blacks and any mixture of short flax, well
                    dressed or heckled, and that the yarn be well and evenly spun and properly
                    twisted. Both warp and weft yarn should be twice boiled with the best American
                    pot and pearl ashes, and carefully and thoroughly washed and cleansed. No acid
                    chloride of lime or other preparation of chlorine, nor any deleterious
                    substance, should be used in any stage of the process, otherwise the integrity
                    of the fibre will most probably be interfered with; the only advantage got is
                    that the cloth looks much whiter, which for yachts and pleasure-boats is perhaps
                    desirable, but for naval and mercantile uses is not at all necessary. The yarns
                    are first boiled a sufficient length of time in a solution of the best American
                    potash, in fixed proportions of ashes, green yarn, and water, then mill-washed
                    (beating process), and subsequently carefully washed in a considerable stream of
                    clear running water, and wrung. They are again boiled for a sufficient length of
                    time in a solution of American pearl ashes, in due proportions of ashes, green
                    yarn, and water, then carefully rinsed, or washed in a clear stream of water,
                    carefully dried, and frequently shaken in the course of drying, so that the
                    fibres of the flax may be equally stretched. These repeated boilings, &amp;c.,
                    have the effect of cleansing, bleaching, softening, and removing all vegetable
                    impurities which may be hanging about; no starch, tallow, paste, or weaver’s
                    dressing of any description should be used, otherwise the fabric will tend to
                    mildew if allowed to remain damp for any time. Sailcloth is made in bolts,
                    mostly 24 inches wide, but also 18 inches wide, and for yachting purposes
                    frequently still less wide, upon the ground that the narrower the cloth the
                    flatter and better will the sail stand to its work. It is generally made of
                    eight different qualities in respect of thickness, numbered 1 to 8 accordingly;
                    the heavier numbers—Nos. 1, 2, and 3—are used for storm and other sails that
                    have to do heavy work, the remaining numbers for the lighter descriptions of
                    sail. The weight of each bolt of canvas 24 inches wide, from Nos. 1 to 6
                    inclusive for 39 yards in length and for Nos. 7 and 8 for 40 yards in length, is
                    about as follows, viz., No. 1, 46 lb; No. 2, 43; No. 3, 40; No. 4, 36; No. 5,
                    33; No. 6, 30; No. 7, 27; No. 8, 25 lb. The weight of each bolt of narrower
                    canvas is in proportion. The warp (or lengthwise) should consist of the
                    following proportions of clean unstarched yarn, viz.:—</p>

                <p>As a rule about 40 yards in length may be considered as the average content of
                    each bolt. Particular attention should be paid to the weaving, that the texture
                    be struck sufficiently close, and the selvages be evenly and well manufactured;
                    what is termed a slack selvage (that is, one selvage longer than the other) is
                    not only awkward for the sailmaker but unsatisfactory both in wear and
                    appearance, the slack side showing itself puckered. Sailcloth made upon these
                    conditions is very likely to be a good article; tests, however, can be applied,
                    generally to strips 1 inch wide from Nos. 1 to 6 inclusive, and 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1/</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> inch wide from Nos. 7
                    and 8. Weft and warp (24 inches in length) in each case are placed in a small
                    testing machine, which has a dial plate with a spring underneath; vices are
                    attached to grip the strips, one vice to the spring, the other in connexion with
                    a long screw’ with a handle; by turning this handle the vices are drawn asunder
                    until the strip breaks, and the hands on the dial-plate indicate the strain in
                    pounds. The following is a fair test of strength for the various numbers of good

                <p>It is not at all unusual, however, to find some sailcloth stand a strain
                    considerably in excess of this. Freedom from blacks, twist and spun of the yarn,
                    stiffening, calendering, &amp;c., can be discovered by observation and a
                    magnifying glass, excessive dressing by a little tincture of iodine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sailmaking</hi> is a very old branch of industry in connexion
                    with the navy and commerce, and it still continues to be important
                    notwithstanding the enormous extent to which steam is now employed in
                    navigation.</p>
                <p>The operations of the sailmaker may be stated as follows. The dimensions of mast
                    and yards and sail plan being supplied, the master sailmaker is enabled to
                    determine the dimensions of each sail—after due allowance for stretching—in
                    terms of cloths and depth in yards—if a square sail, the number of cloths in the
                    head, number in the foot, and the depth in yards; if a fore-and-aft sail
                    (triangular), the number of cloths in the foot, and the depth in yards of the
                    luff or stay and of leech or after-leech; if a fore-and-aft sail (trapezium
                    form), the number of cloths in the head, number in foot, and the depth of mast
                    or luff and of after-leech. These particulars obtained, there is got out what is
                    technically termed a “casting,” which simply means the shape, length, &amp;c.,
                    of each individual cloth in the sail. These figures are given to the cutter, who
                    proceeds to cut out the sail cloth by cloth in consecutive order, numbering them
                    1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.; the series of cloths thus cut out are handed over to the
                    workman, who joins them together by carefully made double flat seams, sewn with
                    twine specially prepared for the purpose, with about 120 stitches in a yard. In
                    the heavy sails the seam is about an inch and a half in width and in the British
                    navy stuck or stitched in the middle of the seam to give additional strength;
                    the seams in the lighter sails are about an inch wide. The whole of the cloths
                    are then brought together, and spread out, and the tabling (or hemming, so to
                    speak) is turned in and finished off with about 72 stitches to a yard.
                    Strengthening pieces or “linings” are affixed where considered necessary, in
                    courses and top-sails such pieces as reef-bands, middle-bands, foot-bands,
                    leech-linings, bunt-line cloths; in top-sails (only) a top-lining or brim; in
                    other and lighter sails such pieces as mast-lining clew and head, tack, and
                    corner pieces; holes, such as head, reef, stay (luff), mast, cringle, bunt-line,
                    &amp;c., are also made where required, a grommet of line of suitable size being
                    worked in them to prevent their being cut through. The next thing to be done is
                    to secure the edges of the sail,—an important operation, as much depends upon
                    this whether the sail will stand well and do its work efficiently. Bolt-rope, a
                    comparatively soft laid rope made from the finer hemp yarn (Italian) is used for
                    this purpose; in the British navy it ranges from 1 inch (increasing in size by
                    quarter inches) up to 8 inches inclusive, the size selected for each part of a
                    sail being determined by the amount of strain it will have to bear; it is then
                    neatly sewn on with roping twine specially prepared, the needle and twine
                    passing between and clear of every two strands of the rope in roping. Where
                    slack sail has to be taken in, it is the practice to leave it to the judgment of
                    the sail<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n172/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0172-0155"/> maker; but where possible it is better to set up
                    the rope by means of a tackle to a strain approximate to what it will have to
                    bear when in use, and whilst on the stretch mark it off in yards, as also the
                    edge of the sail in yards, so that by bringing the marks together in roping the
                    sail will stand flat. In the British navy the largest size of rope sewn on to a
                    sail is 6 inches; sizes above this are used for foot and clew ropes of top-sails
                    and courses, being first wormed, parcelled (that is, wound round with strips of
                    worn canvas), tarred, and served over with spun yarn; the foot of the sail is
                    then secured to it by being marled in. Where two sizes of bolt-rope used in
                    roping a sail have to be connected, it is effected by a tapered splice. Cringles
                    (similar to the handle of a maund) formed by a strand of bolt-rope, mostly
                    having a galvanized iron thimble in them as a protection, are then stuck where
                    necessary, as at the corners, sides or leeches, mast or luff; they are required
                    either for making stationary or hauling “taut” by tackle or otherwise certain
                    parts of the sail when in use. Fore-and-aft sails, such as spankers, gaff-sails,
                    and storm try-sails, are reduced in size by reef-points made of stout line (4 to
                    20 lb), crow-footed in the middle, a hole being pierced through every seam;
                    one-half of the point is passed through and the crowfoot sewn firmly to the
                    sail; the number of reefs depends upon the size of the sail, and the reefs are
                    placed parallel to the foot. The sails—now finished in respect of making—have to
                    be fitted, that is, such ropes have to be attached to each of them as are
                    necessary for proper use; such ropes may be summarily stated as follows
                    :—head-earings, robands, reef-ear-ings, reef-lines, spilling and slab lines,
                    reef-tackle pendant, reef-points, bow-line bridles, bunt-line toggles,
                    bunt-becket, leech-line strops and toggles, toggles in clews, sheet ropes,
                    down-haul, lacings, head and stay, tack-rope (gaff top-sail), tack lashing,
                    bending strops, matting, and gaskets.</p>
                <p>The tools and appliances of a sailmaker are not very numerous :— a bench about 7
                    feet long and 15 inches high, upon which he sits to perforin the greater part of
                    his work; palms for seaming and roping to fit the hand, made of hide lined with
                    leather, a plate properly tempered being fixed in it having chambers to catch
                    the head of the needle, thus acting as a thimble in forcing it through the
                    several parts of canvas in seaming, and between the strands and through the
                    canvas in roping; needles of various sizes, that for seaming being the smallest;
                    and fids, splicing, serving, and stretching knife, rubber, sail-liook, bobbin
                    for twine, and sundry small articles. (E. JE.)</p>
