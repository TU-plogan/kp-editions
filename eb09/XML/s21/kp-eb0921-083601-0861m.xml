                    practical acquaintance with the shorthand systems of Greece and Rome faded
                    completely away, and not till the beginning of the 17th can the art be said to
                    have revived. But even during that interval systems of writing seem to have been
                    practised which for speed approximated to modern shorthand.<note anchored="true"

                    England was the birthplace of modern shorthand, and at the present time there is
                    no country in Europe, except perhaps Germany and German Switzerland, where the
                    art is so extensively practised as in England. The first impulse to its
                    cultivation may possibly be traced to the Reformation. When the principles of
                    that movement were being promulgated from the pulpit, a desire to preserve the
                    discourses of the preacher naturally suggested the idea of accelerated writing.
                    It is certainly striking that in the early systems so many brief arbitrary signs
                    are provided to denote phrases common in the New Testament and Protestant
                    theology. Up to the present time (1886) not less than 483 professedly distinct
                    systems of English shorthand have been published, and doubtless many more have
                    been invented for private use. It is impossible here to notice even by name more
                    than a very few of them. Indeed, if we reject all those systems which are
                    imitations or reproductions of earlier ones, and systems which are so
                    unpractical as to be little better than elegant toys, and a multitude of utterly
                    worthless catchpenny publications, only a few remain. In Dr Timothy
                    Bright’s<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Bodleian
                    Library contains the only known copy of Bright’s book. For a description of the
                    system, see <hi rend="italic">Phonetic Journal,</hi> 1884, p. 86; <hi

                    line, the other letters of the alphabet by a straight line with a hook, circle,
                    or tick added at the beginning. Each alphabetic sign placed in various
                    positions, and having some additional mark at the end, was used to indicate
                    arbitrarily chosen words beginning with <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d,</hi>
                    &amp;c. There were four slopes given to each letter and twelve ways of varying
                    the base, so that forty-eight words could be written under each letter of the
                    alphabet if necessary. Thus the sign for <hi rend="italic">b</hi> with different
                    terminal marks and written in four different directions signified a number of
                    words commencing with <hi rend="italic">b</hi>; 537 such signs had to be learned
                    by heart. By adding certain external marks these signs were applied to other
                    words: thus by writing a dot in one of two positions with respect to a sign the
                    latter was made to represent either a synonym or a word of opposite meaning.

                    appropriate situations, so as to distinguish the words from each other. For an

                    unremitting labour could one acquire a practical knowledge of such methods. The
                    first shorthand system worthy of the name which, so far as is known, appeared in
                    England is that of John Willis, whose <hi rend="italic">Art of Stenographie</hi>

                    from 1602 to</p>
                <p>1644) is substantially based on the common alphabet; but the clumsiness of his
                    alphabetic signs, and the confused laborious contrivances by which he denotes
                    prefixes and terminations, involving the continual lifting of the pen, would
                    seem to render his method almost as slow as longhand. Of the 201 systems which
                    intervene between J. Willis’s and Isaac Pitman’s phonography (1837) nearly all
                    are based, like Willis’s, on the alphabet, and may be called a, b, c systems.
                    But seven are, like phonography, strictly phonetic, viz., those by Tiffin
                    (1750), Lyle (1762), Holdsworth and Aldridge (1766), Roe (1802), Phineas Bailey
                    (1819), Towndrow (1831), and De Stains (1839). Of the 281 systems which have
                    appeared since phonography a very large proportion are merely imitations of that
                    system, or proceed on the same lines.</p>
                <p>A few general remarks apply largely to all the a, b, c systems. Each letter is
                    designated by a straight line or curve (vertical, horizontal, or sloping),
                    sometimes with the addition of a hook or loop. <hi rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> are rejected, <hi rend="italic">k</hi> being substituted
                    for hard <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q, s</hi> for soft <hi
                    rend="italic">c.</hi> Signs are provided for <hi rend="italic">ch, sh, th.
                    G</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j</hi> are classed under one sign, because in some
                    words <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is pronounced as <hi rend="italic">j,</hi> as in
                    <hi rend="italic">giant, gem.</hi> Similarly each of the pairs f, <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, <hi rend="italic">z</hi> has
                    only one sign. A few authors make the signs for <hi rend="italic">j</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">v, z</hi> heavier than those for <hi rend="italic">g, f, s.</hi>
                    Some class <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b, t</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> each under one sign. The stenographic alphabet is
                    therefore— <hi rend="italic">a, b, d,</hi><hi rend="italic">e, f (v), g (j), h,
                    i, k, l, m, n, o, p,r, s (z), t, u, w, x,y, ch, sh th.</hi> Letters which are
                    not sounded may be omitted. <hi rend="italic">Gh, ph</hi> may be counted as <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> in such words as <hi rend="italic">cough, Philip;</hi> but
                    the <hi rend="italic">th</hi> in <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> is never
                    distinguished from the <hi rend="italic">th</hi> in <hi rend="italic">them.</hi>
                    Thus the a, b, c systems are largely phonetic with respect to consonant-sounds;
                    it is rather with regard to the vowels that they disregard the phonetic
                    principle. No attempt is made to provide adequately for the many vowel-sounds of
                    the language. Thus the signs for <hi rend="italic">like</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">lick,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">rate</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >rat,</hi> &amp;c., are the same. In the case of vowel-sounds denoted by two
                    letters, that vowel is to be written which best represents the sound. Thus in
                    <hi rend="italic">meat</hi> the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is selected, but in <hi
                    rend="italic">great</hi> the <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> In some a, b, c systems,
                    including the best of them (Taylor’s), a dot placed anywhere does duty for all
                    the vowels. This practice is, of course, a fruitful source of error, for <hi
                    rend="italic">pauper</hi> and <hi rend="italic">paper, gas</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">goose,</hi> and hundreds of other pairs of words would according
                    to this plan be written alike. In the early systems of Willis and his imitators
                    the vowels are mostly written either by joined characters or by lifting the pen
                    and writing the next consonant in a certain position with respect to the
                    preceding one. Both these plans are bad; for lifting the pen involves
                    expenditure of time, and vowels expressed by joined signs and not by marks
                    external to the word cannot be omitted, as is often necessary in swift writing,
                    without changing the general appearance of the word and forcing the eye and the
                    hand to accustom themselves to two sets of outlines, vocalized and unvocalized.
                    In the better a, b, c systems the alphabetic signs, besides combining to denote
                    words, may also stand alone to designate certain short common words, prefixes,
                    and suffixes. Thus in Harding’s edition of Taylor’s system the sign for <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> when written alone, denotes <hi rend="italic">do,
                    did,</hi> the prefixes <hi rend="italic">de-, des-,</hi> and the terminations
                    <hi rend="italic">-dom, -end, -ened, -ed.</hi> This is a good practice if the
                    words are well chosen and precautions taken to avoid ambiguities. Numbers of
                    symbolical signs and rough word-pictures, and even wholly arbitrary marks, are
                    employed to denote words and entire phrases. Symbolical or pictorial signs, if
                    sufficiently suggestive and not very numerous, may be effective; but the use of
                    "arbitraries” is objectionable because they are so difficult to remember. In
                    many shorthand books<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n862/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0862-0837"/> the student is recommended to form additional
                    ones for himself, and so of course make his writing illegible to others. The <hi
                    rend="italic">raison d'être</hi> of such signs is not far to seek. The proper
                    shorthand signs for many common words were so clumsy or ambiguous that this
                    method was resorted to in order to provide them with clearer and easier
                    outlines. For the purpose of verbatim reporting the student is recommended to
                    omit as a rule all vowels, and decipher his writing with the aid of the context.
                    But, when vowels are omitted, hundreds of pairs of words having the same
                    consonant skeleton (such as <hi rend="italic">minister</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">monastery, frontier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">furniture,
                    libel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">label)</hi> are written exactly alike. This is
                    one of the gravest defects of the a, b, c systems.</p>
                <p>John Willis’s system was largely imitated but hardly improved by Edmond Willis
                    (1618), T. Shelton (1620), Witt (1630), Dix (1633), Mawd (1635), and Theophilus
                    Metcalfe (1635). T. Shelton’s system, republished a great many times down to
                    1687, was the one which Samuel Pepys used in writing his diary.<note

                    inches) was engraved according to Shelton’s system by Thomas Cross. Metcalfe’s

                    of the early systems seems to have brought the art into some contempt. Thus
                    Thomas Heywood, a contemporary of Shakespeare, says in a prologue<note

                    the pen and writing the next consonant in those same three positions with
                    respect to the preceding one. Mason employed 423 symbols and arbitraries. He was
                    the first to discover the value of a small circle for <hi rend="italic">s</hi>
                    in addition to its proper alphabetic sign. Mason’s system was republished by
                    Thomas Gurney in 1740, a circumstance which has perpetuated its use to the
                    present day, for in 1737 Gurney was appointed shorthand-writer to the Old
                    Bailey, and early in the 19th century W. B. Gurney was appointed
                    shorthand-writer to both Houses of Parliament. Gurney reduced Mason’s
                    arbitraries to about a hundred, inventing a few specially suitable for
                    parliamentary reporting. The Gurneys were excellent writers of a cumbrous
                    system. Thomas Gurney’s <hi rend="italic">Brachygraphy</hi> passed through at
                    least eighteen editions, but the sale of the book has now almost ceased.</p>
                <p>In 1767 was published at Manchester a work by John Byrom, sometime fellow of
                    Trinity College, Cambridge, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Universal English
                    Shorthand,</hi> distinguished for its precision, elegance, and systematic
                    construction. Byrom had died in 1763. Having lost his fellowship by failing to
                    take orders, he made a living by teaching shorthand in London and Manchester,
                    and among his pupils were Horace Walpole, Lord Conway, Charles Wesley, Lord
                    Chesterfield, the duke of Devonshire, and Lord Camden. Shorthand, it is said,
                    procured him admission to the Royal Society. He founded a stenographic club, to
                    the proceedings of which his journal,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Byrom’s private journal and literary remains have been
                    published by the Chetham Society of Manchester. See, too, a paper by J. E.
                    Bailey in the <hi rend="italic">Phonetic Journal,</hi> 1875, pp. 109,
                    121.</p></note> written in shorthand, is largely devoted. In the strangers’
                    gallery of the House of Commons in 1728 Byrom dared to write shorthand from Sir
                    R. Walpole and others. In 1731, when called upon to give evidence before a
                    parliamentary committee, he took shorthand notes, and, complaints being made, he
                    said that if those attacks on the liberties of shorthand men went on he "must
                    have a petition from all counties where our disciples dwell, and Manchester must
                    lead the way.” Thomas Molyneux popularized the system by publishing seven cheap
                    editions between 1793 and 1825. Modifications of Byrom’s system were issued by
                    Palmer (1774), Nightingale (1811), Adams (1814), Longmans (1816), Gawtress
                    (1819), Kelly (1820), Jones (1832), and Roffe (1833). Byrom’s method received
                    the distinction of a special Act of Parliament for its protection (15 Geo. II.
                    c. 23, for twenty-one years from 24th June 1742). To secure lineality in the
                    writing and facility in consonantal joinings he provided two forms for <hi
                    rend="italic">b, h,j, ιv, x, sh, th,</hi> and three for <hi rend="italic">l, A,
                    e, i, o, u,</hi> he represented by a dot in five positions with respect to a
                    consonant. Practically it is impossible to observe more than three (beginning,
                    middle, and end). With all its merits, the system lacks rapidity, the continual
                    recurrence of the loop seriously retarding the pen.</p>
                <p>In 1786 was published <hi rend="italic">An Essay intended to establish a Standard
                    for a Universal System of Stenography,</hi> by Samuel Taylor (London). This
                    system did more than any of its predecessors to establish the art in England and
                    abroad. Equal to Byrom’s in brevity, it is simpler in construction. No letter
                    has more than one sign, except <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> which has two.
                    Considering that five vowel places about a consonant were too many, Taylor went
                    to the other extreme and expressed all the vowels alike by a dot placed in any
                    position. He directs that vowels are not to be expressed except when they sound
                    strong at the beginning and end of a word. Arbitraries he discarded altogether;
                    but Harding, who re-edited his system in 1823, introduced a few. Each letter
                    when standing alone represents two or three common short words, prefixes and
                    suffixes. But the list was badly chosen: thus <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    represents <hi rend="italic">my</hi> and <hi rend="italic">many,</hi> both of
                    them adjectives, and therefore liable to be confounded in many sentences. To
                    denote <hi rend="italic">in</hi> and <hi rend="italic">on</hi> by the same sign
                    is evidently absurd. Taylor’s system was republished again and again. The<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0863-0838"/> latest editions are those of J. H. Cooke (London,
                    1865) and A. Janes (London, 1882). In Harding’s edition (1823 and at least
                    twelve times since) the vowels are written on an improved plan, the dot in three
                    positions representing <hi rend="italic">a, e, i,</hi> and a tick in two
                    positions <hi rend="italic">o</hi>, <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> Several other
                    persons brought out Taylor’s system, in particular G. Odell, whose book was
                    re-edited or reprinted not less than sixty-four times, the later republications
                    appearing at New York. The excellence of Taylor’s method was recognized on the
                    Continent: the system came into use in France, Italy, Holland, Sweden, Germany,
                    Portugal, Roumania, Hungary, &amp;c. In England at the present day no method
                    excepting Pitman’s phonography is more popular than Taylor’s, although the
                    systems which have appeared since Taylor’s are far more numerous than those
                    which preceded it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Universal Stenography</hi> of William Mavor (1780 and nine
                    times since) is a very neat system, and differs from Taylor’s in the alphabet
                    and in a more definite method of marking the vowels. <hi rend="italic">A, e,
                    i,</hi> are indicated by commas, o, <hi rend="italic">u, y,</hi> by dots, in
                    three places with respect to a letter, namely beginning, middle, and end. Other
                    systems by J. H. Lewis (1812) and Moat (1833) are still used to a small
                    extent.</p>
                <p>The vast mass of a, b, c systems are strikingly devoid of originality, and are
                    mostly imitations of the few that have been mentioned. Nearly all may be briefly
                    described as consisting of an alphabet, a list of common words, prefixes and
                    suffixes expressed by single letters, a list of arbitrary and symbolical signs,
                    a table showing the best way of joining any two letters, a few general rules for
                    writing, and a specimen plate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Pitman’s phonography, on account of its enormous diffusion in Great Britain and
                    the colonies, and in America, its highly organized and original construction,
                    and its many inherent advantages, merits a more extended notice than has been
                    given to the systems already mentioned. In 1837 Isaac Pitman, then teacher of a
                    British school at Wotton-under-Edge and an excellent writer of Taylor’s system,
                    composed at the invitation of Samuel Bagster a short stenographic treatise of
                    his own, which Bagster published under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stenographic Sound-Hand.</hi> The price was fixed at fourpence, for the author
                    had determined to place shorthand within the reach of everybody. He had won the
                    friendship of the Bible publisher by voluntarily verifying the half a million
                    references in the <hi rend="italic">Comprehensive Bible,</hi> and Mr Bagster for
                    nine years published Mr Pitman’s shorthand books. In 1840 a second edition
                    appeared in the form of a penny plate bearing the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phonography,</hi> the principal feature of the system being that it was
                    constructed on a purely phonetic basis. The name of Bagster helped the
                    enterprise, and the author was indefatigable in spreading the knowledge of his
                    system by lectures and gratuitous teaching through the penny post, then just
                    established. In December 1841 the first number of what is now known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phonetic Journal</hi> appeared at Manchester in a lithographed
                    form. It was then called the <hi rend="italic">Phonographic Journal,</hi> and
                    subsequently in turn the <hi rend="italic">Phonotypic Journal,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phonetic News,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Phonetic
                    Journal.</hi> The chief instruction books issued by the author at the present
                    time from his press at the Phonetic Institute, Bath, are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phonographic Teacher,</hi> a little sixpenny book for beginners, of which
                    1,030,000 copies have been published; the <hi rend="italic">Manual of
                    Phonography</hi> (470th thousand), in which the art is sufficiently developed
                    for the purpose of correspondence, private memoranda, and easy reporting; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Phonographic Reporter</hi> (133d thousand). The weekly
                    circulation of the <hi rend="italic">Phonetic Journal</hi> is about 20,000
                    copies. A part of it is printed in the phonographic character from movable
                    types. The system has been warmly taken up in America, where it has been
                    republished in more or less altered forms, especially by the author’s brother
                    Benn Pitman, and by Messrs A. J. Graham, J. E. Munson, E. Longley, and Eliza B.
                    Burns. A large number of periodicals lithographed in phonography are published
                    in England and America. The <hi rend="italic">Shorthand Magazine,</hi> monthly,
                    has existed since 1864. Of standard English books printed or lithographed in
                    phonography may be mentioned, besides the Bible, New Testament, and Prayer Book,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress, The Vicar of Wakefield, Pickwick
                    Papers, Tom Brown’s School-Days,</hi> Macaulay’s <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Biographies, Gulliver’s Travels,</hi> Blackie’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Self-culture,</hi> Bacon’s <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> and a
                    long list of tales and selections. Numerous societies have been formed in all
                    English-speaking countries for the dissemination of phonography. The largest is
                    the Phonetic Society with 3350 members, who have all certificates of a knowledge
                    of the art and engage to teach through the post gratuitously. Most important
                    towns in the United Kingdom have a phonographic association. London has three.
                    Phonography has been adapted to several foreign languages, but not so
                    successfully as Gabelsberger’s German system. Mr T. A. Reed’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >French Phonography</hi> (1882) is intended only for English phonographers who
                    wish to report French speeches. Other adaptations to French are by A. J. Lawson
                    and J. R. Bruce. A society for the adaptation of phonography to Italian was
                    organized at Rome in 1883 by G. Francini, who has published his results (Rome,
                    1883, 1886). Phonography adapted to Spanish by Parody (Buenos Ayres, 1864) is
                    practised by half the stenographers employed in the senate and chamber at Buenos
                    Ayres. It has been adapted to Welsh by R. H. Morgan (Wrexham, 1876), and to
                    German by C. L. Driesslein (Chicago, 1884). Phonography is steadily driving all
                    other English systems out of the field. Mr T. A. Reed stated in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phonetic Journal,</hi> 1883, p. 62, that of the 61 writers
                    employed by the <hi rend="italic">Times, Standard, Telegraph, Morning Post,</hi>
                    and the Press Association 31 were using phonography, 18 Taylor’s, 5 Gurney’s
                    (<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Mason’s), 4 Lewis’s, and 3 other systems; of the
                    67 members composing the Institute of Shorthand Writers, chiefly practitioners
                    in the law courts, 26 were using phonography, 29 Taylor’s, 7 Gurney’s (<hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Mason’s), 3 Mavor’s, and 2 Lewis’s; while of the 80
                    members of the London Shorthand Writers’ Association, chiefly employed in
                    business offices, at least five-sixths were phonographers. According to a recent
                    (1882) history of shorthand, of 291 professional stenographers in London 134
                    used phonography, 89 Taylor’s, 35 Gurney’s, 8 Lewis’s, 8 Mavor’s, and 17 other
                    systems (Byrom’s, Graham’s, Moat’s, &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>The main features of Pitman’s system must now be described. The alphabet of
                    consonant-sounds is— <hi rend="italic">p, b; t, d; ch</hi> (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">chip), j; k, g</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">gay); f, v; th</hi>
                    (as in <hi rend="italic">thing), dh</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">them); s,z∙,
                    sh, zh</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">vision); m, n, ng</hi> (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">thing); l, r; w, y, h.</hi> The sounds <hi rend="italic">p, t, ch,
                    k</hi> are represented respectively by the four straight strokes</p>
                <p>∖l∕-; and the corresponding voiced sounds <hi rend="italic">b, d, j, g</hi> by
                    exactly the same signs respectively written heavy. <hi rend="italic">F, th</hi>
                    (as in <hi rend="italic">thing), s,</hi><hi rend="italic">sh</hi> are indicated
                    by 0 respectively; the same signs written heavy and tapering to the ends are
                    used for <hi rend="italic">v, dh, z, zh</hi> respectively. <hi rend="italic">M,
                    n, l, r</hi> are denoted by &lt;-x×—A respectively. <hi rend="italic">R</hi> is
                    also represented by written upwards and in a more slanting direction than the
                    sign for <hi rend="italic">ch.</hi> The signs for <hi rend="italic">sh</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">l</hi> may be written up or down when in combination, but
                    standing alone <hi rend="italic">sh</hi> is written downwards and <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> upwards. The signs for <hi rend="italic">w, y, h</hi> are
                    all written upwards. <hi rend="italic">H</hi> has also 7 down. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ng, mp</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">mb), rch</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">rj),
                    lr,</hi> are represented by the signs for <hi rend="italic">n, m, r, l</hi>
                    respectively written heavy. Signs are provided for the Scotch guttural <hi
                    rend="italic">ch</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">loch),</hi> the Welsh <hi
                    rend="italic">U</hi>, and the French nasal <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">S</hi> is generally written by a small circle. The long-vowel
                    sounds are thus classified— <hi rend="italic">â</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >balm), ē</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">bait), ec</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic"

                    they are written light. Signs similarly placed are provided for the diphthongs
                    <hi rend="italic">oi</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">boil), ōă</hi> or <hi

                    only two, one at each end in the direction of the curve. Hooks applied to a
                    straight line indicate the addition of <hi rend="italic">r, l, n,</hi> and <hi

                    the commencement of a curve signifies the addition of <hi rend="italic">l</hi>,

                    devices in the whole history of shorthand. The halving of a light stroke—that
                    is, writing it half length—implies the addition of <hi rend="italic">t</hi>; the
                    halving of a heavy stroke that of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the vowel placed
                    after (or under) the halved stroke being read between the consonant and the
                    added <hi rend="italic">t</hi> or <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> thus— ) <hi

                    brief signs are provided for hosts of syllables ending in <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and for a number of verbal forms ending in
                    <hi rend="italic">ed,</hi> thus — '~ <hi rend="superscript"> tx</hi> 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">ended.</hi> The halving of a heavy stroke may, if necessary, add

                    thus— <hi rend="italic">beautify.</hi> By combining the hook, the circle, and
                    the halving principle, two or three together, exceedingly brief signs are
                    obtained for a number of consonantal series consisting of the combination of a
                    consonant with one or more of the sounds <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Z</hi>, <hi rend="italic">n, f, t,</hi>

                    frnd,</hi> &amp;c. As a vowel-mark cannot conveniently be placed to a hook or
                    circle, we are easily led to a way of distinguishing in outline between such
                    words as Γ^° <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> and i V <hi rend="subscript">
                    t</hi><hi rend="italic">coffee, ∖ pen</hi> and ∖i×. <hi rend="italic">penny,

                    &amp;c. This distinction limits the number of possible readings of an
                    unvocalized outline. A large hook at the end of a stroke indicates the addition
                    of <hi rend="italic">-shon</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">in fashion, action,</hi>
                    &amp;c.). This hook easily combines with the circle 5, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >actions, ∖</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 5</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >positions.</hi> The circle <hi rend="italic">s</hi> made large indicates <hi
                    rend="italic">ss</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sz,</hi> as in ∖j <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">pieces, (P losses.</hi> The vowel
                    between <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (z) may be marked
                    inside the circle, as in <hi rend="italic">exercise, %G&gt; subsistence.</hi>
                    The circle <hi rend="italic">s</hi> lengthened to a loop signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">st,</hi> as in sZ&lt;ψ, <hi rend="superscript"> x</hi> ≤ <hi
                    rend="italic">post,</hi> while a longer loop indicates <hi rend="italic"
                    >str,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">muster, minster.</hi> The loop may be
                    continued through the consonantal stroke and terminate in a circle to denote <hi
                    rend="italic">sts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">strs,</hi> as in V&gt; <hi
                    rend="italic">boasts, minsters.</hi> The loop written on the left or lower side
                    of a straight stroke implies the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> hook and so signifies
                    <hi rend="italic">nst,</hi> as in ⅛= <hi rend="italic">against,</hi> J <hi
                    rend="italic">danced.</hi> A curve (or a straight stroke with a final hook)
                    written double length implies the addition of <hi rend="italic">tr, dr,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">thr,</hi> as in ∖ <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">father, f'" letter, ^*</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    d</hi><hi rend="italic">kinder, fender,</hi><hi rend="italic">render.</hi> This
                    practice is quite safe in the case of curves, but a straight stroke should not
                    be lengthened in this way when there is danger of reading it as a double letter.
                    The lineal consonant-signs may stand alone to represent certain short and common
                    words as in many of the old a, b, c systems, with this difference, that in the
                    old systems each letter represents several words, but in phonography, in almost
                    every case, only one. By writing the horizontal strokes in two positions with
                    respect to the line (above and on) and the others in three positions (entirely
                    above, resting on, and passing through the line) the number is nearly trebled,
                    and very brief signs are obtained for some seventy or eighty common short words
                    (e.g., <hi rend="italic">be, by, in, if, at, it, my, me,</hi> &amp;c. ). A few
                    very common monosyllables are represented by their vowel-marks, as . <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi> (remnant of C). <hi rend="italic">of</hi> (remnant of <hi
                    rend="italic">), on</hi> (remnant of ).</p>
                <p>A certain number of longer words which occur frequently are contracted, generally
                    by omitting the latter part, sometimes a middle part of the word, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">% {ksp) expect,</hi> L (<hi rend="italic">djr) danger,</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> c d-</hi> (⅛i∙⅛ (<hi rend="italic">krk sk) characteristic,
                    (nd f t) indefatigable.</hi> The connective phrase <hi rend="italic">of the</hi>
                    is intimated by writing the words between which it occurs near to each other.
                    <hi rend="italic">The</hi> is often expressed by a short slanting stroke or tick
                    joined to the preceding word and generally struck downwards, thus <hi
                    rend="italic">in the, for the.</hi></p>
                <p>Three principles which remain to be noticed are of such importance and advantage
                    that any one of them would go far to place phonography at the head of all other
                    systems. These are the principles of positional writing, similar outlines, and
                    phraseography. (1) The first slanting stroke of a word can generally be written
                    so as either to lie entirely above the line, or rest on the line, or run through
                    the line, thus—2≥∣,∖∣ , In the case of words composed wholly of horizontal
                    strokes the last two positions</p>
                <p>(on and through the line) coincide, as . These three positions are called first,
                    second, and third respectively. The first is specially connected with
                    first-place vowels (<hi rend="italic">ā, ă; aw, ŏ; î; oi),</hi> the second with
                    second-place vowels (<hi rend="italic">ē, ĕ; ō, ŭ</hi>), and the third with
                    third-place vowels <hi rend="italic">(ee, ĭ; ōō, ŏŏ; ou).</hi> In a fully
                    vocalized style position is not employed, but in the reporting style it is of
                    the greatest use. Thus the outline <hi rend="italic">(tm)</hi> written above the
                    line (<hi rend="underline">L—.</hi>) must be read either <hi rend="italic"
                    >time</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tom;</hi> when written resting on the line (l^)
                    <hi rend="italic">tome</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tame;</hi> when struck through
                    the line ((__) <hi rend="italic">teem,</hi><hi rend="italic">team,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">tomb.</hi> By this method the number of possible readings of an
                    unvocalized outline is greatly reduced. That word in each positional group which
                    occurs the most frequently need not be vocalized, but the others should. In the
                    case of dissyllables it is the accented vowel which decides the position; thus
                    <hi rend="italic">methoúght</hi> should be written first position (.7ΞL ), m <hi
                    rend="italic">éthod</hi> second position(<hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> ~7').
                    (2) Another way of distinguishing between words having the same consonants but
                    different vowels is to vary the outline. The possibility of variety of outline
                    arises from the fact that many consonant-sounds have duplicate or even
                    triplicate signs, as we have seen. For instance, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> has
                    two lineal signs and a hook sign, and so each of the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >carter, curator, creature,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">creator</hi> obtains a
                    distinct outline. A few simple rules direct the student to a proper choice of
                    outline, but some difference of practice obtains among phonographers in this
                    respect. Lists of outlines for words having the same consonants are given in the
                    instruction books; the <hi rend="italic">Reporter's Assistant</hi> contains the
                    outline of every word written with not more than three strokes, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phonographic Dictionary</hi> gives the vocalized outline of every
                    word in the language. Aided by a true phonetic representation of sounds, by
                    occasional vocalization, variety of outline, and the context, the phonographic
                    verbatim reporter should never misread a word.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phonography is so legible that the experiment
                    of handing the shorthand notes to phonographic compositors has often been tried
                    with complete success. A speech of Richard Cobden, on the Corn Laws, delivered
                    at Bath on 17th September 1845, and occupying an hour and a quarter, was
                    reported almost verbatim, and the notes, with a few vowels filled in, handed to
                    the compositors of the <hi rend="italic">Bath Journal,</hi> who set them up with
                    the usual accuracy. A notice of the occurrence appeared the next day in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bath Journal,</hi> and was immediately transferred to the columns
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and other newspapers. Mr. Reed has tried the
                    same experiment with equal success, the notes being handed to the compositors in
                    their original state <hi rend="italic">(Phonetic Journal,</hi> 1884, p. 337). In
                    Mr Pitman’s printing-office at Bath more type-setting is done from shorthand
                    copy than from longhand. Of course it is generally unadvisable to print a speech
                    verbatim, but much time would be saved if the reporter could write his copy in
                    the “corresponding" or less brief and more vocalized style of phonography.
                    Compositors could acquire the faculty of reading phonography in a very short
                    time.</p></note> (3) Lastly, phraseography. It has been found that in numberless
                    cases two or more words may be written without lifting the pen. A judicious use
                    of this practice promotes legibility, and the saving of time is very
                    considerable. Words written thus should be closely connected in sense and
                    awkward joinings avoided. Such phrases are <hi rend="italic">I am, I have, you
                    are,</hi> rv~v <hi rend="italic">you may, [&gt; it would, it would not,
                    &lt;s''''we are, we have, c×∖^we have not, have never been,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">my dear friends, Ύ in a very short time,</hi> X <hi rend="italic"
                    >as far as possible, f"}'-t^for the most part,</hi> and many thousands of
                    others.</p>
                <p>For the sake of obtaining a good phraseogram for a common phrase, it is often
                    advisable to omit some part of the consonant outline. Thus the phrase <hi
                    rend="italic">you must recollect that</hi> may very well be written <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">(you mus recollec that).</hi>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0865-0840"/> Of the numerous systems published since the
                    invention of phonography the principal are A. M. Bell’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stenophonography (</hi> Edinburgh, 1852), Professor J. D. Everett’s (London,
                    1877), Pocknell’s <hi rend="italic">Legible Shorthand</hi> (London, 1881), and
                    J. M. Sloan’s adaptation of the French system of Duployé (1882). Of these
                    Professor Everett’s must be pronounced much the best. The author claims to have
                    adhered to the phonetic principle more strictly than Mr Pitman. Thus he
                    distinguishes the <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in <hi rend="italic">home, comb,</hi>
                    from that in <hi rend="italic">so,</hi> and treats <hi rend="italic">ur, er</hi>
                    as a diphthong. The alphabet is very like Mr Pitman’s in construction, light and
                    heavy sounds being represented by light and heavy strokes. The chief feature of
                    the system is that all vowels are marked in. This is done by joined signs, by
                    lengthening the preceding consonant, by separating the preceding from the
                    following consonant, by lifting the pen and writing the one consonant attached
                    to the other, and by intersection. Mr Pocknell, in his somewhat bewildering
                    system, seeks (like Mr Melville Bell) to provide a method of indicating whether
                    a consonant is preceded or followed by a vowel or vowels. To this end he gives
                    to each consonant three linear signs (two curves and a straight line), the
                    requisite number of signs being made up by using three lengths of stroke. The
                    selection of the right sign is determined by the <hi rend="italic">length</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">class</hi> of the words represented. Much energy is
                    devoted to indicate where a vowel stands, but not to what it is. The vowels,
                    when expressed, are disjoined, as in phonography and most systems. Though Mr
                    Bell’s too elaborate classification of vowels is adopted, the phonetic method of
                    representing consonants is frequently discarded in favour of the alphabetic.
                    Thus, no sign is provided for <hi rend="italic">zh</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >vision),</hi> and the barbarous <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">bright)</hi> is often retained “for the sake of legibility.” Mr
                    Pocknell goes back to the antiquated device of pictorial and arbitrary signs.
                    The Sloan-Duployan system has been vigorously propagated; but it does not
                    provide alphabetic characters for all the vowels and consonants in the language,
                    contents itself with representing not actual but “approximate” sounds, does not
                    always indicate the order in which the characters should be read, recommends the
                    frequent omission of consonants and syllables at the “discretion” of the
                    student, avoids angles, and introduces three slopes, instead of one, between the
                    perpendicular and the horizontal, and therefore is not likely to meet with
                    general acceptance.</p>
                <p>A considerable number of American systems, as well as systems based on Taylor’s
                    and Gurney’s, were issued during the early days of the republic. Since the
                    introduction of phonography into the States in 1845, the dissemination of the
                    art has gone steadily forward, and its use since 1880 has been greatly on the
                    increase, shorthand being now taught in a large number of schools. From
                    elaborate statistics given in Mr Rockwell’s <hi rend="italic">Circular of
                    Information</hi> it appears that during 1882 10,197 persons received instruction
                    in schools and classes and 2273 by correspondence. But these figures probably
                    bear no proportion to the number of persons studying without a teacher. In
                    almost every case phonography, or a modification of it, was selected for
                    instruction. American shorthand societies are very numerous, most of them having
                    been formed since 1880. Two are devoted to the Stolzean system. Of the fourteen
                    shorthand magazines which Mr Rockwell enumerates eleven are phonographic.</p>
                <p>In nine cases out of ten phonography will be found admirably adapted to the
                    purposes of verbatim reporting. But to be legible it must be written with care.
                    This necessity arises from its brevity and its use of light and heavy, halved
                    and double-length strokes. Hence a clumsy scribe may find a longer system, such
                    as Gurney’s, answer his purpose better. A theoretical knowledge of most systems
                    may be gained in a few hours. Pitman’s method is not so easily acquired, but an
                    intelligent person can master its details in a few weeks. Shorthand writing is,
                    however, mainly a matter of practice. Few can make any considerable use of it
                    with less than six months’ assiduous practice. The average rate of public
                    speaking is very slightly over 120 words a minute. Some speakers average 150.
                    The slowest utterance is now and then exchanged for a rapid flow of words, and
                    180 or 200 words a minute is no uncommon speed in certain styles of speech such
                    as the conversational,—a speed which many persons would never acquire.<note

                    a minute. The best method of practice in the early period is to write at
                    dictation from a book; in public speaking the frequent pauses help the writer to
                    regain lost time. The student should write on ruled paper, which checks the
                    tendency to a large sprawling hand when following a rapid speaker. Taylor’s,
                    Gurney’s, and Lewis’s systems can be written without lines, but Pitman’s only at
                    a disadvantage. Ink is preferable to pencil.</p>
                <p>Shorthand was first employed officially in the service of Parliament in 1802,
                    when a resolution was passed that “the evidence given before all committees
                    inquiring into the election of members should or might be reported by a person
                    well skilled in the art of writing shorthand,” and shortly afterwards W. B.
                    Gurney was appointed shorthand-writer in this capacity to both Houses of
                    Parliament. In 1813 a further resolution was passed by both Houses that the
                    official writer "should attend by himself or sufficient deputy when called upon
                    to take minutes of evidence at the bar of this House or in committees of the
                    same.” The lucrative office of shorthand-writer to both Houses of Parliament is
                    still held by the Gurney family. Of course most of the work is done by deputy.
                    Some of the most efficient members of Messrs Gurney’s staff are phono-graphers;
                    others use Taylor’s system. The amount of evidence given in the course of a
                    tolerably long day’s sitting may amount to 400 or 500 folios (72 words make a
                    folio), which would occupy from 12 to 15 columns of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Times</hi> in small type. The whole must often be transcribed and delivered to
                    the printers in the course of the night, and copies, damp from the press, are in
                    the hands of the members and "parties” at the beginning of the sitting on the
                    following day. Since parliament abolished election-committees and committed to
                    judges the duty of inquiring into petitions against the return of a member, an
                    official shorthand writer has to be in attendance upon the judge appointed to
                    hear any particular case. He has often a small staff of assistants. Messrs
                    Gurney or their representatives are also required to attend the sittings of the
                    House of Lords as a court of appeal to take the judgments of the law lords.
                    Finally, Government shorthand-writers are often employed in taking notes of
                    important state-trials and inquiries conducted by the various departments of
                    Government, as well as of the proceedings of Royal Commissions, whenever the
                    evidence of witnesses is taken.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    British Parliament (as in most other countries), and technically no person has a

                    including representatives of the press, by an order of the House as a whole. On
                    seven occasions of note resolutions have been passed prohibiting the reporting
                    of the proceedings of the House of Commons, the last on 25th March 1771. But
                    times have changed, and members now frequently complain that their speeches are
                    not reported. To supply the deficiencies of the newspapers arrangements have
                    been made by the House with Mr Hansard for the special reporting of debates in
                    committee and those occurring at an early hour in the morning, which are given
                    only in the most summary form in the daily papers. Formerly all Hansard’s
                    reports were collected from those appearing in the newspapers. See further Mr S.

                    >German.—</hi> C. A. Ramsay’s <hi rend="italic">Tacheographia</hi> (Frankfort,
                    1679, and several times afterwards until 1743) was an adaptation of T. Shelton’s
                    English system. Mosengeil (1797) first practically introduced short hand writing
                    into Germany in an adaptation of the Taylor-Bertin method. Reischl's (1808) is a
                    modification of Mosengeil's. On Horstig’s (1797) are based those of an anonymous
                    writer (Nuremberg, 1798), Heim (1820), Thon (1825), an anonymous author
                    (Tübingen, 1830), Nowack (1830), Ineichen (1831), an anonymous author (Munich,
                    1831), and Binder (1855). Mosengeil published a second system (1819) in which
                    Horstig’s alphabet is used. On the Mosengeil-Horstig system are based Berthold’s
                    (1819) and Stark’s (1822). On Danzer’s (1800), a close imitation of Taylor’s, is
                    based that of Ellison v. Nidlef (1820). Other systems are those of Leichtlen
                    (1819); J. Brede (1827); Nowack (1834), a system in which the ellipse is
                    employed as well as the circle; Billharz (1838); Cämmerer (1848), a modification
                    of Selwyn’s phonography (1847); Schmitt (1850); Fischbäck (1857), a reproduction
                    of Taylor’s; and that of an anonymous author (1872), based on Horstig,
                    Mosengeil, and Heim. Nowack, in his later method of 1834, makes a new departure
                    in avoiding right or obtuse angles, and in endeavouring to approximate to
                    ordinary writing. This system Gabelsberger considered to be the best which had
                    appeared down to that date. F. X. Gabelsberger’s <hi rend="italic">Anleitung zur
                    deutsche Redezeichenkunst</hi> (Munich, 1834) is the most important of the
                    German systems. The author, an official attached to the Bavarian ministry,
                    commenced his system for private purposes, but was induced to perfect it on
                    account of the summoning of a parliament for Bavaria in 1819. Submitted to
                    public examination in 1829, it was pronounced satisfactory, the report stating
                    that pupils taught on this system executed their trial specimens with the
                    required speed, and read what they had written, and even what others had
                    written, with ease and certainty. The method is based on modifications of
                    geometrical forms, designed to suit the position of the hand in ordinary
                    writing. The author considered that a system composed of simple geometrical
                    strokes forming determinate angles with each other was unadapted to rapid
                    writing. He does not recognize all the varieties of sound, and makes some
                    distinctions which are merely orthographical. Soft sounds have small, light, and
                    round signs, while the hard sounds have large, heavy, and straight signs. The
                    signs too are derived from the current alphabet, so that one can find the former
                    contained in the latter. Vowels standing between consonants are not literally
                    inserted, but symbolically indicated by either position or shape of the
                    surrounding consonants, without however leaving the straight writing line. The
                    proceedings of the chambers in Austria, Bavaria, Baden, Wurtemberg, Saxony,
                    Saxe-Weimar, Coburg-Gotha, Silesia, and the Rhine provinces are reported solely
                    by writers of this method, and half the stenographers in the German reichstag
                    use it. There are in Germany and Austria more than 540 societies containing over
                    20,000 members devoted to it. It is officially taught in all the middle class
                    schools of Bavaria, Saxony, and Austria. It has been adapted to foreign
                    languages to such an extent that legislative proceedings are reported by it in
                    Prague, Agram, Pesth, Sophia, Athens, Copenhagen, Christiania, Stockholm, and
                    Helsingfors. On Gabelsberger’s system is based that of W. Stolze (1840). There
                    are nearly 400 Stolzean associations with over 8000 members. The system is
                    officially used in the Prussian, German, and Hungarian parliaments, in the last
                    two along with Gabelsberger’s. Faulmann (Vienna, 1875) attempted in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Phonographie</hi> to combine the two methods. While Gabelsberger’s
                    system has remained unchanged in principle, Stolze's has split into two
                    divisions, the old and the new. These contain many smaller factions, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Velten’s (1876) and Adler’s (1877). Arends’s (1860) is
                    copied from the French system of Fayet. Roller’s (1874) and Lehmann’s (1875) are
                    offshoots of Arends’s. Many other methods have appeared and as rapidly been
                    forgotten. The schools of Gabelsberger and Stolze can boast of a very extensive
                    shorthand literature. Gabelsberger’s system has been adapted to English by A.
                    Geiger (Dresden, 1860 and 1873), who adhered too closely to the German original,
                    and more successfully by H. Richter (London, 1886), and Stolze’s by G. Michaelis
                    (Berlin, 1863).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">French.—</hi> The earliest French system worthy of notice is
                    that of Coulon de Thévenot (1777), in which the vowels are disjoined from the
                    consonants. The methods practised at the present day may be divided into two
                    classes, those derived from Taylor’s English system, translated in 1791 by T. P.
                    Bertin, and those invented in France. The latter are (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                    Coulon de Thévenot’s; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) systems founded on the
                    principle of the inclination of the usual writing,—the best known being those of
                    Fayet (1832) and Sénocq (1842); and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) systems derived
                    from the method of Conen de Prépéan (5 editions from 1813 to 1833). Prévost, who
                    till 1870 directed the stenographic service of the senate, produced the best
                    modification of Taylor. Many authors have copied and spoilt this system of
                    Prévost. The best known are Plantier (1844) and Tondeur (1849). Zeibig thinks
                    well of A. Delaunay’s improvements on Prévost’s system. On Conen’s are based
                    those of Aimé-Paris (1822), Cadrès-Marmet (1828), Potel (1842), the Duployé
                    brothers (1868), Guénin, &amp;c. Among amateur writers the Duployan method is
                    best known, owing largely to vigorous pushing, but the profession class it among
                    the least efficient of all. Of the forty writers in the official service of

                    (all based ultimately on Taylor’s), while ten employ methods based on

                <p><hi rend="italic">Spanish.—</hi> The father of Spanish stenography was Don
                    Francisco de Paula Marti, whose system, first published in 1803, still holds its
                    ground against all rivals. The alphabet is a combination of Taylor’s and
                    Coulon’s. By decree of 21st November 1802 a public professorship of shorthand
                    was founded in Madrid, Marti being the first professor. Founded on Marti’s
                    system are those of Serra y Ginesta (1816) and Xamarillo (1811). Of the
                    thirty-two Spanish systems enumerated by Zeibig many are merely imitations or
                    reproductions of Marti’s, and adaptations of Gabelsberger’s, Stolze’s, and
                    Pitman’s systems. That of Garriga y Marii (1863) has attained some popularity in
                    Spain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Portuguese.—</hi> Marti’s son carried his father’s system to
                    Portugal, where shorthand is still entirely unknown except in the parliament and
                    the courts. Of the twenty reporters in the senate and chamber at Buenos Ayres
                    ten use Pitman’s phonography, six Marti’s, and the rest Garriga’s. A shorthand
                    society was organized in Buenos Ayres in 1880. The systems used in the Brazilian
                    chambers are those of Silva Velho (1852) and Garriga. The reporters in the
                    assembly of Venezuela use Marti’s method.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Italian.—</hi> Italian translations and adaptations of Taylor’s
                    system succeeded one another in considerable numbers from Amanti (1809) to
                    Bianchini (1871). Delpino’s (1819) is the best. The Gabelsberger-Noe system
                    (1863) is the only other which has gained many followers. Since 1885 the debates
                    of the senate have been partly reported by the Michela stenographic machine with
                    fair results.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dutch.—</hi> J. Reijncr’s Dutch method (1673) was an adaptation
                    of Shelton’s and Bussuijt’s (1814) of Conen’s system. Sommerhausen and Bossaert
                    (1829) received prizes from the Government for their productions. The twelve
                    stenographers employed in the parliament use the system of Cornells Steger
                    (1867), president of the bureau, who translated Taylor’s work and has written a
                    history of shorthand. Gabelsberger’s system was transferred to Dutch by Rietstap
                    (1869) and Stolze’s by Reinbold (1881).</p>
                <p>Adaptations of Gabelsberger’s method have come into use in the remaining
                    countries of Europe, superseding all others.</p>
                <p>Numerous mechanical reporting machines have been invented. The best is by Michela
                    mentioned above. For a description of such machines see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phonetic Journal</hi> for 1881, p. 274; 1884, pp. 12, 34, 35; 1885, pp. 52,
                    268, 278, 291, 447; 1886, p. 22. They take as long to learn as a shorthand
                    system, cannot easily be carried about, are liable to get out of order, and make
                    a noise.</p>
