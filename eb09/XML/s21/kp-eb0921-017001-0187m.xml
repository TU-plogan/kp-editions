                <p><label type="entry">ST GERMAIN-EN-LAYE</label>, a town of France, in the
                    department of Seine-et-Oise, 8 miles north of Versailles and 13 west of Paris by
                    rail. Built on a hill on the left bank of the Seine, nearly 200 feet above the
                    river, and on the edge of a forest 10,000 to 11,000 acres in extent, St Germain
                    has a healthy and bracing air, which makes it a favourite place of summer
                    residence with the Parisians. It had 15,545 inhabitants in 1881 (15,790 in the
                    commune). The terrace of St Germain, constructed by Lenôtre in 1672, is 7900
                    feet long and 100 feet wide, is planted with lime trees upwards of a hundred
                    years old, and affords an extensive view over the valley of the Seine as far as
                    Paris and the surrounding hills; hence it ranks as one of the finest promenades
                    in Europe. It was also after Lenôtre’s plans that the “parterre” promenade was
                    laid out between the castle and the forest and the “English garden” (by which it
                    is approached). The history of St Germain centres in the castle, now occupied by
                    a museum of national antiquities.</p>
                <p>A monastery in honour of St Germain, bishop of Paris, was built in the forest of
                    Laye by King Robert. Louis VI. erected a castle close by. Burned by the English,
                    rebuilt by Louis IX., and again by Charles V., this castle did not reach its
                    full development till the time of Francis I., who may be almost regarded as the
                    real founder of the building. A new castle was erected by Henry II.; but it was
                    demolished by the count of Artois, and there remains only the so-called Henry
                    IV. pavilion, now used as an hotel, and known as the place where Thiers died, 3d
                    September 1877. The old castle, on the contrary, is being completely restored to
                    the state in which it was under Francis I. The chapel, dating from 1240, is
                    older than the Sainte Chapelle at Paris, and is worthy of note for its rose and
                    other windows. The museum, which will occupy forty rooms, contains a
                    chronological series of artistic and industrial products from the earliest
                    prehistoric times. In the church of St Germain is a mausoleum erected by Queen
                    Victoria to the memory of James II. of England, who found in the old castle (now
                    demolished) an asylum after the Revolution of 1688. In one of the public squares
                    is a statue of Thiers. The town is the seat of one of the cavalry garrisons
                    which surround Paris. At no great distance in the forest is the Couvent des
                    Loges, a branch of the educational establishment of the Legion of Honour (St
                    Denis). The fête des Loges is one of the most popular in the neighbourhood of
                    Paris. Henry II., Charles IX., and Margaret of Navarre were born at St Germain,
                    as well as Louis XIV., who is said to have removed from this place to Versailles
                    to get away from the sight of the clock-tower of St Denis, the church where he
                    was to be buried.</p>
