                <p><label type="entry">SHUYA</label>, one of the chief centres of the cotton
                    industry in middle Russia, is a district town in the government of Vladimir, 68
                    miles north-east of the town of Vladimir. A branch railway connects it with the
                    Novki station of the railway from Moscow to Nijni-Novgorod. The town is built on
                    the high left bank of the navigable Teza, a tributary of the Klazma, with two
                    suburbs on the right bank. Annalists mention princes of Shuya in 1403. Its first
                    linen manufactures were established in 1755; but in 1800 its population did not
                    exceed 1500. Its growth began only with the development of the cotton industry
                    in central Russia, and since then has been rapid; in 1882 it had 19,560
                    inhabitants, as against 10,440 in 1870. Of these about 10,000 live by the
                    manufactures, and only a few keep to agriculture and gardening. In 1881 the
                    output of twelve cotton-mills was valued at £442,160 for various cotton stuffs
                    and £48,000 for cotton yarn. Tanneries, especially for the preparation of
                    sheep-skins—widely renowned throughout Russia—still maintain their importance,
                    although this industry has migrated to a great extent to the country districts.
                    The products of its manufactories are chiefly sent to Moscow and Nijni-Novgorod.
                    The town is mainly built of wood. Its cathedral (1799) is a large building, with
                    five gilt cupolas. Shuya has also two gymnasia, for boys and girls, besides a
                    progymnasium for girls, and several secondary and primary schools.</p>
                <p>The surrounding district is also important for its manufactures. The village of
                    Ivanovo-Voznesensk, north of Shuya, with a population of more than 19,000
                    inhabitants, employed 11,329 workmen in its 39 manufactories in 1881, and showed
                    a return of £1,939,950 (£1,700,000 for cottons and the remainder for chemicals
                    and machinery). Teikovo and Kokhma are two other centres of manufacture, —the
                    whole production of the manufactories within the district (exclusive of Shuya
                    and Ivanovo) being estimated at £630,000. These figures, of course, do not
                    include any statistics of the petty trades carried on side by side with
                    agriculture. Nearly every village has a specialty of its own,—bricks, pottery
                    (Menschikovo), wheels, toys packing-boxes, looms and other weaving implements,
                    house furniture, sieves, combs, boots, gloves, felt goods, candles, and so on
                    The manufacture of linen and cotton in villages, as well as the preparation and
                    manufacture of sheepskins and rough gloves, occupies about 40,000 peasants. The
                    Shuya merchants carry on an active trade in these products all over Russia, and
                    in corn, spirits, salt, and other food stuffs, which are imported to a great
                    extent. In 1880 the imported goods reached 1,613,000 cwts. (1,208,000 by rail),
                    and the exports 1,318,000 cwts., chiefly by the Teza.</p>
