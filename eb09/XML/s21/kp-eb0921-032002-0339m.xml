                <p><label type="entry">SATURN</label>, an ancient Italian god, whom the Romans, and
                    till recently the moderns, identified with the Greek god Cronus.</p>
                <p>1. Cronus was the youngest of the Titans, the children of Sky (Uranus) and Earth
                    (Gaea). Besides the Titans, Sky and Earth had other children, the Cyclopes and
                    the Hundred-handers. When the Cyclopes and the Hundred-handers proved
                    troublesome, Sky thrust them back into<pb break="no"

                    called on her sons to avenge her on their father Sky. They all shrank from the
                    deed save Cronus, who waylaid and mutilated his father with a sickle or curved
                    sword. From the drops of blood which fell to the earth sprang the Furies and the
                    Giants. Cronus now reigned in room of Sky. His wife was Rhea, who was also his
                    sister, being a daughter of Sky and Earth. Sky and Earth had foretold to Cronus
                    that he would be deposed by one of his own children, so he swallowed them one
                    after another as soon as they were born. Thus he devoured Hestia, Demeter, Hera,
                    Hades, and Poseidon. But when Rhea had brought forth Zeus, the youngest,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So Hesiod. But according to
                    Homer Zeus was the eldest of the children of Cronus and Rhea.</p></note> she
                    wrapped up a stone in swaddling clothes and gave it to Cronus, who swallowed it
                    instead of the babe. When Zeus, who had been hidden in Crete, grew up, he gave
                    his father a dose which compelled him to disgorge first the stone and then the
                    children whom he had swallowed. The stone was preserved at Delphi; every day it
                    was anointed and on festivals it was crowned with wool. Zeus and his brothers
                    now rebelled against Cronus, and after a ten years’ struggle they were
                    victorious. Cronus and the Titans were thrust down to Tartarus, where they were
                    guarded by the Hundred-handers. According to others, Cronus was removed to the
                    Islands of the Blest, where he ruled over the departed heroes, judging them in
                    conjunction with Rhadamanthus. Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(De Def. Orac.,</hi>
                    18) mentions a story that the dethroned monarch of the gods slept on an island
                    of the northern seas guarded by Briareus and surrounded by a train of attendant
                    divinities. The reign of Cronus was supposed to have been the happiest time of
                    the world, the golden age, when men lived like gods, free from toil and grief
                    and the weakness of old age (for death was like sleep); and the earth too
                    brought forth abundantly without cultivation. There are few traces of the
                    worship of Cronus in Greece. Pausanias, in his description of Greece, mentions
                    only one temple of Cronus; it stood at the foot of the Acropolis at Athens and
                    was sacred to Cronus and Rhea jointly. The Athenians celebrated an annual
                    festival in his honour on the 12th of Hecatombaeon. A mountain at Olympia was
                    called after him, and on its top annual sacrifices were offered to him at the
                    spring equinox.</p>
                <p>The idea that Cronus was the god of time—an idea which appears in antiquity—seems
                    to have arisen from a simple confusion between the words Cronus and Chronus
                    (“time”). Curtius derives Cronus from the root <hi rend="italic">kra,</hi>
                    meaning “to accomplish.” Cronus may perhaps have been a god of some aboriginal
                    half-savage tribe which the Greeks conquered. Hence the savage traits in his
                    legend, his conquest by Zeus, and the scanty traces of his worship in Greece.
                    The myth of the mutilation of Sky by Cronus may be a particular form of the
                    widespread story of the violent separation of Sky and Earth by one of their
                    children (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Mythology).</hi> other forms of this myth
                    are found in New Zealand, India, and China. Parallels to the swallowing and
                    disgorging incident are to be found in the folk-lore of Bushmen, Kaffres,
                    Basutos, Indians of Guiana, and Eskimo.</p>
                <p>2. Saturn and his wife Ops were amongst the oldest deities of ancient Italy. He
                    is said to have had an altar at the foot of the Capitol before Rome was founded.
                    Saturn was a god of agriculture, his name being derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >severe,</hi> “to sow.” The identification of Saturn with Cronus gave rise to
                    the legend that after his deposition by Zeus (Jupiter) Saturn wandered to Italy,
                    where he ruled as king in the golden age and gave the name Saturnia to the
                    country. Janus, another of the most ancient gods of Italy, is said to have
                    welcomed him to Rome, and here he settled at the foot of the Capitol, which was
                    called after him the Saturnian Hill. His temple stood at the ascent from the
                    Forum to the Capitol and was one of the oldest buildings in Rome, but the eight
                    remaining columns of the temple probably formed a portion of a new temple built
                    in the imperial times. The image of Saturn in this temple had woollen bands
                    fastened round its feet all the year through, except at the festival of the
                    Saturnalia; the object of the bands was probably to detain the deity. Similarly
                    there was a fettered image of Enyalius (the War God) at Sparta, and at Athens
                    the image of Victory had no wings, lest she might fly away. The mode of
                    sacrifice at this temple was in so far peculiar that the head of the sacrifice
                    was bare as in the Greek ritual, instead of being covered, as was the usual
                    Roman practice. Legend said that the Greek ritual was introduced by Hercules,
                    who at the same time abolished the human sacrifices previously offered to
                    Saturn. Others said that the rule had been observed by the Pelasgians before.
                    Under or behind the temple was the Roman treasury, in which the archives as well
                    as the treasures of the state were preserved. Dionysius Halicarnensis <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ant. Porn.,</hi> i. 34) tells that there were many sanctuaries of
                    Saturn in Italy and that many towns and places, especially mountains, were
                    called after him. The oldest national form of verse was known as the Saturnian.
                    Like many other figures in Roman mythology, Saturn is said to have vanished at
                    last from earth. His emblem was a sickle. The substitution of a great scythe for
                    the sickle, and the addition of wings and an hour-glass, are modern. Ops
                    (“plenty ”), wife of Saturn, was an earth-goddess, as appears from the custom
                    observed by her suppliants of sitting and carefully touching the earth while
                    they made their vows to her. As goddess of crops and the harvest she was called
                    Consiva, and under this name had a sanctuary at Rome, to which only the Vestals
                    and the priest were admitted. As Saturn was identified in later times with
                    Cronus, so was Ops with Rhea. Another goddess mentioned as wife of Saturn was
                    Lua, a goddess of barrenness. She was one of the deities to whom after a victory
                    the spoils of the enemy were sometimes dedicated and burned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Saturnalia.—</hi> This, the great festival of Saturn, was
                    celebrated on the 19th, but after Caesar’s reform of the calendar on the 17th,
                    of December. Augustus decreed that the 17th should be sacred to Saturn and the
                    19th to Ops. Henceforward it appears that the 17th and 18th were devoted to the
                    Saturnalia, and the 19th and 20th to the Opalia, a festival of Ops. Caligula
                    added a fifth day, “the day of youth” <hi rend="italic">(dies juvenalis),</hi>
                    devoted no doubt to the sports of the young. But in popular usage the festival
                    lasted seven days. The time was one of general joy and mirth. The woollen
                    fetters were taken from the feet of the image of Saturn, and each man offered a
                    pig. During the festival schools were closed; no war was declared or battle
                    fought; no punishment was inflicted. In place of the toga an undress garment was
                    worn. Distinctions of rank were laid aside: slaves sat at table with their
                    masters or were actually waited on by them, and the utmost freedom of speech was
                    allowed them. Gambling with dice, at other times illegal, was now permitted and
                    practised.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is curious
                    to find a similar rule with a similar exception in Nepal. See H. A. Oldfield,
                    <hi rend="italic">Sketches from Nepal,</hi> vol. ii. pp. 353 <hi rend="italic"

                    and clay dolls. These dolls were especially given to children, and the makers of
                    them held a regular fair at this time. Varro thought that these dolls
                    represented original sacrifices of human beings to the infernal god. There
                    certainly was, as we have seen, a tradition that human sacrifices were once
                    offered to Saturn, and the Greeks and Romans gave the name of Cronus and Saturn
                    to a particularly cruel Phoenician Baal, to whom, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    children were sacrificed at Carthage. The Cronus to whom human sacrifices are
                    said to have been offered in Rhodes was most probably a Baal, for there are
                    unmistakable traces of Phoenician worship in Rhodes. It may be conjectured that
                    the Saturnalia was originally a celebration of the winter solstice. Hence the
                    legend that it was instituted by Romulus under the name of the Brumalia <hi
                    rend="italic">(bruma</hi> = winter solstice). The prominence given to candles at
                    the festival points to the custom of making a new fire at this time. The custom
                    of solemnly kindling fires at the summer solstice (Eve of St John) has prevailed
                    in most parts of Europe, notably in Germany, and there are traces (of which the
                    yule-log is one) of the observance of a similar custom at the winter solstice.
                    In ancient Mexico a new fire was kindled, amid great rejoicings, at the end of
                    every period of fifty-two years.</p>
