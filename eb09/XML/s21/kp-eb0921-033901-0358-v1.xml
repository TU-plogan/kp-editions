                <p><label type="entry">SAVOY</label>. The history of the house of Savoy shows in a
                    striking manner how the destinies of a nation may depend on the fortunes of a
                    princely family. During eight centuries, and through all changes of fortune, the
                    princes of Savoy have kept one end steadily in view, and, in the words of
                    Charles Emmanuel III., have “treated Italy as an artichoke to be eaten leaf by
                    leaf.” The ambitions of princes and the interests of the people have fortunately
                    tended in the same direction, and their work is now perfected in the glory of
                    their house and the freedom of the state.</p>
                <p>The descent of <hi rend="smallcaps">Humbert</hi> the Whitehanded, the founder of
                    the family, is uncertain, but he was most probably a son of Amadeus, the
                    great-grandson of that Boso of Provence (879) who was father of the emperor
                    Louis the Blind. In reward for services rendered to Rudolph III. of Arles,
                    Humbert obtained from him in 1027 the counties of Savoy and Maurienne, and from
                    the emperor Conrad the Salic Chablais and the Lower Valais. His territories,
                    therefore, all lay on the north-western slopes of the Alps. On his death in 1048
                    he was succeeded perhaps by his eldest son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> I.,
                    but eventually by his fourth son <hi rend="smallcaps">Otho</hi>, "who, by his
                    marriage with Adelaide, sole heiress of the marquis of Susa, obtained the
                    counties of Turin and the Val d’Aosta, and so acquired a footing in the valley
                    of the Po. His wife’s rank, too, as marchioness made the family guardians of the
                    frontier by authority of the king of Italy, as they had been before by
                    possession of territory, and was the foundation of their subsequent power as
                    “warders” of the Alps. Otho was succeeded in 1060 by his son <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> II., who maintained a judicious neutrality
                    between his brother-in-law the emperor Henry IV. and the pope. In reward for his
                    mediation between them he obtained from the former after Canossa the province of
                    Bugey. The accession of his son <hi rend="smallcaps">HumberT</hi> II. in 1080
                    brought fresh increase of territory in the valley of the Tarantaise, and in 1091
                    this prince succeeded to the dignities of his grandmother Adelaide, when he
                    assumed the title of prince of Piedmont. <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> III.
                    came to the throne in 1103, and in 1111 his states were created counties of the
                    empire by Henry V. On his way home from the crusades in 1149 Amadeus died at
                    Nicosia, and was succeeded by his son <hi rend="smallcaps">HumberT</hi> III.
                    This prince did not follow the example of Amadeus II., but took the part of the
                    pope against Barbarossa, who accordingly ravaged his territories until Humbert’s
                    death in 1188. The guardians of his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi> acted
                    more discreetly, and reconciled their ward and the emperor. He remained
                    Ghibelline all his life, and received from Henry VI. accessions of territory in
                    Vaud, Bugey, and Valais, with the title of imperial vicar in Piedmont and
                    Lombardy. He was followed in 1233 by <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> IV.,
                    whose wife was the beautiful Cecilia of Beaux, surnamed Passe Rose. A campaign
                    against the inhabitants of Valais ended in the annexation of their district, and
                    his support of Frederick II. against the pope caused the erection of Chablais
                    and Aosta into a duchy. In 1253 his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi>
                    succeeded to his states at the age of nine, but, after giving proofs of his
                    valour by defeating the troops of Charles of Anjou before Turin, he was taken
                    prisoner and died of grief (1263).</p>

                    Provence with Henry III. of England and Richard, earl of Cornwall, had visited
                    England, where he had been created earl of Richmond, and built a palace in
                    London afterwards called Savoy House. His brothers Boniface and William were
                    also appointed, the former to the see of Canterbury, and the latter to the
                    presidency of the council. In return he recognized the claims of Richard to the

                    the diocese of Lausanne, conveniently near to the county of Geneva, which had
                    been willed to him by the last count. But this increase of territory only
                    brought new anxieties, for Peter’s short reign was occupied in reducing
                    refractory vassals to obedience. At his death in 1268 he was succeeded by his
                    brother <hi rend="smallcaps">Philip</hi> L, who died in 1285, when their nephew
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> V. came to the throne. This prince,
                    surnamed the Great, united Baugé and Bresse to his states in right of his wife
                    Sibylla, and later on Lower Faucigny and part of Geneva. For his second wife he
                    married Mary of Brabant, sister of the emperor Henry VII., from whom, in reward
                    for his services in North Italy, he received the seigneury of Aosta. His life
                    was passed in continual and victorious warfare, and one of his last exploits was
                    to force the Turks to raise the siege of Rhodes. In commemoration of his victory
                    it is said that he substituted for the eagles in his arms the letters F.E.R.T.

                    making preparations for a campaign in aid of his nephew, the emperor of the

                    1329, was followed by his brother <hi rend="smallcaps">Aymon.</hi> This prince
                    died in 1343, when his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> VI. ascended the
                    throne. His reign was, like his grandfather’s, a series of petty wars, from
                    which he came out victorious and with extended territory, until, accompanying
                    Louis of Anjou on his expedition against Naples, he died there of the plague
                    (1383). The reign of his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> VII. promised to
                    be as glorious as those of his ancestors, but it was cut short by a fall from
                    his horse in 1391. Before his death, however, he had received the allegiance of
                    Barcelonnette, Ventimiglia, Villafranca, and Nice, so gaining access to the
                    Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>His son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> VIII. now came to the throne, under the
                    guardianship of his grandmother Bonne de Bourbon. On attaining his majority he
                    first directed his efforts to strengthening his power in the outlying provinces,
                    and in this he was particularly successful. The states of Savoy now extended
                    from the Lake of Geneva to the Mediterranean, and from the Saône to the Sesia.
                    Its prince had therefore considerable power, and Amadeus threw all the weight of
                    this on the side of the emperor. Sigismund was not ungrateful, and in 1416
                    erected the counties of Savoy and Piedmont into duchies. At this time too the
                    duke recovered the fief of Piedmont, which had been granted to Philip, prince of
                    Achaia, by Amadeus V., and his power was thus thoroughly consolidated. The
                    county of Vercelli afterwards rewarded him for joining the league against the
                    duke of Milan, but in 1434 a plot against his life made him put into execution a
                    plan he had long formed of retiring to a monastery. He accordingly made his son
                    Louis lieutenant-general of the dukedom, and assumed the habit of the knights of
                    S. Maurice, a military order he had founded at the priory of Ripaille. But he
                    was not destined to find the repose he sought. The prelates assembled at the
                    council of Basel voted the deposition of Pope Eugenius IV., and elected Amadeus
                    in his place. Felix V., as he was now called, then abdicated his dukedom
                    definitively, but without much gain in temporal honours, for the schism
                    continued until the death of Eugenius in 1447, shortly after which it was healed
                    by the honourable submission of Felix to Nicholas V. The early years of Louis’s
                    reign were under the guidance of his father, and peace and prosperity blessed
                    his people; but he afterwards made an alliance with the dauphin which brought
                    him into conflict with Charles VII. of France, though a lasting reconciliation
                    was soon effected. His son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> IX. succeeded in
                    1465, but, though his virtues led to his beatification, his bodily sufferings
                    made him assign the regency to his wife Yolande, a daughter of</p>
                <p>' Charles VII. He died in 1472, when his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Philibert</hi>
                    I. succeeded to the throne and to his share in the contests of Yolande with her
                    brother and brothers-in-law, who tried to deprive their nephew of his rights.
                    His reign lasted only ten years, when he was succeeded by his brother <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi> I. This prince raised for a time by his valour
                    the drooping fortunes of his house, but he died in 1489 at the age of
                    thirty-one, having inherited from his aunt, Charlotte of Lusignano, her
                    pretensions to the titular kingdoms of Cyprus, Jerusalem, and Armenia. He was
                    succeeded by his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi> II., an infant, who,
                    dying in 1496, was followed by <hi rend="smallcaps">Philip</hi> II., brother of
                    Amadeus IX. He died in 1497, leaving <hi rend="smallcaps">PhiliberT</hi> II.,
                    who succeeded him, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi> III., who ascended the
                    throne on his brother’s death in 1504. In spite of himself Charles was drawn
                    into the wars of the period, for in the quarrel between Francis I. and the pope
                    he could not avoid espousing the cause of his nephew. But the decisive victory
                    of Francis at Marignano gave the duke the opportunity of negotiating the
                    conference at Bologna which led to the conclusion of peace in 1516. So far well,
                    but Charles was less fortunate in the part he took in the wars between Francis
                    I. and Charles V., the brother-in-law of his wife. He tried to maintain a strict
                    neutrality, but his attendance at the emperor’s coronation at Bologna in 1530
                    was imperative in his double character of kinsman and vassal. The visit was
                    fatal to him, for he was rewarded with the county of Asti, and this so
                    displeased the French king that, on the revolt of Geneva to Protestantism in
                    1532, Francis sent help to the citizens. Bern and Freiburg did likewise, and so
                    expelled the duke from Lausanne and Vaud. Charles now sided definitely with the
                    emperor, and Francis at once raised some imaginary claims to his states. On
                    their rejection the French army marched into Savoy, and, finding the pass of
                    Susa unfortified, descended on Piedmont and seized Turin (1536). Charles V. came
                    to the aid of his ally, and invested the city, but, being himself hard pressed,
                    was obliged to make peace. France kept Savoy, and the emperor occupied Piedmont,
                    so that only Nice remained to the duke. On the resumption of hostilities in 1541
                    Piedmont again suffered. In 1544 the treaty of Crespy restored his states to
                    Charles, but the terms were not carried out and he died of grief in 1553. His
                    only surviving son <hi rend="smallcaps">Emmanuel Philibert</hi> succeeded to the
                    rights but not the domains of his ancestors. Since 1536 he had attached himself
                    to the service of the emperor, and had already given promise of a brilliant
                    career. On the abdication of Charles V; the duke was appointed governor of the
                    Low Countries, and in 1557 the victory of St Quentin marked him as one of the
                    first generals of his time. Such services could not go unrewarded, and the peace
                    of Cateau-Cambresis restored him his states, with certain exceptions still to be
                    held by France and Spain. One of the conditions of the treaty also provided for
                    the marriage of the duke with the lovely and accomplished Margaret of France,
                    sister of Henry II. The evacuation of the places held by them was faithfully
                    carried out by the contracting powers, and Emmanuel Philibert occupied himself
                    in strengthening his military and naval forces, until his death in 1580
                    prevented the execution of the ambitious designs he had conceived. His son <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Charles Emmanuel</hi> I., called the Great, being prevented
                    by Henry III. from retaking Geneva, threw in his lot with Spain, and in 1590
                    invaded Provence and was received by the citizens of Aix. His intention was
                    doubtless to revive the ancient kingdom of Arles, but his plans were frustrated
                    by the accession of Henry IV. to the throne of France. After effecting with
                    Henry an exchange of Bresse and Bugey for the marquisate of Saluzzo he kept up
                    an intermittent war with him until 1609, when, disgusted with the<pb break="no"

                    France against Philip. But he could not remain faithful for long, and, siding
                    first with one and then with the other, he found himself in almost the same
                    straits as his grandfather, when death put an end to his ambitions and failures
                    in 1630. The first care of his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor Amadeus</hi> was
                    to free himself from the double burden of his enemy and his ally, so he
                    concluded peace in 1631. In 1635, however, Richelieu determined to drive the
                    Spaniards out of Italy, and offered the duke the alternatives of war or Milan.
                    He gave but a half-hearted assent to the schemes of France, and, without gaining
                    Milan, died in 1637, leaving by his wife Christina of France Francis Hyacinth, a
                    minor, who only survived till the following year, and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Charles Emmanuel</hi> II., whose legitimacy was unfortunately rather
                    doubtful. The regency of Christina resembled that of Yolande in the same need
                    for guarding her son’s interests against the pretensions of his uncles, Louis
                    XIII. and the princes of Savoy. But fortune favoured her, and on the duke’s
                    reaching his majority in 1648 the wars of the Fronde occupied all the attention
                    of Mazarin. The brunt of the conflict with Spain consequently fell upon Savoy,
                    and was borne not ingloriously until the conclusion of peace. Charles Emmanuel
                    occupied the remaining part of his reign in repairing the ravages caused by
                    twenty-four years of warfare, and died in 1675, leaving an only son, <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Victor Amadeus</hi> II., whose minority was as peaceful as
                    his father’s had been the reverse. He married Mary of Orleans, the daughter of
                    Henrietta of England, and consequently the legitimate heiress to the English
                    crown on the death of Anne and on the exclusion of the Pretender. For a time he
                    united with Louis XIV. in persecuting the Protestants, but the overbearing
                    behaviour of his ally made him join the coalition of Augsburg in 1690. His
                    campaign against Louis was carried on with varying results until 1695, when he
                    accepted proposals of peace. This defection led to the peace of Ryswick in 1697,
                    and in reward he received from Louis the territories then occupied by France. In
                    1700 he sided with France against Austria, but, an extension of territory in the
                    Milanese not being granted by Louis, he went over to the enemy in 1703. The
                    generalship of his relative Prince Eugene proved too much for the French, and in
                    1706 they were defeated before Turin and driven across the frontier. The peace
                    of Utrecht afterwards confirmed the duke in the possession of the places granted
                    on his joining the coalition, including the long-coveted Montferrato, and
                    endowed him besides with the crown of Sicily. Austrian influences now replaced
                    Spanish in the peninsula, and Charles VI. persuaded him to exchange his kingdom
                    for that of Sardinia. This was accordingly effected in 1720 by the treaty of
                    Madrid, and afterwards proved the very salvation of the house of Savoy. In 1730
                    the king abdicated in favour of his son, in order to marry the countess of San
                    Sebastian, at whose instigation he afterwards tried to regain the crown, but he
                    died in 1732.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Emmanuel</hi> III. continued his father’s intrigues
                    to obtain possession of Milan, and joined the league of France and Spain against
                    Austria in 1732. But he used the victories of the allied forces over the
                    imperialists in such a half-hearted way that it seemed as if he did not wish to
                    break finally with Austria. In the end he only gained from the treaty, which he
                    signed in 1739, the Novarese and Tortona, instead of Milan. The death of Charles
                    VI. in 1740 gave him the chance of expelling the Austrians from Italy, but,
                    though he at first claimed Milan from Maria Theresa, he ended in 1742 by
                    espousing her cause. The complete defeat of the French in 1747 led to the treaty
                    of Aix-la-Chapelle, by which Charles Emmanuel received the Upper Novarese and
                    Vigevano, after which he remained at peace until bis death in 1773. His son <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Victor Amadeus</hi> III. succeeded him, and devoted the
                    early years of his reign to the improvement of the administration and the
                    reorganization of his army. The time soon came for him to use the weapon he had
                    created, and on the outbreak of the Revolution in France he headed the coalition
                    of Italian princes against her. The house of Savoy thus assumed the headship of
                    Italy, but for the time without much gain, for Napoleon’s brilliant victories of
                    1796 ended in the peace of Paris, by which Savoy, along with Nice, was given to
                    France. Victor Amadeus died shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by his son <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Charles Emmanuel</hi> IV. The fever of the Revolution
                    spread to Piedmont, and in 1798 nothing was left to the king but to retire to
                    Sardinia. In 1802 he abdicated in favour of his brother, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Victor Emmanuel</hi> I., who, in his island kingdom, protected by the
                    English fleet, became the symbol of the coalition against France. The king
                    returned to Turin in 1814, and in the following year took possession again of
                    Savoy. The anti-revolutionary measures which were adopted by the Italian princes
                    on their return caused a spirit of rebellion to spring up among their subjects.
                    The freedom of the individual and the unity of the nation thus came to be
                    considered objects to be attained at one and the same time. The influence of
                    Austria was paramount in the Peninsula, but an insurrection broke out at Turin
                    in 1820 demanding war with her, and, rather than embroil himself both with his
                    people and with Austria, Victor Emmanuel abdicated in favour of his brother, <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Charles Felix.</hi> The general insurrection was
                    suppressed, and for the next few years Italy suffered everything possible at the
                    hands of various petty princes, whose fears and weakness left them no weapon but
                    persecution. In 1831 Charles Felix died without issue, and in him the elder
                    branch of the family ended. He was succeeded by <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles
                        AlberT,</hi> of the line of Savoy-Carignano, which was founded by Thomas
                    Francis, son of Charles Emmanuel the Great, and grandfather of Prince Eugene.
                    The first care of Charles Albert was to reorganize his military and naval forces
                    in readiness for the conflict with Austria which he foresaw. At the same time he
                    put down the conspiracies which would have forced his hand, among which the most
                    famous was that of Mazzini and Ramorino in 1834. The French revolution of 1848
                    fanned the embers of Italian patriotism, and Charles Albert, without any aid,
                    began the War of Independence. Victory at first followed his arms, but he was
                    defeated at last by the Austrians at Custozza. In the next year he was again
                    driven into war with the Austrians, and, after his defeat at Novara, he
                    abdicated in favour of his son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor Emmanuel</hi> II.
