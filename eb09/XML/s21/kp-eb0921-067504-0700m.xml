                    intersected by pleasant little valleys and varied with woods, the buildings
                    extending partly over the hill occupied by the monastery and partly over the
                    valley below. Including the extensive Kukuevsk suburbs, it had in 1884 31,400
                    inhabitants. There are several lower-grade schools, an infirmary for old women,
                    and a school for girls. Numerous inns and hotels, some maintained by the
                    monastery and others a rich source of revenue to it, accommodate the numerous
                    pilgrims.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n701/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0701-0676"/> Serghievsk has long been renowned for its
                    manufactures of holy pictures (painted and carved), spoons, and a variety of
                    other articles carved in wood, especially toys, sold to pilgrims. Within the
                    last twenty years this industry has greatly developed; separate parts of certain
                    toys are made elsewhere and brought to Serghievsk, where no fewer than 330
                    workshops, employing 1055 hands, with an annual production valued at more than
                    £30,000, supply the finished article. Several other petty industries are carried
                    on both in the town and in the neighbouring villages.</p>
                <p>The Troitsk monastery is the most sacred place in middle Russia, the Great
                    Russians regarding it with more veneration than even the cathedrals and relics
                    of the Kremlin of Moscow. It occupies a picturesque site on the top of a hill,
                    protected on two sides by deep ravines and steep slopes. The walls, 25 to 50
                    feet in height, are fortified by nine towers, one of which, the Pyatnitsk, has
                    been for some time a prison for both civil and ecclesiastical offenders. Eleven
                    churches, including the Troitskiy (Trinity) and Uspenskiy cathedrals, a lofty
                    bell-tower, a theological academy, various buildings for monks and pilgrims, and
                    a hospital stand within the precincts, which are nearly two-thirds of a mile in
                    circuit. A small wooden church, erected by the monk Sergius, and afterwards
                    burned by the Tatars, stood on the site now occupied by the cathedral of the
                    Trinity, which was built in 1422, and contains the relics of Sergius, as well as
                    a holy picture which has frequently been brought into requisition in Russian
                    campaigns. The Uspenskiy cathedral was erected in 1585; close beside it are the
                    graves of Boris Godunoff and his family. In the southern part of the monastery
                    is the church of Sergius, beneath which are spacious rooms where 200,000 dinners
                    are distributed gratis every year to the pilgrims. The bell-tower, 290 feet
                    high, has a bell weighing 137 1/2 tons. Several monasteries of less importance
                    occur in the neighbourhood. The site now occupied by the Troitsk monastery was
                    in the 14th century covered with impenetrable forests. In 1337 two brothers,
                    Barthelemy and Stefan, sons of a Rostoff <hi rend="italic">boiar,</hi> erected a
                    church on the spot. The elder (born in 1314) took monastic orders under the name
                    of Sergius, erected cells by the church, and became widely famous among the
                    peasants around. The Moscow princes also showed great respect for the chief of
                    the new monastery. Dmitri Joannovich Donskoi received the benediction of Sergius
                    before setting out on the Tatar expedition which terminated in the victory of
                    Kulikovo, and afterwards accepted the advice and help of the monk in his
                    dealings with the prince of Ryazan. Sergius lived a life of diligence and
                    simplicity, and declined to accept the office of metropolitan of Moscow. His
                    monastery acquired great fame and became the wealthiest in middle Russia. Ivan
                    the Terrible in 1561 made it the centre of the ecclesiastical province of
                    Moscow. During the Polish invasion at the beginning of the 17th century it
                    organized the national resistance, and supplied the combatants with money and
                    food. In 1608-9 it withstood a sixteen months’ siege by the Poles; at a later
                    date the monks took a lively part in the organization of the army which crushed
                    the outbreak of the peasants. In 1683 and 1689 Peter I. took refuge here from
                    the revolted <hi rend="italic">streltzi.</hi> The theological seminary, founded
                    in 1744 and transformed in 1814 into an academy, reckons Platon and Philarete
                    among its pupils.</p>
