                    student at William and Mary College in 1805, and was admitted to the bar at
                    Richmond, Virginia, in 1807. One of the sudden war excitements of the time
                    changed the course of his life, and he obtained a captain’s commission in the
                    United States army in 1808. He served on the Niagara frontier throughout the war
                    of 1812-15, and became one of its leading figures, rising rapidly through all
                    the grades of the service to that of major-general, which was then the highest.
                    Among other curious testimonials to his valour and conduct, he received from
                    Princeton College in 1814 the honorary degree of doctor of laws, a distinction
                    on which he never ceased to look with peculiar satisfaction. In 1841 he became
                    the senior major-general of the army, and in 1855, after he had passed out of
                    political life, the exceptional grade of lieutenant-general was created for him.
                    His most noteworthy military achievement was his conduct of the main campaign
                    against Mexico in 1847. Landing (9th March) at Vera Cruz with but 5500 men, he
                    fought his way through a hostile country to the capital city of Mexico, which he
                    captured 14th September, thereby practically ending the war. His service,
                    however, was not confined to the army; from 1815 until 1861 he was the most
                    continuously prominent public man of the country, receiving and justifying every
                    mark of public confidence in his integrity, tact, and reasonableness. At a time
                    (1823) when duelling was almost an imperative duty of an officer, he resisted
                    successfully the persistent efforts of a brother officer (Andrew Jackson) to
                    force him into a combat; and the simple rectitude of his intentions was so
                    evident that he lost no ground in public estimation. In 1832, when ordered to
                    Charleston by President Jackson during the “nullification” troubles, he secured
                    every advantage for the Government, while his skilful and judicious conduct gave
                    no occasion to South Carolina for an outbreak. In like manner, in the Black Hawk
                    Indian troubles of 1832-33, in the Canadian “Patriot War” of 1837-38, in the
                    boundary dispute of 1838 between Maine and New Brunswick, in the San Juan
                    difficulty in 1859, wherever there was imminent danger of war and a strong
                    desire to keep the peace, all thoughts turned instinctively to Scott as a fit
                    instrument of an amicable settlement, and his success always justified the
                    choice. Such a career seemed a gateway to political preferment, and his position
                    was strengthened by the notorious fact that, as he was a Whig, the Democratic
                    administration had persistently tried to subordinate his claims to those of
                    officers of its own party. In 1852 his party nominated him for the presidency;
                    but, though his services had been so great and his capacity and integrity were
                    beyond question, he had other qualities which counted heavily against him. He
                    was easily betrayed into the most egregious blunders of speech and action, which
                    drew additional zest from his portly and massive form and a somewhat pompous
                    ceremoniousness of manner. He destroyed his chances of election in the North.
                    The Southern Whigs, believing him to be under the influence of the Seward or
                    anti-slavery wing of the party, cast no strong vote for him, and he was
                    overwhelmingly defeated in both sections, completing the final overthrow of his
                    party. In 1861 he remained at the head of the United States armies, in spite of
                    the secession of his State, until November, when he retired on account of old
                    age and infirmities. After travelling for a time in Europe, he published in 1864
                    his autobiography, a work which reveals the strong and weak points of his
                    character, —his integrity and complete honesty of purpose, his inclination to
                    personal vanity, his rigid precision in every point of military precedent and
                    etiquette, and his laborious affectation of an intimate acquaintance with <hi
