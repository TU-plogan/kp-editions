                    from his university the degree of D.C.L. He entered parliament as member for the
                    pocket borough of Woodstock in 1826; in 1830 he was returned for Dorchester;
                    from 1831 till February 1846 he represented the county of Dorset; and he was
                    member for Bath from 1847 till (having previously borne the courtesy title Lord
                    Ashley) he succeeded his father as earl in 1851. Although giving a general
                    support to the Conservatives, his parliamentary conduct was greatly modified by
                    his intense interest in the improvement of the social condition of the working
                    classes, his efforts in behalf of whom have made his name a household word. He
                    opposed the Reform Bill of 1832, but was a supporter of Catholic emancipation,
                    and his objection to the continuance of resistance to the abolition of the Corn
                    Laws led him to resign his seat for Dorset in 1846. In parliament his name, more
                    than any other, is associated with the factory legislation (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Factory Acts,</hi> vol. viii. p. 845). He was a lord of the
                    admiralty under Sir Robert Peel (1834-35), but on being invited to join Peel’s
                    administration in 1841 refused, having been unable to obtain Peel’s support for
                    the Ten Hours’ Bill. Chiefly by his persistent efforts a Ten Hours’ Bill was
                    carried in 1847, but its operation was impeded by legal difficulties, which were
                    only removed by successive Acts, instigated chiefly by him, until legislation
                    reached a final stage in the Factory Act of 1874. The part which he took in the
                    legislation bearing on coal mines was equally prominent. It is worthy of notice
                    that his efforts in behalf of the practical welfare of the working classes were
                    guided by his own personal knowledge of their circumstances and wants. Thus in
                    1846 he took advantage of his leisure after the resignation of his seat for
                    Dorset to explore the slums of the metropolis, and by the information he
                    obtained not only gave a new impulse to the movement for the establishment of
                    ragged schools, but was able to make it more widely beneficial. For over forty
                    years he was president of the Ragged School Union. He was also one of the
                    principal founders of reformatory and refuge unions, young men’s Christian
                    associations, and working men’s institutes. He took an active interest in
                    foreign missions, and was president of several of the most important
                    philanthropic and religious societies of London. He died 1st October 1885. By
                    his marriage to Lady Emily, daughter of the fifth Earl Cowper, he left a large
                    family, and was succeeded by his eldest son Anthony, who committed suicide
                    shortly afterwards.</p>
