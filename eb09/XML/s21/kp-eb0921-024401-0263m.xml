                    themselves as Israelites, descendants of the ten tribes, and claim to possess
                    the orthodox religion of Moses, accepting the Pentateuch and transmitting it in
                    a text which for the most part has only microscopic variations from the Torah of
                    the Jews. But they regard the Jewish temple and priesthood as schismatical, and
                    declare that the true sanctuary of God’s choice is not Zion but Mount Gerizim,
                    overhanging Shechem (John iv. 20); here they had a temple which was destroyed by
                    John Hyrcanus about 128 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c. (Jos.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ant.,</hi> xiii. 9, 1), and on the top of the mountain they still celebrate the
                    passover. The sanctity of this site they prove from their Pentateuch, reading
                    Gerizim for Ebal in Deut. xxvii. 4. With this change the chapter of Deuteronomy
                    can be interpreted with a little straining as a command to select Gerizim as the
                    legitimate sanctuary (comp. ver. 7); and accordingly in Exod. xx. and Deut. v. a
                    commandment taken from Deut. xxvii. is inserted at the close of the decalogue.
                    Thus on their reckoning the tenth commandment is the direction to build an altar
                    and do sacrifice on Gerizim,—from which of course it follows that not only the
                    temple of Zion but the earlier temple of Shiloh and the priesthood of Eli were
                    schismatical. Such at least is the express statement of the later Samaritans;
                    the older Samaritans, as they had no sacred books except the Pentateuch,
                    probably ignored the whole history between Joshua and the captivity, and so
                    escaped a great many difficulties. The contention that the Pentateuch is a law
                    given by Moses for a community worshipping on Mount Gerizim is of course
                    glaringly unhistorical. By the (unnamed) sanctuary of God’s choice the
                    Deuteronomist certainly designed the temple of Zion; and the priestly law, which
                    is throughout based on the practice of the priests of Jerusalem before the
                    captivity, was reduced to form after the exile, and was first published by Ezra
                    as the law of the rebuilt temple of Zion. The Samaritans must therefore have
                    derived their Pentateuch from the Jews after Ezra’s reforms, after 444 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi> Before that time Samaritanism cannot have existed in a
                    form at all similar to that which we know; but there must have been a community
                    ready to accept the Pentateuch. In point of fact the district of Mount Ephraim
                    was not entirely stripped of its old Hebrew population by the Assyrian
                    captivity, and the worship of Jehovah went on at the old shrines of Northern
                    Israel side by side, or even interfused, with the old heathenish rites of the
                    new settlers whom the Assyrians brought to fill up the lands desolated by war.
                    The account of the religious condition of the country given in 2 Kings xvii. 24
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> dwells only on the partial adoption of
                    Jehovah-worship by the foreigners who had come into the land, but by no means
                    implies that the foreigners constituted the whole population. Josiah extended
                    his reforms beyond the limits of Juda?a proper to Bethel and other Samaritan
                    cities (2 Kings xxiii. 19), and the narrative shows that at that date things
                    were going on at the Northern sanctuaries much as they had done in the time of
                    Amos and Hosea. To a considerable extent his efforts to make Jerusalem the
                    sanctuary of Samaria as well as of Judaea must have been successful, for in Jer.
                    xli. 5 we find fourscore men from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria making a
                    pilgrimage to “the house of Jehovah,” after the catastrophe of Zedekiah. And so
                    it is not surprising to find that the people of this district came to Zerubbabel
                    and Joshua after the restoration, claiming to be of the same religion with the
                    Jews and asking to be associated with them in the rebuilding of the temple.
                    Their overtures were rejected by the leaders of the new theocracy, who could not
                    but fear the results of interfusion with so large a mass of men of mixed blood
                    and very questionable orthodoxy; and so the Jehovah-worshippers of Samaria were
                    thrown into the ranks of “the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin” (Ezra iv.).
                    Nevertheless, down to the time of Nehemiah, the breach was not absolute; but the
                    expulsion from Jerusalem in 432 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi> of a man of
                    high-priestly family who had married a daughter of Sanballat made it so; and it
                    is more than probable, as has been explained in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Israel,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 419, that this priest is the Manasseh of Josephus,
                    who carried the Pentateuch to Shechem, and for whom the temple of Gerizim was
                    built. For, though the story in Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xi. 8) is
                    falsely dated and mixed with fable, it agrees with Neh. xiii. in too many
                    essential points to be wholly rejected, and supplies exactly what is wanted to
                    explain the existence in Shechem of a community bitterly hostile to the Jews,
                    and yet constituted in obedience to Ezra’s Pentateuch.</p>
                <p>When we consider what difficulties were met with in the introduction of
                    Pentateuchal orthodoxy even at Jerusalem, the foundation of a community of the
                    Law in the Samaritan country, among the mixed populations whom the Judaean
                    leaders did not venture to receive into fellowship, must appear a very
                    remarkable exploit. The Samaritan religion was built on the Pentateuch alone;
                    and the fact that they did not receive even those prophetic books and historical
                    narratives which originated in Northern Israel (all which have been preserved to
                    us only by the Jews) shows that, before they received the Pentateuch, their
                    Jehovah-worship was a mere affair of traditional practice, uninspired by
                    prophetic ideas and unsupported by written record of the great deeds of Jehovah
                    in time past. It can hardly in any respect have risen above the level of the
                    popular religion of North Israel as described and condemned by Hosea and Amos.
                    In Judaea the duty of conformity to the Pentateuch was enforced by appeal to the
                    prophets and to the history of the nation’s sins and chastisements, and the
                    acceptance of a vast and rigid body of ordinances was more easy because they
                    came as the consolidation and logical development of a movement that had been in
                    progress from the days of Isaiah. Among the Samaritans, on the other hand, the
                    acceptance of the Pentateuch implied a tremendous<pb break="no"

                    that they had fallen behind the Judaeans in religious matters, and the
                    opportunity of putting themselves on a par with them by securing a copy of the
                    institutes of Moses and the services of a Judaean priest would naturally be
                    grasped at. But what is remarkable is that, having got the Pentateuch, they
                    followed it with a fidelity as loyal and exact as the Jews themselves, save in
                    the one matter of the change of the sanctuary. No concessions were made to
                    heathenism or to the old lax Jehovah-worship; the text of the sacred book was
                    transmitted with as much conscientiousness as was practised by Jewish scribes in
                    the first centuries after Ezra;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This appears especially by comparison of the Samaritan
                    Pentateuch with the Septuagint. It is not of course to be wondered at that the
                    Judaean text is on the whole superior to the Samaritan, for the Samaritans had
                    no opportunity of revising their text by Judaean copies. The Samaritan character
                    is an independent development of the old Hebrew writing as it was about the time
                    when they first got the Pentateuch. This in itself is an indication that from
                    the first their text ran a separate course, and that there was no opportunity of
                    checking corruptions that had got into it by reference to different recensions.
                    In Judaea also there were important variations between MSS. down to the time of
                    the Septuagint and even later, and in many cases the Septuagint readings agree
                    with the Samaritan Pentateuch, showing an affinity between the sources of these
                    two texts. But ultimately the Jewish scribes were able to constitute or rather
                    to select an authoritative text, and whether by good luck or by judgment the
                    text they chose was on the whole one of a singularly good type. The Samaritans
                    never had opportunity to do anything of this kind.</p></note> and even from the
                    unwilling witness of their enemies the Jews we can gather that they fulfilled
                    all righteousness with scrupulous punctiliousness so far as the letter of the
                    written law was concerned, though of course they did not share in the later
                    developments of the oral law, and so were heretics in the eyes of the
                    Pharisees.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare, for

                    that they were falsely accused, it is plain that even this partisan writer did
                    not venture to represent them as indifferent to ritual orthodoxy. No doubt, in
                    addition to the legal ordinances, the Samaritans retained some ancient
                    traditional practices, as they certainly introduced some new observances. Their
                    passover, for example, has some peculiar features, one of which, viz., the
                    application of the sacrificial blood to the faces of the children, has an exact

                <p>That it was possible to establish such a community on such a soil is a remarkable
                    evidence that in that age the tendency to a legal religion was favoured by
                    general causes, not confined to Judsea alone; it must be remembered that
                    elaborate hierocracies sprang up after the fall of the old nationalities in many
                    parts of western Asia (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Priest,</hi> vol. xix. p.
                    729). At the same time it must be remembered that, as Ezra could not have
                    succeeded without Nehemiah, Manasseh had Sanballat’s civil authority to back
                    him. It is probable, too, that Josephus is right in assuming that he was
                    strengthened by a considerable secession of Judaeans, and it is not to be
                    supposed that the “Samaritans” ever embraced anything like the whole population
                    of the Samaritan country. Samaria itself was Hellenized in the time of
                    Alexander; and in Ecclus. 1. 26 the foolish people that dwell at Shechem are
                    distinguished from the inhabitants of the Samaritan hill-country in
                    general.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So all Greek

                    throve and multiplied under the discipline of the law, but at no time in their
                    history do they appear to have had the political importance that would have
                    accrued to so closely knit a religious body if it had held all the fertile
                    Samaritan district.</p>
                <p>Jews and Samaritans were separated by bitter jealousies and open feuds (Jos., <hi
                    rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xii. 4, 1), but their internal development and external
                    history ran closely parallel courses till the Jewish state took a new departure
                    under the</p>
                <p>Maccabees. The religious resemblance between the two bodies was increased by the
                    adoption of the institution of the synagogue, and from the synagogue there
                    certainly grew up a Samaritan theology and an exegetical tradition. The latter
                    is embodied in the Samaritan Targum or Aramaic version of the Pentateuch, which
                    in its present form is, according to Nöldeke’s investigations, not earlier than
                    the fourth Christian century, but in general agrees with the readings of
                    Origen’s <hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi> Σαμαρειτιόν. For the dogmatic views of the
                    Samaritans our sources are all late; they embrace hymns and other books of
                    little general interest, and mainly at least of mediaeval origin. Like the Jews,
                    too, the Samaritans had a haggada; indeed the Arabic books they still possess
                    under the name of chronicles are almost entirely haggadic fable with very little
                    admixture of true tradition. The recent date of all this literature seems to
                    show that the old Samaritans had not nearly so vigorous an intellectual life as
                    the Jews, though what life they had moved in similar lines; indeed, having no
                    sacred book but the Pentateuch, and having passed through no such national
                    revival as that of the Maccabees, they lacked two of the most potent influences
                    that shaped the development of Judaism. On the other hand, they shared with the
                    Jews the influence of a third great intellectual stimulus, that of Hellenism.
                    Samaritans as well as Jews were carried to Egypt by Ptolemy Lagi; the rivalry of
                    the two sects was continued in Alexandria (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi>
                    xii. 1, 1), and Hellenized Samaritans wrote histories and epic poems in Greek
                    with exactly the same patriotic mendacity which characterizes Jewish Hellenism
                    Of this, the oldest surviving Samaritan literature, some fragments have been
                    preserved in the remains of Alexander Polyhistor.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Under the Maccabees their relations with Judaea became very bitter, and they were
                    severely chastised by Hyrcanus, who destroyed their temple. Hostilities between
                    the two nations recurred from time to time; and in the New Testament, in
                    Josephus, and in Jewish tradition we see how deep-seated was their mutual

                    positive in calling them pure Gentiles. The groundless accusation of
                    dove-worship (which makes their religion that of the Syrian Aphrodite) arose in
                    post-Mishnic times.</p></note> But, with all this, the sects were too nearly
                    alike not to have much in common. The Roman yoke galled both in the same way;
                    the Samaritan false prophet whose movement Pilate put down with cruel slaughter
                    (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xviii. 4, 1), and probably also Simon Magus
                    and Dositheus (Orig., <hi rend="italic">Cont. Cels.,</hi> i. p. 44), are
                    parallel phenomena to the false Messiahs that arose among the Jews. The original
                    views of the Samaritans were like those of the Sadducees, and they did not
                    believe in a resurrection or a Messiah; but it was impossible for their faith to
                    survive under the cruel pressure of foreign bondage without absorbing something
                    from Jewish eschatology. And so too, in the struggle of the Jews with Vespasian,
                    perhaps also in that with Hadrian, the Samaritans forgot their old feud, and
                    took part against the Romans. They seem also to have shared in great measure in
                    the subsequent dispersion, for in later times we hear of Samaritans and
                    Samaritan synagogues not only in Egypt but in Rome, and in other parts of the

                    them as well as the Jews, and at length excluded them from the public service.
                    Under these circumstances they naturally came to be mainly traders and
                    merchants’ clerks; in Constantinople “a Samaritan” meant “a banker’s clerk.” In
                    their old homes they still remained numerous enough to make a serious
                    insurrection under Justinian (529 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> Its
                    suppression was followed by very stern decrees against the whole sect, and
                    Europe heard little more of the Samaritans till, towards the close of the 16th
                    century, Western scholars took an interest in the few congregations that still
                    remained in the East, at Cairo and Damascus as well as at Nábulus. It was found
                    that during the Middle Ages they had formed an Arabic literature of considerable
                    size but of little intrinsic worth, and had continued faithfully to preserve
                    their scriptures. Since then their numbers have been constantly on the wane, and
                    they have almost lost their old learning, which was never very considerable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Samaritan Literature.—</hi> Of this a full account is given,
                    along with a sketch of Samaritan history, in the introduction to Nutt’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Fragments of a Samaritan Targum</hi> (1874). The following list
                    confines itself to what has been printed, (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The
                    Hebrew-Sainaritan Pentateuch, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Hebrew text in
                    Samaritan recension and character, was first printed in the Paris polyglott. O11
                    the nature of this recension, see Gesenius, <hi rend="italic">De Pent. Sam.
                    origine,</hi> &amp;c <hi rend="italic">.</hi> (1815). A list of variations from
                    the Massoretic text is given by Petermann, <hi rend="italic">Hebr. Formenlehre
                    nach der Aussprache der Samaritancr</hi> (1868). <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi>
                    Targum, also in the Paris and London polyglotts, but in very corrupt form. A
                    critical edition of the whole is still lacking; the best text of part is that
                    given by Nutt from a Bodleian MS. The dialect, apart from the corruptions of the
                    text, differs little from other Palestinian Aramaic, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
                    Aramaic having been supplanted in Palestine by Arabic, an Arabic version of the
                    Pentateuch was made by Abû Sa'îd about 1100 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The
                    first three books have been edited by Kuenen (1851-54). On this version, see
                    especially De Sacy in <hi rend="italic">Mini. Acad. Inscr. et
                    Belles-Lettres,</hi> vol. xlix. (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The so-called
                    Samaritan book of Joshua is an Arabic chronicle going down to Roman times, but
                    of almost no historical use. It may date from the 13th century. Juynboll edited
                    it in 1848 from a Leyden MS.; there are other MSS. in the British Museum and in
                    Trinity College, Cambridge, (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) Another short chronicle,
                    El-Tolidoth, published by Neubauer in <hi rend="italic">Jour. As. (</hi> 1869),
                    seems to have used the Jewish <hi rend="italic">Book of Jubilees.</hi> Both (<hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) with some other sources
                    were used by—(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) The Chronicle of Abulfatḥ, written in
                    1355, and continued by later hands; edited by Vilmar (Gotha, 1865). <hi
                    rend="italic">(g)</hi> A collection of hymns was published by Gesenius <hi
                    rend="italic">(Carmina Samaritana,</hi> 1824). other liturgical pieces have been
                    published by Heidenheim. <hi rend="italic">(h)</hi> Specimens of Samaritan
                    writings on Hebrew grammar were published by Nöldeke in the <hi rend="italic"
