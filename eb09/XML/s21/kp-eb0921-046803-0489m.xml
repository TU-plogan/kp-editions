                    Yorkshire, on 5th October 1789. His father, also named William, who achieved
                    distinction as an arctic whaler, was the son of a farmer near Crompton,
                    Lancashire, where he was born on 3d May 1760. He went to sea when he was twenty
                    years of age, and became one of the most prominent and successful, as well as
                    daring, of arctic whale-fishers. In 1823 he retired with an ample competency,
                    and died in 1829. Young Scoresby made his first voyage with his father to
                    Greenland in 1800, when he was only eleven years of age. On his return, up to
                    1803, he diligently pursued his education, acquiring a very fair knowledge of
                    mathematics and navigation. From 1803 he was his father’s constant companion to
                    the whale-fishery. On 25th May 1806, as chief officer of the “Resolution,” he
                    succeeded in reaching 81° 30' N. in 19° E. long., the farthest point north
                    attained by any navigator up to that date. On his return, during the following
                    winter, Scoresby attended the natural philosophy and chemistry classes in
                    Edinburgh<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n490/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0490-0469"/> university, as he did again in 1809, when he
                    added several other subjects. In his voyage of 1807 he commenced, as in all
                    subsequent voyages he continued, the study of the meteorology and natural
                    history of the polar regions; among the earlier results are his original
                    observations on snow crystals. In 1809 Professor Jameson of Edinburgh brought
                    Scoresby’s arctic papers before the Wernerian Society of that city, of which he
                    was at once elected a member. Soon after attaining his majority, in 1811,
                    Scoresby was promoted to the command of the “Resolution,” and in the same year
                    married the daughter of a shipbroker. In 1813 he changed the “Resolution” for
                    the “Esk,” in both vessels bringing home large and profitable captures. In his
                    voyage of 1813 Scoresby ascertained that the temperature of the polar ocean is
                    warmer at considerable depths than it is on the surface. Each subsequent spring
                    found Scoresby in search of whales, and no less eagerly of fresh additions to
                    scientific knowledge. His letters of this period to Sir Joseph Banks no doubt
                    gave the first impulse to the modern search for the northwest passage. In 1819
                    he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and among other
                    papers of the year was one communicated to the Royal Society of London through
                    Sir Joseph Banks, “On the Anomaly in the Variation of the Magnetic Needle,”
                    touching upon a subject of the first scientific importance. In 1820 appeared
                    Scoresby’s <hi rend="italic">History and Description of the Arctic Regions,</hi>
                    in which he gathers up the results of his own observation, as well as those of
                    previous navigators, and which still remains a standard authority. In his voyage
                    of 1822 to Greenland, among other scientific work, Scoresby surveyed 400 miles
                    of the east coast, between 69° 30' and 72° 30' N., with so much accuracy that
                    the Government expeditions of the next year were unable to make any substantial
                    correction, although they attempted to ignore his work. This was the last of
                    Scoresby’s arctic voyages. On his return he found his wife dead, and this event,
                    acting upon his naturally pious spirit along with other influences, decided him
                    to enter the church. After two years of residence in Cambridge, he in 1825 was
                    ordained and on 17th July was appointed curate of Bass-ingby. Meantime had
                    appeared at Edinburgh, in 1823, his <hi rend="italic">Journal of a Voyage to the
                    Northern Whale-Fishery, including Researches and Discoveries on the Eastern
                    Coast of Greenland.</hi> The faithful and successful discharge of his clerical
                    duties at Bassingby, in the mariners’ chapel at Liverpool, at Exeter, and at
                    Bradford did not prevent Scoresby from taking as much interest in science as he
                    did during his whaling voyages. In 1824 the Royal Society elected him a fellow,
                    and the Paris Academy of Sciences an honorary corresponding member. From the
                    first he was an active member and official of the British Association, to which
                    he made several important contributions, one being “An Exposition of some of the
                    Laws and Phenomena of Magnetic Induction.” To the progress of terrestrial
                    magnetism especially Scoresby is recognized as having largely contributed. Of
                    the sixty papers which follow his name in the Royal Society list many are more
                    or less connected with this department of research. But his observations
                    extended into many other departments, including certain branches of optics. In
                    order to obtain additional data for his theories on magnetism he made a voyage
                    to Australia in 1856, the results of which were published in a posthumous work,—
                    <hi rend="italic">Journal of a Voyage to Australia for Magnetical Research,</hi>
                    edited by Archibald Smith (1859). He made two visits to America, in 1844 and
                    1848 <hi rend="italic">; on</hi> his return home from the latter visit he made
                    some valuable observations on the height of Atlantic waves, the results of which
                    were given to the British Association. Scoresby interested himself much in
                    social questions, especially the improvement of the condition of factory
                    operatives. He also published numerous works and papers of a religious
                    character, a list of which, as well as of his many scientific papers, is
                    appended to the <hi rend="italic">Life of William Scoresby</hi> by his nephew,
                    Dr R. E. Scoresby-Jackson (1861). In 1850 he published a work on the Franklin
                    expedition, urging the prosecution of the search for the missing ships, and
                    giving the valuable results of his own experience in arctic navigation. Scoresby
                    was twice married after the death of his first wife,—to Miss Elizabeth
                    Fitzgerald in 1828, and in 1849 to Miss Georgina Kerr. After his third marriage
                    Scoresby built a villa at Torquay, where he spent the remainder of his life, and
                    where he died, 21st March 1857. He was a man of simple but deep piety, amiable,
                    cheerful, and guileless.</p>
