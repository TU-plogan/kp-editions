                    include all those minute organisms known as Bacteria, Microphytes, Microbes,
                    &amp;c., and allied forms. These terms have been used at various times by
                    different authors with widely different meanings in detail, but it is now agreed
                    that the Schizomycetes are minute vegetable organisms devoid of chlorophyll and
                    multiplying by repeated bipartitions. They consist of single cells, which may be
                    spherical, oblong, or cylindrical in shape, or of filamentous or other
                    aggregates of such cells. True spores occur in several, but no trace whatever of
                    sexual organs exists. From their mode of growth, division, and spore-formation
                    (in part), as well as their habit of forming deliquescent, swollen cell-walls,
                    and other peculiarities, there can be no doubt of the close alliance between the
                    Schizomycetes and certain lower <hi rend="italic">Algae;</hi> whence both groups
                    have been conjoined under the name <hi rend="italic">Schizophyta.</hi> No one
                    character except the want of chlorophyll—which of course entails physiological
                    differences—separates the Schizomycetes from other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schizophyta;</hi> morphologically and phylogenetically the two groups are
                    united. From this point of view wo relegate all the so-called bacteria which
                    contain chlorophyll <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Engelmann’s <hi rend="italic"

                    assumed by the cells are shown in fig. 1; the filamentous and other aggregates
                    will be described below.</p>
                <p>Schizomycetes are ubiquitous as saprophytes in still ponds and ditches, in
                    running streams and rivers, and in the sea, and especially in drains, bogs,
                    refuse heaps, and in the soil, and wherever organic infusions are allowed to
                    stand for a short time. Any liquid (blood, urine, milk, beer, &amp;c.)
                    containing organic matter, or any solid foodstuff (meat, preserves, vegetables,
                    &amp;c.), allowed to stand exposed to the air soon swarms with bacteria, if
                    moisture is present and the temperature not abnormal. Though they occur all the
                    world over in the air and on the surface of exposed bodies, it is not to be
                    supposed that they are by any means equally distributed, and it is questionable
                    whether the bacteria suspended in the air ever exist in such enormous quantities
                    as was once believed. The evidence to hand shows that on heights and in open
                    country, especially in the north, there may be few or even no Schizomycetes
                    detected in the air, and even in towns their distribution varies greatly;
                    sometimes they appear to exist in minute clouds, as it were, with interspaces
                    devoid of any, but in laboratories and closed spaces where their cultivation has
                    been promoted the air may be considerably laden with them. Of course the
                    distribution of bodies so light and small is easily influenced by movements,
                    rain, wind, changes of temperature, &amp;c. As parasites, certain Schizomycetes
                    inhabit and prey upon the organs of men and animals in varying degrees, and the
                    conditions for their growth and distribution are then very complex. Plants
                    appear to be less subject to their attacks,—possibly, as has been suggested,
                    because the acid fluids of the higher vegetable organisms are less suited for
                    the development of Schizomycetes; nevertheless some are known to be parasitic on
                    plants. Schizomycetes exist in every part of the alimentary canal of animals,
                    except, perhaps, where acid secretions prevail; these are by no means
                    necessarily harmful, though, by destroying the teeth for instance, certain forms
                    may incidentally be the forerunners of damage which they do not directly
                    cause.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See De Bary, <hi

                <p>Little was known about these extremely minute organisms before 1860. Leeuwenhoek
                    figured <hi rend="italic">Bacteria</hi> as far back as the 17th century, and O.
                    F. Müller knew several important forms in 1773, while Ehrenberg in 1830 had
                    advanced to the commencement of a scientific separation and grouping of them,
                    and in 1838 had proposed at least sixteen species, distributing them into four
                    genera. Our modern more accurate though still fragmentary knowledge of the forms
                    of Schizomycetes, however, dates from Cohn’s brilliant researches, the chief
                    results of which were published at various periods between 1853 and 1872; Cohn’s
                    classification of the <hi rend="italic">Bacteria,</hi> published in 1872 and
                    extended in 1875, has in fact dominated the study of these organisms almost ever
                    since. He proceeded in the main on the assumption that the forms of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bacteria</hi> as met with and described by him are practically
                    constant, at any rate within limits which are not wide: observing that a minute
                    spherical <hi rend="italic">Micrococcus</hi> or a rod-like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bacillus</hi> regularly produced similar micrococci and bacilli respectively,
                    he based his classification on what may be considered the constancy of forms
                    which he called species and genera. As to the constancy of form, however, Cohn
                    maintained certain reservations which have been ignored by some of his
                    followers. The fact that Schizomycetes produce spores appears to have been
                    discovered by Cohn in 1857, though it was expressed dubiously in 1872; these
                    spores had no doubt been observed previously. In 1876, however, Cohn had seen
                    the spores germinate, and Koch, Brefeld, Pratzmowski, Van Tieghem, De Bary, and
                    others confirmed the discovery in various species.</p>
                <p>The supposed constancy of forms in Cohn’s species and genera received a violent
                    shock when Lankester in 1873 pointed out that his <hi rend="italic">Bacterium
                    rubescens</hi> (since named <hi rend="italic">Beggiatoa roseo-persicina,</hi>
                    Zopf) passes through conditions which would have been described by most
                    observers influenced by the current doctrine as so many separate “species” or
                    even “genera,”—that in fact forms known as <hi rend="italic">Bacterium,
                    Micrococcus, Bacillus, Leptothrix,</hi> &amp;c., occur as phases in one
                    life-history. Lister put forth similar ideas about the same time; and Billroth
                    came forward in 1874 with the startling view that the various “form-species” and
                    “formgenera” are only different states of one and the same organism. From that
                    time to the present the discussion as to the limits of “species” among the
                    Schizomycetes has been maintained; much extravagance has resulted, as well as
                    valuable additions to our knowledge of the forms. Klebs (1875) and Nägeli (1877)
                    upheld similar views to those suggested by Lankester; and the researches of
                    Cienkowski, Zopf, Kurth, and De Bary have rendered it clear that forms employed
                    by Cohn to define genera and species (it should be borne in mind that Cohn
                    recognized their provisional nature) occur as phases in one and the same
                    life-history. Zopf showed (1882) that minute spherical “cocci,” short rodlets
                    (“bacteria”), longer rodlets (“bacilli”), and filamentous (“leptothrix”) forms
                    as well as curved and spiral threads (“vibrio,” “spirillum”), &amp;c., occur as
                    vegetative stages in one and the same Schizomycete (cf. fig. 16). In the
                    meantime, while various observers were building up our knowledge of the
                    morphology of the Schizomycetes, others were laying the foundations of what is
                    known of the relations of these organisms to fermenta-<pb break="no"

                    “spontaneous generation” being revived by the way. When Pasteur in 1857 showed
                    that the lactic fermentation depends on the presence of an organism, it was
                    already known from the researches of Schwann (1837) and Helmholtz (1843) that
                    fermentation and putrefaction are intimately connected with the presence of
                    organisms derived from the air, and that the preservation of putrescible
                    substances depends on this principle. In 1862 Pasteur placed it beyond
                    reasonable doubt that the ammoniacal fermentation of urea is due to the action
                    of a minute Schizomycete; in 1864 this was confirmed by Van Tieghem, and in 1874
                    by Cohn, who named the organism <hi rend="italic">Micrococcus ureae,.</hi>
                    Pasteur and Cohn also pointed out that putrefaction is but a special case of
                    fermentation, and before 1872 the doctrines of Pasteur were established with
                    respect to Schizomycetes. Meanwhile two branches of inquiry had arisen, so to
                    speak, from the above. In the first place, the ancient question of “spontaneous
                    generation” received fresh impetus from the difficulty of keeping such minute
                    organisms as bacteria from reaching and developing in organic infusions; and,
                    secondly, the long-suspected analogies between the phenomena of fermentation and
                    those of certain diseases again made themselves felt, as both became better
                    understood. Needham in 1745 had declared that heated infusions of organic matter
                    were not deprived of living beings; Spallanzani (1777) had replied that more
                    careful heating and other precautions prevent the appearance of organisms in the
                    fluids. Various experiments by Schwann, Helmholtz, Schultz, Schroeder, Dusch,
                    and others led to the refutation, step by step, of the belief that the more
                    minute organisms, and particularly bacteria, arose <hi rend="italic">de
                    novo</hi> in the special cases quoted. Nevertheless, instances were adduced
                    where the most careful heating of yolk of egg, milk, hay-infusions, &amp;c., had
                    failed,—the boiled infusions, &amp;c., turning putrid and swarming with
                    Schizomycetes after a few hours.</p>
                <p>In 1862 Pasteur repeated and extended such experiments, and paved the way for a
                    complete explanation of the anomalies; Cohn in 1872 published confirmatory
                    results; and it became clear that no putrefaction can take place without
                    Schizomycetes. In the hands of Brefeld, Burdon-Sanderson, De Bary, Tyndall,
                    Roberts, Lister, and others, the various links in the chain of evidence grew
                    stronger and stronger, and every case adduced as one of “spontaneous generation”
                    fell to the ground when examined. No case of so-called “spontaneous generation”
                    has withstood rigid investigation; but the discussion contributed to more exact
                    ideas as to the ubiquity, minuteness, and high powers of resistance to physical
                    agents of the spores of Schizomycetes, and led to more exact ideas of antiseptic
                    treatments. Methods were also improved, and the application of some of them to
                    surgery at the hands of Lister, Koch, and others has yielded results of the
                    highest importance.</p>
                <p>Long before any clear ideas as to the relations of Schizomycetes to fermentation
                    and disease were possible, various thinkers at different times had suggested
                    that resemblances exist between the phenomena of certain diseases and those of
                    fermentation, and the idea that a virus or contagium might be something of the
                    nature of a minute organism capable of spreading and reproducing itself had been
                    entertained. Such vague notions began to take more definite shape as the ferment
                    theory of Cagniard-Latour (1828), Schwann (1837), and Pasteur made way,
                    especially in the hands of the last-named savant. From about 1870 onwards the
                    “germ theory of disease” has passed into acceptance. Rayer in 1850 and Davaine
                    had observed the bacilli in the blood of animals dead of anthrax (splenic
                    fever), and Pollender discovered them anew in 1855. In 1863, imbued with ideas
                    derived from Pasteur’s researches on fermentation, Davaine reinvestigated the
                    matter, and put forth the opinion that the anthrax bacilli caused the splenic
                    fever; this was proved to result from inoculation. Koch in 1876 published his
                    observations on Davaine’s bacilli, placed beyond doubt their causal relation to
                    splenic fever, discovered the spores and the saprophytic phase in the
                    life-history of the organism, and cleared up important points in the whole
                    question (figs. 10 and 11). In 1870 Pasteur had proved that a disease of
                    silkworms was due to a ferment-organism of the nature of a Schizomycete; and in
                    1871 Oertel showed that a <hi rend="italic">Micrococcus</hi> already known to
                    exist in diphtheria is intimately concerned in producing that disease. In 1872,
                    therefore, Cohn was already justified in grouping together a number of
                    “pathogenous” Schizomycetes. Thus arose the foundations of the modern “germ
                    theory of disease”; and, in the midst of the wildest conjectures and the worst
                    of logic, a nucleus of facts was won, which has since grown, and is growing
                    daily. Septicaemia, tuberculosis, glanders, fowl-cholera, relapsing fever, and a
                    few other diseases are now brought definitely within the range of biology, and
                    several other contagious and infectious diseases are known to be also due to
                    Schizomycetes.</p>
                <p>Other questions of the highest importance have arisen from the foregoing. A few
                    years ago Pasteur showed that <hi rend="italic">Bacillus anthracis</hi>
                    cultivated in chicken broth, with plenty of oxygen, and at a temperature of
                    42-43° C. lost its virulence after a few “generations,” and ceased to kill even
                    the mouse; Toussaint and Chaveau confirmed, and others have extended the
                    observations. More remarkable still, animals inoculated with such “attenuated”
                    bacilli proved to be curiously resistent to the deadly effects of subsequent
                    inoculations of the non-attenuated form. In other words, animals vaccinated with
                    the cultivated bacillus showed immunity from disease when reinoculated with the
                    deadly wild form. The questions as to the causes and nature of the changes in
                    the bacillus and in the host, as to the extent of immunity enjoyed by the
                    latter, &amp;c., are now burning,—Metschnikoff’s recent observations (1884),
                    showing that the white corpuscles eliminate the bacilli from the blood, being
                    one of the most startling contributions to the answers.</p>
                <p>Another burning question has already been in part touched upon. Experiments have
                    shown that Schizomycetes are pleomorphic; they are also very sensitive, so to
                    speak, to the influences of the environment. The investigations of Cohn,
                    Pasteur, Koch, Nägeli, Kurth, De Bary, and others leave no doubt that many
                    Schizomycetes are sensibly affected by the media in which they are cultivated:
                    not only are the forms modified, but also the physiological activity varies in
                    degree, and even in kind. These and similar facts seem to be largely responsible
                    for recent ideas as to the possibility of being able to cultivate or “educate”
                    certain Schizomycetes. One case only need be referred to. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bacillus anthracis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B. subtilis</hi> are only
                    distinguishable with great difficulty morphologically <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> figs. 10-12); the former is parasitic in its vegetative stages, the

                    Schizomycetes consist of single cells, or of filamentous or other groups of
                    cells, according as the divisions are completed at once or not. While some
                    unicellular forms are less than <hi rend="smallcaps">1</hi> μ (·001 mm.) in
                    diameter, others have cells measuring 4μ, or <hi rend="smallcaps">5</hi> μ or
                    even <hi rend="italic">7</hi> μ or <hi rend="italic">8</hi> μ in thickness,
                    while the length may vary from that of the diameter to many times that
                    measurement. In the filamentous forms the individual cells are often difficult
                    to observe until reagents are applied <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> fig. 14),
                    and the length of the rows of cylindrical cells may be many hundred times
                    greater than the breadth. Similarly, the diameters of flat or spheroidal
                    colonies may vary from a few times to many hundred times that of the individual
                    cells, the divisions of which have produced the colony. The shape of the
                    individual cell (fig. 1) varies from that of a minute sphere to that of a
                    straight, curved, or twisted filament or cylinder, which is not necessarily of
                    the same diameter throughout, and may have flattened, rounded, or even pointed
                    ends. The rule is that the cells divide in one direction only— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> transverse to the long axis—and therefore produce aggregates of long
                    cylindrical shape; but in rarer cases iso-diametric cells divide in two or three
                    directions, producing flat, or spheroidal, or irregular colonies, the size of
                    which is practically unlimited. As to the structure of the cell, little more can
                    be said than that it consists of a mass of homogeneous or very slightly granular
                    protoplasm, with a pearl-like lustre, and without vacuoles; this is enveloped by
                    a membranous envelope, which is so delicate as to be scarcely perceptible. In
                    the actively vegetating or mobile conditions this cell wall appears very thin
                    and sharp, and is extremely flexible and elastic, but at other times it is
                    swollen and diffluent, furnishing the intercellular gelatinous matrix of the
                    zoogloea condition (fig. 3). It is doubtful whether the thin envelope closely
                    applied to the protoplasm is not always simply the innermost layer of a very
                    diffluent covering, which is continuously thickening and throwing off its
                    outermost swollen and disorganized lamellae. The facts to hand seem to show
                    that, while in some cases this envelope consists mainly of cellulose, in others
                    (zoogloea of <hi rend="italic">Bacteria, e.g.)</hi> it contains relatively large
                    proportions of nitrogenous compounds. In some cases the cell-walls form a
                    lamellated sheath. No cuticularization occurs, nor are deposits of lime or silex
                    known in the cell walls. Colouring pigments, however (red, yellow, and even
                    green and blue), are sometimes met with, and a rusty or brown tinge is in some
                    cases produced by the precipitation of iron oxides in the walls. In the typical
                    Schizomycetes the protoplasmic contents (which are said to consist largely of a
                    peculiar substance named mycoprotein) are colourless, or more rarely tinged with
                    colouring matters—bright red, yellow, &amp;c.—which cannot be mistaken for
                    chlorophyll. The few forms described as containing a green pigment, allied to or
                    identical with chlorophyll, will not be considered here, but relegated to the

                    substance in some <hi rend="italic">Bacteria</hi> is undoubted; it yields a deep
                    blue colour with iodine solutions, is diffused in bands or patches, and arises
                    in cases where the Schizomycete is nourished by a matrix which does not contain
                    starch. Trécul noticed this formation of amyloid substance in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clostridium,</hi> Van Tieghem in a <hi rend="italic">Spirillum,</hi> and

                    starch. In the filamentous Schizomycetes <hi rend="italic">(Beggiatoa,
                    e.g.)</hi> are found extremely minute dark granules; Cramer and Cohn have shown
                    that these consist of sulphur in fine crystals (fig. 14). Oily or fatty
                    substances and minute granules of undetermined nature occur in the protoplasm,
                    but no nucleus has as yet been discovered in any Schizomycete.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetative States.—</hi> While many forms are fixed to a
                    substratum, others are free; and in certain conditions single cells or groups
                    may be motile. In some cases the movements are mere oscillations, in others
                    there are rapid movements of translation, sometimes ascribed to the action of
                    flagella or cilia; these movements are of course not to be confounded with the
                    dancing “Brownian motion” observed in the case of all such minute bodies
                    suspended in fluids. Cilia have now been described in some of the smallest <hi

                    Koch, Zopf), though, on account of their extreme fineness, and the difficulty of
                    fixing them, much discussion has taken place as to their nature, functions,
                    origin, numbers, and even existence; that they occur is proved by the
                    photographs, but whether they are not sometimes mere filaments drawn out from
                    the cell-walls is very doubtful</p>
                <p>(figs. 2 and 12).</p>
                <p>While some Schizomycetes appear to have no active stage, and many are only motile
                    under certain conditions when swarming, others are described as possessing two
                    or even three distinct active forms.</p>
                <p>When vigorously growing and dividing, the Schizomycetes as a rule present certain
                    definite forms, which are at any rate so constant under constant conditions that
                    they can be figured and described with such accuracy and certainty that good
                    observers have regarded them as fixed species, or at least as “form-species” or
                    “form-genera.” We now know, however, that many Schizomycetes pass through
                    several such phases, and we may therefore regard them in these cases as
                    “vegetative forms,” which pass into one another too gradually to admit of their
                    being employed as sharply distinctive of genera.</p>
                <p>As the chief of these forms may be mentioned the following (see fig. 1) :—<pb

                    cylindrical cells which remain united end to end after division, and they may
                    break up later into elements such as those described above. Such filaments are
                    not always of the same diameter throughout, and their segmentation varies
                    considerably. They may be free, or attached at one (the “basal ”) end. A

                    rend="italic">e.g., Leptothrix)</hi> and such as exhibit a false branching <hi

                    rend="italic">spiral</hi> forms. Any of the elongated forms described above may
                    be curved, or sinuous, or twisted into a corkscrew-like spiral instead of
                    straight. If the sinuosity is slight we have the <hi rend="italic">Vibrio</hi>
                    form; if pronounced, and the spiral winding well marked, the forms are known as
                    <hi rend="italic">Spirillum, Spirochaete,</hi> &amp;c. These and similar terms
                    have been applied partly to individual cells, but more often to filaments
                    consisting of several cells; and much confusion has arisen from the difficulty
                    of defining the terms themselves. Various observera have, moreover, described
                    particular cases where the cells or cell-filaments exhibit irregularities of
                    form; such “involution forms,” “torula forms,” &amp;c., appear to bo fairly
                    constant in some cases.</p>
                <p>In addition to the above, however, certain Schizomycetes present aggregates in
                    the form of plates, or solid or hollow and irregular branched colonies. This may
                    be due to the successive divisions occurring in two or three planes instead of
                    only across the long axis <hi rend="italic">(Sarcina),</hi> or to displacements
                    of the cells after division (as in the zooglcea conditions, &amp;c., see fig.
                    3).</p>

                    individual cell, cell-filament, or cell-colony, the immediate visible re sults
                    of active nutrition are elongation of the cell and its division into two equal
                    halves, across the long axis, by the formation of a septum, which either splits
                    at once or re mains intact for a shorter or longer time. This process is then
                    repeated, and so on. In the first case the separated cells assume the characters
                    of the parent-cell whose division gave rise to them; in the second case they
                    form filaments, or, if the further elongation and divisions of the cells proceed
                    in different directions, plates or spheroidal or othershaped colonies. It not
                    unfrequently happens, however, that groups of cells break away from their former
                    connexion as longer or shorter straight or curved filaments, or as solid masses.
                    In some filamentous forms this “fragmentation” into multicellular pieces of
                    equal length or nearly so is a normal phenomenon, each partial filament
                    repeating the growth, division, and fragmentation as before <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> figs. 15</p>
                <p>and 16). Finally, such filaments may break up into their individual cells,
                    forming “bacilli,” “bacteria,” or “cocci” as the case may be. By these means
                    hundreds of thousands of cells may be produced in a few hours,<note

                    temperature, &amp;c.), enormous collections of isolated cells may cloud the
                    fluid in which they are cultivated, or form deposits below or films on its
                    surface; valuable characters are sometimes obtained from these appearances.</p>
                <p>When these dense “swarms” of vegetative cells become fixed in a matrix of their
                    own swollen contiguous cell-walls, they pass over into a sort of resting state
                    as a so-called zoogloea (fig. 3).</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable phenomena in the lifehistory of the Schizomycetes is
                    the formation of this zoogloea stage, which corresponds to the “palmella”
                    condition of the lower <hi rend="italic">Algae.</hi> This occurs as a membrane
                    on the surface of the medium, or as irre gular clumps or branched masses</p>
                <p>(sometimes several inches across) sub merged in it, and consists of more or less
                    gelatinous ma trix enclosing in numerable “cocci,”</p>
                <p>“bacteria,” or other elements of the</p>
                <p>Schizomycete con cerned. Formerly regarded as a distinct genus—the natural fate
                    of all the various forms—the zoogloea is now known to be a sort of resting
                    condition of the Schizomycetes, the various elements being glued together, as it
                    were, by their enormously swollen and diffluent cell-walls becoming contiguous.
                    The zoogloea is formed by active division of single or of several mother-cells,
                    and the progeny appear to go on secreting the cell-wall substance, which then
                    absorbs many times its volume of water, and remains as a consistent matrix, in
                    which the cells come to rest. The matrix— <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the
                    swollen cell-walls—in some cases consists mainly of cellulose, in others chiefly
                    of “my-coprotein,” the substance said to be met with in the protoplasm; the
                    matrix in some cases is horny and resistent, in others more like a thick
                    solution of gum. It is intelligible from the mode of formation that foreign
                    bodies may become entangled in the gelatinous matrix, and compound zoogloeae may
                    arise by the apposition of several distinct forms, a common event in macerating
                    troughs (fig. 3,</p>
                <p>A). Characteristic forms may be assumed by the young zoogloea of different
                    species,—spherical, ovoid, reticular, filamentous, fruticose, lamellar,</p>
                <p>&amp;c.,—but these vary considerably as the mass increases or comes in contact
                    with others. Older zoogloeae may precipitate oxide of iron in the matrix, if
                    that metal exists in small quantities in the medium. Under favourable conditions
                    the elements in the zoogloea again become active, and move out of the matrix,
                    distribute themselves in the surrounding medium, to grow and multiply as before
                    (fig. 4). If the zoogloea is formed on a solid substratum it may become firm and
                    horny; immersion in water softens it as described above.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spores.—</hi> Spores or resting-cells are now known in many
                    Schizomycetes (fig. 5). They may be formed in two ways.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Leuconostoc, Bacterium zopfii, Crenothrix, Beggiatoa,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Cladothrix</hi> the spore is simply one of the smallest
                    segments (“cocci”) into which the filament at length breaks up. De Bary terms
                    such forms “arthrosporous” <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> figs. 8, 13, 14, and 16).
                    In others the formation of the spore is “endosporous” (De Bary). It begins with
                    the appearance of a minute granule in the protoplasm of a vegetative cell; this
                    granule enlarges, and in a few<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0425-0404"/> hours has taken to itself all the protoplasm,
                    secreted a dense envelope, and is a ripe ovoid spore, smaller than the
                    mother-cell, and lying loosely in it (<hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. figs. 9, 11,
                    and 12). In the case of the simplest and most minute Schizomycetes <hi
                    rend="italic">(Micrococcus,</hi> &amp;c.) no definite spores have been
                    discovered; any one of the vegetative micrococci may commence a new series of
                    cells by growth and division. We may call these forms “asporous,” at any rate
                    provisionally.</p>
                <p>The spore may be formed in short or long segments, the cell-wall of which may
                    undergo change of form to accommodate itself to the contents. As a rule only one
                    spore is formed in a cell, and the process usually takes place in a bacillar
                    segment. In some cases the spore-forming protoplasm gives a blue reaction with
                    iodine solutions. The spores may be developed in cells which are actively
                    swarming, the movements not being interfered with by the process (fig. 5, D).
                    The so-called “Köpfchenbacterien” of older writers are simply bacterioid
                    segments with a spore at one end, the mother cell-wall having adapted itself to
                    the outline of the spore (fig. 5, F). The ripe spores of Schizomycetes are
                    spherical, ovoid, or long-ovoid in shape, and extremely minute <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> those of <hi rend="italic">Bacillus subtilis</hi> measure 0·0012
                    mm. long by 0·0006 mm. broad according to Zopf), highly refractive and
                    colourless (or very dark, probably owing to the high index of refraction and
                    minute size). The membrane may be relatively thick, and even exhibit shells or
                    strata.</p>
                <p>The germination of the spores has now been observed in several forms with care.
                    The spores are capable of germination at once, or they may be kept for months
                    and even years, and are very resistent against desiccation, heat and cold,
                    &amp;c. In a suitable medium and at a proper temperature the germination is
                    completed in a few hours. The spore swells and elongates, and the contents grow
                    forth to a cell like that which produced it, in some cases clearly breaking
                    through the membrane, the remains of which may be seen attached to the young
                    germinal rodlet (figs. 5, 9, and 11); in other cases the surrounding membrane of
                    the spore swells and dissolves. The germinal cell then grows forth into the
                    forms typical for the particular Schizomycete concerned.<note anchored="true"

                    already stated, some Schizomycetes have been shown to present as vegetative
                    forms, or phases in one and the same life-history, “cocci,” “bacteria,”</p>
                <p>“leptothrix-filaments,” and even spiral and curved forms known as “spirillum,”
                    “vibrio,” «fcc. On the other hand, several Schizomycetes which have been long
                    and diligently investigated by the best observers show no such pleomorphism. As
                    examples of the latter we may select <hi rend="italic">Bacillus megaterium</hi>
                    (fig. 9) and numerous <hi rend="italic">Micrococci</hi> which produce similar
                    cells generation after generation. A remarkable example of a pleomorphic form is
                    <hi rend="italic">Clado-thrix dichotoma</hi> (fig. 16). According to Zopf this
                    species passes successively through the stages known as “coccus,” “bacterioid,”
                    “bacillar,” and “leptothrix,” by mere elongation and division by transverse
                    septa; the observer named declares that these simple filaments have formerly
                    received generic and specific names <hi rend="italic">{Leptothrix
                    parasitica</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L. ochracea,</hi> Kiitz.). Certain of the
                    threads then partially break up, and the portions become slightly displaced from
                    the linear series; these portions go on growing in a direction at an angle with
                    the previous one, but still in contact, and thus produce the “false-branching”
                    to which <hi rend="italic">Cladothrix</hi> owes its name. Finally the filaments
                    break up into segments corresponding with the septa which have been formed
                    across them. This fragmentation is peculiar in that the filaments separate first
                    into shorter filaments, then into rodlets, and finally into “cocci.” Portions of
                    the filaments or branches may become separated and travel with a gliding
                    movement, or even become more active and swarm by means of cilia. Such portions
                    may break up into shorter filaments or rods which also<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0426-0405"/> swarm. But, in addition to these straight and
                    more or less rigid forms (which, it will be noticed, simulate Ehrenberg and
                    Cohn’s “genera” <hi rend="italic">Micrococcus, Bacterium, Bacillus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Leptothrix</hi> so closely that any of them observed alone would
                    undoubtedly have been formerly placed apart in one of those “genera ”), it is
                    interesting to find that some of the filaments become spirally twisted and
                    simulate <hi rend="italic">Spirillum, Spirochaete,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vibrio,</hi> the dis tinctions depending on the relative length and thickness
                    of the filament, and the closeness or steepness of the coils. Moreover these
                    twisted filaments also break up into shorter gliding or ciliated portions, which
                    at length fall into rodlets and “cocci” as before.</p>
                <p>A branched zoogloea form also occurs, and this contains cocci, bacterium-like or
                    bacillar rods, or filaments resembling <hi rend="italic">Leptothrix</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Vibrio</hi> according to circumstances. In Lankester’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Bacterium rubescens</hi> we have another species which is variable
                    in a high degree. Many other Schizomycetes have now been shown to be more or
                    less pleomorphic, and the researches of Lankester, Nägeli, Zopf, Miller, Kurth,
                    De Bary, and others have laid the foundation for a knowledge of the
                    circumstances which induce the changes in form referred to; it is at least
                    certain that alterations in the nutritive medium, in the quantity of oxygen at
                    the disposal of the organism, and in the temperature, &amp;c., play their part
                    in the matter.</p>
                <p>It by no means follows, however, that because some species are pleomorphic all
                    must be so, and still less that no species of Schizomycetes—or only one—exist at
                    all; those who deny the existence of species among the Schizomycetes on the
                    evidence to hand must, to be logically consistent, deny the existence of species
                    altogether. But even if that be allowed, some name of similar intention must be
                    employed to denote any group of organisms which within our experience exhibit
                    periodical repetitions of a process of development, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    all the individuals of successive generations go through the same phases
                    periodically. It matters not that variations—ill-defined deviations from an
                    average or “type”—occur on the part of individuals or generations; the
                    periodically repeated life-history or development marks what we term a
                    species.</p>
                <p>The difficulties presented by such minute and simple organisms as the
                    Schizomycetes are due partly to the few “characters” which they possess, and
                    partly to the dangers of error in manipulating them; it is anything but an easy
                    matter either to trace the whole development of a single form or to recognize
                    with certainty any one stage in the development unless the others are known.
                    This being the case, and having regard to the minuteness and ubiquity of these
                    organisms, we should be very careful in accepting evidence as to the continuity
                    or otherwise of any two forms which falls short of direct and uninterrupted
                    observation. The outcome of all these considerations is that, while recognizing
                    that the “genera” and “species” as defined by Cohn must be recast, we are not
                    warranted in uniting any forms the continuity of which has not been directly
                    observed; or, at any rate, the strictest rules should be followed in accepting
                    the evidence adduced to render the union of any forms probable.<note

                    examining in detail the system of classification proposed by Cohn, or the
                    modifications of it followed by other authorities. Zopf, in the third edition of
                    his work (1885), proposes a scheme based on the modern views as to the
                    pleomorphism: we must refer to the original for the details, simply remarking
                    that, apart from the extreme views accepted by the author, his system is
                    impracticable to a degree and recognized by him as provisional only. Indeed any
                    such classification must be provisional, for we are at the threshold only of a
                    knowledge of the Schizomycetes.</p>
                <p>The best starting-point for a modern classification of these organisms is that
                    suggested by De Bary—the two modes of formation of the spores,—and as a
                    provisional scheme, and simply to facilitate comparison of the groups, we might
                    perhaps employ De Bary’s two groups, and a third one to include those simple
                    forms which show no trace of spore-formation. Many gaps exist, and many changes
                    will probably have to be made. Meanwhile it might be advisable to classify the

                    case of other plants, we are here concerned with the functions of the
                    Schizomycetes and their relations to the environment; for convenience, the
                    subject may be treated under various headings. Limitation of space prevents our
                    doing more than touch lightly upon such matters as the action of the
                    Schizomycetes as ferments, and their relations to disease, though both subjects
                    belong strictly to the physiology of their nutrition and actions on the
                    environment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nutrition.—</hi> Having no chlorophyll, the Schizomycetes of
                    course depend on other organisms for their carbonaceous food, and are either
                    saprophytes— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> live on the remains of dead organisms—
                    or parasites— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> obtain their food direct from living
                    organisms. Pasteur, Nägeli, and others have shown that these organisms can
                    derive their carbon from very numerous and widely different organic substances,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> sugars of all kinds, mannite, glycerine, tartaric
                    and other vegetable acids, &amp;c., and even from ethylalcohol, benzoic,
                    salicylic, and carbolic acids to some extent. Carbonic, formic, and oxalic
                    acids, cyanogen, urea, and oxamide are, however, useless for this purpose. The
                    nitrogen and carbon together may be obtained from leucin, asparagin,
                    methylamine, &amp;c., or the nitrogen alone from these or urea, and compounds of
                    ammonia with vegetable acids or phosphorus. The best nutritive substances are
                    proteids (peptones) and sugars (glucoses); others must be passed over here. The
                    nature of the particular Schizomycete has to be studied as well as the solution,
                    and external agents affect the matter also. Certain minerals are of course
                    necessary,—sulphur, phosphorus, potassium (or rubidium or caesium), and calcium
                    (or magnesium, barium, or strontium) being indispensable. As one of many
                    suitable nutritive solutions we may select the following :—</p>

                <p>The chief sources of error in cultures of these very minute forms are the
                    introduction of spores, &amp;c., from without into the vessels, and on the
                    instruments, &amp;c., and the difficulty of continuously observing a developing
                    individual with the necessary high powers. Numerous errors have arisen from
                    inferences being employed to fill up gaps in life-histories which have only been
                    partly observed. The first object of the cultivator, then, is to guarantee the
                    purity of his materials, instruments, &amp;c., and then to keep one form (or
                    even a single specimen) under observation for a sufficiently long period and
                    under suitable conditions. The practical difficulties are enormous, of course,
                    and are very rarely entirely overcome for periods at all long. Here again we
                    must refer to the special works for details as to the beautiful and refined
                    methods now devised or employed by De Bary, Cohn, Koch, Brefeld, Lister, Nägeli,
                    and others, calling special attention to the gelatine method devised by
                    Vittadini and Brefeld and so successfully used and improved by Koch. Thoroughly
                    conducted cultivations should decide in what medium the Schizomycete flourishes
                    best, and how it behaves in others,—what vegetative forms it presents normally,
                    and how changes in the environment affect these. They should also decide the
                    characters of the aggregates or colonics; at what temperatures germination,
                    growth, division, spore-formation, &amp;c., take place or cease, and so on; the
                    necessity or otherwise of free oxygen; the effects of the organism on its
                    substratum or medium—whether it cause fermentation, or putrefaction, or excrete
                    soluble ferments, and so on. Moreover, the products of these actions should be
                    examined in detail. Where the particular Schizomycete is a parasite (wholly or
                    partially) the methods of culture are even more refined. Here the fluids or
                    tissues of the host must be regarded as a soil in which (by means of
                    “infection,” “inoculation,” &amp;c.) the observer sows the spores or vegetative
                    cells of the parasitic organism. It is impossible to go more into details in the
                    limits of this article, however, and we must dismiss the subject with the remark
                    that, having regard to the complexity of the medium <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> blood) and the organization of the host, the difficulties of
                    manipulation become greater than ever.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Temperature.—</hi> As with other plants, so with the
                    Schizomycetes, their various functions, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    germination, growth, division, formation of spores, &amp;c., can only be carried
                    on at certain temperatures: the best average temperature is about 35° C., but
                    the optimum may differ for each species and for each function. The same is
                    generally true for the minimum and maximum temperatures, which have to bo
                    determined separately also. Remarkable phenomena are connected with the
                    death-points of certain <hi rend="italic">Bacilli,</hi> &amp;c. The spores of
                    some of these forms have been frozen for days or weeks without injury, and some
                    are said to have resisted temperatures as low as —100° C., or even lower: it
                    appears to be all but impossible to kill such spores by cold. High temperatures
                    are more fatal; but the spores of <hi rend="italic">Bacilli</hi> have germinated
                    after the fluid containing them was boiled for an hour, and even a temperature
                    of 110° C. and higher has been withstood. The vegetative states are less
                    resistent; nevertheless the bacilli of anthrax were not killed by heating the
                    fluid to 75-80° for an hour or more. Speaking generally, ripe spores are most
                    resistent and germinating ones least so; dry cells or spores resist extreme
                    temperatures better than normally saturated ones. Of course time is an important
                    factor; and other conditions also affect the matter, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> slightly acid media are more fatal than neutral or feebly alkaline
                    ones, denser less so than thin ones <hi rend="italic">(caeteris paribus),</hi>
                    and so on.</p>
                <p>To illustrate the importance of these facts we may note Tyndall’s method of
                    “discontinuous heating”: by boiling the solutions containing the spores for 5-10
                    minutes daily all the life was destroyed in two or three days, though an
                    exposure of an hour or more to a temperature of 100° C. did not kill the spores
                    if not repeated. The explanation is that the spores which resist the first or
                    second short boiling have time to begin germinating in the interval, and they
                    then succumb at once when the liquid is again boiled.<note anchored="true"

                    Chemical Agents. —Oxygen. —</hi> Pasteur showed that, while some Schizomycetes
                    require free oxygen like other plants, there are some which need none, or at
                    most very little—the extreme case is perhaps still doubtful; but “anaerobiotic”
                    forms like <hi rend="italic">Bacillus butyricus</hi> stand in sharp contrast to
                    such exquisitely “aerobiotic” ones as <hi rend="italic">Bacterium aceti,
                    Bacillus subtilis,</hi> &amp;c. A few are known to flourish best—or at any rate
                    they are more active—when supplied with oxygen in proportion less than that in
                    the atmosphere. Engelmann showed that, while some species congregated close to a
                    bubble of air, others collected at a certain distance from it, and came nearer
                    when the bubble contained less oxygen. The same is true for the same species
                    when brought near an <hi rend="italic">Alga</hi> which is evolving oxygen—the
                    aerobiotic forms collect where the oxygen is being evolved (in the yellow-red,
                    &amp;c., of the spectrum). Some Schizomycetes are powerful deoxidizing and
                    reducing agents: it has already been stated that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beggiatoa</hi> deposits pure sulphur in its filaments. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bacterium aceti</hi> and others, on the contrary, transfer oxygen in large
                    quantities to the medium in which they live, and the carbon in that may be
                    entirely consumed. Fermentation once started may go on without free oxygen or
                    not (according to the particular Schizomycete, &amp;c. ), but it is necessary at
                    the commencement. Oxygen is of course necessary for the respiration of the
                    growing Schizomycete.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Fermentation and Butrefaction.—</hi> The growth and development
                    of a Schizomycete in any organic medium results in a breaking down of the
                    complex food-materials into simpler bodies, which may then become oxidized and
                    still further decomposed. Such processes are known as fermentation in the wider
                    sense. The particular kind of fermentation depends on the medium and on the
                    species of Schizomycete, and may be affected by other circumstances; as the
                    process goes on volatile substances may escape and others remain behind. Where
                    proteid substances are being decomposed by Schizomycetes and evil-smelling gases
                    escape, the fermentation is spoken of as putrefaction; in certain cases, where
                    intense oxidation follows and still further consumes the products of
                    decomposition, the process has been termed eremocausis. In a few instances a
                    process of reduction sets in, as when sulphur salts are decomposed by <hi
                    rend="italic">Beggiatoa.</hi> The theory of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fermentation</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v</hi>.) cannot be treated in detail
                    here, but it is important to note that side by side with the actions referred to
                    another kind of action may go on. Many Schizomycetes excrete what are called
                    “soluble ferments,” which are capable of changing proteids into peptones, sugar
                    into glucose, and so on. These processes of inversion, &amp;c., result simply in
                    an alteration of the proteid, &amp;c., from the non-diffusible and
                    non-assimilable condition to the diffusible and assimilable one, and are in no
                    way destructive as are the fermentations described above. Nevertheless it is the
                    custom to speak of both as cases of fermentation; the one series of changes
                    renders the medium less and less capable of supporting life at every stage, the
                    other series does not do so, yet the same name is frequently given to both kinds
                    of action. It is a curious fact that the same Schizomycete may produce a
                    different fermentation in each of two different media. The various fermentations
                    are distinguished and valued according to the products which result; these
                    bye-products are usually injurious to the ferment organism as they accumulate,
                    and often complicate the investigation.</p>
                <p>Of important fermentations due to Schizomycetes may be mentioned those concerned
                    in the making of vinegar and cheese, in the preparation of flax, hemp, &amp;c.,
                    in the souring and diseases of beer, wines, &amp;c., the destruction of sugars,
                    preserved food, &amp;c. Others are of importance in the soil, and in the
                    destruction of organic matter in ponds, rivers, drains, &amp;c. In fact, much of
                    the <hi rend="italic">raison d'être</hi> of sanitary science may be referred
                    here; and it may turn out to be still more true than we now know that
                    Schizomycetes are important in agriculture.</p>
                <p>In pathology the changes due to these organisms are at length being duly
                    recognized. Apart from the comparatively harmless actions of those forms
                    normally existing in the alimentary canal— <hi rend="italic">Leptothrix</hi>
                    aids in the decay of teeth, &amp;c.—it is now certain that some invasions are
                    dangerous. The injurious effects of some Schizomycetes when introduced into open
                    wounds, &amp;c., against which the brilliant labours of Lister have been so
                    successfully directed, are acknowledged everywhere; but it is important to
                    recognize that on the whole the diseases due to organisms in the blood depend
                    fundamentally upon changes of the same category as those referred to. Of course
                    the fluids of a living body present complicated conditions, and the action of a
                    pathogenous Schizomycete cannot be treated and studied simply as a typical
                    fermentation; but, although the conditions presented are involved and special,
                    it cannot be doubted that common principles lie at the base of all the
                    phenomena, and that the fluids of the diseased organism must be treated, so to
                    speak, as fermentable media.</p>

                    presence of Schizomycetes in the blood, tissues, or organs of animals and man
                    suffering from certain specific diseases is admitted, and has naturally
                    suggested the question—Are they accompaniments only or have they any causal
                    relations to the diseased conditions? Their constancy in given cases excluded
                    the former view. Next arose the discussion as to how the causal connexion comes
                    about and in what it consists, a discussion which is still going on as to the
                    details. The chief points now established may be expressed generally somewhat as
                    follows.</p>
                <p>In a given specific disease, due to the action of a definite Schizomycete, the
                    latter may be conceived to be injurious in several ways. If it robs the blood or
                    tissues of oxygen or of any other valuable constituent, or if its activity
                    results in the excretion of poisonous substances or in their formation as
                    products of degradation of the matrix, or if it simply acts more or less as a
                    mechanical obstruction or irritant,—in any of these cases harm may result to the
                    delicately adjusted organism of the host. It being known that Schizomycetes act
                    thus in nutrient pabula outside the body, their rapid growth and multiplication
                    inside can of course only be explained as due to their success in the pabula
                    there met with, and are indications that they produce changes there which must
                    result in abnormality so far as the host is concerned. This does not end the
                    matter, however. The living tissues of a healthy animal exert actions which are
                    antagonistic to those of the parasitic invader; and it is now generally admitted
                    that the mere admission of a Schizomycete into an animal does not necessarily
                    cause disease. Were it otherwise it is difficult to see how the higher organisms
                    could escape at all. Schizomycetes abound all over, about and around us; many,
                    of course, are unable to live in the fluids of the body, but many are able to do
                    so. Something must therefore be placed to the action of the tissues of the host,
                    which when healthy can “resist” the attempts of a Schizomycete to settle, grow,
                    and multiply with fatal effect. Much can undoubtedly be explained by this
                    struggle for existence between the cells of the parasite and those of the
                    healthy tissues invaded. But the higher organisms, again, present obstacles of
                    other kinds to the lodgment of Schizomycetes: ciliary actions, active
                    excretions, isolating processes of tissue-formation, &amp;c., may be mentioned.
                    Thus not every Schizomycete met with in the body can do harm.</p>
                <p>But even when a Schizomycete has gained access to the bloodvessels,
                    lymph-passages, &amp;c., and has succeeded in establishing itself and
                    multiplying, there are other facts to be taken into account before we dismiss
                    the question as to its relations to disease. The rapidity of its growth may vary
                    according to many circumstances,—temperature, oxidation, &amp;c.,—as well as the
                    still partially obstructive action of the invaded organism; whether the parasite
                    excretes a poison, or simply robs the host, or distributes injurious agents of
                    any kind, it is clear that everything which favours it aids in intensifying its
                    action. And this may be local or general also according to complex
                    circumstances. Of course sores, open wounds, &amp;c., may render the access of a
                    given Schizomycete very easy, and pave the way for its success in the tissues,
                    &amp;c., different strata of which may be exerting less and less resistance to
                    its attacks. The study of this subject has led to the methods of modern surgery
                    devised by Lister. It may be mentioned that Schizomycetes which produce bad
                    effects on injured or dead tissues of wounds are not necessarily able to live in
                    the healthy organism, however deadly the poisonous products of their action may
                    be when they succeed in establishing themselves.</p>
                <p>All these and many other facts, then, point to the conclusion that the mere
                    presence of a Schizomycete in an organ or tissue is not sufficient proof of its
                    causal relation to disease, and lead us to the following requirements to be
                    satisfied before any such relation can be admitted (Koch) :—(1) given a specific
                    disease in which a definite Schizomycete is constantly detected, and with a
                    constant disposition with respect to the tissues, organs, &amp;c.,—this organism
                    should be absent from animals free from the disease; (2) the Schizomycete should
                    be cultivated in nutrient media outside the body, kept pure for several
                    “generations,” and obtained in some quantity by these means; (3) inoculation of
                    a small amount of this pure cultivation should reproduce the specific disease in
                    a healthy animal; (4) the same foreign elements as before should be clearly
                    detected in the tissues of the now diseased subject, and in the same relations
                    as before.</p>
                <p>The satisfying of all these requirements is difficult, and the necessity of
                    overcoming the difficulties has led to what may almost be termed a special
                    branch of medical art. At the same time the majority of the principles which are
                    here becoming recognized have long been known to biologists, and especially to
                    botanists, and there are still numerous indications of a want of botanical
                    training on the part of writers on these subjects. It is impossible here to even
                    mention all the methods devised for staining, preparing, and examining tissues,
                    &amp;c, and the Schizomycetes they contain, or for cultivating these minute
                    organisms under constant conditions on sterilized potatoes, bread-paste, jelly,
                    blood-serum, &amp;c., or in animal infusions or fluids, &amp;c. Some of the more
                    important points in cultivation have already been referred to; the literature
                    must be consulted for further details.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
