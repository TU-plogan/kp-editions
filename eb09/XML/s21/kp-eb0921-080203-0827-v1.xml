                    (1751-1790), engraver and history-painter, was born in 1751 at East Dean in
                    Sussex. His father was a wood-cutter employed in shaping bolts for shipbuilders,
                    and the son followed the same occupation till his seventeenth year, when, having
                    shown an aptitude for art by copying some miniatures with exceptional accuracy,
                    he was befriended by Mr William Mitford, upon whose estate the elder Sherwin
                    worked, and was sent to study in London, first under John Astley, and then for
                    three years under Bartolozzi—for whom he is believed to have executed a large
                    portion of the plate of Clytie, after Annibal Caracci, published as the work of
                    his master. He was entered as a student of the Royal Academy, and gained a
                    silver medal, and in 1772 a gold medal for his painting of Coriolanus Taking
                    Leave of his Family. From 1774 till 1780 he was an exhibitor of chalk drawings
                    and of engravings in the Royal Academy. Establishing himself in St James’s
                    Street as a painter, designer, and engraver, he speedily attained popularity,
                    and began to mix in fashionable society. His drawing of the Finding of Moses, a
                    work of but slight artistic merit, which introduced portraits of the princess
                    royal of England and other leading ladies of the aristocracy, hit the public
                    taste, and, as reproduced by his burin, sold largely. In 1785 he succeeded
                    Woollett as engraver to the king, and he also held the appointment of engraver
                    to the prince of Wales. His professional income rose to about £12,000 a year;
                    but he was constantly in pecuniary difficulties, for he was shiftless, indolent,
                    and without method, open-handed and even prodigal in his benefactions,—and
                    prodigal, too, in less reputable directions, for he became a reckless gambler,
                    and habits of intemperance grew upon him. He died in extreme penury on the 24th
                    of September 1790,—according to Steevens, the editor of Shakespeare, at “The Hog
                    in the Pound,” an obscure alehouse in Swallow Street, or, as stated by his pupil
                    J. T. Smith, in the house of Robert Wilkinson, a printseller in Cornhill.</p>
                <p>It is as an engraver that Sherwin is most esteemed; and it may be noted that he
                    was ambidexterous, working indifferently with either hand upon his plates. His
                    drawing is correct, his line excellent, and his textures are varied and
                    intelligent in expression. Such of his plates as the Holy Family after Nicholas
                    Poussin, Christ Bearing the Cross after Murillo, the portrait of the Marquis of
                    Buckingham after Gainsborough, and that of Pitt occupy a high place among the
                    productions of the English school of line-engravers. He also worked after Pine,
                    Dance, and Kauffman.</p>
