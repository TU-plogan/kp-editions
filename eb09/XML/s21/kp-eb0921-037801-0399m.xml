                    carnival freak, of his having been obliged to take refuge from popular wrath in
                    a swamp, and of his consequent deformity from rheumatism. The simple fact seems
                    to be that in 1637 he had an attack of fever with the usual sequelae of
                    rheumatic attacks, and that he put himself into the hands of a quack doctor.
                    This at least is how Tallemant tells the story, though he substitutes a less
                    creditable disease for fever. What is certain is that Scarron, after having been
                    in perfect health for nearly thirty years, passed twenty more in a state of
                    miserable deformity and pain. His head and body were twisted, and his legs
                    became useless. Nevertheless he bore up against his sufferings with invincible
                    courage, though they were complicated by his inheriting nothing from his father,
                    and by the poverty and miscouduct of his sisters, whom he supported. For a few
                    years he really held a benefice at Le Mans, but was then in no case to play
                    pranks. It is said, however, that here he conceived the idea of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Roman Comique</hi> and wrote the drama of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jodelet,</hi> which gave a nickname to the actor who performed it. In 1646 he
                    returned to Paris and worked hard for the booksellers, from the name of one of
                    whom he is said to have called literature pleasantly his " marquisat de Quinet.”
                    He had also a pension from Mazarin and one from the queen, but lost both from
                    being accused of “Frondeur” sentiments. The most singular action of his life
                    remains to be told. In his early years he had been, as hinted, something of a
                    libertine, and a young lady of some family, Céleste Palaiseau, had openly lived
                    with him. But in 1652, sixteen years after he had become almost entirely
                    paralysed, he married a girl of much beauty and no fortune, Françoise or
                    Francine d’Aubigné, granddaughter of Agrippa d’Aubigné, afterwards famous as
                    Madame de Maintenon. Scarron’s house was, both before and after the marriage, a
                    great centre of society, despite his narrow means. Yet only the most malignant
                    and unscrupulous libellers of the future favourite accuse her of light conduct
                    during the eight years of her marriage to this strange husband, and the
                    well-informed author of the <hi rend="italic">Historiettes</hi> distinctly
                    acquits her of any such. But Scarron, who had long been able to endure life only
                    by the aid of constant doses of opium, was at length worn out, and died on the
                    6th October 1660.</p>
                <p>Scarron’s work is very abundant, and, written as it was under pressure of want
                    and pain, it is very unequal. The piece most famous in his own day, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Virgile Travesti</hi> (1648-53), is now thought, and not unjustly,
                    a somewhat ignoble and unprofitable waste of singular powers for burlesque. But
                    the <hi rend="italic">Roman Comique</hi> (1651) is a work the merit of which can
                    be denied by no competent judge who has read it. Unfinished, and a little
                    desultory, this history of a troop of strolling actors is almost the first
                    French novel, in point of date, which shows real power of painting manners and
                    character, and is singularly vivid. It furnished Théophile Gautier with the idea
                    and with some of the details of his <hi rend="italic">Capitaine Fracasse.</hi>
                    Scarron also wrote some shorter novels of merit, which arc thought to have
                    inspired Molière and Sedaine. Of his plays <hi rend="italic">Jodelet</hi> (1645)
                    and <hi rend="italic">Don Japhet d'Arménie</hi> (1653) are the best. Both these
                    and the others which he wrote are of course somewhat antiquated in style, but
                    with Corneille’s <hi rend="italic">Menteur</hi> they stand above everything else
                    in comedy before Molière. He also produced many miscellaneous pieces.</p>
                <p>Scarron is generally spoken of and thought of as a representative writer of
                    burlesque, but in reality he possessed in abundance the faculty of true comedy.
                    The most complete edition of his works is held tobe that of 1737 (10 vols.,
                    Amsterdam), but his more celebrated pieces, including all those mentioned above,
                    have been frequently reprinted.</p>
