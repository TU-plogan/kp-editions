                <p><label type="entry">SECRETARY-BIRD</label>, a very singular African animal first
                    accurately made known, from an example living in the menagerie of the prince of
                    Orange, in 1769 by Vosmaer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Afrique,</hi> ii. p. 273) truly states that Kolben in 1719 (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Caput Bonae Spei hodiernum,</hi> p. 182, French version, ii. p. 198) had
                    mentioned this bird under its local name of “Snake-eater" (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Slangen-vreeter,</hi> Dutch translation, i. p. 214); but that author, who was a
                    bad naturalist, thought it was a Pelican and also confounded it with the
                    Spoonbill, which is figured to illustrate his account of it. Though he doubtless
                    had seen, and perhaps tried to describe, the Secretary-bird, he certainly failed
                    to convey any correct idea of it. Latham’s suggestion (<hi rend="italic"
                    >loc</hi>. <hi rend="italic">infra cit.)</hi> that the figure of the “Grus
                    Capensis cauda cristata” in Petiver’s <hi rend="italic">Gazοphylaeium</hi> (tab.
                    xii. fig. 12) was meant for this bir∣l is negatived by his description of it (p.
                    20). The figure was probably copied from one of Sherard’s paintings and is more
                    likely to have had its origin in a Crane of some species. Vosmaer’s plate is
                    lettered “Amerikaanischen Roof-Vogel,” of course by mistake for
                    “Afrikaanischen.”</p></note> in a treatise published simultaneously in Dutch and
                    French, and afterwards included in his collected works issued, under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Regnum Animale,</hi> in 1804. He was told that at the Cape
                    of Good Hope this bird was known as the “Sagittarius” or Archer, from its
                    striding gait being thought to resemble that of a bowman advancing to shoot, but
                    that this name had been corrupted into that of “Secretarius.” In August 1770
                    Edwards saw an example (apparently alive, and the survivor of a pair which had
                    been brought to England) in the possession of Mr</p>
                <p>Raymond near Ilford in Essex; and, being unacquainted with Vosmaer’s work, he
                    figured and described it as “of a new genus” in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for the following year (lxi. pp. 55, 56, pl.
                    ii.). In 1776 Sonnerat (Voy. <hi rend="italic">Nouυ. Guinée,</hi> p. 87, pl. 50)
                    again described and figured, but not at all correctly, the species, saying (but
                    no doubt wrongly) that he found it in 1771 in the Philippine Islands. A better
                    representation was given by D’Aubenton in the <hi rend="italic">Planches
                    Enluminées</hi> (721); in 1780 Buffon <hi rend="italic">(Oiseaux,</hi> vii. p.
                    330) published some additional information derived from Querhoent, saying also
                    that it was to be seen in some English menageries; and the following year Latham
                    <hi rend="italic">(Synopsis,</hi> i. p. 20, pl. 2) described and figured it from
                    three examples which he had seen alive in England. None of these authors,
                    however, gave the bird a scientific name, and the first conferred upon it seems
                    to have been that of <hi rend="italic">Falco serpentarius,</hi> inscribed on a
                    plate bearing date 1779, by John Frederick Miller <hi rend="italic">(III. Nat.

                    >Cimelia Physica</hi> (No. 28) and is a misleading caricature. In 1786 Scopoli

                    Secretary-bird is of remarkable appearance, standing nearly 4 feet in height,
                    the great length of its legs giving it a resemblance to a Crane or a Heron; but
                    the expert will at once notice that, unlike those birds, its tibiae are
                    feathered all the way down. From the back of the head and the nape hangs,
                    loosely and in pairs, a series of black elongated feathers, capable of erection
                    and dilation in periods of excitement.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    colour. The head, neck, and upper parts of the body and wingcoverts are
                    bluish-grey; but the carpal feathers, including the primaries, are black, as
                    also are the feathers of the vent and tibiae,—the last being in some examples
                    tipped with white. The tail-quills are grey for the greater part of their
                    length, then barred with black and tipped with white; but the two middle
                    feathers are more than twice as long as those next to them, and drooping
                    downwards present a very unique appearance.</p>
                <p>The habits of the Secretary-bird have been very frequently described, one of the
                    best accounts of them being by Verreaux in the Zoological Society’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for 1856 (pp. 348-352). Its chief prey consists
                    of insects and reptiles, and as a foe to snakes it is held in high esteem.
                    Making every allowance for exaggeration, it seems to possess a strange
                    partiality for the destruction of the latter, and successfully attacks the most
                    venomous species, striking them with its knobbed wings and kicking forwards at
                    them with its feet, until they are rendered incapable of offence, when it
                    swallows them. The nest is a huge structure, placed in a bush or tree, and in it
                    two white eggs, spotted with rust-colour, are laid. The young remain in the nest
                    tor a long while, and even when four months old are unable to stand upright.
                    They are very frequently brought up tame, and become agreeable not to say useful
                    pets about a house, the chief drawbacks to them being that when hungry they will
                    help themselves to the small poultry, and the fragility of their legs, which
                    follows on any sudden alarm, and ends in their death. The Secretary-bird is
                    found, but not very abundantly and only in some localities, over the greater
                    part of Africa, especially in the south, extending northwards on the west to the
                    Gambia and in the interior to Khartum, where Von Heuglin observed it
                    breeding.</p>
                <p>The systematic position of the genus <hi rend="italic">Serpentarius</hi> has long
                    been a matter of discussion, and is still one of much interest, though of late
                    classifiers have been pretty well agreed in placing it in the Order <hi
                    rend="italic">Accipitres.</hi> Most of them, however, have shown great want of
                    perception by putting it in the Family <hi rend="italic">Falconidae.</hi> No
                    anatomist can doubt its forming a peculiar Family, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Serpentariidae,</hi> differing more from the <hi rend="italic">Falconidse</hi>
                    than do the <hi rend="italic">Vulturidae</hi>; and the fact of Prof. A.
                    Milne-Edwards having recognized in the Miocene of the Allier the fossil bone of
                    a species of this genus, <hi rend="italic">S. robustus (Ois. foss. France,</hi>
                    ii. pp. 465-468, pi. 186, figs. 1-6), proves that it is an ancient form, one
                    possibly carrying on a direct and not much modified descent from a generalized
                    form, whence may have sprung not only the <hi rend="italic">Falconidae</hi> but
                    perhaps the progenitors of the <hi rend="italic">Ardeidae</hi> and <hi
