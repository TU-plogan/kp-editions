                    region of France formed in 1790 from the districts of Autunois, Brionnais,
                    Chalonnais, Charollais, and Mâconnais previously belonging to Burgundy. Lying
                    between 46° 9' and 47° 9' N. lat., 3° 37' and 5° 27' E. long., it is bounded on
                    the N. by the department of Côte d’Or, E. by that of Jura, S.E. by Ain, S. by
                    Rhone and Loire, W. by Allier and Nièvre. The two streams from which it takes
                    its name bound the department on the south-east and on the west respectively.
                    Between these the continental watershed between the Mediterranean and the
                    Atlantic called the Charollais Mountains runs south and north. Its altitude
                    (2500 feet on the south) diminishes to the north in the direction of Côte-d’Or.
                    The culminating point of the department is in the heights of Morvan, on the
                    border of Nièvre (2960 feet). The lowest point, where the Saône leaves the
                    department, is under 550 feet. The Saône crosses the department from north to
                    south, and receives on its right the Dheune, followed by the Canal du Centre and
                    the Grosne, and on its left the Doubs and the Seille. The Loire only receives
                    one important affluent from the right, the Arroux, which is increased by the
                    Bourbince, whose valley is followed by the Canal du Centre. The average
                    temperature is slightly higher at Mâcon than at Paris—the winters being colder
                    and the summer hotter. The yearly rainfall (32 inches, increasing towards the
                    hilly districts) is distributed over 135 days; there are 25 days of snow and 27
                    of storm.</p>
                <p>Of a total area of 2,116,311 acres (this is one of the largest of the French
                    departments) 1,079,395 are arable, 371,866 forest, 292,287 natural meadows and
                    orchards, and 106,111 vineyards. In 1880 the live-stock comprised 26,000 horses,
                    6000 asses and mules, 75,000 bulls and oxen, 150,000 cows and heifers, 56,000
                    calves, 216,000 sheep, 175,000 pigs, 50,000 goats, 35,000 beehives (yielding 214
                    tons of honey and 52 tons of wax). The white Charollais oxen are one of the
                    finest French breeds, equally suitable for labour and fattening. No fewer than
                    366,252 of the inhabitants of the department out of a total of 625,559 depend on
                    agriculture. In 1883 there was produced 3,678,276 bushels of wheat, 22,890
                    meslin, 1,022,037 rye; in 1880 210,375 bushels of barley, 754,875 buckwheat,
                    809,325 maize, 101,970 millet, 2,107,187 oats, 13,359,307 potatoes, 38,500

                    tons colza oil. In 1883 the vintage yielded 22,636,636 gallons of wine, the
                    average quantity of recent years being 21,809,018 gallons. The red wines of
                    Mâconnais (especially those of Thorins) are those in highest repute; Pouilly
                    produces the best white wines. The industrial classes are represented by 150,983
                    individuals. The coal-basin of Creusot, the sixth in importance in France,
                    produced in 1882 1,269,783 tons. A pit at Épinac is 3937 feet deep. Iron-ore was
                    extracted in 1882 to the amount of 28,654 tons. Slate, limestone,
                    building-stone, millstones, granite, marble, marl, plaster, bituminous schists,
                    peat, kaolin, manganese (4360 tons per annum), and certain precious stones are
                    also found in the department. The most celebrated mineral waters are those of
                    Bourbon-Laney, six out of the seven springs being thermal. They are strongly
                    saline. Metal-working is principally carried on at Creusot, which, with its
                    13,000 workmen and its 13 smelting furnaces, 100 puddling ovens, 4 Bessemer
                    apparatuses and 4 Martin’s ovens, &amp;c., produced in 1882 63,989 tons of iron
                    (965 tons of rails, 21,984 tons of sheet-iron) and 99,823 tons of steel (72,085
                    tons of rails, 7056 tons of sheet-iron). The engine works produce all sorts of
                    machines, including about 100 locomotives. The Châlon branch works turn out
                    ships, boats, bridges, and boilers, other foundries and forges in the department
                    produced in 1882 175,113 tons of cast iron and certain quantities of copper and
                    bronze. The cotton manufacture employs 14,000 spindles and 2000 looms, silk 2900
                    spindles and 2500 handlooms, wool-spinning 350 spindles, other industrial
                    establishments are potteries, tile-works, glass-works (6,000,000 bottles at
                    Épinac alone), distilleries, oil-works, mineral-oil works, cooperages,
                    tanneries, flour-mills, sugar-works—the total number being 850 with 1372 steam
                    engines of 27,780 horse-power. The commerce of the department, especially as
                    regards its exports, deals mainly with coal, metals, machinery, wine, cattle,
                    bricks, pottery, glass. It is facilitated by five navigable streams (181
                    miles),—Loire, Arroux, Saône, Doubs, Seille,—the Canal du Centre which unites
                    Chalon-sur-Saône with Digoin on the Loire, and the canal from Roanne to Digoin
                    and the lateral Loire Canal, both following the main river valley. The total
                    length of the canals is 90 miles. There are 365 miles of national road, 7098 of
                    other roads, and 487 miles of railway. Saône-et-Loire forms the diocese of
                    Autun; it is part of the district of the 8th corps d’armée (Bourges), and its
                    university is that of Lyons. It is divided into five arrondissements, —Mâcon,
                    Chalon-sur-Saône, Autun, Charolles (3350 inhabitants in the town), Louhans
                    (4280),—50 cantons, and 539 communes; the most populous commune is Creusot
                    (28,000 inhabitants, 16,000 in the town). Montceau-les-Mines (4560) is also a
                    mining centre. Cluny (3500) is celebrated for its abbey, now occupied by the
                    normal school of secondary instruction, and Paray-le-Monial (300) for its
                    pilgrimage.</p>
