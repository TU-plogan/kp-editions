                            First Earl of</hi></label> (1621-1683), was the son of Sir John Cooper
                    of Rockbourne in Hampshire, and of Anne, the only child of Sir Anthony Ashley,
                    Bart., and was born at Wimborne St Giles, Dorset, on July 22, 1621. His parents
                    died before he was ten years of age, and he inherited extensive estates in
                    Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and Somersetshire, much reduced, however, by
                    litigation in Chancery. He lived for some time with Sir Daniel Norton, one of
                    his trustees, at Southwick, and upon his death in 1635 with Mr Tooker, an uncle
                    by marriage, at Salisbury. In 1637 he went as a gentleman-commoner to Exeter
                    College, Oxford, where he remained about a year. No record of his studies is to
                    be found, but he has left an amusing account of his part in the wilder doings of
                    the university life of that day, in which, in spite of his small stature, he was
                    recognized by his fellows as their leader. At the age of eighteen, on February
                    25, 1639, he married Margaret, daughter of Lord Coventry, with whom he and his
                    wife lived at Durham House in the Strand, and at Canonbury House in Islington.
                    In March 1640, though still a minor, he was elected for Tewkesbury, and sat in
                    the parliament which met on April 13, but appears to have taken no active part
                    in its proceedings. In 1640 Lord Coventry died, and Cooper then lived with his
                    brother-in-law at Dorchester House in Covent Garden. For the Long Parliament,
                    which met on November 3, 1640, he was elected for Downton in Wiltshire, but the
                    return was disputed, and he did not take his seat,—his election not being
                    declared valid until the last days of the Rump. He was present as a spectator at
                    the setting up of the king’s standard at Nottingham on August 25, 1642; and in
                    1643 he appeared openly on Charles’s side in Dorsetshire, where he raised at his
                    own expense a regiment of foot and a troop of horse of both of which he took the
                    command. He was also appointed governor of Weymouth, sheriff of Dorsetshire for
                    the king, and president of the king’s council of war in the county. In the
                    beginning of January 1644, however, for reasons which are variously reported by
                    himself and Clarendon, he resigned his governorship and commissions and went
                    over to the Parliament. He appeared on March 6 before the standing committee of
                    the two Houses to explain his conduct, when he stated that he had come over
                    because he saw danger to the Protestant religion in the king’s service, and
                    expressed his willingness to take the Covenant. In July 1644 he went to
                    Dorsetshire on military service, and on August 3 received a commission as
                    field-marshal general. He assisted at the taking of Wareham, and shortly
                    afterwards compounded for his estates by a fine of £500 from<pb break="no"

                    Cromwell. On October 25 he was made commander-in-chief in Dorsetshire, and in
                    November he took by storm Abbotsbury, the house of Sir John Strangways,—an
                    affair in which he appears to have shown considerable personal gallantry.</p>
                <p>In December he relieved Taunton. His military service terminated at the time of
                    the Self-denying Ordinance in 1645; he had associated himself with the
                    Presbyterian faction, and naturally enough was not included in the New Model.
                    For the next seven or eight years he lived in comparative privacy. He was high
                    sheriff of Wiltshire during 1647, and displayed much vigour in this office. Upon
                    the execution of Charles, Cooper took the Engagement, and was a commissioner to
                    administer it in Dorsetshire. On April 25, 1650, he married Lady Frances Cecil,
                    sister of the earl of Essex, his first wife having died in the previous year
                    leaving no family. In 1651 a son was born to him, who died in childhood, and on
                    January</p>
                <p>16, 1652, another son, named after himself, who was his heir. On January 17 he
                    was named on the commission for law reform, of which Hale was the chief; and on
                    March</p>
                <p>17, 1653, he was pardoned of all delinquency, and thus at last made capable of
                    sitting in parliament. He sat for Wiltshire in the Barebones parliament, of
                    which he was a leading member, and where he zealously and prudently supported
                    Cromwell’s views against the extreme section. He was at once appointed on the
                    council of thirty. On the resignation of this parliament he became a member of
                    the council of state named in the “Instrument.” In the first parliament elected
                    under this “Instrument” he sat for Wiltshire, having been elected also for Poole
                    and Tewkesbury, and was one of the commissioners for the ejection of unworthy
                    ministers. After December 28, 1654, for reasons which it is impossible to
                    ascertain with clearness, he left the privy council, and henceforward is found
                    with the Presbyterians and Republicans, in opposition to Cromwell. His second
                    wife had died during this year; in 1656 he married a third, who survived him,
                    Margaret, daughter of Lord Spencer, niece of the earl of Southampton, and sister
                    of the earl of Sunderland, who died at Newbury. By his three marriages he was
                    thus connected with many of the leading politicians of Charles II.’s reign.</p>
                <p>Cooper was again elected for Wiltshire for the parliament of 1656, but Cromwell
                    refused to allow him, with many others of his opponents, to sit. He signed a
                    letter of complaint, with sixty-five excluded members, to the speaker, as also a
                    “Remonstrance” addressed to the people. In the parliament which met on January
                    20, 1658, he took his seat, and was active in opposition to the new constitution
                    of the two Houses. He was also a leader of the opposition in Richard Cromwell’s
                    parliament, especially on the matter of the limitation of the power of the
                    Protector, and against the House of Lords. He was throughout these debates
                    celebrated for the “nervous and subtle oratory” which made him so formidable in
                    after days: he had “his tongue well hung, and words at will.”</p>
                <p>Upon the replacing of the Rump by the army, after the breaking up of Richard’s
                    parliament, Cooper endeavoured unsuccessfully to take his seat on the ground of
                    his former disputed election for Downton. He was, however, elected on the
                    council of state, and was the only Presbyterian in it; he was at once accused by
                    Scot, along with Whitelocke, of corresponding with Hyde. This he solemnly
                    denied. After the rising in Cheshire Cooper was arrested in Dorsetshire on a
                    charge of correspondence with its leader Booth, but on the matter being
                    investigated by the council he was unanimously acquitted. In the disputes
                    between Lambert at the head of the military party and the Rump in union with the
                    council of state, he supported the latter, and upon the temporary supremacy of
                    Lambert’s party worked indefatigably to restore the Rump. With Monk’s
                    commissioners he, with Haselrig, had a fruitless conference, but he assured Monk
                    of his co-operation, and joined with eight others of the overthrown council of
                    state in naming him commander-in-chief of the forces of England and Scotland. He
                    was instrumental in securing the Tower for the Parliament, and in obtaining the
                    adhesion of Admiral Lawson and the fleet. Upon the restoration of the Parliament
                    on December 26 Cooper was one of the commissioners to command the army, and on
                    January 2 was made one of the new council of state. On January 7 he took his
                    seat on his election for Downton in 1640, and was made colonel of Fleetwood’s
                    regiment of horse. He speedily secured the admission of the secluded members,
                    having meanwhile been in continual communication with Monk, was again one of the
                    fresh council of state, consisting entirely of friends of the Restoration, and
                    accepted from Monk a commission to be governor of the Isle of Wight and captain
                    of a company of foot. He now steadily pursued the design of the Restoration, but
                    without holding any private correspondence with the king, and only on terms
                    similar to those proposed in 1648 to Charles I. at the Isle of Wight. In the
                    Convention Parliament he sat for Wiltshire. Monk cut short these deliberations
                    and forced on the Restoration without condition. Cooper was one of the twelve
                    commissioners who went to Charles at Breda to invite him to return. On his
                    journey he was upset from his carriage, and the accident caused an internal
                    abscess which was never cured.</p>
                <p>Cooper was at once placed on the privy council, receiving also a formal pardon
                    for former delinquencies. His first duty was to examine the Anabaptist prisoners
                    in the Tower. In the prolonged discussions regarding the Bill of Indemnity he
                    was instrumental in saving the life of Haselrig, and opposed the clause
                    compelling all officers who had served under Cromwell to refund their salaries,
                    he himself never having had any. He showed indeed none of the grasping and
                    avaricious temper so common among the politicians of the time. He was one of the
                    commissioners for conducting the trials of the regicides, but was himself
                    vehemently “fallen upon” by Prynne for having acted with Cromwell. He was named
                    on the council of plantations and on that of trade. In the debate abolishing the
                    court of wards he spoke, like most landed proprietors, in favour of laying the
                    burden on the excise instead of on the land, and on the question of the
                    restoration of the bishops carried in the interests of the court an adjournment
                    of the debate for three months. At the coronation in April 1661 Cooper had been
                    made a peer, as Baron Ashley of Wimborne St Giles, in express recognition of his
                    services at the Restoration; and on the meeting of the new parliament in May he
                    was appointed chancellor of the exchequer and under-treasurer, aided no doubt by
                    his connexion with Southampton. He vehemently opposed the persecuting Acts now
                    passed,—the Corporation Act, the Uniformity Bill, against which he is said to
                    have spoken three hundred times, and the Militia Act. He is stated also to have
                    influenced the king in issuing his dispensing declaration of December 26, 1662,
                    and he zealously supported a bill introduced for the purpose of confirming the
                    declaration, rising thereby in favour and influence with Charles. He was himself
                    the author of a treatise on tolerance. He was now recognized as one of the chief
                    opponents of Clarendon and the High Anglican policy. On the breaking out of the
                    Dutch War in 1664 he was made treasurer of the prizes, being accountable to the
                    king alone for all sums received or spent. He was also one of the grantees of
                    the province of Carolina and took a leading part in its management; it was at
                    his request that Locke in 1669 drew up a constitution for the new colony. In
                        September<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n754/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0754-0729"/> 1665 the king unexpectedly paid him a visit
                    at Wimborne. He opposed unsuccessfully the appropriation proviso introduced into
                    the supply bill as hindering the due administration of finance, and this
                    opposition seems to have brought about a reconciliation with Clarendon. In 1668,
                    however, he supported a bill to appoint commissioners to examine the accounts of
                    the Dutch War, though in the previous year he had opposed it. In accordance with
                    his former action on all questions of religious toleration he strongly opposed
                    the shameful Five Mile Act of 1665. In 1667 he eagerly supported the bill for
                    prohibiting the importation of Irish cattle on the ground that it would lead to
                    a great fall of rents in England. Ashley was himself a large landowner, and
                    moreover was opposed to Ormonde who would have greatly benefited by the
                    importation. In all other questions of this kind he shows himself far in advance
                    of the economic fallacies of the day. His action led to an altercation with
                    Ossory, the son of Ormonde, in which Ossory used language for which he was
                    compelled to apologize. On the death of Southampton, Ashley was placed on the
                    commission of the treasury, Clifford and William Coventry being his principal
                    colleagues. He appears to have taken no part in the attempt to impeach Clarendon
                    on a general charge of treason.</p>
                <p>The new administration was headed by Buckingham, in whose toleration and
                    comprehension principles Ashley shared to the full. A most able paper written by
                    him to the king in support of these principles, on the ground especially of
                    their advantage to trade, has been preserved. He excepts, however, from
                    toleration Roman Catholics and Fifth Monarchy men. His attention to all trade
                    questions was close and constant; he was a member of the council of trade and
                    plantations appointed in 1670, and was its president from 1672 to 1676. The
                    difficulty of the succession also occupied him, and he co-operated thus early in
                    the design of legitimizing Monmouth as a rival to James. In the intrigues which
                    led to the infamous treaty of Dover he had no part. That treaty contained a
                    clause by which Charles was bound to declare himself a Catholic, and with the
                    knowledge of this Ashley, as a staunch Protestant, could not be trusted. In
                    order to blind him and the other Protestant members of the Cabal a sham treaty
                    was arranged in which this clause did not appear, and it was not until a
                    considerable while afterwards that he found out that he had been duped. Under
                    this misunderstanding he signed the sham Dover treaty on December 31, 1670. This
                    treaty, however, was carefully kept from public knowledge, and Ashley did not
                    hesitate to help Charles to hoodwink parliament by signing a similar treaty on
                    February 2, 1672, which was then laid before them as the only one in existence.
                    This is one of the proved dishonourable actions of his life. His approval of the
                    attempt of the Lords to alter a money bill led to the loss of the supply to
                    Charles and to the consequent displeasure of the king. His support of the Lord
                    Roos Act, ascribed generally to his desire to ingratiate himself with Charles,
                    was no doubt due in part to the fact that his son had married Lord Roos’s
                    sister. It is, too, necessary to notice that, so far from advising the “Stop of
                    the Exchequer,” he actively opposed this bad measure; the reasons which he left
                    with the king for his opposition are extant. The responsibility rests with
                    Clifford alone. In the other great measure of the Cabal ministry, Charles’s
                    Declaration of Indulgence, he cordially concurred. He was now rewarded by being
                    made Earl of Shaftesbury and Baron Cooper of Pawlett by a patent dated April 23,
                    1672. It is stated too that he was offered, but refused, the lord treasurership.
                    On November 17, 1672, however, he became lord chancellor, Bridgman having been
                    compelled to resign the seat. As chancellor he issued writs for the election of
                    thirty-six new members to fill vacancies caused during the long recess; this,
                    though grounded upon precedent, was certainly open to the gravest suspicion as
                    an attempt to fortify Charles, and was vehemently attacked by an angry House of
                    Commons which met on February 4, 1673. The writs were cancelled, and the
                    principle was established that the issuing of writs rested with the House
                    itself. It was at the opening of parliament that Shaftesbury made his celebrated
                    “delenda est Carthago” speech against Holland, in which he urged the Second
                    Dutch War, on the ground of the necessity of destroying so formidable a
                    commercial rival to England, excused the Stop of the Exchequer which he had
                    opposed, and vindicated the Declaration of Indulgence. On March 8 he announced
                    to parliament that the declaration had been cancelled, though he did his best to
                    induce Charles to remain firm. For affixing the great seal to this declaration
                    he was threatened with impeachment by the Commons. The Test Act was now brought
                    forward, and Shaftesbury, who appears to have heard how he had been duped in
                    1670, warmly supported it, with the object probably of thereby getting rid of
                    Clifford. He now began to be regarded as the chief upholder of Protestantism in
                    the ministry; he rapidly lost favour with Charles, and on Sunday, September 9,
                    1673, was dismissed from the chancellorship. Among the reasons for this
                    dismissal is probably the undoubted fact that he opposed reckless grants to the
                    king’s mistresses. He has been accused of much vanity and ostentation in his
                    office, but his reputation for ability and integrity as a judge was high even
                    with his enemies.</p>
                <p>Charles soon regretted the loss of Shaftesbury, and endeavoured, as did also
                    Louis, to induce him to return, but in vain. He preferred now to become the
                    great popular leader against all the measures of the court, and may be regarded
                    as the intellectual chief of the opposition. At the meeting of parliament on
                    January 8, 1674, he carried a motion for a proclamation banishing Catholics to a
                    distance of ten miles from London. During the whole session he organized and
                    directed the opposition in their attacks on the king’s ministers. On May 19 he
                    was dismissed the privy council and ordered to leave London. He hereupon retired
                    to Wimborne, from whence he urged upon his parliamentary followers the necessity
                    of securing a new parliament. He was in the House of Lords, however, in 1675,
                    when Danby brought forward his famous Non-resisting Test Bill, and headed the
                    opposition which was carried on for seventeen days, distinguishing himself, says
                    Burnet, more in this session than ever he had done before. The bill was finally
                    shelved, a prorogation having taken place in consequence of a quarrel between
                    the two Houses, supposed to have been purposely got up by Shaftesbury, in which
                    he vigorously supported the right of the Lords to hear appeal cases, even where
                    the defendant was a member of the Lower House. Parliament was prorogued for
                    fifteen months until February 15, 1677, and it was determined by the opposition
                    to attack its existence on the ground that a prorogation for more than a year
                    was illegal. In this matter the opposition were clearly in the wrong, and by
                    attacking the parliament discredited themselves. The immediate result was that
                    Shaftesbury, Buckingham, Wharton, and Salisbury were sent to the Tower. In June
                    Shaftesbury applied for a writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi> but
                    could get no release until February 26, 1678, after his letter and three
                    petitions to the king. Being brought before the bar of the House of Lords he at
                    length made a complete submission as to his conduct in declaring parliament
                    dissolved by the prorogation, and in violating the Lords’ privileges by bringing
                    a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> in the King’s Bench.</p>

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0755-0730"/> the worst part of Shaftesbury’s career. That
                    so clear-headed a man could have really credited the extravagant lies of Oates
                    and the other perjurers is beyond belief; and the manner in which by incessant
                    agitation he excited the most baseless alarms, and encouraged the wildest
                    excesses of fanatic cruelty, for nothing but party advantage, is utterly without
                    excuse. On November 2 he opened the great attack by proposing an address
                    declaring the necessity for the king’s dismissing James from his council. Under
                    his advice the opposition now made an alliance with Louis whereby the French
                    king promised to help them to ruin Danby on condition that they would compel
                    Charles, by stopping the supplies, to make peace with France, doing thus a grave
                    injury to Protestantism abroad for the sake of a temporary party advantage at
                    home. Upon the refusal in November of the Lords to concur in the address of the
                    Commons requesting the removal of the queen from court, he joined in a protest
                    against the refusal, and was foremost in all the violent acts of the session. He
                    urged on the bill by which Catholics were prohibited from sitting in either
                    House of Parliament, and was bitter in his expressions of disappointment when
                    the Commons passed a proviso excepting James, against whom the bill was
                    especially aimed, from its operation. A new parliament met on March 6, 1679.
                    Shaftesbury had meanwhile ineffectually warned the king that unless he followed
                    his advice there would be no peace with the people. On March 25 he made a
                    striking speech upon the state of the nation, especially upon the dangers to
                    Protestantism and the misgovernment of Scotland and Ireland. He was, too,
                    suspected of doing all in his power to bring about a revolt in Scotland. By the
                    advice of Temple, Charles now tried the experiment of forming a new privy
                    council in which the chief members of the opposition were included, and
                    Shaftesbury was made president, with a salary of £4000, being also a member of
                    the committee for foreign affairs. He did not, however, in any way change either
                    his opinions or his action. He vigorously opposed the compelling of Protestant
                    Nonconformists to take the. oath required of Roman Catholics. That indeed, as
                    Ranke says, which makes him memorable in English history is that he opposed the
                    establishment of an Anglican and Royalist organization with decisive success.
                    The question of the succession was now again prominent, and Shaftesbury, in
                    opposition to Halifax, committed the error, which really brought about his fall,
                    of putting forward Monmouth as his nominee, thus alienating a large number of
                    his supporters; he encouraged, too, the belief that this was agreeable to the
                    king. He pressed on the Exclusion Bill with all his power, and, when that and
                    the inquiry into the payments for secret service and the trial of the five
                    peers, for which too he had been eager, were brought to an end by a sudden
                    prorogation, he is reported to have declared aloud that he would have the heads
                    of those who were the king’s advisers to this course. Before the prorogation,
                    however, he saw the invaluable Act of Habeas Corpus, which he had carried
                    through parliament, receive the royal assent. In pursuance of his patronage of
                    Monmouth, Shaftesbury now secured for him the command of the army sent to
                    suppress the insurrection in Scotland, which he is supposed to have fomented. In
                    October 1679, the ‘circumstances which led Charles to desire to conciliate the
                    opposition having ceased, Shaftesbury was dismissed from his presidency and from
                    the privy council; when applied to by Sunderland to return to office he made as
                    conditions the divorce of the queen and the exclusion of James. With nine other
                    peers he presented a petition to the king in November, praying for the meeting
                    of parliament, of which Charles took no notice. In April, upon the king’s
                    declaration that he was resolved to send for James from Scotland, Shaftesbury
                    strongly advised the popular leaders at once to leave the council, and they
                    followed his advice. In March we find him unscrupulously eager in the
                    prosecution of the alleged Irish Catholic plot. Upon the king’s illness in May
                    he held frequent meetings of Monmouth’s friends at his house to consider how
                    best to act for the security of the Protestant religion. On June 26, accompanied
                    by fourteen others, he presented to the grand jury of Westminster an indictment
                    of the duke of York as a Popish recusant. In the middle of September he was
                    seriously ill. On November 15 the Exclusion Bill, having passed the Commons, was
                    brought up to the Lords, and an historic debate took place, in which Halifax and
                    Shaftesbury were the leaders on opposite sides. The bill was thrown out, and
                    Shaftesbury signed the protest against its rejection. The next day he urged upon
                    the House the divorce of the queen. On December 7, to his lasting dishonour, lie
                    voted for the condemnation of Lord Stafford. On the 23d he again spoke
                    vehemently for exclusion, and his speech was immediately printed. All opposition
                    was, however, checked by the dissolution on January 18. A new parliament was
                    called to meet at Oxford, to avoid the influences of the city of London, where
                    Shaftesbury had taken the greatest pains to make himself popular. Shaftesbury,
                    with fifteen other peers, at once petitioned the king that it might as usual be
                    held in the capital. He prepared, too, instructions to be handed by
                    constituencies to their members upon election, in which exclusion, disbanding,
                    the limitation of the prerogative in proroguing and dissolving parliament, and
                    security against Popery and arbitrary power were insisted on. At this
                    parliament, which lasted but a few days, he again made a personal appeal to
                    Charles, which was curtly rejected, to permit the legitimizing of Monmouth. The
                    king’s advisers now urged him to arrest Shaftesbury; he was seized on July 2,
                    1681, and committed to the Tower, the judges refusing his petition to be tried
                    or admitted to bail. This refusal was twice repeated in September and October,
                    the court hoping to obtain evidence sufficient to ensure his ruin. In October he
                    wrote offering to retire to Carolina if he were released. On November 24 he was
                    indicted for high treason at the Old Bailey, the chief ground being a paper of
                    association for the defence of the Protestant religion, which, though among his
                    papers, was not in his handwriting; but the grand jury ignored the bill. He was
                    released on bail on December 1. In 1682, however, Charles secured the
                    appointment of Tory sheriffs for London; and, as the juries were chosen by the
                    sheriffs, Shaftesbury felt that he was no longer safe from the vengeance of the
                    court. Failing health and the disappointment of his political plans led him now
                    into violent courses. He appears to have entered into consultation of a
                    treasonable kind with Monmouth and others; he himself had, he declared, ten
                    thousand brisk boys in London ready to rise at his bidding. For some weeks he
                    was concealed in the city and in Wapping; but, finding the schemes for a rising
                    hang fire, he determined to flee. He went to Harwich, disguised as a
                    Presbyterian minister, and after a week’s delay, during which he was in imminent
                    risk of discovery, if indeed, as is very probable, his escape was not winked at
                    by the Government, he sailed to Holland on November 28, 1682, and reached
                    Amsterdam in the beginning of December. Here he was welcomed with the jest,
                    referring to his famous speech against the Dutch, "nondum deleta Carthago.” He
                    was made a citizen of Amsterdam, but died there of gout in the stomach on
                    January 21, 1683. His body was sent in February to Poole, in Dorset, and was
                    buried at Wimborne St Giles.</p>

                    scathing, if venal, satire; and Dryden’s satire has been accepted as truth by
                    later historians. Macaulay in especial has exerted all his art, though in
                    flagrant contradiction of probability and fact, to deepen still further the
                    shade which rests upon his reputation. Mr Christie, on the other hand, in
                    possession of later sources of information, and with more honest purpose, has
                    done much to rehabilitate him. Occasionally, however, he appears to hold a brief
                    for the defence, and, though his picture is comparatively a true one, should be
                    read with caution. Finally, in his monograph in the series of “English
                    Worthies,” Mr H. D. Traill professes to hold the scales equally. He makes an
                    interesting addition to our conception of Shaftesbury’s place in English
                    politics, by insisting on his position as the first great party leader in the
                    modern sense, and as the founder of modern parliamentary oratory. In other
                    respects his book is derived almost entirely from Christie. Much of
                    Shaftesbury’s career, increasingly so as it came near its close, is incapable of
                    defence; but it has escaped his critics that his life up to the Restoration,
                    apparently full of inconsistencies, was evidently guided by one leading
                    principle, the determination to uphold the supremacy of parliament, a principle
                    which, however obscured by self-interest, appears also to have underlain his
                    whole political career. He was, too, ever the friend of religious freedom and of
                    an enlightened policy in all trade questions. And, above all, it should not be
                    forgotten, in justice to Shaftesbury’s memory, that “during his long political
                    career, in an age of general corruption, he was ever incorrupt, and never
                    grasped either money or land. In the days of the Commonwealth he never obtained
                    or sought grants of forfeited estates. In the days of the restored monarchy he
                    never profited by the king’s favour for aught beyond the legal emoluments of
                    office, and in office or out of office spurned all and many offers of bribes
                    from the French king.” (O. A.)</p>
