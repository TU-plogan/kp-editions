                <p><label type="entry">SEPTICAeMIA</label>. After a wound, whether the result of
                    accident or of operation by the surgeon, blood-poisoning may occur. Sepsis or
                    putrefaction in the wound is the most evident local condition which has been
                    associated by clinical observers with blood-poisoning, and hence the term
                    “septicaemia.” Within recent years the relation of microorganisms to the
                    different forms of blood-poisoning has come prominently into notice;
                    putrefaction is now known to be only one of the fermentative changes due to the
                    presence of certain micro-organisms in a wound, and it is admitted that there
                    are many organisms which, when they enter a wound, may give rise there to
                    fermentative changes that are non-putrefactive. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Schizomycetes.)</hi></p>
                <p>Organisms have recently been divided into two great groups,—those which can only
                    grow in dead or decaying matter and those which can grow in the living tissues
                    and in the blood, which in this relation must be looked upon as a tissue. The
                    first group has been termed “saprophytic.” The second group may be termed
                    “pathogenic,” to distinguish them from the saprophytic variety. But no distinct
                    line of demarcation can yet be drawn between these two groups, and as a matter
                    of fact some pathogenic organisms may equally with the saprophytic find a
                    pabulum in dead and decaying matter. Yet there can be no doubt that the more
                    common varieties of septic organisms or saprophytes can only grow in dead or
                    decaying matter, and that the living tissues, more especially when their power
                    of vitality is great, are able to resist and destroy the saprophytes. There are
                    also some organisms which, as far as is known at present, may be innocuous and
                    give rise to no symptoms, local or general, when they are implanted in the human
                    body. When an organism finds in the tissues a fit pabulum for its growth and
                    development, the elements in the tissue are broken up, and the products are
                    termed a “ptomaine” (τrτω∕χα). This ptomaine may irritate the wound and prevent
                    healing; it may also be absorbed into the blood and poison it, hence the term
                    “ptomaine poisoning.” Both the saprophytic and the pathogenic organism may form
                    a ptomaine in the wound. When the wound is due to a saprophyte the absorption of
                    the ptomaine has been termed “sapraemia”; the ptomaine of the saprophyte has
                    been called “sepsin.” No special name has yet been given to the ptomaine formed
                    in the wound by the pathogenic organism; nor has any name been given to the
                    condition due to the absorption of the ptomaine formed by the pathogenic
                    organism. Our knowledge is not yet sufficient to enable us to separate these two
                    varieties of ptomaine poisoning. There can, however, be little doubt that they
                    do exist as separate conditions, and also there can be little doubt that in some
                    instances both forms of poisoning may be present at one and the same time.</p>
                <p>The pathogenic organism, however, has another power which gives rise to an
                    entirely separate condition. Not only may it form its ptomaine in the wound, but
                    the organism itself can enter into and be carried by the bloodstream and
                    lymph-stream to distant parts. It can live in the blood or lymph-stream and can
                    grow there: it may be arrested in the capillaries of the blood-vessels, or in
                    the lymphatic glands of the lymph-vessels, and in these situations may form, so
                    to speak, a colony of organisms which develop and form ptomaines; and the
                    ptomaines, passing into the blood, may still further poison the patient. This
                    power of the pathogenic organism is infective, and the term “infection” has been
                    applied to the process. These colonies or secondary foci of infection often go
                    on to suppuration; hence the term “secondary” applied to the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n692/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0692-0667"/> abscesses which have long been observed in some
                    forms of blood-poisoning. It was at one time thought that the pus-cells in the
                    original wound passed into the blood, and, being caught in the capillaries, were
                    the cause of the abscess-formation in the parts distant from the wound; hence
                    the term “pyaemia” or pus in the blood. The pus-cells may enter the
                    blood-stream; it is not, however, the cellular element that is the essence of
                    the condition, but the organism which the cellular element may carry along with
                    it. The hectic condition observed in a case of long-continued suppuration is in
                    all probability a chronic form of blood-poisoning. In very acute cases, in which
                    the poison is either concentrated, virulent, or in large quantity, death may
                    occur within a very few hours. In other cases the condition may become chronic,
                    and if the strength of the patient can be kept up by stimulants recovery often
                    takes place. The chances of recovery are much greater when the condition is not
                    truly an infective one. When the manufactory of the ptomaine is only in the
                    wound, the organism may be there destroyed by the use of powerful antiseptics or
                    antifermentatives. The primary cause being removed, the patient may then be
                    saved. When, however, the pathogenic organism gets into the bloodstream and
                    distant foci of infection are formed, the chances of ultimate recovery are
                    greatly diminished. Various unsuccessful attempts have been made by the internal
                    administration of antifermentatives so to alter the blood that the
                    micro-organism cannot find in it or the tissues a fit nidus. The point to attend
                    to is to prevent organismal fermentation in wounds by careful antiseptic or
                    rather antifermentative precautions. Just as the word “septicaemia” has a more
                    general application than can now be strictly allowed if we look to the
                    derivation of the word and the present state of our knowledge, so the word
                    “antiseptic” is applied to all substances which prevent organismal fermentation,
                    although many of these organisms are undoubtedly non-septic in their
                    character.</p>
