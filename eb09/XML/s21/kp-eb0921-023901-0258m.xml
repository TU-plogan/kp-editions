                <p><label type="entry">SALWIN HILL TRACTS</label>, a district in the Tenasserim
                    division of British Burmah, extending from the northern portion of the province
                    southwards to Kaw-ka-rit on the Salwin river, and occupying the whole of the
                    country between that river on the east and the Poung-loung mountains on the
                    west. The district contains an area of about 4646 square miles, and is bounded
                    on the north by the Kareng-ni state, on the east by Zeng-mai, on the south by
                    Amherst and Shwe-gyeng and on the west by Shwe-gyeng and Toung-gnú. From the
                    annexation of Pegu until 1872 the Hill Tracts formed a subdivision of the
                    Shwe-gyeng district, but in that year it was constituted into a separate
                    jurisdiction. Nearly the whole district is a mass of mountains intersected by
                    deep ravines, the only level land of any considerable extent being found in the
                    valley of the Rwon-za-leng, while every part of the country is covered with
                    dense forest.</p>
                <p>The Hill Tracts are drained by three principal rivers, the Salwin, Rwon-za-leng,
                    and Bhi-leng, fed by numerous mountain torrents which rush down narrow ravines.
                    The Salwin is the largest river in the Tenasserim division. Its source has never
                    been explored, but it appears to take its rise far north in the Himalayas or in
                    the mountains which form their extension eastward. After traversing the Chinese
                    province of Yunnan and the Shan and Kareng-ni states to the south, it enters
                    British Burmah at its extreme northeastern corner, and for some distance marks
                    the eastern limits of the province. It has a known course of about 700 miles,
                    but its breadth seldom exceeds 100 yards, and in some parts the bed does not
                    occupy more than 30 yards. The Salwin is greatly obstructed by rapids, and is
                    not navigable by large craft for more than 100 miles from its mouth. The
                    Rwon-za-leng, which rises in the extreme north, is navigable with some
                    difficulty in the dry season as far as Pa-pwon, the administrative headquarters;
                    the Bhi-leng is not navigable within the limits of the district except by small
                    boats and rafts.</p>
                <p>Of the total area of the district only 21 square miles are cultivated; the chief
                    crops are rice and betel-nuts. The revenue of Salwin amounted in 1883-84 to only
                    £1964, of which £940 were raised from the land-tax. The population in 1881 was
                    returned at 30,009 (males 15,509, females 14,500).</p>
