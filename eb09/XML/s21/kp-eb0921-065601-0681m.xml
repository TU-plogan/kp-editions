                    (1725-1791), ecclesiastical historian and critic, sometimes called “the father
                    of German rationalism” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rationalism),</hi> was born at
                    Saalfeld in Thuringia on 18th December 1725. He was the son of a clergyman in
                    poor circumstances, and had to fight his way in the world solely by his own
                    talents. He grew up amidst Pietistic surroundings, which powerfully influenced
                    him his life through, though he was never spiritually or intellectually a
                    Pietist. As a boy he showed the omnivorous appetite for books which was
                    characteristic of his later life. In his seventeenth year he entered the
                    university of Halle, where he became the disciple, afterwards the assistant, and
                    at last the literary executor of the orthodox rationalistic Professor
                    Baumgarten. In 1749 he accepted the position of editor, with the title of
                    professor, of the Coburg official <hi rend="italic">Gazette,</hi> with leisure
                    to pursue historical and scientific studies. But the next year he was invited to
                    Altdorf as professor of philology and history, and six months later became a
                    professor of theology in Halle. After the death of Baumgarten (1757) Semler
                    became the head of the theological faculty of his university, and the fierce
                    opposition which his writings and lectures provoked only helped to increase his
                    fame as a professor. His popularity continued undiminished for more than twenty
                    years, until 1779. In that year he came forward with a reply to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wolfenbüttel Fragments</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Reimarus)</hi> and to Bahrdt’s confession of faith, a step which was
                    interpreted by the extreme rationalists as a revocation of his own rationalistic
                    position. Even the Prussian Government, which favoured Bahrdt, made Semler
                    painfully feel its displeasure at this new but really not inconsistent aspect of
                    his position. But, though Semler was really not inconsistent with himself in
                    attacking the views of Reimarus and Bahrdt, as a comparison of his works prior
                    and subsequent to 1779 with those in question shows, his popularity began from
                    that year to decline, and towards the end of his life he felt painfully the
                    necessity of emphasizing the apologetic and conservative value of true
                    historical inquiry. With more justification, perhaps, might his defence of the
                    notorious edict of Wöllner (1788), the cultus minister, be cited as a sign of
                    the decline of his powers and of an unfaithfulness to his principles. He died at
                    Halle on 14th</p>
                <p>March 1791, worn out by his prodigious labours, embittered by his desertion, and
                    disappointed at the issue of his work.</p>
                <p>Sender’s importance in the history of theology and the human mind is that of a
                    critic of Biblical and ecclesiastical documents and of the history of dogmas. He
                    was not a philosophical thinker or theologian, though he insisted, more or less
                    confusedly, and yet with an energy and persistency before unknown, on certain
                    distinctions of great importance when properly worked out and applied, <hi
                    rend="italic">c.g.,</hi> the distinction between religion and theology, that
                    between private personal beliefs and public historical creeds, and that between
                    the local and temporal and the permanent elements of historical religion. His
                    great work was that of the critic. He was the first to reject with sufficient
                    proof the equal value of the Old and the New Testaments, the uniform authority
                    of all parts of the Bible, the divine authority of the traditional canon of
                    Scripture, the inspiration and supposed correctness of the text of the Old and
                    New Testaments, and, generally, the identification of revelation with Scripture.
                    Though to some extent anticipated by the English deist Thomas Morgan, Semler was
                    the first to take due note of and use for critical purposes the opposition
                    between the Judaic and anti-Judaic parties of the early church. He led the way
                    in the task of discovering the origin of the Gospels, the Epistles, the Acts of
                    the Apostles, and the Apocalypse. He revived previous doubts as to the direct
                    Pauline origin of the Epistle to the Hebrews, called in question Peter’s
                    authorship of the first epistle, and referred the second epistle to the end of
                    the 2d century. He wished to remove the Apocalypse altogether from the canon. In
                    textual criticism Semler pursued further the principle of classifying MSS. in
                    families, adopted by R. Simon and Bengel. Though he lacked almost every
                    qualification of the true church historian, Semler did the work of a pioneer in
                    many periods and in several departments of ecclesiastical history. Tholuck
                    pronounces him “the father of the history of doctrines” and Baur " the first to
                    deal with that history from the true critical standpoint.” At the same time, it
                    is admitted by all that he was nowhere more than a pioneer. Baur’s description
                    of his work in one department of ecclesiastical history is true of his work
                    generally. “His writings on the history of dogma resemble a fallow-field waiting
                    to be cultivated or a building-site on which, underneath refuse and ruins, lie
                    the materials in chaotic confusion for a new edifice. The consequence was that
                    as he was always occupied in preliminary labours, he brought nothing to even
                    partial completion; and, though his general critical standpoint was correct, in
                    its application to details his criticism could only be regarded as extremely
                    bold and arbitrary.”</p>
                <p>Tholuck gives 171 as the number of Sender’s works, of which only two reached a
                    second edition, and none is now read for its own sake. Amongst the chief are—
