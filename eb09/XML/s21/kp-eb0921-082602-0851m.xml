                <p><label type="entry">SHIPPING</label>. The island of Britain (to the shipping of
                    which the present historical notice is mainly restricted) is well fitted to
                    serve as a commercial depot, both by the number of its natural harbours and the
                    variety of its products. There is evidence that Phoenician traders visited it
                    for tin, and in after times it served as one of the granaries of the Roman
                    empire. On the other hand raw wool was the staple article of commerce in the
                    Middle Ages, while the supremacy of English manufactures in modern days has
                    contributed to the development of British shipping till it has grown out of all
                    comparison with anything in ancient or mediaeval times.</p>
                <p>Britain must have been one of the most distant points that was visited by
                    Phoenician or Carthaginian ships. Adventurous as their sailors were when
                    compared with those of other races, and ready as they were to carry on trading
                    on behalf of neighbouring states, it is not clear that they ever sailed across
                    the Indian Ocean or ventured beyond the Persian Gulf, even in the service of the
                    Egyptians (Brugsch). Their coasting habits led to the settlement of a chain of
                    colonies along the Mediterranean shores, and that sea was wide enough to form a
                    convenient barrier between the Greek and the Carthaginian settlements. When
                    their empire was at length destroyed the Romans became the heirs of their
                    enterprise, but do not appear to have pushed maritime adventure much further or
                    opened out many new commercial connexions.</p>
                <p>Though the Angle and Saxon tribes were doubtless skilled both in shipbuilding and
                    in the management of their vessels at the time when they conquered Britain,
                    these arts had greatly decayed during the four centuries that elapsed before the
                    time of Alfred, who endeavoured to improve on existing models <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Eng. Chron.,</hi> 897). Hence the necessity of resisting the Danes, with the
                    subsequent fusion of Danish and other elements in our nationality, may be taken
                    as marking the period when English shipping had its rise. Apart from incidental
                    notices of communication with other lands, there is clear evidence, from the
                    early English laws, of efforts to encourage commerce, particularly in the status
                    which was accorded to traders and the protection afforded to merchant ships. The
                    whole of these arrangements seem to imply that the merchant was the owner of the
                    vessel, who “adventured” with his cargo, and sailed in his ship himself; but
                    these voyages were probably undertaken for the most part to ports on the other
                    side of the Channel, as it does not appear that English ships penetrated to the
                    Mediterranean till the time of the crusades.</p>
                <p>The steady development of English shipping during the Norman and early.
                    Plantagenet reigns may be inferred from the more frequent intercommunication
                    with the Continent and the many evidences of the increasing importance of the
                    commercial classes and trading towns. In the time of Edward III. the shipping
                    interest suffered a temporary check from the removal of the staple to England, a
                    step which was taken with the view of attracting foreign merchants to visit
                    England (1353). This policy, however, was soon reversed, and the reign of that
                    monarch was on the whole favourable to the development of shipping. He was
                    himself fond of the sea, and commanded in person in naval engagements, and by
                    taking possession of Calais and enforcing his sovereignty over the narrow seas
                    he rendered the times more favourable for the development of commerce. More than
                    one of the noble families of England have descended from the merchant princes of
                    the 14th century. By this time also the compass, which had been introduced in a
                    rude form as early as the 12th century, had been improved and had come into
                    common use. But many years were to elapse before the enterprise of the 15th and
                    16th centuries made the most of the new facilities for undertaking long voyages;
                    and the fortunes of English shipping, as depicted by a contemporary <hi
                    rend="italic">(Libell of Englishe Policy,</hi> 1436), continued to vary
                    according to the state of political connexions with the Continent and the
                    success of English monarchs in “keeping the narrow seas” free from the ravages
                    of pirates. During this century, too, we hear far more of organizations of
                    merchants to foreign parts, and of struggles between different bodies of
                    traders. The “Merchants of the Staple” dealt in raw wool and the other staple
                    commodities of the realm, which they exported to Calais; the “Merchant
                    Adventurers,” a powerful association which had developed out of a religious
                    guild, dealt chiefly in woollen cloths, but they traded with any port where they
                    could get a footing. This brought them into frequent collision with the
                    “Merchants of the House,” who had had a footing in London since before the
                    Conquest. The chief attempt at accommodation took place in the time of Edward
                    IV. (1474), but the quarrels and reprisals continued till the discovery of the
                    New World had revolutionized trade, and the Hanse League, expelled by Elizabeth,
                    were unable either to injure or to compete with English shipping.</p>
                <p>Considering the interest which all the Tudor monarchs showed in developing
                    shipping,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    Raleigh, Drake, and other sailors, it is remarkable that England obtained so
                    little footing at first in the new lands which were discovered by Columbus
                    (1492) or along the route that was<pb break="no"

                    inherited much of the commercial empires of Spain, Portugal, Holland, and
                    France, but there was still comparatively little permanent acquisition, or
                    establishment of trading factories, at the close of the 16th century. The fact
                    was that such undertakings were beyond the power of private traders, and that
                    Elizabeth was too penurious to make an attempt on such a scale as to command
                    success. It was by the formation of companies that the difficulty was at length
                    overcome, and that associated traders, or traders working on a joint stock, were
                    able to establish factories in foreign parts, and thus to give a new impetus to
                    English shipping. The African Company and others were failures, but there were
                    many which had a long and successful career. The Levant Company was established
                    in 1581, and had factories at Smyrna. The Eastland Company traded with the
                    Baltic; it was established in 1579, and had factories in Prussia The Hudson’s
                    Bay Company is much more recent, and only dates from 1670. But by far the
                    greatest of these undertakings was the East India Company, which was founded in
                    1600, and which, after a long struggle with commercial rivals at home and Dutch
                    competitors abroad, attained at length to the sovereignty of a large empire. The
                    chief cause of complaint against this company in the early stages of its
                    existence lay in the fact that it was a joint-stock company, and that therefore
                    the proprietors had a monopoly of a valuable trade; the greater part of the
                    other companies were regulated companies, and membership was open to any British
                    subject who liked to pay the entrance fees and join with other merchants. The
                    merchants thus associated agreed to abide by certain specified conditions, so as
                    not to spoil the markets for one another, but develop the trade in which all
                    were interested in a manner which should be advantageous to all. The Levant
                    Company and Merchant Adventurers were regulated companies, and they led the
                    attack on the East India Company as the monopoly of a few which injured the
                    trade of other merchants. The controversy raged during the reigns of James I.
                    and Charles I., and many of the leading merchants of the time—Mun, Malynes,
                    Misselden, as well as Wheeler, the secretary of the Merchant Adventurers—took
                    part in it. The advocates of the East India trade argued that, owing to the
                    immense distance of their factories and the special difficulties of maintaining
                    their position abroad, it was impossible to carry on their trade except on the
                    joint-stock principle, and their plea prevailed in the long run.</p>
                <p>The Merchant Adventurers and the whole system of regulated companies is less
                    familiar to us in the present day, and it may be worth while to indicate the
                    sort of regulations which were imposed on the members. One series of rules was
                    directed at regulating the total export trade of certain classes of goods to the
                    chief Continental ports, so that the markets abroad might not be overstocked,
                    and that they might always be able to get remunerative prices. Other regulations
                    allotted the proportion of goods which each member of the company should export,
                    and the terms as to credit and so forth on which he should deal. Each factory
                    was carefully regulated so as to secure a respectable and orderly life among the
                    merchants resident abroad; none of them were to do business during the times of
                    public preaching or on fast-days; and there was a curious administrative system
                    by which the compliance of the members with these regulations was enforced.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wheeler in Brit. Mus. Add.
                    MS. 18913.</p></note></p>
                <p>Those English merchants who traded to towns where the Adventurers had a factory,
                    but did not comply with their regulations, were stigmatized as “interlopers,”
                    and they were greatly disliked by the regular traders, as they were accused of
                    spoiling the market in various ways and, generally speaking, trading on any
                    terms for an immediate advantage without regard to the steady and regular
                    development of commerce. At a later time, there were interlopers within the East
                    India Company’s territories also.</p>
                <p>The formation of these large companies for the purpose of undertaking long
                    voyages marks a great revolution in the shipping of the country. The
                    differentiation of the mercantile and defensive navy became more complete. There
                    had of course been a certain number of royal ships from a very early time (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Navy),</hi> but the fleet had not been regularly maintained
                    in the 15th century, and the defence of the realm was practically left to
                    individuals or associations. As late as the time of Elizabeth we find that the
                    same thing was the case, and that the fleet which harassed the Armada consisted
                    very largely of merchant ships. In the time of the naval wars with Holland,
                    however, this is greatly changed, and the navy was much more effectively
                    organized and regularly maintained. But even when the royal navy was thus
                    organized it was felt that its continued effectiveness must depend on the
                    maintenance of merchant shipping. The two were still interconnected, and just
                    because special importance was attached to this arm as a means of defence there
                    was a great deal of legislation for the purpose of indirectly promoting shipping
                    and providing seamen. This was one of the aspects in which the prosperity of
                    British fisheries was specially attended to; the consumption of fish was
                    stimulated by insisting on the observance of Lent and of weekly fasts on
                    Wednesdays and Fridays, when “the eating of fish was required politically and
                    not spiritually” 5 Eliz. c. 5, § 13, 1 Jas. I. c. 29), and this was principally
                    done as a means of inducing men to take to a seafaring life, and so to fit
                    themselves for the defence of the country and for the manning of our merchant
                    ships.</p>
                <p>Considerable progress had also been made both in the art of sailing and in the
                    building of ships. The vessels which composed the fleets of the crusaders appear
                    to have been for the most part galleys, provided with a double row of oars; the
                    huge prows which gave a superiority in hand-to-hand fighting with a grappled
                    vessel were of no advantage when the use of cannon had revolutionized naval
                    warfare. We thus find that the ships of this period were built on a different
                    model, and many inducements were held out to those who built large ships. Both
                    Elizabeth and Charles offered bounties for the building of larger craft (100 and
                    200 tons); in 1597 800 tons was the largest vessel that an English yard turned
                    out. The legislature also was most assiduous in endeavouring to encourage this
                    industry. The importation of naval stores of all kinds, the growth of hemp for
                    cordage and of timber, were matters of constant care, both in England itself and
                    in the policy which was dictated to her colonies.</p>
                <p>It is easy enough to see that in these cases the encouragement of shipping was
                    undertaken as an indirect means of increasing the power of the country, and the
                    same thing is true of the complicated arrangements that were made for giving
                    special inducements to trade in particular articles or with particular
                    countries. Every one is of course familiar with the fact that during the 17th
                    and 18th centuries efforts were made to regulate trade so that gold and silver
                    might be brought into England. It is unnecessary to enumerate the expedients
                    that were adopted at different times, or to discuss the vexed question as to how
                    far those who advocated the system were in error. There can be no doubt that the
                    possession of a treasure was vastly important for political purposes, and that
                    trade was the only means by which a state which possessed no mines could procure
                    treasure; and it is of course possible that some of the mercantilists laid too
                    much stress on the desirability for political purposes of amassing wealth in
                    this form. But the fundamental principle of this system of commercial policy lay
                    in the connexion which was felt to exist between trade and industry. Trade, it
                    was said, stimulated industry by providing a new market for its products. If two
                    countries trade together, each will stimulate the trade of the other to some
                    extent, but, if England<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n853/mode/1up"

                    manufactured cloth from England, then the operation of trade between them is
                    such that Portugal stimulates English industry and sets English labour in motion
                    to a far larger extent than English consumption stimulates that of Portugal; it
                    was believed that this relative stimulus might be detected by examining the
                    balance of trade, and that, if by an ingenious adjustment of duties the balance
                    could be kept in her favour, the trade would be benefiting England more than it
                    stimulated the progress of her possible rivals. In the present day we look at
                    the volume of trade and trust that both are gainers; in those centuries they
                    looked at the kind of gain that accrued and tried to ensure that England gained
                    more than her possible enemies. Thus it was generally held that by commercial
                    intercourse between England and France the French gained relatively more than
                    the English; to the legislators of the time it seemed desirable to impose such
                    conditions as should alter this state of affairs, or, if no agreement could be
                    come to on the terms of a treaty, the trade should be stopped altogether, lest
                    by continuing to overbalance England in trade the French should be enabled to
                    overbalance her in power. These ideas of commercial policy dominated the whole
                    of British legislation for shipping<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    17th century till after the Napoleonic wars; the preference which was given to
                    English ships, English built and English manned, was enforced in a manner that
                    was prejudicial to the development of the colonies by the Navigation Act of
                    1651, aud was subsequently embodied in the orders in council. But these ideas
                    are expressed most clearly in such discussions as those regarding the Methven
                    treaty with Portugal. Without attempting to advocate a system of which the
                    unwisdom has become patent in our own day, it may yet be worth while to note
                    that it was during this regime that England acquired her position as the great
                    shipping nation of the world, and passed the Dutch and French in the struggle
                    for naval supremacy. Napoleon gave unconscious testimony to the effectiveness of
                    the commercial policy for building up the strength of the nation when he sought
                    to humble England, not by direct attack, but by destroying the trade and
                    shipping by means of which she had raised herself to power.</p>
                <p>This policy of subordinating the interests of shipping as a trade and means by
                    which merchants acquired wealth to the policy and power of the nation as a whole
                    had another side. Revenue for war expenses was furnished almost entirely by the
                    mother country; neither Ireland nor the colonies contributed at all largely to
                    the burden of maintaining the national struggle with Continental rivals. Hence
                    it was undesirable that these dependencies should develop at the expense of the
                    mother country, as by so doing they would reduce the fund from which parliament
                    drew for the expenses of the realm. Hence, while England was always willing to
                    develop resources or industries—like the linen trade in Ireland —which did not
                    compete with and could not undersell existing English manufactures, her
                    politicians were unwilling to allow her dependencies to become her competitors
                    in trade so long as they did not co-operate in maintaining power. Hence the
                    galling restrictions to which the Irish and the colonists were subjected, both
                    with regard to the development of some of their resources and the carrying on of
                    profitable trade with other colonies or foreign countries. But it must not be
                    forgotten that English merchants suffered in the same sort of way, as changes of
                    political relations at once brought about changes in the conditions of trade,
                    and that in at least one case the interests of enterprising farmers at home were
                    set aside in favour of protecting an established industry in the colonics. The
                    subordination of the craftsman and trader interest to the public policy of the
                    realm brought about a system of galling regulations which pressed hardly on many
                    persons, though they were most obviously baneful to Ireland and the colonists,
                    who had not so much interest in the political objects for which their wealth was
                    sacrificed.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to attempt to illustrate in detail the application of these
                    principles; it only remains to add that, whether in spite of these regulations
                    or because of them, the shipping of England increased vastly during the 18th
                    century. This was partly due to the greater facilities which were granted for
                    procuring capital for trading ventures. In mediaeval times a merchant could
                    hardly obtain the command of additional capital, unless by means of a temporary
                    partnership, or loans on bottomry; but the objection to usury was fast giving
                    way, and the public were willing to lend capital and to share in the profits of
                    trading. The practice of trading on borrowed capital, and of obtaining temporary
                    loans from goldsmiths, was common enough all through the 17th century, but the
                    development of the banking system and the new forms of credit which thus became
                    available gave still greater scope to the enterprising shipper. The full fruits
                    of the new power were only shown, however, in the beginning of the 18th century,
                    when the rivalry of the Old and New East India Companies and the story of the
                    Darien expedition and the South Sea Bubble show how willing the British public
                    were to pour their capital into trading undertakings. Among the companies which
                    were started about this period there were two which have exercised a most
                    salutary influence on British shipping. The Royal Exchange Assurance (6 Geo. I.
                    c. 18) and the London Assurance revolutionized the whole system of marine
                    assurance, and did so much to relieve skippers from the losses they suffered
                    through the risks of commerce as to give considerable encouragement to the
                    business. The plantations were developing into important settlements; the
                    British merchant had outdone his Dutch rivals; and the East India Company was
                    pursuing its course of progress in the East. There can be no wonder that, with
                    so many opportunities for trading, and such new facilities for obtaining capital
                    and assuring against risk, the shipping of the country developed during the 18th
                    century. It is unnecessary to dwell on the shocks it received at the time when
                    the American colonies asserted their independence (27 and 28 Geo. III.) or in
                    the life and death struggle of the Napoleonic wars. The difficulty of recasting
                    the restrictive system under which English merchants plied their trade was very
                    great, and when it broke down in regard to America and Ireland (20 Geo. III. cc.
                    6, 10) it was becoming apparent that its days were numbered. The doctrines
                    preached by Adam Smith soon began to bear fruit; the practical difficulty of
                    regulating commerce rendered politicians more willing to let it regulate itself;
                    and the controversy between the exclusive companies aud the interlopers or
                    independent merchants once more came to the front. It was during the reign of
                    George IV. that the old system was practically abandoned and that the greater
                    part of the old companies were dissolved, and trade to all parts of Africa, to
                    the Levant, and to China became open to all British subjects. The East India
                    Company maintained its position in part despite its many critics for another
                    half century, and tho peculiar conditions of the trade of the Hudson’s Bay
                    Company have made it desirable to maintain that privileged corporation till the
                    present time.</p>
                <p>It became still more obvious that the old policy of regulating the commerce of
                    the country in the supposed interests of its power was being abandoned when
                    Huskisson reformed the tariff in 1825. The measure he succeeded in carrying was
                    not so thoroughgoing as the one he proposed, but its principle was that tho
                    customs duties should bo levied for revenue objects only, and not with the view
                    of maintaining British merchants in one particular employment of their capital.
                    Later the repeal of the corn laws (1846) and navigation laws (1849) removed the
                    last vestiges of the old commercial policy which had ruled over the development
                    of British shipping almost from the earliest times, but which had been steadily
                    and systematically pursued for three hundred years.</p>
                <p>It was thus that Adam Smith’s criticisms worked so effectively as to realize his
                    dreams at no great interval of time. His deeper reasons for objecting to the
                    commercial system of the 18th century lay in the fact that the colonial trade
                    and shipping altogether seemed to him to have received an unhealthy stimulus,
                    and that the country would be in a sounder economic position if capital were
                    employed at home in developing native resources, and foreign trade built upon a
                    foundation of highly developed native industry. But the removal of the stimulus
                    did not have the effect he anticipated, or restore the “balance” between
                    industry and shipping. England is far more dependent than ever before on her
                    relations with foreign countries, and therefore on her shipping, for the
                    materials of her manufacture and her food, as well as for markets for her
                    products. She is further removed than ever from that condition of “opulence”
                    which has, according to Adam Smith, the greatest promise of stability and
                    progress.</p>
                <p>This has undoubtedly been due to the immense developments in manufacturing in
                    which England, with her wealth of coal and iron, led the way. This reacted on
                    shipping in many ways. England came to be the workshop of the world, and her
                    shipping was freighted with soft goods from Lancashire and Yorkshire, and with
                    hardware and machinery, to be conveyed to the most distant parts of the globe.
                    But not only were the opportunities for trading immensely increased; the
                    application of the steam engine to transit by water has accelerated
                    communication, and rendered it so regular and certain as to give an
                    extraordinary stimulus to foreign trade. The first steamboat that was more than
                    a mere toy made its trial in 1807, and since that time steam shipping has been
                    more and more substituted for the old sailing vessels. Still more recently there
                    has been a considerable change in the construction of ships, from the success
                    which has attended iron shipbuilding. The first experiment, which was generally
                    deemed exceedingly rash, was made in 1851.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to get satisfactory data for a comparison of the relative
                    importance of English and foreign shipping for a long period; but it may be
                    assumed that the shipping of the Italian republics and of the Hanse League
                    excelled that of England during the Middle Ages, that in the 16th century Spain
                    was far ahead of her when she could send such fleets to the West and fit out a
                    Spanish Armada, and that in the 17th and 18th centuries respect<pb break="no"

                    the great rivals —Holland and France—with which she had to compete so keenly. We
                    may compare the present position and the relative growth of tonnage during the
                    last century, so far as figures are available for the purpose :—</p>
