                    Sea), 177 miles north of Paris by the railway to Arras, Hazebrouck, and Calais,
                    at the junction of a line to Boulogne. Before the modifications made in the
                    defensive system of the frontier the place was a fortress of the first class. At
                    St Omer begins the canalized portion of the Aa, which reaches the sea at
                    Gravelines, and under its walls it connects with the Neuffossé, which ends at
                    the Lys. There are two harbours outside and one within the city. St Omer has
                    wide streets and spacious squares, but little stir of life. The old cathedral is
                    the most curious church in Artois; it belongs almost entirely to the 13th, 14th,
                    and 15th centuries. Of its four portals the finest, dating from the 13th and
                    14th centuries, was decorated with statuettes, unfortunately mutilated during
                    the Revolution. In spite of the spoliations of the 18th century, the contents of
                    the church still comprise interesting paintings, a Virgin in wood of the 12th
                    century (the object of numerous pilgrimages, and solemnly crowned in 1875), a
                    colossal statue of Christ seated between the Virgin and St John (13th century,
                    originally belonging to the cathedral of Thérouanne and presented by Charles
                    V.), fine stained glass and mosaics, interesting tombstones, the cenotaph of St
                    Omer, and numerous ex-votos, distinguished by their antiquity, originality, and
                    delicacy of workmanship. The clearing of the church from the encroachments of
                    other buildings has led to the reconstruction of the apsidial chapel of the
                    Sacred Heart in the purest Gothic style. Of St Bertin, the church of the abbey
                    (built between 1326 and 1520 on the site of previous churches), where Childeric
                    III. retired to end his days, nothing now remains but some arches and a tower,
                    190 feet high, which serves to adorn the public gardens (once possessed by the
                    monks). Several<pb break="no"

                    interest, but it is enough to mention St Sepulchre’s (14th century) for the sake
                    of its beautiful stone spire and stained-glass windows. A fine collection of
                    records, a picture gallery, and a theatre are all accommodated in the town-hall,
                    built of the materials of the abbey of St Bertin. Among the five hospitals the
                    military hospital is of note as occupying the college opened by the English
                    Jesuits in 1592 and known as the place where O’Connell received his education.
                    The old episcopal palace is used as a court-house. Several learned societies
                    exist in the town; the public library contains 20,000 volumes and 1000 MSS. The
                    arsenal is an extensive series of buildings. Besides 30,000,000 to 40,000,000
                    tobacco-pipes exported to America and the colonies, St Omer manufactures cloth,
                    hosiery, and tulle, cambric, and muslin embroideries. Its trade (and it is the
                    seat not only of a tribunal but also of a chamber of commerce) is mainly in
                    provisions for England, the products of the local industry, and those of the
                    paper-mills, flour-mills, distilleries, and sugar-factories in the vicinity,
                    especially along the banks of the Aa. The suburb of Haut Pont to the north of St
                    Omer is inhabited by a special stock, which has remained faithful to the Flemish
                    tongue, its original costume, and its peculiar customs, and is distinguished by
                    honesty and industry. The ground which these people cultivate has been reclaimed
                    from the marsh, and the lègres (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the square blocks
                    of land) communicate with each other only by boats floated on the ditches and
                    canals that divide them. At the end of the marsh, on the borders of the forest
                    of Clairmarais, are the ruins of the abbey founded in 1140 by Thierri d’Alsace,
                    to which Thomas a Becket betook himself in 1165. To the south of St Omer on a
                    hill commanding the Aa lies the camp of Helfaut, often called the camp of St
                    Omer. On 15th June 1884 a statue was erected to Jacqueline Robin, a heroine who
                    in the time of Louis XIV. saved St Omer from foreign occupation. The population
                    of the town was 20,479 in 1881 (21,556 in the commune).</p>
                <p>Near a castle named Sithiu, Omer, bishop of Thérouanne, erected churches and the
                    monks of Luxeuil established monasteries in the 7th century; and in the 9th
                    century the village thus originated took the name of its founder St Omer. The
                    Normans laid the place waste in 861 and 881, but ten years later found town and
                    monastery surrounded by walls and safe from their attack. Situated on the
                    borders of territories frequently disputed by French, Flemish, English, and
                    Spaniards, St Omer long continued subject to siege and military disaster. In
                    1071 Philip I. put all to sword and flame. Burned in 1136, captured in 1198 by
                    Richard and Baldwin IX., attacked in 1214 by Ferrand of Portugal, in 1302 and
                    1303 by the Flemish, in 1337 and 1339 by the English, and in 1477 by Louis XL,
                    St Omer at last fell in 1487 into the hands of Charles VIII. Two years later it
                    was recovered by the archduke Maximilian; and Charles V. strengthened its
                    ramparts with bastions. The French made five futile attempts against it between
                    1551 and 1596, and had no better success in 1638 (under Richelieu) or in 1647.
                    But on 26th April 1677, after seventeen days’ siege, Louis XIV. forced the town
                    to capitulate; and the peace of Nimeguen permanently confirmed the conquest.
                    From time to time the people of St Omer (Audomarois) still celebrate the
                    entrance into the town of William Cliton, count of Flanders, from whom in 1127
                    they obtained a communal charter granting them numerous privileges. St Omer
                    ceased to be a bishopric in 1790.</p>
