                    Berzelius in 1817. Both occur only in the mineral kingdom as components of very
                    rare minerals, most of which are compounds of one or the other or of both and

                    of sp. gr. 4·26, which dissolves in 1000 times its weight of boiling bisulphide
                    of carbon (at 46°·6 C.). The solution on cooling deposits most of its selenium

                    and 180° C. Fused selenium when cooled down suddenly hardens into a very
                    dark-coloured glass of 4·28 sp. gr., soluble in bisulphide of carbon; on gradual
                    cooling it becomes more or less completely “metallic.” (2) <hi rend="italic"
                        >Metallic selenium</hi> is a dark grey or black solid of 4·8 sp. gr.; it
                    exhibits metallic lustre, stretches perceptibly under the hammer, and its
                    fracture is similar to that of grey cast iron. It is insoluble in bisulphide of
                    carbon. Its fusing point is sharply defined and lies at 217° C. At the ordinary
                    temperature it conducts electricity, while the non-metallic modification does
                    not; at higher temperatures, or after temporary exposure to higher temperatures,
                    the conductivity on either side becomes an eminently variable quantity.
                    According to Draper and Moss, glassy selenium begins to conduct electricity at
                    165° to 175° C., and the conductivity increases regularly as the temperature
                    rises to near the boiling-point. With metallic selenium, which behaves
                    similarly, the increase of conductivity is proportional to the increase of
                    temperature to near the fusing point (217° C.); but from this point upwards it
                    decreases rapidly and attains its minimum at 250° C. According to W. Siemens,
                    however, selenium by long exposure to 200° C. becomes what one may call
                    electrically metallic; the conductivity then decreases when the temperature
                    rises, just as it does with ordinary metals. But this electro-metallicity is not
                    permanent; on continued exposure to a lower temperature it vanishes gradually,
                    until the proportion of quasi-metal has fallen to a limit-value depending on
                    that temperature. Very surprising is the observation of Sale that the electric
                    conductivity of metallic selenium increases on exposure to the light; the red
                    and ultra-red rays, as he found, act most powerfully. The effect of insolation
                    is almost instantaneous, but on re-exposure to darkness the original condition
                    is re-established only very gradually. W. Siemens found that his
                    electro-metallic selenium (as produced at 200° C.) is more sensitive to light
                    than any other kind. The conductivity of such selenium starting from darkness is
                    raised twofold by diffuse and tenfold by direct sunlight. The specific heat of
                    selenium, according to Regnault, is 0.0746 both in the glassy and in the
                    metallic modification. Selenium (of any kind) boils at 700° C. (Mitscherlich).
                    The vapour has an intense colour intermediate between that of chlorine and that
                    of sulphur. According to Deville and Troost, at 880° C. it is 7·67 times, and at
                    1420° is 5·68 times, as heavy as air; theory, for Se <hi rend="subscript">

                <p><hi rend="italic">Elementary Tellurium.—</hi> This, the compact form, is a
                    silver-white resplendent metal of markedly crystalline structure; the crystals
                    are rhombohedra, and the ingot consequently is very brittle. Specific gravity
                    6·2. The metal fuses at about 500° C., and is distillable at very high
                    temperatures. Its vapour is golden yellow and has a very brilliant
                    absorption-spectrum. The vapour density, according to Deville and Troost, is 9Ό8
                    at 1439° C. (air=l), corresponding to Te <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 1
                    molecule. A bar of tellurium becomes feebly electrical when rubbed with a
                    woollen cloth. The electric conductivity, like that of selenium, is largely
                    influenced by the temperature and previous exposure to heat, and it increases
                    after exposure to light, though not to the same extent as selenium does.
                    Starting from the ordinary temperature the conductivity decreases up to some
                    point between 90° and 145° C.; it then increases up to 200° C. (the highest
                    temperature tried); on cooling it decreases steadily, and finally is only
                    one-fifth or one-sixth of what it was at 200°. The numerical value at 200°
                    (silver = 100) was found equal to 0·0035 to 0.0031 (F. Exner).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extraction of the Elementary Substances.—</hi> If seleniferous
                    sulphur or pyrites is used for the manufacture of oil of vitriol by the chamber
                    process, most of the selenium accumulates as such in the “chamber mud,” from
                    which it may be extracted by the following method of Wohler’s. The mud, after
                    having been thoroughly washed and dried, is fused with alkaline nitrate and
                    carbonate, to convert the selenium into selenate (SeO <hi rend="subscript">

                    which is extracted by means of water. The filtered solution is boiled with
                    hydrochloric acid to convert the selenic into selenium acid (SeO <hi

                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + Se <hi

                    ore-smoke as produced in Mansfeld, which likewise contains free selenium. Its
                    extraction, according to O. Pettersen and F. Nilson, is best effected by
                    digestion with concentrated solution of cyanide of potassium at 80°C., which
                    converts the selenium into selenocyanide (SeNCK), easily extractable by water.
                    The filtered solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid and allowed to stand,
                    when the selenium (through the spontaneous decomposition of the SeNC. H into NCH
                    and Se) comes down as a precipitate.</p>
                <p>Tellurium is generally prepared from Transylvanian gold ore. The powdered ore is
                    oxidized by means of hot nitric acid and the least sufficiency of hydrochloric
                    acid, the excess of nitric acid being chased away by evaporation, and the
                    residue mixed with sulphuric acid (to convert the lead into insoluble sulphate),
                    and with some tartaric acid to prevent precipitation of tellurious acid (TeO <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) in the subsequent treatment with water. From the
                    filtered aqueous solution the gold is removed by addition of ferrous sulphate
                    and by filtration. The filtrate is treated with sulphurous acid to reduce the
                    tellurious acid to tellurium, which separates out as a black precipitate. The
                    precipitated metal is fused down and then sublimed at a very high temperature,
                    in a porcelain tube, in a current of hydrogen, to remove non-volatile impurities
                    and eliminate the last trace of selenium (SeH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemical Relalions.—</hi> Selenium and tellurium are similar in
                    their chemical character to sulphur; the gradation of properties within the

                    = 128 (O = 16). In oxygen or air the elementary substances burn readily into

                    elementary selenium and tellurium respectively by the action of sulphurous acid
                    in the heat. Chlorine combines readily with elementary selenium and tellurium
                    into dichlorides (Se or Te)Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which, however, on

                    into corresponding compounds. Hydrogen unites with elementary selenium and
