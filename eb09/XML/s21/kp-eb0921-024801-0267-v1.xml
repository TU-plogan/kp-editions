                <p><label type="entry">SAMNITES</label>, a people of ancient Italy, whose name
                    figures conspicuously in the early history of Rome. They occupied an extensive
                    tract in the centre of the peninsula, which derived from them the name of
                    Samnium. The territory thus designated was a wholly inland district, bounded on
                    the north by the Marsi, Peligni, and Frentani, who separated them from the
                    Adriatic, on the east by Apulia, on the south by Lucania, and on the west by
                    Campania and Latium. But the Samnites were from an early period a numerous and
                    powerful nation, and formed rather a confederacy of tribes than a single people.
                    Hence the name is sometimes used in a wider sometimes in a more limited
                    sense,—the Hirpini, especially, who occupied the southernmost portion of their
                    territory, being sometimes included amongst them, sometimes distinguished from
                    them. But according to the usual acceptation of the term—excluding the Frentani,
                    who, though unquestionably of Samnite origin, were not usually regarded as
                    belonging to the Samnite nation— they consisted of three principal tribes :—the
                    Caraceni in the north, the Pentri, who may be termed the Samnites proper, in the
                    centre, and the Hirpini in the south. Almost the whole of Samnium, as thus
                    defined, was a rugged, mountainous country, and, though the Apennines do not in
                    this part of their range attain to so great an elevation as farther north, they
                    form irregular masses and groups, filling up almost the whole territory, and in
                    great part covered with extensive forests. On the side of Campania alone the
                    valley of the Vulturnus was richer and more fertile, and opened a natural access
                    from the south into the northern regions of Samnium, while the Calor, a
                    tributary of the same river, which flows from the east past Benevento, afforded
                    in all ages a similar route into the upland districts of the Hirpini. Between
                    the two, occupying the centre of the Pentrian territory and the very heart of
                    Samnium, was the great mountain mass now known as the Monte Matese, of which the
                    highest summit attains to an elevation of 6600 feet, and which must in all ages
                    have been a region presenting peculiar difficulties of access.</p>
                <p>All ancient writers agree in representing the Samnites as a people of Sabine
                    origin, who migrated at an early period to the region of which we find them in
                    the occupation when they first appear in history. The period of this emigration
                    is wholly unknown, but, if we can trust the tradition reported by Strabo, that
                    it was the result of a vow to send forth the produce of a “sacred spring” (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Sabines),</hi> it could hardly have been in the first
                    instance very numerous, and it is probable that the invaders established
                    themselves in the midst of an Oscan population, with whom they gradually
                    coalesced. It is certain that no very long interval elapsed before the Samnites
                    in their turn found themselves exceeding the resources of their barren and
                    rugged territory, and extending their dominion over the more fertile and
                    accessible regions by which they were surrounded. The first of these movements
                    was probably that by which they occupied the land of the Frentani, a fertile
                    district along the shores of the Adriatic, between the northern part of Samnium
                    and the sea. The Hirpini also were in the first instance almost certainly a
                    later offshoot of the central Samnite people, though they continued always in
                    such close connexion with them that they were generally reckoned as forming part
                    of the Samnite confederacy, and almost uniformly took part with the more central
                    tribes in their wars against Rome. The Frentani, on the contrary, generally
                    either stood aloof from the contest or secured their own safety by an alliance
                    with Rome.</p>
                <p>To a later period belong the emigrations that gave rise to the two powerful
                    nations of the Lucanians and Cam panians. At the time when the Greek colonies
                    were established in southern Italy the native tribes that occupied the regions
                    to the south of Samnium were the Oenotrians and other Pelasgic races, and it was
                    not till after the middle of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> that
                    the pressure of the Lucanians from the interior began to make itself felt in
                    this quarter. From this time they gradually extended their power throughout the
                    whole country to the Gulf of Tarentum and the Sicilian Straits. It was probably
                    at a somewhat earlier period (about 440 to 420 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>
                    that they effected the conquest of the fertile country to the west, intervening
                    between the mountain regions of Samnium and the sea. Here they found an Oscan
                    population, with whom they seem to have speedily coalesced, and thus gave rise
                    to the people known thenceforth as Campanians, or “inhabitants of the plain.”
                    But in this case also the new nationality thus constituted had no political
                    connexion with the parent state, and retained its independent action both for
                    peace and war. The first mention of the Samnites themselves in Roman history
                    occurs in 354, when they concluded a treaty of alliance with the rising
                    republic.</p>
                <p>But it was not long before the course of events brought the two rival powers into
                    collision. The Samnites, who appear to have been still actuated by aggressive
                    tendencies, had attacked the Sidicini, a petty tribe to the north of Campania,
                    and the latter, feeling unable to cope with so powerful an adversary, invoked
                    the assistance of the Campanians. These, however, were in their turn attacked by
                    the Samnites, and sustained so crushing a defeat, under the very walls of Capua,
                    that they were compelled to implore the aid of Rome. Their request was granted,
                    though not without hesitation, and thus began (in 343) the first of the long
                    series of the Samnite Wars, which ultimately led to the establishment of the
                    Roman domination over the whole of southern Italy. The events of these wars,
                    which are related in all histories of Rome, can only be very briefly noticed
                    here. The first contest was of short duration; and after two campaigns the
                    Romans were willing not only to conclude peace with Samnium but to renew the
                    previously existing alliance, to which the Samnites continued faithful
                    throughout the great struggle which ensued between the Romans and the allied
                    Campanians and Latins. The Second Samnite War was of a very different character.
                    Both nations felt that it was a struggle for supremacy, and, instead of being
                    brought to a close within three years, it lasted for more than twenty years
                    (326-304), and was marked with considerable vicissitudes of fortune, among which
                    the celebrated disaster of the Caudine Forks (321) stands most conspicuous. Nor
                    was the struggle confined to the two leading powers, many of the neighbouring
                    nations espousing the cause of the one side or the other, and often with
                    fluctuating faith, in accordance with the varying fortunes of the war. The
                    result, however, was on the whole favourable to the Roman arms, notwithstanding
                    which they were willing to conclude peace in 304, on condition of the renewal of
                    the previously existing alliance. This interval of tranquillity was of short
                    duration, and little more than five years elapsed between the end of the Second
                    Samnite War and the commencement of the Third (298). In this fresh contest they
                    received a formidable auxiliary in a large body of Gauls, who had recently
                    crossed the Alps, and, together with their countrymen the Senones, espoused the
                    cause of the Samnites against Rome. Their combined forces were, however,
                    defeated in the great battle of Sentinum (294), and after several successive
                    campaigns the consul M. Curius Dentatus was able to boast of having put an end
                    to the Samnite Wars (290), after they had lasted more than fifty years. It is
                    true that a few<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n268/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0268-0249"/> years later the Samnites again appear in
                    arms, though rather as auxiliaries than principals, and the name of Fourth
                    Samnite War is given by some historians to the memorable contest which,
                    commenced in 282 by the Lucanians, assumed a wholly different aspect when
                    Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, appeared in Italy as their auxiliary. But the power of
                    the Samnites was evidently broken, and after the final defeat of Pyrrhus they
                    appear to have offered little resistance. Their final submission was made in
                    272, and according to the usual Roman policy was secured by the establishment in
                    their territory of the two important colonies of Aesernia and Beneventum.</p>
                <p>During the Second Punic War, Samnium became the frequent theatre of hostilities.
                    The Hirpini were among the first of the Italian tribes to declare in favour of
                    Hannibal after the battle of Cannse (216); but their example was not followed by
                    the more powerful tribe of the Pentri, and when Hannibal was finally driven out
                    of Central Italy the Samnites were speedily reduced to submission. From this
                    time we hear no more of them till the great outbreak of the Italian nations,
                    commonly known as the Social War (90), in which they bore a prominent part. Two
                    of the most distinguished of the Italian leaders, C. Papius Mutilus and C.
                    Pontius Telesinus, were of Samnite birth, and after the fall of Corfinium the
                    Samnite town of Bovianum became the temporary capital of the confederates. Their
                    submission had not indeed been completed when the civil war between Marius and
                    Sulla gave a fresh character to the contest. The Samnites warmly espoused the
                    cause of the former, and it was the defeat of their leader C. Pontius Telesinus
                    at the Colline Gate of Rome that secured the victory of Sulla and sealed the
                    fate of the Samnite nation (82). Not content with putting all his Samnite
                    prisoners to the sword, the ruthless conqueror organized a systematic
                    devastation of the whole country, with the avowed object of extirpating the very
                    name of the Samnites, as the eternal enemies of Rome. To such an extent was this
                    cruel purpose carried into effect that more than a hundred years afterwards, in
                    the time of Strabo, the whole country is described as being in a state of utter
                    desolation, flourishing towns being reduced to mere villages, while others had
                    altogether ceased to exist. Nor does it appear probable that it ever recovered
                    this severe blow; and, though some attempt was made to revive its prosperity by
                    the establishment of Roman colonies within its limits, none of these attained to
                    any importance. The name of Samnium was indeed retained as that of a distinct
                    province throughout the greater part of the Roman empire, and is still found in
                    Cassiodorus. But under the Lombard rule the whole of this part of Italy was
                    included in the duchy of Benevento, which continued to subsist as an independent
                    state long after the fall of the Lombard kingdom in the north of Italy. During
                    the revolutions of the Middle Ages all trace of the name is lost; and, though it
                    was revived in the last century as the official designation of a part of the
                    region comprised within the ancient limits, previously known as the Contado di
                    Molise, this was a mere piece of official pedantry, and the name has again
                    disappeared from the modern maps of Italy.</p>
                <p>Very few towns of importance existed at any period within the limits of Samnium,
                    and many of those mentioned in history had disappeared in the continual wars
                    with which the country was ravaged. The only names that are worthy of special
                    notice are— Aufidena, in the north, the capital of the Caraceni, the ruins of
                    which still exist a few miles from Castel di Sangro; Bovianum (still called
                    Bojano), the ancient capital of the Pentri, in the heart of Monte Matese;
                    Saepinum (Sepino), in the same neighbourhood; Aesernia, in the valley of the
                    Vulturnus, still known as Isernia; Aquilonia (Lacedogna), in the land of the
                    Hirpini, near the frontier of Apulia; and Compsa (Conza), on the borders of
                    Lucania, near the sources of the Aufidus. Beneventum alone has retained its
                    ancient consideration as well as name, an advantage which it derives from its
                    position on the Via Appia, commanding the entrance to the mountain district of
                    the Hirpini.</p>
                <p>The language of the Samnites, like that of their parents the Sabines, must
                    clearly have been closely related to that of the Oscans, and the two
                    nationalities appear to have amalgamated so readily that before the historical
                    period there was probably little difference in this respect. Several of the most
                    important of the inscriptions that remain to us have been found within the
                    limits of the Samnite territory, and may be considered as Sabello-Oscan in their
                    character, rather than purely Oscan. See for these the articles <hi
