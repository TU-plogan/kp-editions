                <p><label type="entry">SEA-SICKNESS</label>, a peculiar set of symptoms experienced
                    by many persons when subjected to the pitching and rolling motion of a vessel at
                    sea, of which depression, giddiness, nausea, and vomiting are the most
                    prominent.</p>
                <p>Although the vast majority of persons appear to be liable to this ailment on
                    exposure to its exciting cause (the instances of complete and constant immunity
                    being rare), they do not all suffer alike. Many endure distress of a most acute
                    and even alarming kind, while others are simply conscious of transient feelings
                    of nausea and discomfort. In long voyages, while many are affected with
                    sea-sickness for the first few days only, others are tormented with it during
                    the entire period, especially on the occurrence of rough weather. In short
                    voyages, such as across the English Channel, not a few even of those susceptible
                    escape, while others suffer in an extreme degree, the sickness persisting long
                    after arrival on shore.</p>
                <p>The symptoms generally show themselves soon after the vessel has begun to roll by
                    the onset of giddiness and discomfort in the head, together with a sense of
                    nausea and sinking at the stomach, which soon develops into intense sickness and
                    vomiting. At first the contents of the stomach only are ejected; but thereafter
                    bilious matter, and occasionally even blood, are brought up by the violence of
                    the retching. The vomiting is liable to exacerbations according to the amount of
                    oscillation of the ship; but seasons of rest, sometimes admitting of sleep,
                    occasionally intervene. Along with the sickness there is great physical
                    prostration, as shown in the pallor of the skin, cold sweats, and feeble pulse,
                    accompanied with mental depression and wretchedness. In almost all instances the
                    attack has a favourable termination, and it is extremely rare that serious
                    results arise, except in the case of persons weakened by other diseases,
                    although occasionally the symptoms are for a time sufficiently alarming.</p>
                <p>The causes giving rise to sea-sickness have long been discussed, and a vast
                    number of theories have been proposed. The conditions concerned in the
                    production of the malady are apparently of complex character, embracing more
                    than one set of causes. In the first place, the rolling or heaving of the vessel
                    disturbs that feeling of the relation of the body to surrounding objects upon
                    which our sense of security rests. The nervous system being thus subjected to a
                    succession of shocks or surprises fails to effect the necessary adjustments for
                    equilibrium. Giddiness and with it nausea and vomiting follow, aided probably by
                    the profound vaso-motor disturbance which produces such manifest depression of
                    the circulation. Much has been made by some of the effects of the displacement
                    of the abdominal viscera, especially the stomach, by the rolling of the vessel;
                    but, while this may possibly operate to some extent, it can only be as an
                    accessory cause. The same may be said of the influence of the changing
                    impressions made upon the vision, which has been regarded by some as so powerful
                    in the matter, since attacks of seasickness occur also in the dark, and in the
                    case of blind persons. Other contributory causes may be mentioned, such as the
                    feeling that sickness is certain to come, which may bring on the attack in some
                    persons even before the vessel has begun to move; the sense of the body being in
                    a liquid or yielding medium as it descends with the vessel into the trough of
                    the sea, the varied odours to be met with on board ship, and circumstances of a
                    like nature tend also to precipitate or aggravate an attack. Dr Chapman’s view
                    is that the essential cause is an undue afflux of blood to the spinal cord. But,
                    in the few rare instances where sea-sickness has proved fatal, <hi rend="italic"
                    >post-mortem</hi> appearances have been almost entirely negative, and only such
                    as are met with in death from syncope.</p>
                <p>Innumerable preventives and remedies have been proposed; but most of them fall
                    far short of the success claimed for them. No means has yet been discovered
                    which can altogether prevent the occurrence of sea-sickness, nor is it likely
                    any will be found, since it is largely due to the pitching movements of the
                    vessel, which cannot be averted. Swinging couches or chambers have not proved of
                    any practical utility. No doubt there is less risk of sickness in a largo and
                    well-ballasted vessel than in a small one; but, even though the rolling may be
                    considerably modified, the ascending and descending movements which so readily
                    produce nausea continue. None of the medicinal agents proposed possess
                    infallible properties: a remedy which suits one person will often wholly fail
                    with another. There appears to be a wide concurrence of opinion that nerve
                    sedatives are among the most potent drugs which can be employed; and full
                    medicinal doses of bromide of potassium, chloral, or opium (the last two only
                    under strict medical direction) taken before sailing appear to act usefully in
                    the case of many persons. On the other hand, some high authorities have
                    recommended the employment of nerve stimulants, such as a small cupful of very
                    strong coffee to be taken about two hours before sailing, which will frequently
                    prevent or mitigate the sickness. When the vessel is in motion, or even before
                    starting, the recumbent position with the head low and the eyes closed should be
                    assumed by those at all likely to suffer, and, should the weather admit, on deck
                    rather than below,—the body, especially the extremities, being well covered.
                    Many persons, however, find comfort and relief from lying down in their berths
                    with a hot bottle to the feet, by which means sleep may be obtained, and with it
                    a temporary abatement of the distressing giddiness and nausea. Should sickness
                    supervene small quantities of some light food, such as thin arrowroot, gruel, or
                    soup, ought to be swallowed if possible, in order to lessen the sense of
                    exhaustion, which is often extreme. The vomiting may be mitigated by saline
                    effervescing drinks, ice, chloroform, hydrocyanic acid, or opium. Alcohol,
                    although occasionally useful in great prostration, is not generally found to be
                    of much service, but tends rather to aggravate the sickness. Dr Chapman, in
                    accordance with his view of the cause of the sickness, introduced a spinal
                    ice-bag, which has been extensively employed and recommended; but, like every
                    other plan of treatment, it has only occasional success. The more recently
                    proposed remedies, such as nitrite of amyl and cucaine, do not seem to yield any
                    better results than the agents already mentioned.</p>
