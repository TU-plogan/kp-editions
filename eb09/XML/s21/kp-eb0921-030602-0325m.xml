                <p><label type="entry">SARÁWAK</label>, a territory in the north-west of Borneo,
                    which, reclaimed from piracy and barbarism by the energy of Sir James <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Brooke</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> was converted into an
                    independent and prosperous state. With an area estimated at from 35,000 to
                    40,000 square miles, it has a population of about 250,000. The coast extends
                    from Tanjong Datu, a prominent cape in 2° 3' N. lat., northwards to the frontier
                    of Brunei in 3° 10'—a distance in a straight line of about 280 miles, but,
                    following the sinuosities, about 400 miles. Inland the boundaries towards the
                    Dutch territory are hypothetically determined by the line of watershed between
                    the streams, flowing north-west and those flowing east-south-east and
                    south-west, but the frontier districts are to a considerable extent unexplored.
                    Towards the coast there are tracts of low alluvial land; and some of the rivers
                    reach the sea by deltas out of all proportion to the length of their course. The
                    surface of the country soon, however, begins to rise and to be diversified with
                    irregular hills, sometimes of rounded sandstone, sometimes of picturesque and
                    rugged limestone. The Bongo Hills, in the residency of Saráwak, are about 3000
                    feet high; and along the frontier, where the Seraung Mountains, the Klinkong
                    Mountains, the Batang Lupar Mountains, &amp;c., are supposed to form more or
                    less continuous ranges, there are altitudes of from 4000 to 8000 feet. In some
                    of the limestone mountains there are caves of enormous extent (a detailed
                    account will be found in Boyle, <hi rend="italic">Adventures among the Dyaks of
                    Borneo,</hi> 1865). The Rejang is the largest river in Saráwak. Its sources are
                    only 120 or 130 miles directly inland near Mount Lawi, Mount Marud (8000 feet),
                    and Gura Peak; but it flows obliquely southwest for 350 miles, and the principal
                    branches of its delta (the Eyan river and the Rejang proper) embrace a territory
                    of 1600 square miles with a coast-line of 60 miles. In their upper course the
                    headwaters have a rapid descent, and none of them are navigable above Balleh
                    where the Rejang is deflected westward by the accession of the Balleh river.
                    Left-hand tributaries from a low line of hills to the south—the Katibas, Nymah,
                    Kanowit, and Kajulan rivers—continue to swell the main stream; but there are no
                    tributaries of any importance from the right hand, the country in that direction
                    being drained directly seawards by a number of short rivers—the Oya, Mukah,
                    Balinean, Tatau, and Bintulu,—of which the first three rise in the Ulat-Bulu
                    Hills (3600 feet). At the apex of the Rejang delta lies the village and
                    government of Sibu, and at the mouth of the Rejang branch is the important
                    village and shipping-port of Rejang. Passing over the small river basins of the
                    Kalukah and the Saribas we reach the Batang Lupar, which ranks next to the
                    Rejang, and is navigable for large vessels as far as Lingga, about 30 miles from
                    its mouth—the bar having 3½ fathoms water at high tide. The value of the
                    navigable portion of the Batang Lupar is, however, greatly lessened by the
                    formidable bores to which it is subject; they begin about three days before full
                    moon and change, and last about three days, rushing up the river with a crest
                    about 6 feet high for a distance of 60 miles. In several of the other rivers a
                    similar phenomenon is observed. The broad mouth of the Batang Lupar opens in the
                    angle where the coast, which has run nearly north and south from the delta of
                    the Rejang, turns<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0326-0307"/> abruptly west; and all the rivers which reach the
                    sea between this point and Tanjong Datu—the Sadong, the Samaralian, the Saráwak
                    (with its tributaries the Senna, the Samban, the Poak, &amp;c.), the Lundu, are
                    short.</p>
                <p>The mineral wealth of Sarawak is not unimportant. Gold washing has long been
                    carried on in the central residency, though not with more than moderate success;
                    and more recently a fairly prolific gold-field has been opened in the
                    neighbourhood of Marup, on the Batang Lupar, where there is a flourishing
                    Chinese settlement. Of much greater value are the antimony ores which occur more
                    especially in the district of the headstreams of the Sarawak, in the most
                    various localities, occasionally as dykes <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> but
                    more frequently in boulders deep in the clayey soil, or perched on tower-like
                    summits and craggy pinnacles, accessible only by ladders. Those rich deposits
                    have, however, been largely exhausted, and no new ones have been discovered in
                    other parts of the territory, so that the Borneo Company (which has the monopoly
                    of this and other minerals in the country) has been tempted to erect local
                    furnaces to reduce the poorer qualities of ore and the refuse of the mines to
                    regulus on the spot. A deposit of cinnabar was discovered by Mr Helms in 1867,
                    at Tegora, at the foot of the Bongo Mountains, but no other occurrence of this
                    ore of quicksilver in the territory has yet been reported. In 1876 quicksilver
                    was exported to the value of 108,050 dollars, and in 1879 to 76,620. Coal has
                    been worked for many years at the government mines of Simunjun, on the banks of
                    a right-hand affluent of the Sadong; and there is known to exist at Silantek up
                    the Lingga river (a left-hand affluent of the Batang Lupar) a very extensive
                    coal-field, whose products, still intact, could be brought down for shipment at
                    Lingga by a railway of some 18 miles in length. Diamonds are occasionally found,
                    and copper, manganese, and plumbago have been discovered, but not in paying
                    quantities.</p>
                <p>Like the rest of Borneo, Sarawak is largely covered with forest and jungle. The
                    bilian or ironwood is not only used locally but exported, especially from the
                    Batang Lupar district, to China, where it is highly valued as a house-building
                    and furniture timber. Gutta-percha, india-rubber <hi rend="italic"
                    >(gutta-susu),</hi> and birds’ nests are also exported, but in diminishing
                    quantities; and their place is being taken by gambier and pepper, the
                    cultivation of which was introduced by the rajah. Gambier figured at 20,461
                    piculs in the exports of 1881 and at 22,432 in 1884, and pepper at 28,807 piculs
                    in 1881 and 43,490 in 1884. The territory of Sarawak is said to furnish more
                    than half the sago produce of the world, and most of it is grown on the marshy
                    banks of the Oya, Mukah, and other rivers of the northern residency of Sarawak
                    to the distance of about 20 miles inland. The total value of the exports of
                    Sarawak in 1884 was 1,145,248 dollars (1,071,528 from Kuching), that of the
                    imports 1,083,255 dollars. Natuna and Dutch vessels are the most numerous in the
                    shipping returns.</p>
                <p>The government is an absolute monarchy—the present rajah being the nephew of Sir
                    James Brooke. The rajah is assisted by a supreme council of six, consisting of
                    two chief European residents and four natives, nominated by himself; there is
                    also a general council of fifty, which meets once every three years or oftener
                    if required. For administrative purposes the country is divided into eight
                    districts corresponding to the number of principal river basins. Three chief
                    districts are presided over by European officers. The military force—some 250
                    men—is under the control of an English commandant. There is also a small police
                    force, and the Government possesses a few small steam vessels. The civil service
                    is regularly organized, with pensions, &amp;c. The revenue is in a satisfactory
                    state, showing 64,899 dollars to the good in the period between 1875 and 1884.
                    In 1884 the revenue was 276,269 dollars and the expenditure 289,291. Roman
                    Catholics and Protestants both have missions in Sarawak; and the English bishop
                    of Singapore and Labuan is also styled bishop of Sarawak. The population
                    consists of Malays, Chinese, Land Dyaks, Sea Dyaks, and Milanows. “Without the
                    Chinaman,” says the rajah <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette,</hi> 19th
                    September, 1883) “we can do nothing.” When not allowed to form secret societies
                    he is easily governed, and this he is forbidden to do on pain of death. The
                    Dyaks within the territory have given up headhunting. The Milanows, who live in
                    the northern districts, have adopted the Malay dress and in many cases have
                    become Mohammedans; they are a quiet, contented, and laborious people. Slavery
                    still prevails in Sarawak, but arrangements are made for its entire abolition in
                    1888. Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, on the Sarawak river, is a place of
                    12,000 inhabitants and is steadily growing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> In 1839-40 Sarawak, the most southern province
                    of the sultanate of Brunei, was in rebellion against the tyranny of the
                    governor, Pangeran Makota, and Muda Hassim had been sent to restore order. The
                    insurgents held out at Balidah or Blidah fort in the Siniawan district, and
                    there James Brooke first took part in the affairs of the territory. By his
                    assistance the insurrection was suppressed, and on September 24th he was
                    appointed chief of Sarawak. In 1843 Captain Keppel and Mr Brooke expelled the
                    pirates from the Saribas river and in 1844 they defeated those on the Batang
                    Lupar, to whom Makota had attached himself, In 1849 another severe blow was
                    struck by the destruction of Sirib Sahib’s fort at Patusan. The Chinese, who had
                    begun to settle in the country about 1850 (at Bau, Bidi, &amp;c.), made a
                    violent attempt to massacre the English and seize the government, but they were
                    promptly and severely crushed after they had done havoc at Kuching. During Sir
                    James Brooke’s absence in England (1857— 1860) his nephew Captain J. Johnson
                    (who had taken the name Brooke, and is generally called Captain Brooke) was left
                    in authority; but a quarrel afterwards ensued and Sir James Brooke was in 1868
                    succeeded by Charles Johnson (or Brooke), a younger nephew. The independence of
                    Sarawak had been recognized after much controversy by England in 1863 and
                    previously by the United States.</p>
