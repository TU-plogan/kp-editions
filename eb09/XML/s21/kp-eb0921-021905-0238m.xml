                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0239-0220"/> him at the age of sixteen to Paris, where his
                    promise excited the especial interest of Casaubon. After hardly overcoming his
                    father’s opposition, he proceeded in 1606 to the university of Heidelberg,
                    nominally to be initiated into jurisprudence under Godefroy, but in fact
                    entirely devoted to classical studies. The atmosphere of the place probably had
                    its influence in inducing him to embrace Protestantism, the religion of his
                    mother; and his first publication was an edition of a work by Nilus Cabasilas,
                    archbishop of Thessalonica, against the primacy of the pope, with a similar
                    tract by Barlaam. The Latin translation of these works, although apparently
                    assigned to Salmasius on the title page, is not by him. In 1609 he edited
                    Florus, with notes compiled in ten days. In the following year he returned to
                    France, and nominally pursued the study of jurisprudence to qualify himself for
                    the succession to his father’s post, which he eventually lost on account of his
                    religion. Nothing important proceeded from his pen until 1620, when he published
                    Casaubon’s notes on the <hi rend="italic">Augustan History</hi>, with copious
                    additions of his own, equally remarkable for learning and acumen. In 1623 he
                    married Anna Mercier, a Protestant lady of a distinguished family; and in 1629
                    he produced his <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi> as a critic, his commentary
                    on Solinus’s <hi rend="italic">Polyhistor,</hi> or rather on Pliny, to whom
                    Solinus is indebted for most of his materials. Greatly as this work may have
                    been overrated by his contemporaries, it is still a monument of stupendous
                    learning and conscientious industry. Salmasius learned Arabic to qualify himself
                    for the botanical part of his task, and was so unwilling to go to press without
                    having consulted a rare treatise by Didymus that the third part of his
                    commentary, <hi rend="italic">De Herbis et Plantis,</hi> did not appear in his
                    lifetime. He was now ostensibly as well as actually devoted to philology, and
                    foreign universities vied with each other in endeavouring to secure his
                    services. After declining overtures from Oxford, Padua, and Bologna, he closed
                    in 1631 with a proposal from Leyden, offering an entirely honorary
                    professorship, with a stipend of two thousand (afterwards raised to three
                    thousand) livres a year, merely to live in Holland and refute the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Baronius. This latter stipulation he never
                    fulfilled. Shortly after his removal to Holland, he composed, at the request of
                    Prince Frederick of Nassau, his treatise on the military system of the Romans,
                    which was not published until 1657. Other works followed, mostly philological,
                    but including a denunciation of wigs and hair-powder, and a vindication of
                    moderate and lawful interest for money, which drew down upon him many
                    expostulations from lawyers and theologians. It prevailed, however, with the
                    Dutch Church to admit money-lenders to the sacrament. His treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De Primatu Papae</hi> (1645), accompanying a republication of the
                    tract of Nilus Cabasilas, excited a warm controversy in France, but the
                    Government declined to suppress it. Notwithstanding his Protestantism and the
                    opposition of the papal nuncio, he had already been made a royal counsellor and
                    a knight of St Michael, and great offers had been made to induce him to return,
                    which, suspecting that he was to be charged with the composition of a panegyric
                    on Richelieu, he honourably declined.</p>
                <p>In November 1649 appeared the work by which Salmasius is best remembered, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Defensio Regia pro Carolo I.</hi> His advice had already been
                    sought on English and Scotch affairs, and, inclining to Presbyterianism or a
                    modified Episcopacy, he had written against the Independents. It does not appear
                    by whose influence he was induced to undertake the <hi rend="italic">Defensio
                    Regia,</hi> but Charles II., low as his exchequer was, defrayed the expense of
                    printing, and presented the author with £100. The first edition was anonymous,
                    but the author was universally known. A French translation which speedily
                    appeared under the name of Le Gros was the work of Salmasius himself. This
                    celebrated work, in our day principally famous for the reply it provoked from
                    Milton, even in its own added little to the reputation of the author. Salmasius
                    injured his character for consistency by defending absolute monarchy, and knew
                    too little of English history and politics to argue his cause with effect. He
                    deals chiefly in generalities, and most inappropriate illustrations from
                    Biblical and classical history. Not caring sufficiently for his theme to rise to
                    the heights of moral indignation, he is as inferior to Milton in earnestness as
                    in eloquence and the power of invective. Milton had, no doubt, a great advantage
                    in encountering a personality, at whose head vituperation could be launched,
                    while Salmasius is fighting abstractions and indicting a people. But the reply
                    to Milton, which he left unfinished at his death, and which was published by his
                    son in 1660, is insipid as well as abusive. Until the appearance of Milton’s
                    rejoinder in March 1651 the effect of Salmasius’s work was no doubt
                    considerable; and it probably helped to procure him the flattering invitation
                    from Queen Christina which induced him to visit Sweden in 1650. Christina loaded
                    him with gifts and distinctions, but upon the appearance of Milton’s book was
                    unable to conceal her conviction that he had been worsted by his antagonist.
                    Milton, addressing Christina herself, ascribes Salmasius’s withdrawal from
                    Sweden in 1651 to mortification at this affront, but this appears to be
                    negatived by the warmth of Christina’s subsequent letters and her pressing
                    invitation to return. The claims of the university of Leyden and dread of a
                    second Swedish winter seem fully adequate motives. Nor is there any foundation
                    for the belief that Milton’s invectives hastened his death, which took place on
                    September 3, 1653, from an injudicious use of the Spa waters. He was at the time
                    engaged upon his reply to Milton; this he does not seem to have reckoned among
                    the MSS. which, feeling that he had expressed himself with undue asperity, he
                    directed his wife to burn after his decease. He left several sons, but his
                    posterity did not attain the third generation.</p>
                <p>Nothing, to modern ideas, can seem more singular than the literary dictatorship
                    exercised by a mere classical scholar, who shone principally as a commentator,
                    and whose independent works, though highly respectable, evince no especial
                    powers of mind. Salmasius was far enough from being a Grotius, a Leibnitz, or
                    even a Casaubon. As a commentator and verbal critic, however, he is entitled to
                    very high rank. His notes on the <hi rend="italic">Augustan History</hi> and
                    Solinus display not only massive erudition but massive good sense as well; his
                    perception of the meaning of his author is commonly very acute, and his
                    corrections of the text are frequently highly felicitous. His manly independence
                    was shown in many circumstances of his life, and the general bias of his mind
                    was liberal and sensible. He was accused of sourness and sullenness of temper;
                    but the charge, if it had any foundation, is extenuated by the wretched
                    condition of his health. His biographer Clement enumerates seven classes of
                    disorders which pursued him throughout his life, and which render his industry
                    and productiveness the more extraordinary. Papillon catalogues eighty books
                    published by Salmasius himself, or from his MSS., or to which he contributed
                    notes; eighteen manuscripts which he himself saw in the library of M. de la
                    Mare; forty-three more mentioned by others; ninety-three works with MS. notes by
                    Salmasius, which should now be in the National Library of France; and fifty-nine
                    books projected or contemplated.</p>
                <p>The life of Salmasius was written nt great length by Philibert de la Mare,
                    counsellor of the parlement of Dijon, who inherited his MSS. from his son.
                    Papillon says that this biography left nothing to desire, but it has the capital
                    fault of never having been printed. It was, however, used by Papillon himself,
                    whose account of Salmasius in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque des Auteurs de
                    Bourgogne</hi> (Dijon, 1745) is by far the best extant. There is an <hi
                    rend="italic">éloge</hi> by Clément prefixed to his edition of Salmasius's <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters</hi> (1656), and another by Morisot, inserted in his own
                    <hi rend="italic">Letters.</hi> Clément's notice contains many interesting
                    facts, but it is marred by an extravagant admiration for its subject, perhaps
                    excusable if he really believed that his hero was born in 1596, and edited
                    Florus at thirteen. It is remarkable, however, that Clément passes over the <hi
                    rend="italic">Defensio Regia</hi> almost without notice, whether from feeling
                    that it was unworthy of Salmasius, or because discussion of the subject was
                    discouraged in Holland during the existence of the English Commonwealth. (R.
