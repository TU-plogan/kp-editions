                <p><label type="entry">SENEGAMBIA</label>, a country in the west of equatorial
                    Africa, comprising, as the name indicates, the regions watered by the Senegal
                    and the Gambia. It lies between 9° and 17° N. lat. and 6° and 17° 30' W. long.,
                    being bounded on the N. by the Sahara, W. by the Atlantic, S. by Sierra Leone,
                    and E. by the Joliba or upper Niger. The area is estimated at about 400,000
                    square miles. Accepting the course of the Senegal and its right hand affluent
                    the Ba-ule as the boundary towards the Sahara, the Joliba as the frontier
                    towards Segu and Upper Guinea, and the watershed between the Mellacorée
                    (Mellicoury) and the Great Scarcies as that between Senegambia and Sierra Leone,
                    we have only for short distances to fall back on a mere conventional
                    delimitation,—in the north between Sidian on the Ba-ule and Sansanding on the
                    Niger <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Murdia; in the south-east, from Sansanding to a
                    point above Nyamina; and finally between the Joliba and the sources of the Great
                    Scarcies. The Senegambian coast extends south-south-west almost in a straight
                    line from the N’diadier or Mosquito lagoon (Marigot des Ma-ringouins), formerly
                    the northern mouth of the Senegal, to Cape Verd, the most western point of the
                    African continent; then it bends south as far as Cape Roxo; and afterwards
                    south-east as far as the Mellacorée. With the exception of the two great capes
                    just mentioned, the only headlands of any importance are Cape St Mary, forming
                    the south side of the estuary of the Gambia; Cape Verga, between Rio Nunez and
                    Rio Pongo; and Konakry Point, opposite the Los (or Idolos) Islands. The only
                    gulf on the whole coast is that which lies to the south of Cape Verd and
                    contains the island of <hi rend="smallcaps">Gorée</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.);</hi> the other inlets, such as the bay of Sangareah, are mere estuaries
                    or river mouths. Apart from the island in the Senegal on which St Louis is built
                    and those formed by the deltas of the rivers, the only islands along the coast
                    are Gorée, the Bissagos (or Bijug) Archipelago, the Los Islands, and the little
                    island of Matakong. The coast in the northern part has the same appearance as
                    that of the Sahara,—low, arid, desolate, and dune-skirted, its monotony relieved
                    only here and there by cliffs and plateaus. Farther south it becomes low,
                    marshy, and clothed with luxuriant vegetation. Behind the low flat seaboard the
                    country rises into a vast plateau terminating eastwards in a mountainous region.
                    Though of no great height, these mountains cover a large area and have numerous
                    ramifications. Farther to the east they sink abruptly towards the Niger valley,
                    while southwards they are prolonged towards Sierra Leone and the interior of
                    Upper Guinea, perhaps forming those Kong Mountains which are said to exist
                    between the ocean and the Niger basin. Under the name of Mounts Badet, Yandi,
                    Maté, Kissi (of which the first form the “Alps” of Futa-Jallon) they descend on
                    the west by a series of terraces to the plains of Senegambia, and on the north
                    they extend to the left bank of the Senegal and even throw out some spurs into
                    the desert beyond. The mountain region is cut by numerous erosion valleys. As to
                    the general altitude nothing is accurately known, but the following points have
                    been determined—Mount Daro, 4068 feet; Kuruworo, 3868; Warnani, 3799; Yenkina,
                    3560; Bogoma, 3524; Pampaya, 3290. The principal rivers are the Senegal, the
                    Salum, the Yombas, the Gambia, the Casamance, the Cacheo, the Geba, the Rio
                    Grande, the<pb break="no"

                    Pongo, the Dubreka or Konakry, the Forecareah, and the Mellacorée. They all rise
                    in the mountains of the interior or at the foot of the highlands and fall into
                    the Atlantic. Their general direction is from east to west with a south-west
                    deflexion, which becomes always more pronounced as we advance southwards. Unlike
                    these rivers, the Joliba or <hi rend="smallcaps">Niger (q.v.),</hi> flowing
                    north and north-east, soon passes beyond Senegambia. Lagoons and backwaters are
                    common; but there are no true lakes of any importance.</p>
                <p>The geological constitution of the country is as yet very imperfectly known,
                    especially in the interior. The low region of the seaboard has a very uniform
                    character. It consists of sandstones or clay rocks and loose beds of reddish
                    soil containing marine shells. At certain points, such as Cape Verd and Cane
                    Roxo, the sandstones crop out; it is the red colour of the sandstone in fact
                    which has given Cape Roxo or Cap Rouge its name. Clay slates also occur, and at
                    intervals these sedimentary strata are interrupted by basaltic amygdaloid and
                    volcanic rocks. For instance, the island of Gorée is basaltic; the Bissagos
                    (Bissão) Islands are composed of scoriae and other volcanic products; and a
                    great part of the coast to the north of Rio Nuñez consists of basaltic and
                    amygdaloid rocks. The base of the mountains is formed in certain places of clay
                    slate, but more generally of granite, porphyry, syenite, or trachyte. In those
                    districts mica schists and iron ores occur. Iron and gold are found in the
                    mountains and the alluvial deposits. The streams also carry down gold dust. Many
                    of the valleys are covered with fertile soils and there is generally a fertile
                    belt along the river sides; but the rest of the country is rather arid and
                    sterile.</p>
                <p>The climate is far from being so unhealthy as is frequently asserted. Except when
                    yellow fever is raging, Europeans may live there as satisfactorily as at home.
                    There are two seasons, the dry season and the rainy season or winter, the latter
                    contemporaneous with our summer. Along the seaboard the dry season is cool and
                    agreeable; in the interior it is mild only for the three months which correspond
                    to our winter, and then it becomes a time of intolerable heat. The annual
                    temperature increases as we advance south and more rapidly as we advance east
                    into the interior, except, of course, where an ascent is made to higher
                    altitudes. To the south of Cape Verd the changes of temperature become less and
                    less marked; Bissão has a more equable climate than Gorée. Eastwards the monthly
                    range of the thermometer becomes more extensive. The maximum readings, which are
                    exceptional at St Louis, become almost the rule at Bakel on the upper Senegal
                    and at MacCarthy on the Gambia. In the north, on the banks of the Senegal, the
                    north-east trade-winds blow for eight months of the year, the daily land and sea
                    breezes which cool the atmosphere along the seaboard not being felt far inland.
                    During the other four months there prevails a gentle south-west monsoon
                    accompanied with frequent calms, storms, tornadoes, and rains. Southwards along
                    the coast the trade-winds gradually decrease in both strength and duration,
                    while the south-west monsoon becomes more powerful and persistent. The rainy
                    season begins at Gorée between 27th June and 13th July, on the Gambia about 20th
                    June, on the Casamance about the end of May, at the Bissagos Archipelago about
                    the middle of May, and on the Rio Nuñez at the end of April. During this season
                    Senegambia, drenched by heavy rains brought from the ocean, has everywhere one
                    uniform appearance. The mean temperature is throughout very close on 81° Fahr.
                    and the range of the thermometer is extremely limited. The rivers overflow and
                    flood the lowlands. Storms are frequent. Vegetation displays its fullest energy.
                    The fever exhalations are unfortunately also at their worst. At St Louis, Gorée,
                    Dagana, and all along the Senegal there are 35 days of rain, a slight increase
                    being apparent in the upper course of the river. At St Mary’s, Bathurst, there
                    are 48 days, at Sedhiu 84, at Bissão 111, at Boké 137,—a steady increase as we
                    approach the equator. The number of storms follows almost the same ratio of
                    increase, and showers which last two or three hours at St Louis give place to
                    whole days of rain on the Casamance and the Rio Nuflez.</p>
                <p>The king of the Senegambian trees is the baobab <hi rend="italic">(Adansonia
                    digitata),</hi> which sometimes at the height of 24 feet has a diameter of 34
                    feet and a circumference of 104. Acacias are very numerous, one species, <hi
                    rend="italic">A. Adansonia,</hi> being indeed the commonest of all Senegambian
                    trees and valuable for its ship-timber. Among the palm-trees the <hi
                    rend="italic">ronier</hi> deserves to be mentioned, as the wood resists moisture
                    and the attacks of insects; in some places, as in Cayor, it forms magnificent
                    forests. The wood of the cailcedra <hi rend="italic">(Khaya senegalensis),</hi>
                    a tall tree, is used in joiner’s work and inlaying, and its bark furnishes a
                    bitter tonic. The mampatas grows sometimes 100 feet high, its branches beginning
                    only at a height of about 25 feet The tree producing the famous kola-nut<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A very complete account of

                    the southern streams. It is almost needless to mention the m’bilor, the gonat,
                    the mimosa, fig-trees, orange-trees, cocoa-palms, mango-trees, pomegranates,
                    sycamores, and so on. The dimb, the neteru, the tiamanoi, the dimbguton, the
                    gologne, the n’tabo yield edible fruits. The cultivated plants are millet, rice,
                    tobacco, haricots, ground-nuts, indigo (wild indigo is also abundant), cotton
                    (also found wild), maize, sugar-cane, and the butter-tree or karité..</p><p>The
                    Senegambian lion is quite different from the Barbary lion: its colour is a
                    deeper and brighter yellow, and its mane is neither so thick nor so long, Other
                    beasts of prey are the leopard, the wild cat, the cheetah, the civet, and the
                    hyaena. The wild boar is clumsier than the European variety. Antelopes and
                    gazelles occur in large herds all through upper Senegambia; the giraffe is
                    common in the region of the upper Senegal; the elephant is rare; the
                    hippopotamus is gradually disappearing. Crocodiles swarm both in the upper
                    Senegal and the upper Niger. Monkeys and apes of different species (the
                    chimpanzee, the colobus, the cynocephalus, &amp;c. ), the squirrel, rat, and
                    mouse abound. The hedgehog, marmot, porcupine, hare, rabbit, &amp;c., are also
                    met with. Among the more noteworthy birds are the ostrich, which migrates to the
                    Sahara; the bustard, occurring in desert and uncultivated districts; the
                    marabout, a kind of stork, with its beak black in the middle and red at the
                    point, which frequents the moist meadow-lands and the lagoons; the brown
                    partridge, the rock partridge, and the quail in the plains and on the mountain
                    sides; and the guinea-fowl in the thickets and brushwood. Along the coast are
                    caught the sperm whale, the manatee, and the cod-fish. The domestic animals are
                    the horse, ass, ox, sheep, goat, dog, and camel.</p><p>The population of
                    Senegambia cannot be ascertained with any approach to accuracy, but it may be
                    roughly stated at from ten to twelve millions. It comprises three distinct
                    races,—the Moor, the Negro, and the European. The Moors, or rather Berbers
                    (Trarzas, Braknas, and Duaish), belong strictly to the right bank of the Senegal
                    and appear in Senegambia only exceptionally. The Negroes form the bulk of the
                    population. They are divided into Pouls (Peuls, Fulbe, Fulah, or Fellatah),
                    Toucouleurs, Mandingoes, Sarakolés, Wolofs, Sereres, Diolas, Bambaras, Balantes,
                    Biafares, Papels, Nalus, Landumans, Bagas, and Susus. The Pouls inhabit Futa,
                    Damga, Bondu, and Futa-Jallon; they have a reddish complexion and almost
                    straight hair, their body fairly stout, but their limbs slim. They are gentle
                    and hospitable, but addicted to theft. The Toucouleurs, Poul half-breeds,
                    belonging originally to Futa-Jallon, are similar to the Negro proper; they are
                    treacherous, warlike, fond of plunder, and fanatical in their Mohammedanism. The
                    Mandingoes or Malinkés inhabit the basins of the upper Niger and the upper
                    Senegal and the western slope of the mountains of Futa-Jallon. They comprise the
                    Mandingo proper, occupying Manding, and the Malinkés and Soninkés, scattered
                    about Bambuk, Buré, and Fuladugu. Under the name of Wakore or Wangara they are
                    also found in all the immense tract which extends to the north of the Kong
                    Mountains. They are tall of stature and of great muscular strength. The
                    Sarakolés are one of the branches of the Bambara race produced by crossing with
                    the Pouls. Their character is mild and pacific. Scattered about in Guoy, Kamera,
                    and Guidimakha, they are fond of trade and engage in it with activity. The
                    Wolofs and the Sereres inhabit the seaboard from St Louis to Cape Verd and the
                    left bank of the Senegal from its mouth to Richard Toll and Dagana. They are
                    tall and robust, with black and glossy skin. Most of them are fetishists. The
                    Diolas have flat noses, thick lips, harsh features, and a prominent belly; the
                    body is tattooed. The Bambaras, who have invaded Kaarta and Khasso, have a
                    coppery black complexion and frizzly hair; their cheeks are marked with deep
                    scars. The Balantes inhabit the left bank of the Casamance; they are as cruel
                    and as fond of pillage as the Mandingoes, but are more generous towards the
                    vanquished. The Biafares live on the banks of the Rio Grande and the Papels in
                    the valley of the Cacheo and the Geba. The Nalus and the Landumans are tributary
                    to the French ports of the Rio Nuflez and the Rio Pongo. Islam is gradually
                    detaching them from fetishism. The Bagas occupy the coast between the Rio Nunez
                    and the Rio Pongo. The Susus formerly dwelt on the upper Niger, but they were
                    expelled by the invasion of the Mohammedans and are at the present time settled
                    in the valley of the Rio Pongo. The principal languages of Senegambia are Wolof,
                    Poul, Sereres, Mandingo, and Arabic. Wolof is spoken in a large part of
                    Senegambia, in Wolof, Walo, Cayor, Dakar, Baol, Sine, Salum, and in the towns of
                    St Louis and Gorée. The river Senegal marks the line of separation between Wolof
                    and Arabic. Poul is the language of the Pouls and the Toucouleurs; Mandingo
                    comprises several dialects,—Malinké, Soninké, Bambara. The few Europeans are
                    mainly civil and military officials or traders. White planters are rare. The
                    natives of Senegambia are generally divided into two quite distinct
                    classes,—freemen and slaves. The griots are a kind of bards or trouvères who
                    live at the expense of those whose praises they sing. Polygamy is generally
                    practised. Circumcision of the adults of both sexes is a rite accompanied with
                    superstitious</p></note> grows on the banks<pb break="no"

                    >q.v.</hi>) and the islands of Los. Portuguese Senegambia consisted till quite
                    recently of Bissagos Archipelago and the “factories” of Zighinchor on the
                    Casamance, Cacheo and Farim on the Rio Cacheo, and Geba on the Geba. By an
                    arrangement effected in 1886 Portugal ceded Zighinchor to France in exchange for
                    Massabé on the Loango coast. Germany, which seemed at one time disposed to place
                    various territories of Dubreka, Koba, and Kabitai under its protection, has
                    formally abandoned the plan. The independent states are not very numerous, but
                    for the most part they are more extensive than the protected countries. They
                    were quite recently—Jolof, lying between the Senegal and the Gambia in one
                    direction and between the Falemé and the ocean in the other; Buré in the
                    Mandingo region, a territory abounding in gold; Guidimakha in Gangara, on the
                    right bank of the Senegal. There still remain among the more important Kaarta,
                    the country of Segu, and Futa-Jallon.</p>
                <p>Several lines of English, French, and German packets call at the Senegambian
                    ports, and small steamers ascend the navigable portions of the rivers. A railway
                    unites St Louis and Dakar, and another line is being constructed from Kayes to
                    Bafulabé (on the upper Senegal), with a projected extension to Bammako. There is
                    telegraphic communication between Dakar and St Louis, and a second line puts all
                    the ports of the upper Niger and the left bank of the Senegal into connexion
                    with St Louis, which has touch of Europe by means of a submarine cable passing
                    by way of the Canary Islands to Cadiz. The foreign trade of Senegambia consists
                    in the exportation of gums, ground-nuts, sesame, oil, india-rubber, birds’
                    feathers, hides, wax, and ivory, coffee from the Rio Nunez, and rice from the
                    Casamance, and the importation of iron, alcoholic liquors, firearms, ammunition,
                    coral, beads, tobacco, preserved foods, and blue calico (guinée). (D. K*.)</p>
