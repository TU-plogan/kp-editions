                    by which used to be meant the bird now almost invariably called <hi

                    half of the 16th century transferred to one hitherto generally, and in these
                    days locally, known as the Spoon-billed Duck—the <hi rend="italic">Anas
                    clypeata</hi> of Linnaeus and <hi rend="italic">Spatula</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhynchaspis clypeata</hi> of modern writers. All these names refer
                    to the shape of the bird’s bill, which, combined with the remarkably long <hi

                    has been thought sufficient to remove the species from the Linnaean genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Anas.</hi> Except for the extraordinary formation of this feature,
                    which carries with it a clumsy look, the male Shoveler would pass for one of the
                    most beautiful of this generally beautiful group of birds. As it is, for bright
                    and variegated colouring, there are few of his kindred to whom he is inferior.
                    His golden eye, his dark green head, surmounting a throat of pure white and
                    succeeded by a breast and flanks of rich bay, are conspicuous; while his deep
                    brown back, white scapulars, lesser wing-coverts (often miscalled shoulders) of
                    a glaucous blue, and glossy green speculum bordered with white present a
                    wonderful contrast of the richest tints, heightened again by his bright orange
                    feet. On the other hand, the female, excepting the blue wing-coverts she has in
                    common with her mate, is habited very like the ordinary Wild-Duck, <hi
                    rend="italic">A. boscas</hi> (see vol. vii. p. 505). The Shoveler is not an
                    abundant species, and in Great Britain its distribution is local; but its
                    numbers have remarkably increased since the passing of the WildFowl Protection
                    Act in 1876,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prior to
                    that year there was perhaps only one district in England wherein the Shoveler
                    could he said to breed regularly, and thereto only a few pairs resorted. In 1885
                    there must have been a dozen counties in which it nested, and in some of them
                    the pairs breeding might be reckoned by the score.</p></note> so that in certain
                    districts it has regained its old position as an indigenous member of the Fauna.
                    It has not ordinarily a very high northern range, but inhabits the greater part
                    of Europe, Asia, and America, passing southwards, like most of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anatidae</hi> towards winter, constantly reaching India, Ceylon,
                    Abyssinia, the Antilles, and Central America, while it is known to have occurred
                    at that season in New Granada, and, according to Gould, in Australia. Generally
                    resembling in its habits the other freshwater Ducks, the Shoveler has one
                    peculiarity that has been rarely, if ever, mentioned, and one that is perhaps
                    correlated with the structure of its bill. It seems to be especially given to
                    feeding on the surface of the water immediately above the spot where Diving
                    Ducks <hi rend="italic">(Fuligulinae)</hi> are employing themselves beneath. On
                    such occasions a pair of Shovelers may be watched, almost for the hour together,
                    swimming in a circle, about a yard in diameter, their heads turned inwards
                    towards its centre, their bills immersed vertically in the water, and engaged in
                    sifting, by means of the long <hi rend="italic">lamellae</hi> before mentioned,
                    the floating matters that are disturbed by their submerged allies and rise to
                    the top. These gyrations are executed with the greatest ease, each Shoveler of
                    the pair merely using the outer leg to impel it on its circular course, and to
                    the observer the prettiest part of the performance is the precision with which
                    each preserves its relative distance from its comrade.</p>
                <p>Four other species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Spatula,</hi> all possessing
                    the characteristic light blue “shoulders,” have been described:—one, <hi
                    rend="italic">S. platalea,</hi> from the southern parts of South America, having
                    the head, neck, and upper back of a pale reddish brown, freckled or closely
                    spotted with dark brown, and a dull bay breast with interrupted bars; a second,
                    <hi rend="italic">S. capensis,</hi> from South Africa, much lighter in colour
                    than the female of <hi rend="italic">S. clypeata</hi>; a third and a fourth, S.
                    <hi rend="italic">rhynchotis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">S. variegata,</hi> from
                    Australia and New Zealand respectively,—these last much darker in general
                    coloration, and the males possessing a white crescentic mark between the bill
                    and the eye, very like that which is found in the South-American Blue-winged
                    Teal <hi rend="italic">(Querquedula cyanoptera),</hi> but so much resembling
                    each other that their specific distinctness has been disputed by good authority.
                    In these last two the sexual difference is well marked by the plumage; but in
                    the South-American and SouthAfrican species it would seem that both male and
                    female have much the same appearance, as is the case with so many species of the
                    restricted genus <hi rend="italic">Anas,</hi> though this cannot yet be asserted
                    with certainty. (A. N. )</p>
