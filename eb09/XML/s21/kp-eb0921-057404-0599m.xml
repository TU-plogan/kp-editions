                <p><label type="entry">SCYTHE <hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi> SICKLE</label>. Till the
                    invention of the reaping machine, which came into practical use only about the
                    middle of the 19th century, scythes and sickles were the sole reaping
                    implements. The scythe is worked with two hands with a swinging motion, while
                    the sickle or reaping hook is held in one hand and the reaper bends and cuts the
                    crop with a shearing or hitting motion. Of the two the sickle is the more
                    ancient, and indeed there is some reason to conclude that its use is coeval with
                    the cultivation of grain crops. Among the remains of the later Stone period in
                    Great Britain and on the European continent curved flint knives have
                    occasionally been found the form of which has led to the suggestion that they
                    were used as sickles. Sickles of bronze occur quite commonly among remains of
                    the early inhabitants of Europe. Some of these are deeply curved hooks, flat on
                    the under-side, and with a strengthening ridge or back on the upper surface,
                    while others are small curved knives, in form like the ordinary hedge-bill.
                    Among the ancient Egyptians toothed or serrated sickles of both bronze and iron
                    were used. Ancient Roman drawings show that both the scythe and the sickle were
                    known to that people, and Pliny makes the distinction plain.<note

                    varieties, the Italian, which is the shorter and can he handled among brushwood,
                    and the two-handed Gallic sickle, which makes quicker work of it when employed
                    on their [the Gauls’] extensive domains; for there they cut their grass only in
                    the middle, and pass over the shorter blades. The Italian mowers cut with the
                    right hand only” <hi rend="italic">(II. N.,</hi> xviii. 67).</p></note> Although
                    both implements have lost much of their importance since the general
                    introduction of mowing and reaping machinery, they are still used very
                    extensively, especially in those countries where small agricultural holdings
                    prevail. The principal modern forms are the toothed hook, the scythe hook, the
                    Hainault scythe, and the common scythe. The toothed hook, which was in general
                    use till towards the middle of the 19th century, consists of a narrow-bladed
                    curved hook, having on its cutting edge a series of fine close-set serratures
                    cut like file-teeth, with their edges inclined towards the heft or handle. Such
                    sickles were formerly made of iron edged with steel; but in recent times they
                    came to be made of cast steel entirely. Towards the middle of the century the
                    toothed hook was gradually supplanted by the scythe hook or smooth-edged sickle,
                    a somewhat heavier and broader-bladed implement, having an ordinary knife edge.
                    Both these implements were intended for “shearing” handful by handful, the crop
                    being held in the left hand and cut with the tool held in the right. A heavy
                    smooth-edged sickle is used for “bagging” or “clouting,”—an operation in which
                    the hook is struck against the straw, the left hand being used to gather and
                    carry along the cut swath. The Hainault scythe is an implement intermediate
                    between the scythe and<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0600-0575"/> the sickle, being worked with one hand, and the
                    motion is entirely a swinging or bagging one. The implement consists of a short
                    scythe blade mounted on a vertical handle, and in using it the reaper collects
                    the grain with a crook, which holds the straw together till it receives the
                    cutting stroke of the instrument. The Hainault scythe is extensively used in
                    Belgium. The common hay scythe consists of a slightly curved broad blade varying
                    in length from 28 to 46 inches, mounted on a bent, or sometimes straight, wooden
                    sned or snathe, to which two handles are attached at such distances as enable
                    the workman, with an easy stoop, to swing the scythe blade along the ground, the
                    cutting edge being slightly elevated to keep it clear of the inequalities of the
                    surface. The grain-reaping scythe is similar, but provided with a cradle or
                    short gathering rake attached to the heel and following the direction of the
                    blade for about 12 inches. The object of this attachment is to gather the stalks
                    as they are cut and lay them in regular swaths against the line of
                    still-standing corn. The reaping scythe, instead of a long sned, has frequently
                    two helves, the right hand branching from the left or main helve and the two
                    handles placed about 2 feet apart. The best scythe blades are made from rolled
                    sheets of steel, riveted to a back frame of iron, which gives strength and
                    rigidity to the blade. On the Continent it is still common to mould and hammer
                    the whole blade out of a single piece of steel, but such scythes are difficult
                    to keep keen of edge. There is a great demand for scythes in Russia, chiefly
                    supplied from the German empire and Austria. The principal manufacturing centre
                    of scythes and sickles in the United Kingdom is Sheffield.</p>
