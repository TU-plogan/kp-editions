                    TH, into which S passes in a lisping pronunciation; a larger part of the surface
                    of the tongue is brought near to the palate for TH than for S. The symbol which
                    represents the soft open sound corresponding to S is Z, though in practice S
                    often stands for both.</p>
                <p>The history of our symbol S is easy up to a certain point. It is the rounded form
                    of 5, rounded at a very early period for convenience of writing, for the change
                    is apparent in the old Italian alphabet of Caere, and still more on the recently
                    discovered vase of Formello; and even in the scribbling of the Greeks at Abu
                    Simbel—the oldest, or nearly the oldest, bit of Greek epigraphy—perfectly
                    rounded forms stand side by side with the angular ones. The common Greek form Σ
                    was obtained by adding a fourth stroke, and gradually making the top and bottom
                    ones horizontal. When, however, we wish to identify the Greek symbol of three
                    strokes with its Phoenician counterpart, the difficulty begins. The Phoenicians
                    had four symbols for sibilants, known in Hebrew as Zayin, Samekh, Ṣade, and
                    Shin; the last of these at a very early date represented two sounds, the English
                    <hi rend="italic">sh,</hi> and another sound which resembled that of Samekh and
                    ultimately became indistinguishable from it, both being pronounced as the
                    English s. The Greeks did not want all these symbols, consequently in different
                    parts of Greece one or other— not the same—Phoenician symbol fell into disuse.
                    One of these, M or N, called San, though lost in Ionic, appears in old Doric
                    inscriptions, as those of Thera, Melos, and Crete, Argos, Corinth, and Corcyra;
                    but the later Doric form is the usual Sigma; probably San was too like the nasal
                    M. There is no doubt that in form Zeta represents Zayin, and that Xi represents
                    Samekh. Moreover, Zeta and Zayin stand seventh in the Greek and Phoenician
                    alphabets respectively, and Xi and Samekh each fifteenth. Again, the form of San
                    with three strokes corresponds fairly with Ṣade, and Sigma is moderately like
                    Shin; but here the evidence of position comes in again to strengthen a somewhat
                    weak case, for in the old Italian alphabets San has the place of Ṣade, the
                    simpler form occurring in the Caere alphabet, the fuller in that of the Formello
                    vase; in both Sigma (rounded in form) has the place of Shin. These
                    identifications would be certain if the names corresponded as well as the forms;
                    but they clearly do not: Zeta and Ṣade (not Zayin) seem to hold together in
                    sound, and Sigma (as has often been suggested) looks like a “popular etymology”
                    for Samekh. But the objection from difference of names is not fatal. All names
                    which are thought of habitually in rows or sets tend to be modified under the
                    influence of analogy; and analogy has certainly been at work here, for Xi, which
                    is a purely Greek name, is, like Psi, and like Chi and Phi, due to the older Pi.
                    Similarly Eta and Theta have probably made Zeta; but it must be allowed that the
                    metamorphosis of Ṣade is more intelligible (as a matter of sound-change) than
                    that of Zayin. Probably we must have recourse to a different principle to
                    explain at least some part of our difficulty. We may suppose that in some part
                    of Greece the sounds denoted originally by Ṣade and Zayin became
                    indistinguishable; there would then exist for a time one sound but two names. It
                    would be a matter of little moment which name should survive; thus Ṣade (or
                    Zeta) might supersede Zayin, or one name might survive in one district—as San in
                    the Doric, but Sigma in the rest of Greece. This suggestion is made by Dr Taylor
                    <hi rend="italic">(The Alphabet,</hi> ii. 100). The history of the sounds, as
                    well as of the forms, of the Greek sibilants is difficult. Probably Sigma was
                    generally hard—our <hi rend="italic">s</hi> in <hi rend="italic">sign.</hi> But
                    Zeta did not originally denote the corresponding <hi rend="italic">z</hi>:
                    rather it was <hi rend="italic">dz;</hi> some say <hi rend="italic">dj,</hi> as
                    in “John,” but this is not likely. Xi was probably a strong sibilant with a weak
                    guttural, as X was in Latin. If the sound <hi rend="italic">z</hi> existed in
                    Greek, as is probable, it was denoted by Sigma. In Italy, also, we must infer
                    that the soft sibilant was heard too little to need a special symbol, because
                    <hi rend="italic">z</hi>, which exists in the old alphabets of Caere and
                    Formello, was lost early enough to leave a place for the newly-made Italian
                    symbol G. When Z was restored, it was placed at the end of the alphabet and
                    doubtless with the value of Greek Z in the Greek words in which alone it was
                    used. One Latin <hi rend="italic">s—</hi> probably <hi rend="italic">z—</hi>
                    became the trilled <hi rend="italic">r</hi> between two vowels,— <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in "Papirius” for “Papisius,” “arboris” for
                    “arbosis.”</p>
                <p>In English the symbol <hi rend="italic">s</hi> alone existed till z was
                    introduced from France with words of French origin, as “zeal,” “zone.” An
                    attempt was made to employ it at the end of plural nouns, where the sound is
                    regularly heard except when the last sound of the noun is hard, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., “</hi> bedz” (beds), but “hops”; but this was not
                    maintained, nor even consistently done, for the symbol was used even when the
                    sound must have been <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> We regularly write <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> for both sounds,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in “lose”
                    and “loose,” “curs” and “curse,” “hers” and “hearse.” When there is a
                    distinction in spelling the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> commonly has the value of
                    <hi rend="italic">z</hi>,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> “vies” and “vice,”
                    “pays” and “pace,” “his” and “hiss.” S has the sound of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sh</hi> in “sure,” “sugar,” and some other words; this is due to the palatal
                    sound heard before the <hi rend="italic">u. Sh,</hi> in spite of its spelling,
                    is a single sound, the position of which differs from that for s only in a
                    slight retraction of the point of the tongue; it is commonly found in English
                    words which originally had <hi rend="italic">sk,—e.g.,</hi> “shall,” O.E. <hi
                    rend="italic">seeal</hi>; “shabby,” a doublet of “scabby”; “fish,” O.E. <hi
                    rend="italic">fisk.</hi> The sound is the same as that of French <hi
                    rend="italic">ch</hi> in “chateau,” “chef,” “sécher,” where it is due to
                    assibilation of original <hi rend="italic">k.</hi></p>
