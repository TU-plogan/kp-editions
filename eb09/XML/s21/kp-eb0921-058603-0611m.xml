                    rend="italic">σφρaγiς,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">sigillum).</hi> During the
                    mediaeval period the importance of seals was very great, as they were considered
                    the main proofs of the authenticity of all sorts of documents, both public and
                    private.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In some cases,
                    in the presence of witnesses, a seal which did not belong to the signer of a
                    document was used when the right matrix was not at hand. This has naturally
                    caused many archaeological puzzles.</p></note> That is much less the case now,
                    the written signature being thought a safer guarantee of genuineness. In order
                    to make illicit use or imitation of a seal difficult, the seal itself was
                    usually locked up and guarded with special care, and in the case of royal
                    personages or corporate bodies was often made a very complicated work of art,
                    which it would have been almost impossible to copy exactly. One very curious
                    precaution that was adopted is still in use with the corporate seal of the
                    monasteries of Mount Athos. The circular matrix<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The word “seal” is often used to denote both
                    the impression made and the object that makes the impress. More correctly the
                    latter is called the “matrix,” and only the impression is called the “seal.”
                    </p></note> is divided into four quarters, each of which is kept by one of the
                    four <hi rend="italic">epistatai</hi> or ruling monks; the four pieces are
                    joined by a key-handle, which remains in the custody of the secretary. Thus it
                    is only when all five guardians of the various parts of the matrix meet together
                    that the complete seal can be stamped on any document. The device on the Mount
                    Athos seal is a half-length figure of the Madonna and Child, and the imprint is
                    made by blackening the matrix in the flame of a lamp and then pressing it on the
                    paper or vellum itself. Mediaeval seals were applied in two different ways: in
                    one the stamp was impressed in wax run on the surface of the document (Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">plaqué</hi> or <hi rend="italic">en placard);</hi> in the other
                    the wax impression was suspended by cord or strips of parchment (Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">pendant).</hi> The latter method was necessarily used with metal
                    seals or <hi rend="italic">bullae</hi> (see below). </p>
                <p>For the sake of greater security in the case of <hi rend="italic">plaqué</hi>
                    seals, it was a common practice from the 12th century onwards, or even earlier,
                    to make a cross cut in the vellum of the document, the corners of which were
                    then turned back, thus forming a square opening, over which the wax seal was
                    stamped; the turned-up corners helped to hold the wax in its place, and the
                    aperture allowed a second matrix to be applied at the back. This was usually a
                    smaller private seal called a <hi rend="italic">secretum.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus, for example, an abbot would use on the front of a document the large
                    corporate seal of his community, and on the back would stamp his personal seal
                    as a <hi rend="italic">secretum.</hi> Till the 12th century pure white beeswax
                    was generally used, after that wax coloured green or red. The use of shellac or
                    other harder materials, such as modern sealing-wax, is of recent date. Thus it
                    was usual to protect the soft wax seals by some sort of “fender,” often a wreath
                    of rushes or plaited strips of paper twisted round it; another method much
                    employed in the 15th century was to cover the seal with leaves of oak, bay, or
                    beech. <hi rend="italic">Pendant</hi> seals were often encased in boxes of wood
                    or <hi rend="italic">cuir bouilli,</hi> which in some cases are very richly
                    decorated. From the 13th to the 15th century original royal documents are
                    usually on fine vellum and have green seals hung by many-coloured silk and gold
                    thread, while office copies are on coarser vellum and have white seals hung by
                    parchment strips. In England an important official, called the clerk of the
                    chafe-wax, an office which still exists, was entrusted with the duty of
                    softening the wax for state seals over a chafing-brazier. Two different methods
                    of sealing documents, either closed or open for inspection, are recorded in the
                    legal terms “letters secret” and “letters patent.” </p>
                <p>Owing to the enormous number of mediaeval seals which still exist, and their
                    frequently great historical and artistic importance, it is necessary to adopt
                    some method of classification, especially for large collections, such as that of
                    the British Museum, which contains about 25,000 specimens, and the very
                    important one of the Society of Antiquaries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of seals is that of the French kings. The Carlovingian and Merovingian monarchs
                    mostly used antique gems or pastes,—portrait heads being selected and a legend
                    added in the metal setting of the matrix. Charlemagne used a head of Jupiter
                    Serapis,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The monks of
                    Durham also used a gem with a head of Jupiter Serapis, round which was added the

                    Dionysus. The British Museum possesses a seal of Odo or Eudes, king of France
                    (888-898), impressed from a fine Greek gem of the 3d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> with a portrait of Seleucus IV. The oldest existing
                    matrix is that of Lothaire I. (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 817), now preserved at
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, attached to an altar-cross. It is an oval intaglio in rock
                    crystal, with a laureated portrait and the legend + XPE . ADIVVA. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">hlotharivm</hi>. REG.; it is not an antique, but is of
                    contemporary Byzantino-Rhenish work. Till the time of Louis VI. (1108-1137)
                    these seals were <hi rend="italic">plaqué,</hi> but he introduced <hi
                    rend="italic">pendant</hi> seals about 1108; and counter-seals at the back were
                    first used by Louis VII. (1137-80). The grand series of round seals with an
                    enthroned figure of the king begins with the Capet Henry I. (1031-60). The king
                    holds a sceptre in one hand and a flower in the other. Those of the queens are
                    frequently of a pointed oval form, with a standing portrait figure holding a
                    flower in each hand. In the 13th and 14th centuries the French royal seals were
                    elaborate works of art, with a finely draped figure of the king seated under a
                    rich canopy on a throne, decorated with lions’ or eagles’ heads; the king holds
                    a sceptre in each hand. The queens’ seals, of a round or pointed oval form, are
                    also very beautiful, with a graceful figure standing between two shields under a
                    rich canopy. After the 15th century there was a rapid decadence in the royal
                    seals, and in the 17th and 18th centuries they were of the most tasteless style,
                    far worse than those used in England at the same date.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">English Royal Seals.—</hi> This, which is on the whole the most
                    beautiful of all royal series, begins with the seal of Edward the Confessor (see
                    fig. 1).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The English
                    kings before the Conquest signed usually with a cross only, but a few, such as
                    Offa, Ethelwulf, and Ethelred, occasionally used seals, especially on documents
                    containing grants to St Denis and other French abbeys, on which they followed
                    the French custom of affixing <hi rend="italic">plaqué</hi> seals.</p></note>
                    The great seal of William the Norman and his successors was not <hi
                    rend="italic">plaqué,</hi> like the earlier ones, but pendant; it has on one
                    side an enthroned figure of a king copied from contemporary French seals, and on
                    the reverse the king on horseback armed with spear and shield. These two ways of
                    representing the sovereign have been used on all the royal seals of England down
                    to the present day. By degrees greater elaboration of ornament was introduced
                    into the throne and its canopy. In Edward III.’s time niches with minute
                    statuettes of saints were added at the sides of the obverse. The climax of
                    magnificence was reached in the reign of Henry V. On the obverse of his seal the
                    king sits holding the orb and sceptre; the gorgeous canopy contains statuettes
                    of the Virgin and two saints, and at each side are three rows of statuettes in
                    minute canopied niches, each row two tiers high; about fifteen minute figures of
                    saints and angels are introduced into the design. On the reverse is the king on
                    horseback, bearing a sword and shield; the horse, going at full speed, is
                    clothed with richly embroidered heraldic drapery, and on its head and on the
                    king’s is a lion crest. After Henry V. the seals began to decrease in
                    magnificence, and in the reign of Henry VII. the new taste of the Renaissance
                    began to supplant the pure Gothic of the earlier seals. In the time of Philip
                    and Mary both sovereigns appear together, seated under canopies, or riding side
                    by side.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A variety of
                    design is introduced on the reverse of one of Queen Elizabeth’s seals: she is
                    represented standing, holding the orb and sceptre, and wears a dress with
                    enormous hoops. Her other seal has the usual equestrian portrait on the
                    reverse.</p></note> The great seal of the Commonwealth is a marvel of ugliness.
                    On the obverse is a perspective view of the interior of the House of Commons,
                    and on the reverse a map of Great Britain and Ireland. Cromwell’s seal has an
                    equestrian portrait of himself, and its reverse the arms of the Commonwealth
                    between a lion and a dragon as supporters. Little is noticeable about the seals
                    of succeeding sovereigns; that of Victoria is minutely cut, but is very poor as
                    a work of art.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Other English Seals.—</hi> Gilt bronze was the commonest
                    material for large seals, but other metals were used, such as gold, silver, and
                    lead, also jet and ivory, especially before the Norman Conquest. Rock crystal,
                    carnelian, and sard were the favourites among the hard stones cut for matrices.
                    Large seals were usually either round or of a pointed oval form (as in figs. 2
                    and 3); the small <hi rend="italic">secreta</hi> were sometimes square,
                    triangular, or hexagonal, as well as round or oval.<note anchored="true"

                    ecclesiastical seals and those of females were of the pointed oval form, most
                    others being circular; there are, however, many exceptions to this
                    rule.</p></note> The most elaborate and beautiful of all were those of religious
                    corporations, such as the chapter seals of monasteries.<note anchored="true"

                    Ages produced, especially during the 14th century, and exceed in delicacy of
                    workmanship and elaboration of design the finest seals of all other classes, not
                    excepting those of the sovereigns. Fig. 2 shows the common seal of Boxgrove
                    priory (Sussex), the matrix of which is now in the British Museum. On one side
                    is a figure of the Virgin enthroned, and on the reverse a representation of the
                    west front of the priory church, with open tracery and niches containing minute
                    statuettes. This elaborate matrix is made up of four distinct pieces of gilt
                    bronze, and to form the perfect seal must have been a work requiring
                    considerable skill and patience. The reverse was formed by two stamps used on
                    two separate plaques of softened wax: one of these formed the background with
                    the various statuettes, and the second was used to stamp the open tracery work
                    of the front of the church; the latter when hard was fitted on to the<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n613/mode/1up"

                    miniature model of the church was made, with its statues and the inner planes of
                    the façade seen through the open tracery work,—the effect being extremely rich
                    and delicate. When the finished obverse and reverse had been fitted together,
                    the legend was added on their edges by means of the fourth piece of the
                    matrix,—a strip of bronze with letters cut into it on both its edges; first one
                    side and then the other of this strip was pressed against the rim of the wax
                    seal, which thus received the impression of the complete legend all round its
                    edge. The seal of Southwark priory, also of the 14th century, is even more
                    elaborate, as both sides have open tracery separately applied, and thus the
                    matrix consists of five distinct pieces. Many of the bishops’ seals, though less
                    complicated in design, are of equal beauty to those of the chapters. The common
                    design has a standing figure under a richly decorated canopy. Fig. 3 shows a
                    very beautiful example, the seal of Richard, bishop of Durham. The standing
                    figure of the bishop in mass vestments is modelled with wonderful skill and
                    shows extreme taste in the treatment of the drapery; the legend is s[igillum]

                    variety of sacred subjects occur on ecclesiastical seals in addition to single
                    figures of patron saints; the most frequent were perhaps the Crucifixion, the
                    Annunciation, the Coronation of the Virgin, and the Virgin enthroned in Heaven;
                    small figures of kneeling worshippers were often added. Fig. 4 shows one of the
                    most magnificent of this class, with, in the centre, a figure of the Virgin in
                    glory, between St Nicholas and Henry VI., each under a very rich canopy; at the
                    sides are shields charged with England and France, and France (modern) alone,
                    held by two monks.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    class of seal is often a sort of miniature reproduction of some magnificent
                    altar retable, as in fig. 4.</p></note> This very beautiful work of art dates
                    about the year 1443. In the 15th century the ecclesiastical seals began to fall
                    off in richness and beauty, and after the Reformation were of little artistic
                    value. Very handsome seals were used by lay corporations, especially the
                    municipalities of towns. These last frequently have a careful representation of
                    the town itself, with its circuit of walls or that of its chief castle or
                    cathedral, and thus often afford valuable evidence as to the form of its
                    defences and principal buildings. Fig. 5 shows a fine example, 3 inches in
                    diameter, —the corporate seal of Rochester, made in the 13th century; it has a
                    minute representation of the keep of Rochester Castle, surrounded by an outer
                    circuit wall and a moat. On one of the turrets of the gateway is a sentinel
                    blowing a signal horn; legend, <hi rend="smallcaps">sigillvm</hi>. CIVIVM .
                    ROFENSIS. The reverse has the same legend repeated round the scene of the
                    Crucifixion of St Andrew. Other corporation seals are covered with small figures
                    under elaborate canopy work, much like those of the ecclesiastical
                    foundations.</p>
                <p> Seals of hospitals are often designed in a similar way, with a representation of
                    the hospital building very minutely treated. In the 15th century seals began to
                    be designed in a rather pictorial style, which, though very graceful, is
                    inferior to the earlier and more architectonic class. Very magnificent seals
                    were used by state officials: those of the lord high admiral of England are
                    especially fine, from the beautiful form of the ship on the obverse. Fig. 6
                    shows that of the earl of Huntingdon, who was lord high admiral in the reign of
                    Henry VIII. In design it resembles those of the admirals of the previous
                    century. On the sails are embroidered the royal arms of England. Among private
                    seals those of powerful barons are often large and very beautifully cut. Fig. 7
                    shows a silver matrix, now in the British Museum, which is remarkable for the
                    great beauty of its workmanship. Its legend is SIGILLVM . ROBERTI . <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">filii . Walterl</hi> On it an armed knight, of the time of
                    Henry III., is riding over a dragon, whose tail ends in a scroll of very

                    delicacy.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n614/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0614-0589"/> A common and graceful form of private seal in the
                    13th and 14th centuries has simply a shield with the owner’s arms on a diapered
                    background, the whole enclosed with in many-cusped tracery. Fig. 8 shows an
                    example of a fine Graeco-Roman gem, —a carnelian engraved with a female head,
                    full face. The 14th-century owner of this has added a metal setting with the
                    words <hi rend="smallcaps">capvt .</hi> MARIE . MAGDALENE, to give it a sacred
                    meaning. The legends of private seals or <hi rend="italic">secreta</hi> were
                    often chosen in allusion to their use; common phrases are “clausa secreta tego,”
                    or “lecta lege, tecta tege.” Many ingenious devices were practised to enable the
                    same matrix to give two or more different varieties of impression. In some cases
                    the border with the legend was so contrived as to slide up the handle, so that
                    the seal could be made either with or without an inscription. Others had the
                    border made to revolve on a swivel, so as to supply two different legends; and
                    the magnificent monastic seals (as that shown in fig. 2) were arranged so as to
                    give a perfect seal without the use of the elaborate open tracery. In the 15th
                    and 16th centuries merchants and handicraftsmen frequently employed devices
                    connected with their trade—either some tool or badge or an arbitrary sign used
                    as a trade-mark; or a rebus of the owner’s name was used, such as a bolt and a
                    tun (cask) for the name Bolton. The use of seals by the humbler classes was more
                    common in England than abroad; even bondsmen sometimes had seals, both before
                    and after the Norman Conquest. Seals of other countries mostly followed the same
                    fashions as those of England, though of course varying in design and workmanship
                    with each country. On the whole, the English seals were superior during their
                    best period (the 14th century) to those of any other country, though matrices of
                    great beauty were produced in both Germany and France. In Italy less care and
                    skill were usually spent on seals, partly owing to the greater use of metal
                    bullae for important charters.</p>

                    passed through a hole in the seal. Lead was the metal most commonly used, but
                    some sovereigns had bullae struck in silver or gold, either as a mark of their
                    own dignity or to confer special honour on the recipient of a charter. An extant
                    letter from Petrarch to Charles IV. thanks that emperor for a diploma of the
                    rank of count, and especially for the honour shown to him by the attachment of
                    gold bullae to the document. Lead bullae were also used by various
                    ecclesiastical dignitaries, from patriarchs to bishops, but were rarely used by
                    ecclesiastics of lower rank. In some cases, however, especially in Sicily and
                    Byzantium, bullae were used by laymen of very moderate rank. A large number of

                    patriarchs of Byzantium. Those of the doges of Venice exist in large numbers,
                    bearing figures of St Mark and the reigning doge kneeling before him. Existing
                    bullae of Charlemagne have a rude profile portrait crowned with a diadem, and on
                    the reverse the monogram of <hi rend="smallcaps">karolvs</hi> arranged in the
