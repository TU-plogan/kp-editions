                    notions in common.” His career of playwriting extended from 1625 to the
                    suppression of stage plays by parliament in 1642. Born in London in 1596, he had
                    been educated for a profession—at Merchant Taylors’ school, St John’s College,
                    Oxford, and Catherine Hall, Cambridge. The church was his destination, but he
                    turned Roman Catholic, and made a living for two years as a schoolmaster. His
                    first play, <hi rend="italic">Love Tricks,</hi> seems to have been accepted
                    while he was teaching at St Albans, and for eighteen years from that time he was
                    a prolific writer for the stage, producing more than thirty regular plays,
                    tragedies, and comedies, and showing no sign of exhaustion when a stop was put
                    to his occupation by the Puritan edict. He turned again to teaching for a
                    livelihood and prospered, publishing some educational works under the
                    Commonwealth. Besides these he published<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0855-0830"/> during the period of dramatic eclipse three small
                    volumes of poems and masques, in 1646, 1653, and 1659. He survived into the
                    reign of Charles II., but, though some of his comedies were revived, he did not
                    again attempt to write for the stage. It is said that he and his second wife
                    died of the fright caused by the great fire of 1666.</p>
                <p>There is little original force but much stage-craft and manipulative dexterity in
                    Shirley’s plays. He was born to great dramatic wealth, and he handled it freely.
                    It has been remarked that he did not, like some of his great predecessors, take
                    his plots from narrative fiction or history, but constructed them for himself.
                    This is true; but he constructed them out of the abundance of materials that had
                    been accumulated by more originative men during thirty years of unexampled
                    dramatic activity. He did not strain after novelty of situation or character,
                    but worked with confident ease and buoyant copiousness on the familiar lines,
                    contriving situations and exhibiting characters after types whose effectiveness
                    on the stage had been proved by ample experience. He spoke the same language
                    with the great dramatists, it is true, but this grand style appears in him as
                    the mechanical knack of an able and clever workman. It is often employed for the
                    artificial elevation of commonplace thought. “Clear as day” becomes in this
                    manner “day is not more conspicuous than this cunning”; while the proverb “Still
                    waters run deep” is ennobled into—</p>
                <p>The shallow rivers glide away with noise—</p>
                <p>The deep are silent.</p>
                <p>But it cannot be denied that he uses the poetic diction of his predecessors with
                    ease, spirit, and judgment. His scenes are ingeniously conceived, his characters
                    boldly and clearly drawn; and he never falls beneath a high level of stage
                    effect.</p>
                <p>His chief plays were— <hi rend="italic">Love Tricks,</hi> a comedy, 1625; <hi
                    rend="italic">The Maid's Revenge,</hi> a tragedy, 1626; <hi rend="italic">The

                    a comedy, 1633; <hi rend="italic">The Example</hi> (containing an imitation of

                    Opportunity,</hi> 1634; <hi rend="italic">The Traitor,</hi> a tragedy (perhaps
                    Shirley’s best), 1635; <hi rend="italic">The Lady of Pleasure</hi> (perhaps the
                    best of his comedies), 1635; <hi rend="italic">The Cardinal,</hi> a tragedy (an
                    attempt to compete with Webster’s <hi rend="italic">Duchess of Malfi),</hi>
                    1641. An edition of his works in six volumes, with notes by Dyce and Gifford,
                    was published in 1833.</p>
