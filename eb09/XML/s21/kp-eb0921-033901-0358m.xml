                    striking manner how the destinies of a nation may depend on the fortunes of a
                    princely family. During eight centuries, and through all changes of fortune, the
                    princes of Savoy have kept one end steadily in view, and, in the words of
                    Charles Emmanuel III., have “treated Italy as an artichoke to be eaten leaf by
                    leaf.” The ambitions of princes and the interests of the people have fortunately
                    tended in the same direction, and their work is now perfected in the glory of
                    their house and the freedom of the state.</p>
                <p>The descent of <hi rend="smallcaps">Humbert</hi> the Whitehanded, the founder of
                    the family, is uncertain, but he was most probably a son of Amadeus, the
                    great-grandson of that Boso of Provence (879) who was father of the emperor
                    Louis the Blind. In reward for services rendered to Rudolph III. of Arles,
                    Humbert obtained from him in 1027 the counties of Savoy and Maurienne, and from
                    the emperor Conrad the Salic Chablais and the Lower Valais. His territories,
                    therefore, all lay on the north-western slopes of the Alps. On his death in 1048
                    he was succeeded perhaps by his eldest son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> I.,
                    but eventually by his fourth son <hi rend="smallcaps">Otho</hi>, "who, by his
                    marriage with Adelaide, sole heiress of the marquis of Susa, obtained the
                    counties of Turin and the Val d’Aosta, and so acquired a footing in the valley
                    of the Po. His wife’s rank, too, as marchioness made the family guardians of the
                    frontier by authority of the king of Italy, as they had been before by
                    possession of territory, and was the foundation of their subsequent power as
                    “warders” of the Alps. Otho was succeeded in 1060 by his son <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> II., who maintained a judicious neutrality between
                    his brother-in-law the emperor Henry IV. and the pope. In reward for his
                    mediation between them he obtained from the former after Canossa the province of
                    Bugey. The accession of his son <hi rend="smallcaps">HumberT</hi> II. in 1080
                    brought fresh increase of territory in the valley of the Tarantaise, and in 1091
                    this prince succeeded to the dignities of his grandmother Adelaide, when he
                    assumed the title of prince of Piedmont. <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> III.
                    came to the throne in 1103, and in 1111 his states were created counties of the
                    empire by Henry V. On his way home from the crusades in 1149 Amadeus died at
                    Nicosia, and was succeeded by his son <hi rend="smallcaps">HumberT</hi> III.
                    This prince did not follow the example of Amadeus II., but took the part of the
                    pope against Barbarossa, who accordingly ravaged his territories until Humbert’s
                    death in 1188. The guardians of his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi> acted
                    more discreetly, and reconciled their ward and the emperor. He remained
                    Ghibelline all his life, and received from Henry VI. accessions of territory in
                    Vaud, Bugey, and Valais, with the title of imperial vicar in Piedmont and
                    Lombardy. He was followed in 1233 by <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> IV.,
                    whose wife was the beautiful Cecilia of Beaux, surnamed Passe Rose. A campaign
                    against the inhabitants of Valais ended in the annexation of their district, and
                    his support of Frederick II. against the pope caused the erection of Chablais
                    and Aosta into a duchy. In 1253 his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi>
                    succeeded to his states at the age of nine, but, after giving proofs of his
                    valour by defeating the troops of Charles of Anjou before Turin, he was taken
                    prisoner and died of grief (1263).</p>
                <p>The Salic law now came into operation for the first time, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Peter,</hi> the uncle of Boniface, was called to the throne.
                    This prince, on the marriage of his nieces Eleanor and Sancha of Provence with
                    Henry III. of England and Richard, earl of Cornwall, had visited England, where
                    he had been created earl of Richmond, and built a palace in London afterwards
                    called Savoy House. His brothers Boniface and William were also appointed, the
                    former to the see of Canterbury, and the latter to the presidency of the
                    council. In return he recognized the claims of Richard to the impe-<pb

                    diocese of Lausanne, conveniently near to the county of Geneva, which had been
                    willed to him by the last count. But this increase of territory only brought new
                    anxieties, for Peter’s short reign was occupied in reducing refractory vassals
                    to obedience. At his death in 1268 he was succeeded by his brother <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Philip</hi> L, who died in 1285, when their nephew <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> V. came to the throne. This prince, surnamed the
                    Great, united Baugé and Bresse to his states in right of his wife Sibylla, and
                    later on Lower Faucigny and part of Geneva. For his second wife he married Mary
                    of Brabant, sister of the emperor Henry VII., from whom, in reward for his
                    services in North Italy, he received the seigneury of Aosta. His life was passed
                    in continual and victorious warfare, and one of his last exploits was to force
                    the Turks to raise the siege of Rhodes. In commemoration of his victory it is
                    said that he substituted for the eagles in his arms the letters F.E.R.T. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit).</hi> He died in 1323 while making
                    preparations for a campaign in aid of his nephew, the emperor of the East. His
                    son <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward</hi> succeeded him, and, dying in 1329, was
                    followed by his brother <hi rend="smallcaps">Aymon.</hi> This prince died in
                    1343, when his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> VI. ascended the throne.
                    His reign was, like his grandfather’s, a series of petty wars, from which he
                    came out victorious and with extended territory, until, accompanying Louis of
                    Anjou on his expedition against Naples, he died there of the plague (1383). The
                    reign of his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> VII. promised to be as
                    glorious as those of his ancestors, but it was cut short by a fall from his
                    horse in 1391. Before his death, however, he had received the allegiance of
                    Barcelonnette, Ventimiglia, Villafranca, and Nice, so gaining access to the
                    Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>His son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> VIII. now came to the throne, under the
                    guardianship of his grandmother Bonne de Bourbon. On attaining his majority he
                    first directed his efforts to strengthening his power in the outlying provinces,
                    and in this he was particularly successful. The states of Savoy now extended
                    from the Lake of Geneva to the Mediterranean, and from the Saône to the Sesia.
                    Its prince had therefore considerable power, and Amadeus threw all the weight of
                    this on the side of the emperor. Sigismund was not ungrateful, and in 1416
                    erected the counties of Savoy and Piedmont into duchies. At this time too the
                    duke recovered the fief of Piedmont, which had been granted to Philip, prince of
                    Achaia, by Amadeus V., and his power was thus thoroughly consolidated. The
                    county of Vercelli afterwards rewarded him for joining the league against the
                    duke of Milan, but in 1434 a plot against his life made him put into execution a
                    plan he had long formed of retiring to a monastery. He accordingly made his son
                    Louis lieutenant-general of the dukedom, and assumed the habit of the knights of
                    S. Maurice, a military order he had founded at the priory of Ripaille. But he
                    was not destined to find the repose he sought. The prelates assembled at the
                    council of Basel voted the deposition of Pope Eugenius IV., and elected Amadeus
                    in his place. Felix V., as he was now called, then abdicated his dukedom
                    definitively, but without much gain in temporal honours, for the schism
                    continued until the death of Eugenius in 1447, shortly after which it was healed
                    by the honourable submission of Felix to Nicholas V. The early years of Louis’s
                    reign were under the guidance of his father, and peace and prosperity blessed
                    his people; but he afterwards made an alliance with the dauphin which brought
                    him into conflict with Charles VII. of France, though a lasting reconciliation
                    was soon effected. His son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> IX. succeeded in
                    1465, but, though his virtues led to his beatification, his bodily sufferings
                    made him assign the regency to his wife Yolande, a daughter of</p>
                <p>' Charles VII. He died in 1472, when his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Philibert</hi>
                    I. succeeded to the throne and to his share in the contests of Yolande with her
                    brother and brothers-in-law, who tried to deprive their nephew of his rights.
                    His reign lasted only ten years, when he was succeeded by his brother <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi> I. This prince raised for a time by his valour the
                    drooping fortunes of his house, but he died in 1489 at the age of thirty-one,
                    having inherited from his aunt, Charlotte of Lusignano, her pretensions to the
                    titular kingdoms of Cyprus, Jerusalem, and Armenia. He was succeeded by his son
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi> II., an infant, who, dying in 1496, was
                    followed by <hi rend="smallcaps">Philip</hi> II., brother of Amadeus IX. He died
                    in 1497, leaving <hi rend="smallcaps">PhiliberT</hi> II., who succeeded him, and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi> III., who ascended the throne on his brother’s
                    death in 1504. In spite of himself Charles was drawn into the wars of the
                    period, for in the quarrel between Francis I. and the pope he could not avoid
                    espousing the cause of his nephew. But the decisive victory of Francis at
                    Marignano gave the duke the opportunity of negotiating the conference at Bologna
                    which led to the conclusion of peace in 1516. So far well, but Charles was less
                    fortunate in the part he took in the wars between Francis I. and Charles V., the
                    brother-in-law of his wife. He tried to maintain a strict neutrality, but his
                    attendance at the emperor’s coronation at Bologna in 1530 was imperative in his
                    double character of kinsman and vassal. The visit was fatal to him, for he was
                    rewarded with the county of Asti, and this so displeased the French king that,
                    on the revolt of Geneva to Protestantism in 1532, Francis sent help to the
                    citizens. Bern and Freiburg did likewise, and so expelled the duke from Lausanne
                    and Vaud. Charles now sided definitely with the emperor, and Francis at once
                    raised some imaginary claims to his states. On their rejection the French army
                    marched into Savoy, and, finding the pass of Susa unfortified, descended on
                    Piedmont and seized Turin (1536). Charles V. came to the aid of his ally, and
                    invested the city, but, being himself hard pressed, was obliged to make peace.
                    France kept Savoy, and the emperor occupied Piedmont, so that only Nice remained
                    to the duke. On the resumption of hostilities in 1541 Piedmont again suffered.
                    In 1544 the treaty of Crespy restored his states to Charles, but the terms were
                    not carried out and he died of grief in 1553. His only surviving son <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Emmanuel Philibert</hi> succeeded to the rights but not the
                    domains of his ancestors. Since 1536 he had attached himself to the service of
                    the emperor, and had already given promise of a brilliant career. On the
                    abdication of Charles V; the duke was appointed governor of the Low Countries,
                    and in 1557 the victory of St Quentin marked him as one of the first generals of
                    his time. Such services could not go unrewarded, and the peace of
                    Cateau-Cambresis restored him his states, with certain exceptions still to be
                    held by France and Spain. One of the conditions of the treaty also provided for
                    the marriage of the duke with the lovely and accomplished Margaret of France,
                    sister of Henry II. The evacuation of the places held by them was faithfully
                    carried out by the contracting powers, and Emmanuel Philibert occupied himself
                    in strengthening his military and naval forces, until his death in 1580
                    prevented the execution of the ambitious designs he had conceived. His son <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Charles Emmanuel</hi> I., called the Great, being prevented by
                    Henry III. from retaking Geneva, threw in his lot with Spain, and in 1590
                    invaded Provence and was received by the citizens of Aix. His intention was
                    doubtless to revive the ancient kingdom of Arles, but his plans were frustrated
                    by the accession of Henry IV. to the throne of France. After effecting with
                    Henry an exchange of Bresse and Bugey for the marquisate of Saluzzo he kept up
                    an intermittent war with him until 1609, when, disgusted with the<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0361-0342"/> behaviour of Spain, he made a treaty with France
                    against Philip. But he could not remain faithful for long, and, siding first
                    with one and then with the other, he found himself in almost the same straits as
                    his grandfather, when death put an end to his ambitions and failures in 1630.
                    The first care of his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor Amadeus</hi> was to free
                    himself from the double burden of his enemy and his ally, so he concluded peace
                    in 1631. In 1635, however, Richelieu determined to drive the Spaniards out of
                    Italy, and offered the duke the alternatives of war or Milan. He gave but a
                    half-hearted assent to the schemes of France, and, without gaining Milan, died
                    in 1637, leaving by his wife Christina of France Francis Hyacinth, a minor, who
                    only survived till the following year, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles
                    Emmanuel</hi> II., whose legitimacy was unfortunately rather doubtful. The
                    regency of Christina resembled that of Yolande in the same need for guarding her
                    son’s interests against the pretensions of his uncles, Louis XIII. and the
                    princes of Savoy. But fortune favoured her, and on the duke’s reaching his
                    majority in 1648 the wars of the Fronde occupied all the attention of Mazarin.
                    The brunt of the conflict with Spain consequently fell upon Savoy, and was borne
                    not ingloriously until the conclusion of peace. Charles Emmanuel occupied the
                    remaining part of his reign in repairing the ravages caused by twenty-four years
                    of warfare, and died in 1675, leaving an only son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor
                    Amadeus</hi> II., whose minority was as peaceful as his father’s had been the
                    reverse. He married Mary of Orleans, the daughter of Henrietta of England, and
                    consequently the legitimate heiress to the English crown on the death of Anne
                    and on the exclusion of the Pretender. For a time he united with Louis XIV. in
                    persecuting the Protestants, but the overbearing behaviour of his ally made him
                    join the coalition of Augsburg in 1690. His campaign against Louis was carried
                    on with varying results until 1695, when he accepted proposals of peace. This
                    defection led to the peace of Ryswick in 1697, and in reward he received from
                    Louis the territories then occupied by France. In 1700 he sided with France
                    against Austria, but, an extension of territory in the Milanese not being
                    granted by Louis, he went over to the enemy in 1703. The generalship of his
                    relative Prince Eugene proved too much for the French, and in 1706 they were
                    defeated before Turin and driven across the frontier. The peace of Utrecht
                    afterwards confirmed the duke in the possession of the places granted on his
                    joining the coalition, including the long-coveted Montferrato, and endowed him
                    besides with the crown of Sicily. Austrian influences now replaced Spanish in
                    the peninsula, and Charles VI. persuaded him to exchange his kingdom for that of
                    Sardinia. This was accordingly effected in 1720 by the treaty of Madrid, and
                    afterwards proved the very salvation of the house of Savoy. In 1730 the king
                    abdicated in favour of his son, in order to marry the countess of San Sebastian,
                    at whose instigation he afterwards tried to regain the crown, but he died in
                    1732.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Emmanuel</hi> III. continued his father’s intrigues
                    to obtain possession of Milan, and joined the league of France and Spain against
                    Austria in 1732. But he used the victories of the allied forces over the
                    imperialists in such a half-hearted way that it seemed as if he did not wish to
                    break finally with Austria. In the end he only gained from the treaty, which he
                    signed in 1739, the Novarese and Tortona, instead of Milan. The death of Charles
                    VI. in 1740 gave him the chance of expelling the Austrians from Italy, but,
                    though he at first claimed Milan from Maria Theresa, he ended in 1742 by
                    espousing her cause. The complete defeat of the French in 1747 led to the treaty
                    of Aix-la-Chapelle, by which Charles Emmanuel received the Upper Novarese and
                    Vigevano, after which he remained at peace until bis death in 1773. His son <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Victor Amadeus</hi> III. succeeded him, and devoted the early
                    years of his reign to the improvement of the administration and the
                    reorganization of his army. The time soon came for him to use the weapon he had
                    created, and on the outbreak of the Revolution in France he headed the coalition
                    of Italian princes against her. The house of Savoy thus assumed the headship of
                    Italy, but for the time without much gain, for Napoleon’s brilliant victories of
                    1796 ended in the peace of Paris, by which Savoy, along with Nice, was given to
                    France. Victor Amadeus died shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by his son <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Charles Emmanuel</hi> IV. The fever of the Revolution spread to
                    Piedmont, and in 1798 nothing was left to the king but to retire to Sardinia. In
                    1802 he abdicated in favour of his brother, <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor
                    Emmanuel</hi> I., who, in his island kingdom, protected by the English fleet,
                    became the symbol of the coalition against France. The king returned to Turin in
                    1814, and in the following year took possession again of Savoy. The
                    anti-revolutionary measures which were adopted by the Italian princes on their
                    return caused a spirit of rebellion to spring up among their subjects. The
                    freedom of the individual and the unity of the nation thus came to be considered
                    objects to be attained at one and the same time. The influence of Austria was
                    paramount in the Peninsula, but an insurrection broke out at Turin in 1820
                    demanding war with her, and, rather than embroil himself both with his people
                    and with Austria, Victor Emmanuel abdicated in favour of his brother, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Charles Felix.</hi> The general insurrection was suppressed,
                    and for the next few years Italy suffered everything possible at the hands of
                    various petty princes, whose fears and weakness left them no weapon but
                    persecution. In 1831 Charles Felix died without issue, and in him the elder
                    branch of the family ended. He was succeeded by <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles
                    AlberT,</hi> of the line of Savoy-Carignano, which was founded by Thomas
                    Francis, son of Charles Emmanuel the Great, and grandfather of Prince Eugene.
                    The first care of Charles Albert was to reorganize his military and naval forces
                    in readiness for the conflict with Austria which he foresaw. At the same time he
                    put down the conspiracies which would have forced his hand, among which the most
                    famous was that of Mazzini and Ramorino in 1834. The French revolution of 1848
                    fanned the embers of Italian patriotism, and Charles Albert, without any aid,
                    began the War of Independence. Victory at first followed his arms, but he was
                    defeated at last by the Austrians at Custozza. In the next year he was again
                    driven into war with the Austrians, and, after his defeat at Novara, he
                    abdicated in favour of his son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor Emmanuel</hi> II.
