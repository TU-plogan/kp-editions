                    of sp. gr. 4·26, which dissolves in 1000 times its weight of boiling bisulphide
                    of carbon (at 46°·6 C.). The solution on cooling deposits most of its selenium
                    in the form of minute monoclinic crystals of sp.<pb break="no"

                    which retain their solubility in bisulphide of carbon up to 100° C. At 110° C.
                    or higher temperatures they pass into the metallic modification (see below) with
                    evolution of heat. With the amorphous kind a similar change sets in at or above
                    80° C. and attains its maximum of rapidity at a point between 125° and 180° C.
                    Fused selenium when cooled down suddenly hardens into a very dark-coloured glass
                    of 4·28 sp. gr., soluble in bisulphide of carbon; on gradual cooling it becomes
                    more or less completely “metallic.” (2) <hi rend="italic">Metallic selenium</hi>
                    is a dark grey or black solid of 4·8 sp. gr.; it exhibits metallic lustre,
                    stretches perceptibly under the hammer, and its fracture is similar to that of
                    grey cast iron. It is insoluble in bisulphide of carbon. Its fusing point is
                    sharply defined and lies at 217° C. At the ordinary temperature it conducts
                    electricity, while the non-metallic modification does not; at higher
                    temperatures, or after temporary exposure to higher temperatures, the
                    conductivity on either side becomes an eminently variable quantity. According to
                    Draper and Moss, glassy selenium begins to conduct electricity at 165° to 175°
                    C., and the conductivity increases regularly as the temperature rises to near
                    the boiling-point. With metallic selenium, which behaves similarly, the increase
                    of conductivity is proportional to the increase of temperature to near the
                    fusing point (217° C.); but from this point upwards it decreases rapidly and
                    attains its minimum at 250° C. According to W. Siemens, however, selenium by
                    long exposure to 200° C. becomes what one may call electrically metallic; the
                    conductivity then decreases when the temperature rises, just as it does with
                    ordinary metals. But this electro-metallicity is not permanent; on continued
                    exposure to a lower temperature it vanishes gradually, until the proportion of
                    quasi-metal has fallen to a limit-value depending on that temperature. Very
                    surprising is the observation of Sale that the electric conductivity of metallic
                    selenium increases on exposure to the light; the red and ultra-red rays, as he
                    found, act most powerfully. The effect of insolation is almost instantaneous,
                    but on re-exposure to darkness the original condition is re-established only
                    very gradually. W. Siemens found that his electro-metallic selenium (as produced
                    at 200° C.) is more sensitive to light than any other kind. The conductivity of
                    such selenium starting from darkness is raised twofold by diffuse and tenfold by
                    direct sunlight. The specific heat of selenium, according to Regnault, is 0.0746
                    both in the glassy and in the metallic modification. Selenium (of any kind)
                    boils at 700° C. (Mitscherlich). The vapour has an intense colour intermediate
                    between that of chlorine and that of sulphur. According to Deville and Troost,
                    at 880° C. it is 7·67 times, and at 1420° is 5·68 times, as heavy as air;
                    theory, for Se <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> =l molecule, demands 5·47.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Elementary Tellurium.—</hi> This, the compact form, is a
                    silver-white resplendent metal of markedly crystalline structure; the crystals
                    are rhombohedra, and the ingot consequently is very brittle. Specific gravity
                    6·2. The metal fuses at about 500° C., and is distillable at very high
                    temperatures. Its vapour is golden yellow and has a very brilliant
                    absorption-spectrum. The vapour density, according to Deville and Troost, is 9Ό8
                    at 1439° C. (air=l), corresponding to Te <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 1
                    molecule. A bar of tellurium becomes feebly electrical when rubbed with a
                    woollen cloth. The electric conductivity, like that of selenium, is largely
                    influenced by the temperature and previous exposure to heat, and it increases
                    after exposure to light, though not to the same extent as selenium does.
                    Starting from the ordinary temperature the conductivity decreases up to some
                    point between 90° and 145° C.; it then increases up to 200° C. (the highest
                    temperature tried); on cooling it decreases steadily, and finally is only
                    one-fifth or one-sixth of what it was at 200°. The numerical value at 200°
                    (silver = 100) was found equal to 0·0035 to 0.0031 (F. Exner).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extraction of the Elementary Substances.—</hi> If seleniferous
                    sulphur or pyrites is used for the manufacture of oil of vitriol by the chamber
                    process, most of the selenium accumulates as such in the “chamber mud,” from
                    which it may be extracted by the following method of Wohler’s. The mud, after
                    having been thoroughly washed and dried, is fused with alkaline nitrate and
                    carbonate, to convert the selenium into selenate (SeO <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi> K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> or Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), which
                    is extracted by means of water. The filtered solution is boiled with
                    hydrochloric acid to convert the selenic into selenium acid (SeO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 2HCl = Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + H <hi

                    then reduced by addition of sulphurous acid and heating, when the selenium comes
                    down as a red precipitate (SeO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + Se <hi

                    ore-smoke as produced in Mansfeld, which likewise contains free selenium. Its
                    extraction, according to O. Pettersen and F. Nilson, is best effected by
                    digestion with concentrated solution of cyanide of potassium at 80°C., which
                    converts the selenium into selenocyanide (SeNCK), easily extractable by water.
                    The filtered solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid and allowed to stand,
                    when the selenium (through the spontaneous decomposition of the SeNC. H into NCH
                    and Se) comes down as a precipitate.</p>
                <p>Tellurium is generally prepared from Transylvanian gold ore. The powdered ore is
                    oxidized by means of hot nitric acid and the least sufficiency of hydrochloric
                    acid, the excess of nitric acid being chased away by evaporation, and the
                    residue mixed with sulphuric acid (to convert the lead into insoluble sulphate),
                    and with some tartaric acid to prevent precipitation of tellurious acid (TeO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) in the subsequent treatment with water. From the
                    filtered aqueous solution the gold is removed by addition of ferrous sulphate
                    and by filtration. The filtrate is treated with sulphurous acid to reduce the
                    tellurious acid to tellurium, which separates out as a black precipitate. The
                    precipitated metal is fused down and then sublimed at a very high temperature,
                    in a porcelain tube, in a current of hydrogen, to remove non-volatile impurities
                    and eliminate the last trace of selenium (SeH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemical Relalions.—</hi> Selenium and tellurium are similar in
                    their chemical character to sulphur; the gradation of properties within the

                    = 128 (O = 16). In oxygen or air the elementary substances burn readily into

                <p>By fusion with nitre and alkaline carbonate the three elements, in their

                    chlorine; and the lower acids are readily reduced to (precipitates of)
                    elementary selenium and tellurium respectively by the action of sulphurous acid
                    in the heat. Chlorine combines readily with elementary selenium and tellurium
                    into dichlorides (Se or Te)Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which, however, on
                    continued chlorination are at last completely converted into the tetrachlorides

                    sulphur compound, are distillable without decomposition. Metals capable of
                    uniting directly with sulphur as a rule unite also with selenium and tellurium
                    into corresponding compounds. Hydrogen unites with elementary selenium and
                    tellurium in the heat into gaseous hydrides (Se or Te)H <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> closely similar to sulphuretted hydrogen. But, as these hydrides are
                    liable to dissociation, the pure compounds must be prepared by the decomposition
                    of the zinc compounds Zn∑ with hydrochloric acid. For the description of
                    individual compounds reference must be made to the handbooks of chemistry. (W.
