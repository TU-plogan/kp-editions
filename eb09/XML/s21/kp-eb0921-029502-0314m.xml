                    Monte</hi></label> (1460- 1529), an able Florentine sculptor, who lived during
                    the rapid decline of plastic art which took place from about the beginning of
                    the 16th century; he was the son of a shepherd called Niccolo di Domenico
                    Contucci, and was born in 1640 at Monte Sansavino near Arezzo, whence he took
                    his name, which is usually softened to Sansovino. He was a pupil of Antonio
                    Pollaiuolo, and during the first part of his life worked in the purer style of
                    15th-century Florence. Hence his early works are by far the best, such as the
                    terra-cotta altar-piece in Santa Chiara at Monte Sansavino, and the marble
                    reliefs of the Annunciation, the Coronation of the Virgin, a Pietà, the Last
                    Supper, and various statuettes of saints and angels in the Corbinelli chapel of
                    S. Spirito at Florence, all executed between the years 1488 and 1492. From 1491
                    to 1500 Andrea worked in Portugal for the king, and some pieces of sculpture by
                    him still exist in the monastic church of Coimbra.<note anchored="true"

                    the influence of Donatello. The beginning of a later and more pagan style is
                    shown in the statues of St John baptizing Christ which are over the east door of
                    the Florentine baptistery. This group was, however, finished by the weaker hand
                    of Vincenzo Danti. In 1502 he executed the marble font at Volterra, with good
                    reliefs of the Four Virtues and the Baptism of Christ. In 1505 Sansovino was
                    invited to Rome by Julius II. to make the monuments of Cardinal Ascanio Maria
                    Sforza and Cardinal Girolamo della Rovere for the retro-choir of S. Maria del
                    Popolo. The architectural parts of these monuments and their sculptured foliage
                    are extremely graceful and executed with the most minute delicacy, but the
                    recumbent effigies show the beginning of a serious decline in taste. Though
                    skilfully modelled, they are uneasy in attitude, and have completely lost the
                    calm dignity and simple lines of the earlier effigies, such as those of the
                    school of Mino da Fiesole in the same church. These tombs had a very important
                    influence on the monumental sculpture of the time, and became models which for
                    many years were copied by most later sculptors with increasing exaggerations of
                    their defects. In 1512, while still in Rome, Sansovino executed a very beautiful
                    group which shows strongly the influence of Leonardo da Vinci, both in the pose
                    and in the sweet expression of the faces; it is a group of the Madonna and Child
                    with St Anne, now over one of the side altars in the church of S. Agostino. From
                    1513 to 1528 he was at Loreto, where he cased the outside of the Santa Casa in
                    white marble, covered with reliefs and statuettes in niches between engaged
                    columns; a small part of this gorgeous mass of sculpture was the work of Andrea
                    himself, but the greater part was executed by Montelupo, Tribolo, and others of
                    his numerous school of assistants and pupils. Though the general effect of the
                    whole is very rich and magnificent, the individual pieces of sculpture are both
                    dull and feeble, showing the unhappy results of an attempt to imitate
                    Michelangelo’s grandeur of style. The earlier reliefs, those by Sansovino
                    himself, are the best, still retaining some of the sculpturesque purity of the
                    older Florentines. He died in 1529.</p>
