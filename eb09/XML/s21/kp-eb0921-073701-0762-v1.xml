                <p><label type="entry">SHAKESPEARE</label></p>
                <p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE (1564-1616), the national poet of England, the greatest
                    dramatist that modern Europe has produced, was born in April, in the year 1564,
                    at Stratford-upon-Avon, in the county of Warwick. The known facts of the poet’s
                    personal history are comparatively few, and before giving them in order we
                    purpose considering in some detail the larger educational influences which
                    helped to stimulate his latent powers, to evoke and strengthen his poetical and
                    patriotic sympathies, and thus prepare and qualify him for his future work. In
                    dealing with these influences we are on firm and fruitful ground. We know, for
                    example, that Shakespeare was born and lived for twenty years at
                    Stratford-upon-Avon; and we can say therefore with certainty that all the
                    physical and moral influences of that picturesque and richly-storied Midland
                    district melted as years went by into the full current of his ardent blood,
                    became indeed the vital element, the very breath of life his expanding spirit
                    breathed. We know a good deal about his home, his parents, and his domestic
                    surroundings; and these powerful factors in the development of any mind gifted
                    with insight and sensibility must have acted with redoubled force on a nature so
                    richly and harmoniously endowed as that of the Stratford poet. It would be
                    difficult indeed to overestimate the combined effect of these vital elements on
                    his capacious and retentive mind, a mind in which the receptive and creative
                    powers were so equally poised and of such unrivalled strength. This review of
                    the larger influences operating with concentrated force during the critical
                    years of youth and early manhood will help to connect and interpret the few and
                    scattered particulars of Shakespeare’s personal history. These particulars must
                    indeed be to some extent connected and interpreted in order to be clearly
                    understood, and any intelligible account of Shakespeare’s life must therefore
                    take the shape of a biographical essay, rather than of a biography proper. We
                    may add that the sketch will be confined to the points connected with
                    Shakespeare’s local surroundings and personal history. The large literary
                    questions connected with his works, such as the classification, the chronology,
                    and analysis of the plays, could not of course be adequately dealt with in such
                    a sketch. It is the less necessary that this wider task should be attempted as
                    the main points it embraces have recently been well handled by competent
                    Shakespearian scholars. The best and most convenient manuals embodying the
                    results of recent criticism and research will be referred to at the close of the
                    article. Meanwhile we have first to look at the locality of Shakespeare’s birth,
                    both in its material and moral aspects.</p>
                <p>Warwickshire was known to Shakespeare’s contemporaries as the central county or
                    heart of England. It was the middle shire of the Midlands, where the two great
                    Roman roads crossing the island from east to west and west to east met,—forming
                    at their point of junction the centre of an irregular St Andrew’s cross, of
                    which the arms extended from Dover to Chester on the one side and from Totnes to
                    Lincoln and the north on the other. The centre in which these roads—Watling
                    Street and the Fosse Way —thus met was early known from this circumstance as the
                    High Cross. Being the most important Midland position during the Roman
                    occupation of the country, several Roman stations were formed in the
                    neighbourhood of this venerable Quatre Bras. Of these Camden specifies the
                    ancient and flourishing city of Clychester, represented in part by the modern
                    Clybrook, and Manduessidum, the memory of which is probably retained in the
                    modern Man-cettar. Important Roman remains have also been found within a few
                    miles of Stratford, at Alcester, a central station on the third great Roman
                    road, Ricknild Street, which runs from south to north across the western side of
                    the county. In later times, when means of communication were multiplied, the
                    great roads to the north-west still<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n763/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0763-0738"/> passed through the county, and one of them,
                    the mail road from London through Oxford to Birmingham, Stafford, and Chester,
                    was the “streete” or public way that crossed the Avon at the celebrated ford
                    spanned in 1483 by Sir Hugh Clopton’s magnificent bridge of fourteen arches.
                    Immediately beyond the bridge rose the homely gables and wide thoroughfares of
                    Shakespeare’s native place.</p>
                <p>In Shakespeare’s time Warwickshire was divided by the irregular line of the Avon
                    into two unequal but well-marked divisions, known respectively, from their main
                    characteristics, as the woodland and the open country, or more technically as
                    the districts of Arden and Feldon. The former included the thickly-wooded region
                    north of the Avon, of which the celebrated forest of Arden was the centre, and
                    the latter the champaign country, the rich and fertile pasture-lands between the
                    Avon and the line of hills separating Warwick from the shires of Oxford and
                    Northampton. Shakespeare himself was of course familiar with this division of
                    his native shire, and he has well expressed it in Lear’s description of the
                    section of the kingdom assigned to his eldest daughter Goneril,—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>“Of all these bounds,—even from this line to this,</l>
                    <l>With shadowy forests and with champains rich’d,</l>
                    <l>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,—</l>
                    <l>We make thee lady.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>No better general description of Warwickshire could indeed be given than is
                    contained in these lines. Taking the Roman roads, Watling and Ricknild Streets,
                    as boundaries, they vividly depict the characteristic features of the county,
                    including its plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads. The old and central
                    division of Arden and Feldon is clearly embodied in the second line, “with
                    shadowy forests and with champains rich’d.” This distinction, practically
                    effaced in modern times by agricultural and mining progress, was partially
                    affected by these causes even in Shakespeare’s own day. The wide Arden, or belt
                    of forest territory which had once extended not only across the county but from
                    the Trent to the Severn, was then very much restricted to the centre of the
                    shire, the line of low hills and undulating country which stretched away for
                    upwards of twenty miles to the north of Stratford. The whole of the northern
                    district was, it is true, still densely wooded, but the intervening patches of
                    arable and pasture land gradually encroached more and more upon the bracken and
                    brushwood, and every year larger areas were cleared and prepared for tillage by
                    the axe and the plough. In the second half of the 16th century, however, the
                    Arden district still retained enough of its primitive character to fill the
                    poet’s imagination with the exhilarating breadth and sweetness of woodland
                    haunts, the beauty, variety, and freedom of sylvan life, and thus to impart to
                    the scenery of <hi rend="italic">As You Like It</hi> the vivid freshness and
                    reality of a living experience. In this delightful comedy the details of
                    forest-life are touched with so light but at the same time so sure a hand as to
                    prove the writer’s familiarity with the whole art of venery, his thorough
                    knowledge of that “highest franchise of noble and princely pleasure” which the
                    royal demesnes of wood and park afforded. In referring to the marches or wide
                    margins on the outskirts of the forest, legally known as purlieus, Shakespeare
                    indeed displays a minute technical accuracy which would seem to indicate that in
                    his early rambles about the forest and casual talks with its keepers and woodmen
                    he had picked up the legal incidents of sylvan economy, as well as enjoyed the
                    freedom and charm of forest-life. Throughout the purlieus, for instance, the
                    forest laws were only partially in force, while the more important rights of
                    individual owners were fully recognized and established. Hence it happened that
                    Corin’s master, dwelling, as Rosalind puts it in a quaint but characteristic
                    simile that betrays her sex, “here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon
                    a petticoat,” could sell “his cote, his flock, and bounds of feed,” and that
                    Celia and Rosalind were able to purchase “the cottage, the pasture, and the
                    flock.” It may be noted, too, that, in exchange for the independence the
                    dwellers in the purlieus acquired as private owners, they had to relinquish
                    their common right or customary privilege of pasturing their cattle in the
                    forest. Sheep, indeed, were not usually included in this right of common, their
                    presence in the forest being regarded as inimical to the deer. When kept in the
                    purlieus, therefore, they had to be strictly limited to their bounds of feed,
                    shepherded during the day and carefully folded every night, and these points are
                    faithfully reflected by Shakespeare. Again, only those specially privileged
                    could hunt venison within the forest. But if the deer strayed beyond the forest
                    bounds they could be freely followed by the dwellers in the purlieus, and these
                    happy hunting grounds outside the forest precincts were in many cases spacious
                    and extensive. The special office of a forest ranger was indeed to drive back
                    the deer straying in the purlieus. The banished duke evidently has this in mind
                    when, as a casual denizen of the forest, he proposes to make war on its native
                    citizens :—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>“Come, shall we go and kill us venison?</l>
                    <l>And yet it irks me, the poor dappled fools,</l>
                    <l>Being native burghers of this desert city,</l>
                    <l>Should, in their own confines, with forkèd heads,</l>
                    <l>Have their round haunches gor’d.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>And the melancholy Jacques, refining as usual with cynical sentimentalism on
                    every way of life and every kind of action, thinks it would be a special
                    outrage</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>“To fright the animals, and to kill them up,</l>
                    <l>In their assign’d and native dwelling place.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>Not only in <hi rend="italic">As You Like It,</hi> but in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Love's Labour's Lost,</hi> in A <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Night's
                        Dream,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Merry Wives of Windsor,</hi> and indeed
                    throughout his dramatic works, Shakespeare displays the most intimate knowledge
                    of the aspects and incidents of forest life; and it is certain that in the first
                    instance this knowledge must have been gained from his early familiarity with
                    the Arden district. This, as we have seen, stretched to the north of Stratford
                    in all its amplitude and variety of hill and dale, leafy covert and sunny glade,
                    giant oaks and tangled thickets,—the woodland stillness being broken at
                    intervals not only by the noise of brawling brooks below and of feathered
                    outcries and flutterings overhead, but by dappled herds sweeping across the open
                    lawns or twinkling in the shadowy bracken, as well as by scattered groups of
                    timid conies feeding, at matins and vespers, on the tender shoots and sweet
                    herbage of the forest side. The deer-stealing tradition is sufficient evidence
                    of the popular belief in the poet’s love of daring exploits in the regions of
                    vert and venison, and of his devotion, although in a somewhat irregular way
                    perhaps, to the attractive woodcraft of the park, the warren, and the chase. The
                    traditional scene of this adventure was Charlecote Park, a few miles north-east
                    of Stratford; but the poet’s early wanderings in Arden extended, no doubt, much
                    further afield. Stirred by the natural desire of visiting at leisure the more
                    celebrated places of his native district, he would pass from Stratford to Henley
                    and Hampton, to Wroxall Priory and Kenilworth Castle, to Stoneleigh Abbey and
                    Leamington Priors, to Warwick Keep and Guy’s Cliffe. The remarkable beauty of
                    this last storied spot stirs the learned and tranquil pens of the antiquaries
                    Camden and Dugdale to an unwonted effort of description, even in the
                    pre-descriptive era. “Under this hill,” says Camden, “hard by the river Avon,
                    standeth Guy-cliffe, others call it Gib-cliffe, the dwelling house at this day
                    of Sir Thomas Beau-foe, descended from<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n764/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0764-0739"/> the ancient Normans line, and the very seate
                    itselfe of pleasantnesse. There have yee a shady little wood, cleere and
                    cristall springs, mossy bottomes and caves, medowes alwaies fresh and greene,
                    the river rumbling here and there among the stones with his stream making a
                    milde noise and gentle whispering, and besides all this, solitary and still
                    quietnesse, things most grateful to the Muses.” But the whole of the circuit was
                    richly wooded, the towns, as the names indicate, being forest
                    towns,—Henley-in-Arden, Hampton-in-Arden,—while the castles and secularized
                    religious houses were paled off within their own parks and bounds from the
                    sylvan wilderness around them. Some, like the celebrated castle of the
                    Mountfords, called from its pleasant situation amongst the woods Beaudesert,
                    having been dismantled during the Wars of the Roses were already abandoned, and
                    had in Shakespeare’s day relapsed from the stately revelry that once filled
                    their halls into the silence of the surrounding woods. At every point of the
                    journey, indeed, as the poet’s eager and meditative eye embraced new vistas, it
                    might be said,</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>“Towers and battlements it sees</l>
                    <l>Bosomed high in tufted trees.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>On the southern margin of the Arden division, towards the Avon, small farms were
                    indeed already numerous, and cultivation had become tolerably general. But the
                    region as a whole still retained its distinctive character as the Arden or
                    wooded division of the county. Even now, indeed, it includes probably more woods
                    and parks than are to be found over the same area in any other English
                    shire.</p>
                <p>While parts of the Arden district were in this way under cultivation, it must not
                    be supposed that the champaign or open country to the south of the Avon, the
                    Feldon division of the county, was destitute of wood; on the contrary its
                    extensive pastures were not only well watered by local streams overshadowed by
                    willow and alder, but well wooded at intervals by groups of more stately trees.
                    The numerous flocks and herds that grazed throughout the valley of the Red Horse
                    found welcome shelter from the noonday heat and the driving wind under the green
                    roofs and leafy screens that lined and dotted their bounds of feed. And,
                    although even the grazing farms were comparatively small, almost every homestead
                    had its group of protecting elms, its outlying patch of hanging beech and ash,
                    or straggling copse of oak and hazel. This is still reflected in such local
                    names as Wood Park, Shrub Lands, Ockley Wood, Furze Hill, Oakham, Ashborne,
                    Alcott Wood, Berecote Wood, and Radland Gorse. These features gave interest and
                    variety to the Feldon district, and justified the characteristic epithet which
                    for centuries was popularly applied to the county as a whole, that of “woody
                    Warwickshire.” And Shakespeare, in passing out of the county on his London
                    journeys, would quickly feel the difference, as beyond its borders he came upon
                    stretches of less clothed and cultivated scenery. As his stout gelding mounted
                    Edgehill, and he turned in the saddle to take a parting look at the familiar
                    landscape he was leaving, he would behold what Speed, in his enthusiasm, calls
                    “another Eden, as Lot the plain of Jordan.” While the general aspect would be
                    that of green pastures and grassy levels, there would be at the same time the
                    picturesque intermingling of wood and water, of mill and grange and manor house,
                    which gives light and shade, colour and movement, interest and animation, to the
                    plainer sweeps and more monotonous objects of pastoral scenery.</p>
                <p>On the historical side Warwickshire has points of interest as striking and
                    distinctive as its physical features. During the Roman occupation of the country
                    it was, as we have seen, the site of several central Roman stations, of which,
                    besides those already noticed, the fortified camps of</p>
                <p>Tripontium and Praesidium on the line of the Avon were the most important. A
                    Roman road crossed the Avon at Stratford, and radiating north and south soon
                    reached some of the larger Roman towns of the west, such as Uriconium and
                    Corinium. Between these towns were country villas or mansions, many of them
                    being, like that at Woodchester, “magnificent palaces covering as much ground as
                    a whole town.” The entire district must in this way have been powerfully
                    affected by the higher forms of social life and material splendour which the
                    wealthier provincials had introduced. The immediate effect of this Roman
                    influence on the native populations was, as we know, to divide them into opposed
                    groups whose conflicts helped directly to produce the disastrous results which
                    followed the withdrawal of the Romans from the island. But the more permanent
                    and more important effect is probably to be traced in the far less obstinate
                    resistance offered by the Celtic tribes of Mid Britain to the invading Angles
                    from the north and Saxons from the south, by whom themselves and their district
                    were eventually absorbed. Instead of the fierce conflicts and wrathful
                    withdrawal or extermination of the conquered Britons which prevailed further
                    east, and for a time perhaps further west also, the intervening tribes appear to
                    have accepted the overlordship of their Teutonic neighbours and united with them
                    in the cultivation and defence of their common territory. The fact that no
                    record of any early Angle conquest remains seems to indicate that, after at most
                    a brief resistance, there was a gradual coalescence of the invading with the
                    native tribes rather than any fierce or memorable struggle between them. Even
                    the more independent and warlike tribes about the Severn repeatedly joined the
                    Saxon Hwiccas, whose northern frontier was the forest of Arden, in resisting the
                    advance of Wessex from the south. And for more than a hundred years after the
                    establishment of the central kingdom of the Angles, the neighbouring Welsh
                    princes are found acting in friendly alliance with the Mercian rulers. It was
                    thus the very district where from an early period the two race elements that
                    have gone to the making of the nation were most nearly balanced and most
                    completely blended. The union of a strong Celtic element with the dominant
                    Angles is still reflected in the local nomenclature, not only in the names of
                    the chief natural features, such as rivers and heights, —Arden and Avon, Lickey,
                    Alne, and Thame,—but in the numerous <hi rend="italic">combes</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">cotes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cots,</hi> as in the
                    reduplicative Cotswold, in the <hi rend="italic">duns, dons,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">dens,</hi> and in such distinctively Celtic elements as <hi
                        rend="italic">man, pol, try,</hi> in names of places scattered through the
                    district. The <hi rend="italic">cotes</hi> are, it is true, ambiguous, being in
                    a majority of cases perhaps Saxon rather than Celtic, but in a forest country
                    near the old Welsh marches many must still represent the Celtic <hi
                        rend="italic">coet</hi> or <hi rend="italic">coed,</hi> and in some cases
                    this is clear from the word itself, as in Kingscot, a variation of Kingswood,
                    and even Charlecote exists in the alternative form of Charlewood. This union of
                    the two races, combined with the stirring conditions of life in a wild and
                    picturesque border country, gave a vigorous impulse and distinctive character to
                    the population, the influence of which may be clearly traced in the subsequent
                    literary as well as in the political history of the country. As early as the 9th
                    century, when the ravages of the Danes had desolated the homes and scattered the
                    representatives of learning in Wessex, it was to western Mercia that King Alfred
                    sent for scholars and churchmen to unite with him in helping to restore the
                    fallen fortunes of religion and letters. And after the long blank in the native
                    literature produced by the Norman Conquest the authentic signs of its
                    indestructible vitality first appeared on the banks of the Severn. Layamon’s
                    spirited poem dealing with the legendary history of Britain, and written<pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n765/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0765-0740"/> at Redstone near Arley, within sight of the
                    river’s majestic sweep amidst its bordering woods and hills, is by far the most
                    important literary monument of semi-Saxon. And, while the poem as a whole
                    displays a Saxon tenacity of purpose in working out a comprehensive scheme of
                    memorial verse, its more original parts have touches of passion and
                    picturesqueness, as well as of dramatic vivacity, that recall the patriotic fire
                    of the Celtic bards. A hundred and fifty years later the first great period of
                    English literature was inaugurated by another poem of marked originality and
                    power, written under the shadow of the Malvern Hills. The writer of the striking
                    series of allegories known as <hi rend="italic">Piers Plowman's Visions</hi> was
                    a Shropshire man, and, notwithstanding his occasional visits to London and
                    official employments there, appears to have spent his best and most productive
                    years on the western border between the Severn and the Malvern Hills. In many
                    points both of substance and form the poem may, it is true, be described as
                    almost typically Saxon. But it has at the same time a power of vivid
                    portraiture, a sense of colour, with an intense and penetrating if not
                    exaggerated feeling for local grievances which are probably due to the strain of
                    Celtic blood in the writer’s veins. Two centuries later, from the same district,
                    from a small town on an affluent of the Severn, a few miles to the west of the
                    river, came the national poet, who not only inherited the patriotic fire and
                    keen sensibility of Layamon and Langland, but who combined in the most perfect
                    form and carried to the highest point of development the best qualities of the
                    two great races represented in the blood and history of the English nation. Mr
                    J. R. Green, in referring to the moral effects arising from the mixture of races
                    in the Midland district, has noted this fact in one of those sagacious
                    side-glances that make his history so instructive. “It is not without
                    significance,” he says, “that the highest type of the race, the one Englishman
                    who has combined in their largest measure the mobility and fancy of the Celt
                    with the depth and energy of the Teutonic temper, was born on the old Welsh and
                    English borderland, in the forest of Arden.” And from the purely critical side
                    Mr Matthew Arnold has clearly brought out the same point. He traces some of the
                    finest qualities of Shakespeare’s poetry to the Celtic spirit which touched his
                    imagination as with an enchanter’s wand, and thus helped to brighten and enrich
                    the profounder elements of his creative genius.</p>
                <p>The history of Warwickshire in Anglo-Saxon times is identified with the kingdom
                    of Mercia, which, under a scries of able rulers, was for a time the dominant
                    power of the country. In later times, from its central position, the county was
                    liable to be crossed by military forces if rebellion made head in the north or
                    west, as well as to be traversed and occupied by the rival armies during the
                    periods of civil war. The most important events, indeed, connected with the
                    shire before Shakespeare’s time occurred during the two greatest civil conflicts
                    in the earlier national annals— the Barons’ War in the 13th century, and the
                    Wars of the Roses in the 15th. The decisive battles that closed these long and
                    bitter struggles, and thus became turning points in our constitutional history,
                    were both fought on the borders of Warwickshire,—the battle of Evesham on the
                    south-western and the battle of Bosworth Field on the north-eastern boundary.
                    The great leaders in each conflict—the founder of the Commons House of
                    Parliament and the “setter up and puller down of kings”—were directly connected
                    with Warwickshire. Kenilworth belonged to Simon de Montfort, and its siege and
                    surrender constituted the last act in the Barons’ War. During the Wars of the
                    Roses the county was naturally prominent in public affairs, as its local earl,
                    the last and greatest of the lawless, prodigal, and ambitious barons of
                    mediaeval times, was for more than twenty years the leading figure in the
                    struggle. But notwithstanding this powerful influence the county was, like the
                    country itself, very much divided in its political sympathies and activities.
                    The weakness and vacillation of Henry VI. had stimulated the rival house of York
                    to assert its claims, and, as the trading and mercantile classes were always in
                    favour of a strong government, London, with the eastern counties and the chief
                    ports and commercial towns, favoured the house of York. On the other hand, South
                    Wales, some of the Midland and most of the western shires, under the leadership
                    of the Beauforts, and the northern counties, under the leadership of Clifford
                    and Northumberland, supported the house of Lancaster. Political feeling in the
                    Principality itself was a good deal divided. The duke of York still possessed
                    Ludlow Castle, and, the Welsh of the northern border being devoted to the houses
                    of March and Mortimer, Prince Edward, the young earl of March, after the defeat
                    and death of his father at Wakefield, was able to rally on the border a “mighty
                    power of marchmen,” and, after uniting his forces with those of Warwick, to
                    secure the decisive victory of Towton which placed him securely on the throne.
                    Still, during the earlier stages of the struggle the Beauforts, with the carls
                    of Pembroke, Devon, and Wiltshire, were able to muster in the south and west
                    forces sufficient to keep the Yorkists in check. And when the final struggle
                    came, —when Henry of Richmond landed at Milford Haven,—the Welsh blood in his
                    veins rallied to his standard so powerful a contingent of the southern marchmen
                    that he was able at once to cross the Severn, and, traversing north
                    Warwickshire, to confront the forces of Richard, with the assurance that in the
                    hour of need he would be supported by Stanley and Northumberland. Warwickshire
                    itself was, as already intimated, considerably divided even in the more active
                    stages of the conflict, Coventry being strongly in favour of the Red Rose, while
                    Warwick, under the influence of the earl, was for a while devoted to the cause
                    of the White Rose. Kenilworth was still held by the house of Lancaster, and
                    Henry VI. at the outset of the conquest had more than once taken refuge there.
                    On the other hand Edward IV and Richard III. both visited Warwick, the latter
                    being so interested in the castle that he is said to have laid the foundation of
                    a new and “mighty fayre” tower on the north side, afterwards known as the Bear’s
                    Tower. Edward IV., in harmony with his strong instinct for popularity, and
                    command of the arts that secure it, tried to conciliate the people of Coventry
                    by visiting the town and witnessing its celebrated pageants more than once—at
                    Christmas in 1465 and at the festival of St George in 1474. Although he was
                    accompanied by his queen the efforts to win the town from its attachment to the
                    rival house do not appear to have been very successful. Under Edward’s rule the
                    manifestation of active partisanship was naturally in abeyance, and no doubt the
                    feeling may to some extent have declined. Indeed, in the later stages of the
                    struggle Warwickshire, like so many other counties, was comparatively weary and
                    quiescent. When Richard III. advanced to the north the sheriff of the shire had,
                    it is true, in obedience to the royal mandate levied a force on behalf of the
                    king, but as this force never actually joined the royal standard it is naturally
                    assumed that it was either intercepted by Henry on his march to Bosworth Field
                    or had voluntarily joined him on the eve of the battle. In view of the strong
                    Lancasterian sympathies in the north and east of the shire the latter is by far
                    the more probable supposition. In this case, or indeed on either alternative, it
                    may be true, as asserted in the patent of arms subsequently granted to
                    Shakespeare’s father, that his ancestors had fought on behalf of Henry VII. in
                    the great battle that placed the crown on his head. Many families bearing the
                    name of Shakespeare were scattered through Warwickshire in the 15th century, and
                    it is therefore not at all unlikely that some of their members had wielded a
                    spear with effect in the battle that, to the immense relief of the country,
                    happily closed the most miserable civil conflict in its annals.</p>
                <p>But, whether any of his ancestors fought at Bosworth Field or not, Shakespeare
                    would be sure in his youth to hear, almost at first hand, a multitude of
                    exciting stories and stirring incidents connected with so memorable and
                    far-reaching a victory. After the battle Henry VII. had slept at Coventry, and
                    was entertained by the citizens and presented with handsome gifts. He seems
                    there also to have first exercised his royal power by conferring knighthood on
                    the mayor of the town. The battle was fought only eighty years before
                    Shakespeare’s birth, and public events of importance are vividly transmitted by
                    local tradition for more than double that length of time. At this hour the quiet
                    farmsteads of Mid Somerset abound with stories and traditions of Monmouth and
                    his soldiers, and of the events that preceded and followed the battle of
                    Sedgemoor. And a century earlier local traditions possessed still more vitality
                    and power. In the 16th century, indeed, the great events of the nation’s life,
                    as well as more important local incidents, were popularly preserved and
                    transmitted by means of oral tradition and scenic display. Only a small and
                    cultured class could acquire their knowledge of them through literary chronicles
                    and learned records. The popular mind was of necessity largely fed and
                    stimulated by the spoken narratives of the rustic festival and the winter
                    fireside. And a quiet settled neighbourhood like Stratford, out of the crush,
                    but near the great centres of national activity, would be peculiarly rich in
                    these stored-up materials of unwritten history. The very fact that within eight
                    miles of Shakespeare’s birthplace arose from their cedared slopes the halls and
                    towers of the great earl who for more than a quarter of a century wielded a
                    political and<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n766/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0766-0741"/> military power mightier than any subject had
                    wielded before would give the district an exceptional prominence in the national
                    annals, which would be locally reflected in an answering wealth of historic
                    tradition. In Shakespeare’s day Warwickshire thus supplied the materials of a
                    liberal elementary training in the heroic annals of the past, and especially in
                    the great events of the recent past that had established the Tudors on the
                    throne, consolidated the permanent interests of the Government and the country,
                    and helped directly to promote the growing unity and strength, prosperity and
                    renown, of the kingdom. The special value of Shakespeare’s dramatic
                    interpretation of this period, arising from his early familiarity with the rich
                    and pregnant materials of unwritten history, has recently been insisted on
                    afresh by one of our most careful and learned authorities. In the preface to his
                    work on <hi rend="italic">The Houses of Lancaster and York,</hi> Mr James
                    Gairdner says:—“For this period of English history we are fortunate in
                    possessing an unrivalled interpreter in our great dramatic poet Shakespeare. A
                    regular sequence of historical plays exhibits to us, not only the general
                    character of each successive reign, but nearly the whole chain of leading events
                    from the days of Richard II. to the death of Richard III. at Bosworth. Following
                    the guidance of such a master mind, we realize for ourselves the men and actions
                    of the period in a way we cannot do in any other epoch. And this is the more
                    important as the age itself, especially towards the close, is one of the most
                    obscure in English history. During the period of the Wars of the Roses we have,
                    comparatively speaking, very few contemporary narratives of what took place, and
                    anything like a general history of the times was not written till a much later
                    date. But the doings of that stormy age,—the sad calamities endured by kings—the
                    sudden changes of fortune in great men—the glitter of chivalry and the horrors
                    of civil war,— all left a deep impression upon the mind of the nation, which <hi
                        rend="italic">was kept alive by vivid traditions of the past at the time
                        that our great dramatist wrote.</hi> Hence, notwithstanding the scantiness
                    of records and the meagreness of ancient chronicles, we have singularly little
                    difficulty in understanding the spirit and character of the times.” Familiar as
                    he must have been in his youth with the materials that enabled him to interpret
                    so stirring a period, it is not surprising that even amidst the quiet hedgerows
                    and meadows of Stratford Shakespeare’s pulse should have beat high with
                    patriotic enthusiasm, or that when launched on his new career in the metropolis
                    he should have sympathized to the full extent on his larger powers with the glow
                    of loyal feeling that, under Elizabeth’s rule, and especially in the conflict
                    with Spain, thrilled the nation’s heart with an exulting sense of full political
                    life, realized national power, and gathering European fame.</p>
                <p>In the interval that elapsed between the battle of Bosworth Field and the birth
                    of Shakespeare Warwickshire continued to be visited by the reigning monarch and
                    members of the royal family. The year after his accession to the crown Henry
                    VIII., with Queen Catherine, visited Coventry in state, and witnessed there a
                    series of magnificent pageants. In 1525 the Princess Mary spent two days at the
                    priory, being entertained with the usual sports and shows, and presented by the
                    citizens on her departure with handsome presents. The year after Shakespeare’s
                    birth Queen Elizabeth made a state visit to Coventry, Kenilworth, and Warwick,
                    the young queen being received at every point of her progress with unusually
                    splendid demonstrations of loyalty and devotion. And nine years before
                    Shakespeare’s birth King Edward VI., in the last months of his reign, had
                    specially interested himself in the reestablishment by royal charter of the free
                    grammar school of the guild at Stratford, which had been suppressed at the
                    dissolution of religious houses during his father’s reign.</p>
                <p>The town of Stratford lies on the north bank of the Avon, at a point about midway
                    in its course from its rise in Northamptonshire hills to its junction with the
                    Severn at Tewkesbury. On entering the town, across Sir Hugh Clopton’s noble
                    bridge, the road from the south-east fans out in three main directions,—on the
                    right to Warwick and Coventry, on the left to Alcester, while between runs the
                    central street, the modern representative of the old Roman way to Birmingham,
                    Chester, and the north. Further to the left a fourth and less important road
                    leaves the town beyond the church, and, keeping in the main the line of the
                    river, goes to Bidford, Salford Priors, and Evesham. ft is a picturesque country
                    road connecting a string of undulating villages and hamlets with Stratford. The
                    town itself consisted in the 16th century of the low gable-roofed
                    wood-and-plaster houses dotted at intervals along these roads and down the cross
                    streets that connected them with each other and with the river. Most of the
                    houses in Shakespeare’s time had gardens at the back, and many at the sides
                    also; and the space between the houses, combined with the unusual width of the
                    streets, gave the town an open cheerful look which enabled it to retain pleasant
                    touches of its earlier rural state. As its prosperity increased the scattered
                    dwellings naturally tended to close up their ranks, and present a more united
                    front of exposed wares and convenient hostelries to the yeomen and graziers, who
                    with their wives and families frequented the place on fair and market days. But
                    in Shakespeare’s time the irregular line of gables and porches, of penthouse
                    walls and garden palings, with patches of flowers and overarching foliage
                    between, still varied the view and refreshed the eye in looking down the leading
                    thoroughfares. These thoroughfares took the shape of a central cross, of which
                    Church, Chapel, and High Streets, running in a continuous line north and south,
                    constituted the shaft or stem, while Bridge and Wood Streets, running in another
                    line east and west, were the transverse beam or bar. At the point of
                    intersection stood the High Cross, a solid stone building with steps below and
                    open arches above, from which public proclamations were made, and, as in London
                    and other large towns, sermons sometimes delivered. The open space around the
                    High Cross was the centre of trade and merchandise on market days, and from the
                    force of custom it naturally became the site on which at a later period the
                    market-house was built. Opposite the High Cross the main road, carried over Sir
                    Hugh Clopton’s arches and along Bridge Street, turns to the left through Henley
                    Street on its way to Henley-in-Arden and the more distant northerly towns. At
                    the western end of Wood Street was a large and open space called. Rother Market,
                    whence Rother Street running parallel with High Street led through narrower
                    lanes into the Evesham Road.</p>
                <p>This open ground was, as the name indicates, the great cattle market of
                    Stratford, one of the most important features of its industrial history from
                    very early times. In the later Middle Ages most of the wealthier inhabitants
                    were engaged in farming operations, and the growth and prosperity of the place
                    resulted from its position as a market town in the midst of an agricultural and
                    grazing district. In the 13th century a number of charters were obtained from
                    the early Plantagenet kings, empowering the town to hold a weekly market and no
                    fewer than five annual fairs, four of which were mainly for cattle. In later
                    times a series of great cattle markets, one for each month in the year, was
                    added to the list. The name of the Stratford cattle market embodies this feature
                    of its history, “rother” being a good Saxon word for horned cattle, a word
                    freely employed in Early English, both alone and in composition. In the 16th
                    century it was still in familiar use, not only in literature but in official
                    documents and especially in statutes of the realm. Thus Cowell, in his law
                    dictionary, under the heading “Rother-beasts,” explains that “the name
                    comprehends oxen, cows, steers, heifers, and such like horned beasts,” and
                    refers to statutes of Elizabeth and James in support of the usage. And Arthur
                    Golding in 1567 translates Ovid’s lines—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>“Mille greges illi totidemque <hi rend="italic">armenta</hi> per herbas</l>
                    <l part="I">Errabant—”</l>
                    <l part="F">“A thousand flocks of sheep,</l>
                    <l>A thousand herds of <hi rend="italic">rother-beasts,</hi> he in his fields
                        did keep.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>The word seems to have been longer retained and more freely used in the Midland
                    counties than elsewhere, and Shakespeare himself employs it with colloquial
                    precision in the restored line of <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens·.</hi> “It
                    is the pasture lards the rother’s sides.” Many a time, no doubt, as a boy,
                    during the spring and summer fairs, he had risen with the sun, and, making his
                    way from Henley Street to the bridge, watched the first arrivals of the
                    “large-eyed kine” slowly driven in from the rich pastures of the “Red Horse
                    Valley.” There would be some variety and excitement in the spectacle as the
                    droves of meditative oxen were invaded from time to time by groups of
                    Herefordshire cows lowing anxiously after their skittish calves, as well as by
                    the presence and disconcerting activity of still smaller deer. And the boy would
                    be sure to follow the crowding cattle to the Rother Market and observe at
                    leisure the humours of the ploughmen and drovers from the Feldon district, whose
                    heavy intermittent talk would be in perfect keeping with the bovine stolidity of
                    the steers and heifers around them. There was a market-cross at the head of the
                    Rother expanse, and this was the chief gathering place for the cattle-dealers,
                    as the High Cross was the rallying point of the dealers in corn and country
                    produce. In<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0767-0742"/> modern Stratford Rother Market retains its
                    place as the busiest centre at the annual fairs, during one of which it is still
                    customary to roast an ox in the open street, often amidst a good deal of popular
                    excitement and convivial uproar.</p>
                <p>The cross ways going from Rother Street to the river side, which cut the central
                    liue, dividing it into three sections, are Ely Street and Sheep Street in a
                    continuous line, and Scholar’s Lane and Chapel Lane in another line. They ran
                    parallel with the head line of Bridge and Wood Streets, and like them traverse
                    from east to west the northern shaft of the cross that constituted the ground
                    plan of the town. Starting down this line from the market house at the top, the
                    first division, the High Street, is now, as it was in Shakespeare’s day, the
                    busiest part for shops and shopping, the solid building at the further corner to
                    the left being the Corn Exchange. At the first corner of the second division,
                    called Chapel Street, stands the town-hall, while at the further corner are the
                    site and railed in gardens of New Place, the large mansion purchased by
                    Shakespeare in 1597. Opposite New Place, at the corner of the third and last
                    division, known as Church Street, is the grey mass of Gothic buildings belonging
                    to the guild of the Holy Cross, and consisting of the chapel, the hall, the
                    grammar school, and the almshouses of the ancient guild. Turning to the left at
                    the bottom of Church Street, you enter upon what was in Shakespeare’s day a
                    well-wooded suburb, with a few good houses scattered among the ancient elms, and
                    surrounded by ornamental gardens and extensive private grounds. In one of these
                    houses, with a sunny expanse of lawn and shrubbery, lived in the early years of
                    the 17th century Shakespeare’s eldest daughter Susanna with her husband, Dr John
                    Hall, and here in spring mornings and summer afternoons the great poet must have
                    often strolled, either alone or accompanied by his favourite daughter, realizing
                    to the full the quiet enjoyment of the sylvan scene and its social surroundings.
                    This pleasant suburb, called then as now Old Town, leads directly to the church
                    of the Holy Trinity, near the river side. The church, a fine specimen of
                    Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic with a lofty spire, is approached on the
                    northern side through an avenue of limes, and sheltered on the east and south by
                    an irregular but massive group of elms towering above the churchway path between
                    the transepts, the chancel, and the river. Below the church, on the margin of
                    the river, were the mill, the mill-bridge, and the weir, half hidden by grey
                    willows, green alders, and tall beds of rustling sedge. And, beyond the church,
                    the college, and the line of streets already described, the suburbs stretched
                    away into gardens, orchards, meadows, and cultivated fields, divided by rustic
                    lanes with mossy banks, flowering hedgerows, and luminous vistas of bewildering
                    beauty. These cross and country roads were dotted at intervals with cottage
                    homesteads, isolated farms, and the small groups of both which constituted the
                    villages and hamlets included within the wide sweep of old Stratford parish.
                    Amongst these were the villages and hamlets of Welcombe, Ingon, Drayton,
                    Shottery, Luddington, Little Wilmcote, and Bishopston. The town was thus girdled
                    in the spring by daisied meadows and blossoming orchards, and enriched during
                    the later months by the orange and gold of harvest fields and autumn foliage,
                    mingled with the coral and purple clusters of elder, hawthorn, and mountain ash,
                    and, around the farms and cottages, with the glow of ripening fruit for the
                    winter’s store.</p>
                <p>But perhaps the most characteristic feature of the scenery in the neighbourhood
                    of Stratford is to be found in the union of this rich and varied cultivation
                    with picturesque survivals of the primeval forest territory. The low hills that
                    rise at intervals above the well-turned soil still carry on their serrated
                    crests the lingering glories of the ancient woodland. Though the once mighty
                    forest of Arden has disappeared, the after-glow of its sylvan beauty rests on
                    the neighbouring heights formerly enclosed within its ample margin. These traces
                    of the forest wildness and freedom were of course far more striking and abundant
                    in Shakespeare’s day than now. At that time many of the farms had only recently
                    been reclaimed from the forest, and most of them still had their bosky acres “of
                    tooth’d briars, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,” their broom groves,
                    hazel copses, and outlying patches of unshrubbed down. And the hills that rose
                    above the chief villages of the neighbourhood were still clothed and crowned
                    with the green and mystic mantle of the leafy Arden. But, though much of the
                    ancient woodland has disappeared since Shakespeare’s day, many traces of it
                    still remain. Any of the roads out of Stratford will soon bring the pedestrian
                    to some of these picturesque survivals of the old forest wilderness. On the
                    Warwick road, at the distance of about a mile from the town, there are on the
                    left the Welcombe Woods, and just beyond the woods the well-known Dingles, a
                    belt of straggling ash and hawthorn winding irregularly through blue-bell depths
                    and briery hollows from the pathway below to the crest of the hill above, while
                    immediately around rise the Welcombe Hills, from the top of which is obtained
                    the finest local view of Stratford and the adjacent country. Looking south-west
                    and facing the central line of the town, you see below you, above the mass of
                    roofs, the square tower of the guild chapel, the graceful spire of the more
                    distant church, the sweep of the winding river, and beyond the river the
                    undulating valley of the Red Horse shut in by the blue range of the Cotswold
                    Hills. A couple of miles to the east of the Welcombe Hills is the village of
                    Snitterfield, where Shakespeare’s grandfather, Richard Shakespeare, lived and
                    cultivated to the end of his days the acres around his rustic dwelling. Beyond
                    the village on its western side there is an upland reach of wilderness in the
                    shape of a hill, covered with shrub and copsewood, and known as the Snitterfield
                    Bushes. Here Shakespeare as a boy must have often rambled, enjoying the freedom
                    of the unfenced downs, and enlarging his knowledge of nature’s exuberant
                    vitality. On the opposite side of the town, about a mile on the Evesham road, or
                    rather between the Evesham and Alcester roads, lies the hamlet of Shottery, half
                    concealed by ancestral elms and nestling amongst its homestead fruits and
                    flowers. From one of these homesteads Shakespeare obtained his bride Anne
                    Hathaway. A mile or two on the central road, passing out of the town through
                    Henley Street, is the village of Bearley, and above the village another sweep of
                    wooded upland known as Bearley Bushes. And at various more distant points
                    between these roads the marl and sandstone heights, fringed with woods or
                    covered with wilding growths, still bear eloquent testimony to the time when Guy
                    of Warwick and his tutor in chivalry, Heraud of Arden, still roamed the forest
                    in search of the wild ox and savage boar that frayed the infrequent travellers
                    and devastated at intervals the slender cultivation of the district. The subtle
                    power of this order of scenery, arising from the union of all that is rich and
                    careful in cultivation with all that is wild and free in natural beauty, is
                    exactly of the kind best fitted to attract and delight imaginative and emotional
                    minds. It possesses the peculiar charm that in character arises from the union
                    of refined culture with the bright and exhilarating spontaneity of a free and
                    generous nature.</p>
                <p>On its moral side such scenery has an expanding illuminating power which links it
                    to the wider and deeper interests of humanity as a whole. Nature seems to put
                    forth her vital energies expressly for the relief of man’s estate, appearing as
                    his friend and helper and consoler. Instead of being absorbed in her own
                    inaccessible grandeurs and solitary sublimities, she exerts her benign
                    influences expressly as it were for his good, to cheer and brighten his
                    evanescent days, and beautify his temporary home. Bolder and more rugged
                    landscapes, gloomy glens, and thunder-scarred peaks may excite more passionate
                    feelings, may rouse and strengthen by reaction the individualistic elements of
                    mind and character, and thus produce the hardy, daring type of mountaineer, the
                    intense self-centred and defiant local patriot or hero, the chieftain and his
                    clansmen, <hi rend="italic">contra mundum.</hi> No doubt it is also true that
                    the vaster and loftier mountain ranges have a unique power of exciting in
                    susceptible minds the emotions of awe, wonder, and sublimity. But the very power
                    and permanence of these mighty solitudes, the grandeur and immobility of their
                    measureless strength and imperial repose, dwarf by comparison all merely human
                    interests; and to the meditative mind swept by the spirit of such immensities
                    the moments of our mortal life seem to melt as dew-drops into the silence of
                    their eternal years. The feelings thus excited, being in themselves of the
                    essence of poetry, may indeed find expression in verse and in verse of a noble
                    kind, but the poetry will be lyrical and reflective, not dramatic, or if
                    dramatic in form it will be lyrical in substance. As Mr Ruskin has pointed out,
                    the overmastering effect of mountain scenery tends to absorb and preoccupy
                        the<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n768/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0768-0743"/> mind, and thus to disturb the impartial view,
                    the universal vision of nature and human nature as a complex whole, or rather of
                    nature as the theatre and scene of human life, which the dramatist must preserve
                    in order to secure success in his higher work. Mountain scenery is, however, not
                    only rare and exacting in the range and intensity of feeling it excites, but
                    locally remote in its separation from the interests and occupations of men. It
                    is thus removed from the vital element in which the dramatist works, if not in
                    its higher influence antagonistic to that element. Mr Hamerton, who discusses
                    the question on a wider basis of knowledge and experience than perhaps any
                    living authority except Mr Ruskin, supports this view. “As a general rule,” he
                    says, “I should say there is an antagonism between the love of mountains and the
                    knowledge of mankind, that the lover of mountains will often be satisfied with
                    their appearances of power and passion, their splendour and gloom, their seeming
                    cheerfulness or melancholy, when a mind indifferent to this class of scenery
                    might study the analogous phases of human character.” Where, indeed, the
                    influence of nature is overpowering, as in the East, wonder, —the wonder excited
                    by mere physical vastness, power, and infinitude,—takes the place of intelligent
                    interest in individual life and character.</p>
                <p>But the dramatic poet has to deal primarily with human power and passion; and not
                    for him therefore is the life of lonely raptures and awful delights realized by
                    the mountain wanderer or the Alp-inspired bard. His work lies nearer the homes
                    and ways of men, and his choicest scenery will be found in the forms of natural
                    beauty most directly associated with their habitual activities, most completely
                    blended with their more vivid emotional experiences. A wooded undulating
                    country, watered by memorable streams, its ruder features relieved by the graces
                    of cultivation, and its whole circuit rich in historical remains and
                    associations, is outside the domain of cities, the natural stage and theatre of
                    the dramatist and story-teller. This was the kind of scenery that fascinated
                    Scott’s imagination, amidst which he fixed his chosen home, and where he sleeps
                    his last sleep. It is a border country of grey waving hills, divided by streams
                    renowned in song, and enriched by the monuments of the piety, splendour, and
                    martial power of the leaders whose fierce raids and patriotic conflicts filled
                    with romantic tale and minstrelsy the whole district from the Lammermoors to the
                    Cheviots, and from the Leader and the Tweed to the Solway Firth. In earlier
                    times Shakespeare’s own district had been virtually a border country also. The
                    mediaeval tide of intermittent but savage warfare, between the unsubdued Welsh
                    and the Anglo-Normans under the feudal lords of the marches, ebbed and flowed
                    across the Severn, inundating at times the whole of Powis-land, and sweeping on
                    to the very verge of Warwickshire. In the 12th and 13th centuries the policy of
                    intermarriage between their own families and the Welsh princes was tried by the
                    English monarchs, and King John, on betrothing his daughter Joan to the Welsh
                    prince Llewelyn, gave the manor of Bidford, six miles from Stratford-on-Avon, as
                    part of her dower. The fact of this English princess being thus identified with
                    South Warwickshire may help to explain the prevalence of the name Joan in the
                    county, but the early impulse towards the giving of this royal name would no
                    doubt be strengthened by the knowledge that John of Gaunt’s daughter, the mother
                    of the great earl of Warwick, had also borne the favourite local name.
                    Shakespeare himself it will be remembered had two sisters of this name, the
                    elder Joan, born some time before him, the firstborn of the family indeed, who
                    died in infancy, and the younger Joan, who survived him. But the local
                    popularity of a name, familiarly associated with the kitchen and the scullery
                    rather than with the court or the palace, is no doubt due to one of the more
                    striking incidents of the long conflict between the English and the Welsh on the
                    western border. As we have seen, during the Barons’ War and the Wars of the
                    Roses the western border was the scene of active conflict, each party seeking
                    Welsh support, and each being able in turn to rally a power of hardy marchmen to
                    its banner. And that the insurgent Welsh were not idle during the interval
                    between these civil conflicts we have the emphatic testimony of Glendower :—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>“Three times hath Henry Bolingbrooke made head </l>
                    <l>Against my power: thrice from the banks of Wye </l>
                    <l>And sedgy-bottomed Severn have I sent him </l>
                    <l>Bootless home, and weather-beaten back.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>The Hotspur and Mortimer revolt against Henry IV. well illustrates, indeed, the
                    kind of support which English disaffection found for centuries in the Welsh
                    marches. A rich heritage of stirring border life and heroic martial story was
                    thus transmitted from the stormy ages of faith and feudalism to the more settled
                    Tudor times. Apart from the border warfare there were also the multiplied
                    associations connected with the struggles between the nobles and the crown, and
                    the rise of the Commons as a distinctive power in the country. The whole local
                    record of great names and signal deeds was in Shakespeare’s day so far withdrawn
                    into the past and mellowed by secular distance as to be capable of exerting its
                    full enchantment over the feelings and the imagination. The historical
                    associations thus connected with the hills and streams, the abbeys and castles,
                    of Warwickshire added elements of striking moral interest to the natural beauty
                    of the scenery. To the penetrating imagination of poetic natures these elements
                    reflected the continuity of national life as well as the greatness and splendour
                    of the personalities and achievements by which it was developed from age to age.
                    They also helped to kindle within them a genuine enthusiasm for the fortunes and
                    the fame of their native land. And scenery beautiful in itself acquired a
                    tenfold charm from the power it thus possessed of bringing vividly before the
                    mind the wide and moving panorama of the heroic past. The facts sufficiently
                    prove that scenery endowed with this multiplied charm takes, if a calmer, still
                    a deeper and firmer hold of the affections than any isolated and remote natural
                    features, however beautiful and sublime, have power to do. This general truth is
                    illustrated with even exceptional force in the lives of Scott and Shakespeare.
                    Both were passionately attached to their native district, and the memorable
                    scenes amidst which their early years were passed. So intense was Scott’s
                    feeling that he told Washington Irving that if he did not see the grey hills and
                    the heather once a year he thought he should die. And one of the few traditions
                    preserved of Shakespeare is that even in the most active period of his London
                    career he always visited Stratford at least once every year. We know indeed from
                    other sources that during his absence Shakespeare continued to take the
                    liveliest interest in the affairs of his native place, and that, although London
                    was for some years his professional residence, he never ceased to regard
                    Stratford as his home.</p>
                <p>Amongst other illustrations of this strong feeling of local attachment that might
                    be given there is one that has recently excited a good deal of attention and is
                    worth noticing in some detail. Mr Hallam, in a well-known passage, has stated
                    that “no letter of Shakespeare’s writing, no record of his conversation, has
                    been preserved.” But we certainly have at least one conversation reported at
                    first hand, and it turns directly on the point in question. It relates to a
                    proposal made in 1614 by some of the local proprietors for the enclosure of
                    certain common lands at Welcombe and Old Stratford. The corporation of Stratford
                    strongly opposed the project on the ground that it would be a hardship to the
                    poorer members of the community, and their clerk Mr Thomas Greene, who was
                    related to Shakespeare, was in London about the business in November of the same
                    year. Under date November<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0769-0744"/> 17th Greene says, in notes which still exist,
                    “My cosen Shakespear comyng yesterdy to town, I went to see him how he did. He
                    told me that they assured him they ment to inclose no further than to Gospell
                    Bush, and so upp straight (leavyng out part of the Dyngles to the ffield) to the
                    gate in Clopton hedg, and take in Salis-buryes peece; and that they mean in
                    Aprill to survey the land, and then to gyve satisfaction, and not before; and he
                    and Mr Hall say they think ther will be nothyng done at all.” This proves that
                    the agents of the scheme had seen Shakespeare on the subject, that he had gone
                    carefully into the details of their plan, consulted his son-in-law Dr John Hall
                    about them, and arrived at the conclusion that for the present they need take no
                    decided action in the matter. There is evidently on Shakespeare’s part a strong
                    feeling against the proposed enclosure, and the agents of the scheme had clearly
                    done their best to remove his objections, promising amongst other things that if
                    it went forward he should suffer no pecuniary loss, a promise already confirmed
                    by a legal instrument. But nine months later, when the local proprietors seemed
                    bent on pushing the scheme, Shakespeare takes a more decided stand, and
                    pronounces strongly against the whole business. We have a notice, dated
                    September 1, 1615, to the effect that Mr Shakespeare had on that day told the
                    agent of the corporation “that he was not able to bear the enclosing of
                    Welcombe.” As his proprietary rights and pecuniary interests were not to be
                    affected by the proposed enclosure, this strong expression of feeling must refer
                    to the public advantages of the Welcombe common fields, and especially to what
                    in Scotland would be called their “amenity,” the element of value arising from
                    their freedom and beauty, their local history and associations. Welcombe, as we
                    have seen, was the most picturesque suburb of Stratford. The hills divided by
                    the leafy Dingles afforded the finest panoramic view of the whole neighbourhood.
                    On their eastern slope they led to Ful-broke Park, the probable scene of the
                    deer-stealing adventure, and towards the north-west to the village of
                    Snitter-field with its wooded sweep of upland “bushes.” Every acre of the ground
                    was associated with the happiest days of Shakespeare’s youth. In his boyish
                    holidays he had repeatedly crossed and recrossed the unfenced fields at the foot
                    of the Welcombe Hills on his ways to the rustic scenes and occupations of his
                    uncle Henry’s farm in the outlying forest village. He knew by heart every
                    boundary tree and stone and bank, every pond and sheep-pool, every barn and
                    cattle-shed, throughout the whole well-frequented circuit. And in his later
                    years, when after the turmoil and excitement of his London life he came to
                    reside at Stratford, and could visit at leisure the scenes of his youth, it was
                    perfectly natural that he should shrink from the prospect of having these scenes
                    partially destroyed and their associations broken up by the rash hand of
                    needless innovation. In his own emphatic language, “he could not bear the
                    enclosing of Welcombe,” and the only authoritative fragment of his conversation
                    preserved to us thus brings vividly out one of the best known and most
                    distinctive features of his personal character and history—his deep and
                    life-long attachment to his native place. Another illustration of the same
                    feeling, common both to Scott and Shakespeare, is supplied by the prudence and
                    foresight they both displayed in husbanding their early gains in order to
                    provide, amidst the scenery they loved, a permanent home for themselves and
                    their families. Shakespeare, the more careful and sharp-sighted of the two, ran
                    no such risks and experienced no such reverses of fortune as those which
                    saddened Scott’s later days. Both, however, spent the last years of their lives
                    in the home which their energy and affection had provided, and both sleep their
                    last sleep under the changing skies and amidst the fields and streams that gave
                    light and music to their earliest years. Hence, of all great authors, they are
                    the two most habitually thought of in connexion with their native haunts and
                    homesteads. Even to his contemporaries Shakespeare was known as the Swan of
                    Avon. The two spots on British ground most completely identified with the
                    noblest energies of genius, consecrated by lifelong associations, and hallowed
                    by sacred dust are the banks of the Tweed from Abbotsford to Dryburgh Abbey, and
                    the sweep of the Avon from Charlecote Park to Stratford church. To all lovers of
                    literature, to all whose spirits have been touched to finer issues by its
                    regenerating influence, these spots, and above all the abbey grave and the
                    chancel tomb, are holy ground,— national shrines visited by pilgrims from every
                    land, who breathe with pride and gratitude and affection the household names of
                    Shakespeare and of Scott.</p>
                <p>The name Shakespeare is found in the Midland counties two centuries before the
                    birth of the poet, scattered so widely that it is not easy at first sight to fix
                    the locality of its rise or trace the lines of its progress. Several facts,
                    however, would seem to indicate that those who first bore it entered
                    Warwickshire from the north and west, and may therefore have migrated in early
                    times from the neighbouring marches. The name itself is of course thoroughly
                    English, and it is given by Camden and Verstegan as an illustration of the way
                    in which surnames were fabricated when first introduced into England in the 13th
                    century. But it is by no means improbable that some hardy borderers who had
                    fought successfully in the English ranks may have received or assumed a
                    significant and sounding designation that would help to perpetuate the memory of
                    their martial prowess. We have indeed a distinct and authoritative assertion
                    that some of Shakespeare’s ancestors had served their country in this way.
                    However this may be, families bearing the name are found during the 15th and
                    16th centuries in the Arden district, especially at Wroxhall and Rowington,—some
                    being connected with the priory of Wroxhall, while during the 15th century the
                    names of more than twenty are enumerated as belonging to the guild of St Ann, at
                    Knoll near Rowington. In the roll of this guild or college are also found the
                    representatives of some of the best families in the county, such as the
                    Ferrerses of Tamworth and the Clintons of Coleshill. Among the members of the
                    guild the poet’s ancestors are to be looked for, and it is not improbable, as Mr
                    French suggests, that John and Joan Shakespeare, entered on the Knoll register
                    in 1527, may have been the parents of Richard Shakespeare of Snitterfield, whose
                    sons gave each to his children the favourite family names. Richard Shakespeare,
                    the poet’s grand father, occupied a substantial dwelling and cultivated a forest
                    farm at Snitterfield, between 3 and 4 miles from Stratford. He was the tenant of
                    Robert Arden of Wilmcote, “a gentleman of worship,” who farmed his own estate,
                    situated a few miles to the west of Snitterfield. Richard Shakespeare was
                    settled at the latter hamlet and doing well as early as 1543, Thomas Atwood of
                    Stratford having in that year bequeathed to him four oxen which were then in his
                    keeping; and he continued to reside there certainly till 1560, and probably till
                    his death. He appears to have had two sons, John and Henry, of whom John, the
                    eldest, early broke through the contracted circle of rustic life at
                    Snitterfield, made his way to Stratford, and established himself as a trader in
                    one of the leading thoroughfares of the town. This movement to the town probably
                    took place in 1551, as in 1552 John Shakespeare is described in an official
                    document as residing in Henley Street, where the poet was subsequently born. As
                    to the<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n770/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0770-0745"/> precise nature of his occupation, the kind of
                    wares in which he principally dealt, there are various and conflicting
                    statements that have given rise to a good deal of discussion. The earliest
                    official statement on the subject occurs in the register of the bailiff’s court
                    for the year 1556. He is there described as a “glover,” which, according to the
                    verbal usage of the time, included dealing in skins, as well as in the various
                    leather-made articles of farming gear, such as rough gauntlets and leggings for
                    hedging and ditching, white leather gloves for chopping wood, and the like. But
                    in addition to the trade of glover and fell-monger tradition assigns to John
                    Shakespeare the functions of butcher, wool-stapler, corn-dealer, and
                    timber-merchant. These occupations are not incompatible, and together they
                    represent the main lines some of which at least a young farmer going into the
                    town for trading purposes would be likely to pursue. He would naturally deal
                    with the things he knew most about, such as corn, wool, timber, skins, and
                    leather-made articles used in farm work—in a word, he would deal in farm
                    conveniences and farm products. In a town that was the centre and chief market
                    of an agricultural and grazing district, and as the member of a family whose
                    wide connexions were nearly all engaged in farming operations, his prospects
                    were certainly rather favourable than otherwise. And he soon began to turn his
                    country connexion to account. There is distinct evidence that he early dealt in
                    corn and wood as well as gloves and leather, for in 1556 he sues a neighbour for
                    eighteen quarters of barley, and a few years later is paid three shillings by
                    the corporation for a load of timber.</p>
                <p>The poet’s father was evidently a man of energy, ambition, and public spirit,
                    with the knowledge and ability requisite for pushing his fortune with fair
                    success in his new career. His youthful vigour and intelligence soon told in his
                    favour, and in a short time we find him taking an active part in public affairs.
                    He made way so rapidly indeed amongst his fellow-townsmen, that within five
                    years after entering Stratford he is recognized as a fitting recipient of
                    municipal honours; and his official appointments steadily rise in dignity and
                    value through the various gradations of leet-juror, ale-taster, constable,
                    affeeror, burgess, chamberlain, and alderman, until in 1568 he gains the most
                    distinguished post of official dignity, that of high-bailiff or mayor of the
                    town. Within twenty years after starting in business in Henley Street he thus
                    rises to the highest place in the direction of municipal affairs, presiding as
                    their head over the deliberations of his fellow aldermen and burgesses, and as
                    chief magistrate over the local court of record. Three years later, in 1571, he
                    was again elected as chief alderman. There is ample evidence, too, that during
                    these years he advanced in material prosperity as well as in municipal dignities
                    and honours. As early as 1556 he had means at his command which enabled him to
                    purchase two houses in the town, one in Henley Street with a considerable
                    garden, and another in Greenhill Street with a garden and croft attached to it.
                    In the following year he married an heiress of gentle birth, Mary Arden of the
                    Asbies, who had recently inherited under her father’s will a substantial sum of
                    ready money, an estate at Wilmcote, consisting of nearly 60 acres of land with
                    two or three houses, and a reversionary interest in houses and lands at
                    Snitterfield, including the farm tenanted by Richard Shakespeare, her husband’s
                    father. Being now a landed proprietor and a man of rising position and
                    influence, John Shakespeare would be able to extend his business operations, and
                    it is clear that he did so, though whether always with due prudence and
                    foresight may be fairly questioned. To a man of his sanguine and somewhat
                    impetuous temper the sudden increase of wealth was probably by no means an
                    unmixed good. But for some years, at all events, he was able to maintain his
                    more prosperous state, and his new ventures appear for a time to have turned out
                    well. He is designated in official documents as yeoman, freeholder, and
                    gentleman, and has the epithet “master” prefixed to his name; this, being
                    equivalent to esquire, was rarely used except in relation to men of means and
                    station, possessing landed property of their own. In a note to another official
                    document it is stated that about the time of his becoming chief magistrate of
                    Stratford John Shakespeare had “lands and tenements of good worth and substance”
                    estimated in value at £500, and though there may be some exaggeration in this
                    estimate his property from various sources must have been worth nearly that sum.
                    And in 1575 he increased the total amount by purchasing two houses in Henley
                    Street, the two that still remain identified with the name and are consecrated
                    by tradition as the birthplace of the poet. But this was his last purchase, the
                    tide of his hitherto prosperous fortunes being but too clearly already on the
                    turn. Having passed the highest point of social and commercial success, he was
                    now facing the downward slope, and the descent once begun was for some years
                    continuous, and at times alarmingly and almost inscrutably rapid.</p>
                <p>It seems clear indeed from the facts of the case that, notwithstanding John
                    Shakespeare’s intelligence, activity, and early success, there was some defect
                    of character which introduced an element of instability into his career, and in
                    the end very much neutralized the working of his nobler powers. Faintly
                    discernible perhaps from the first, and overpowered only for a time by the
                    access of prosperity that followed nis fortunate marriage, this vital flaw
                    ultimately produced its natural fruit in the serious embarrassments that clouded
                    his later years. The precise nature of the defect can only be indicated in
                    general terms, but it seems to have consisted very much in a want of measure and
                    balance, of adequate care and foresight, in his business dealings and
                    calculations. He seems to have possessed the eager sanguine temperament which,
                    absorbed in the immediate object of pursuit, overlooks difficulties and neglects
                    the wider considerations on which lasting success depends. Even in his early
                    years at Stratford there are signs of this ardent, impatient, somewhat unheedful
                    temper. He is not only active and pushing, but too restless and excitable to pay
                    proper attention to necessary details, or discharge with punctuality the minor
                    duties of his position. The first recorded fact in his local history illustrates
                    this feature of his character. In April 1552 John Shakespeare is fined twelve
                    pence, equal to between eight and ten shillings of our English money now, for
                    not removing the heap of household dirt and refuse that had accumulated in front
                    of his own door. Another illustration of his want of thorough method and system
                    in the management of his affairs is supplied by the fact that in the years
                    1556-57 he allowed himself to be sued in the bailiffs court for comparatively
                    small debts. This could not have arisen from any want of means, as during the
                    same period, in October 1556, he made the purchase already referred to of two
                    houses with extensive gardens. The actions for debt must therefore have been the
                    result of negligence or temper on John Shakespeare’s part, and either
                    alternative tells almost equally against his habits of business coolness and
                    regularity. Another illustration of his restless, ill-considered, and unbalanced
                    energy may be found in the number and variety of occupations which he seems to
                    have added to his early trade of glover and leather-dealer. As his prospects
                    improved he appears to have seized on fresh branches of business, until he had
                    included within his grasp the whole circle of agricultural products that could
                    in any way be brought to market. It would seem also that he added farming, to a
                    not inconsiderable extent, to his expanding retail business in Stratford. But it
                    is equally clear that he lacked the orderly method, the comprehensive outlook,
                    and the vigilant care for details essential for holding well in hand the threads
                    of so complicated a commercial web. Other disturbing forces may probably be
                    discovered in the pride and ambition, the love of social excitement and display,
                    which appear to be among the ground notes of John Shakespeare’s character so far
                    as it is revealed to us in the few facts of his history. His strong social
                    feeling and love of pleasurable excitement are illustrated by the fact that
                    during the year of his mayoralty he brought companies of players into the town,
                    and inaugurated dramatic performances in the guild hall. It is during the year
                    of his filling the post of high-bailiff that we first hear of stage plays at
                    Stratford, and the players must have visited the town, if not, as is most
                    likely, at the invitation and desire of the poet’s father, at least with his
                    sanction and support.<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n771/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0771-0746"/> In such cases the players could not act at
                    all without the permission of the mayor and council, and their first performance
                    was usually a free entertainment, patronized and paid for by the corporation,
                    and called the mayor’s play. In all this John Shakespeare took the initiative,
                    and in so doing probably helped to decide the future career of his son. The
                    notes of personal pride and social ambition are equally apparent. It is on
                    record, for example, that soon after reaching the highest post of municipal
                    distinction the poet’s father applied to the heralds’ college for a grant of
                    arms. This application was not at the time successful, but it seems to have been
                    so far seriously entertained that official inquiries were made into the family
                    history and social standing of the Shakespeares. But the remarkable fact is that
                    such an application should have been made at all by a Stratford burgess whose
                    position and prospects were so unstable and precarious as the events of the next
                    few years showed those of John Shakespeare to be. At the time of the application
                    his increasing family must have enlarged his household expenses, while his
                    official position, combined with his open and generous nature, his love of
                    social sympathy, distinction, and support, would probably have led him into
                    habits of freehanded hospitality and inconsiderate expenditure. All this must
                    have helped to introduce a scale of lavish domestic outlay that would tend
                    directly to hasten the financial collapse in his affairs that speedily followed.
                    And on finding things going against him John Shakespeare was just the man to
                    discount his available resources, and, as the pressure increased, mortgage his
                    future and adopt any possible expedient for maintaining the increased port and
                    social consequence he had imprudently assumed.</p>
                <p>This seems to have been the course actually pursued when pecuniary difficulties
                    arose. During the three years that elapsed after his last purchase of house
                    property his affairs became so seriously embarrassed that it was found
                    necessary, if not to sacrifice, at least to jeopardize the most cherished future
                    of the family in order to meet the exigencies of the moment. In 1578 John and
                    Mary Shakespeare mortgaged for forty pounds their most considerable piece of
                    landed property, the estate of the Asbies. The mortgagee was a family connexion
                    of their own, Edmund Lambert, who had married Mary Shakespeare’s sister Joan.
                    The subsequent history of this transaction shows how bitter must have been the
                    need that induced the Shakespeares to surrender, even for a time, their full
                    control over the ancestral estate. The next year, however, the pressure, instead
                    of being relieved by the sacrifice, had become still more urgent, and the only
                    outlying property that remained to meet it was the reversionary interest in the
                    Snitterfield estate. Under a family settlement Mary Shakespeare, on the death of
                    her stepmother, would come into the possession of houses and laud at
                    Snitterfield almost equal in value to the Asbies estate. But in 1579 the
                    Shakespeares found it necessary to dispose altogether of this reversionary
                    interest. In that year it was sold to Robert Webb for the sum of forty pounds.
                    The buyer was a nephew of Mary Shakespeare, being the son of Alexander Webb, who
                    had married her sister Margaret. In thus applying to relatives or family
                    connexions in their need, and disposing of their property to them, the
                    Shakespeares may have hoped it would be more easily regained should times of
                    prosperity return. The sacrifice of the remaining interests in the Snitterfield
                    property afforded, however, only a temporary relief, quite insufficient to
                    remove the accumulating burden of debt and difficulty which now weighed the
                    Shakespeares down. The notes of the proceedings of the Stratford corporation and
                    of the local court of record sufficiently show that John Shakespeare’s adverse
                    fortune continued through a series of years, and they also enable us in part to
                    understand how he bore himself under the changes in his social position that
                    followed. These changes begin in the critical year 1578. In January of that
                    year, when his brother aldermen were called upon to pay a considerable sum each
                    as a contribution to the military equipment to be provided by the town, John
                    Shakespeare is so far relieved that only one half the amount is required from
                    him. Later in the year we find him wholly exempted from the weekly tax paid by
                    his fellow-aldermen for the relief of the poor. In the spring of the following
                    year, on a further tax for military purposes being laid on the town, he is
                    unable to contribute anything, and is accordingly reported as a defaulter. A few
                    years later, in an action for a debt, a verdict is recorded against him, with
                    the official report that he had no goods on which distraint could be made. About
                    the same time he appears to have been under some restraint, if not actually
                    imprisoned for debt. And as late as 1592 it is officially stated, as a result of
                    an inquiry into the number who fail to attend the church service once a month
                    according to the statutory requirement, that John Shakespeare with some others,
                    two of whom, curiously enough, are named Fluellen and Bardolph, “come not to
                    church for fear of process for debt.” In the year 1586 another alderman had at
                    length been chosen in his place, the reason given being expressly because “John
                    Shakespeare doth not come to the halles when they are warned, nor hath not done
                    for a long time.”</p>
                <p>From this brief official record it would seem that under his reverse of fortune
                    he was treated with marked sympathy and consideration by his fellow townsmen.
                    For at least seven years after his troubles first began his fellow-burgesses
                    persist in keeping his name in its place of honour on their roll, partly no
                    doubt as a mark of respect for his character and past services, and partly it
                    may be in the hope that his fortunes might improve and prosperous days return.
                    And, when at length he is superseded by the appointment of another in his place,
                    this is done, not on the ground of his reduced circumstances, but simply because
                    he voluntarily absents himself from the council, never attends its meetings or
                    takes any part in its affairs. This is a noteworthy fact illustrating still
                    further John Shakespeare’s character. The statement clearly indicates the kind
                    of moral collapse that had followed the continuous pressure of material
                    reverses. The eager sanguine nature that had so genially expanded in prosperity
                    was, it is clear, sorely chilled and depressed by adversity. He abandons the
                    usual places of resort, withdraws himself from the meetings of the corporation,
                    and ceases to associate with his fellow-burgesses. And, what is perhaps still
                    more noticeable, he gives up attending church, and no longer even worships with
                    his fellow-townsmen. All this is the more significant because his circumstances,
                    though seriously embarrassed, and for some years much reduced, were never so
                    desperate as to compel him to part with his freehold property in Henley Street.
                    In the darkest hours of his clouded fortune he still retained the now
                    world-famous houses associated with the poet’s birth and early years. There was
                    no adequate reason therefore why John Shakespeare should have so completely
                    forsaken the usual haunts and regular assemblies of his fellow-townsmen and
                    friends. But it seems clear, as already intimated, that, while gifted with a
                    good deal of native energy and intelligence, and possessing a temper that was
                    proud, sensitive, and even passionate, John Shakespeare lacked the kind of
                    fortitude and moral courage which enables men to meet serious reverses of
                    fortune with dignity and reserve, if not with cheerfulness and hope. With the
                    instinct of a wounded animal he seems to have left the prosperous herd and
                    retired apart to bear his pain and loss in solitude and alone. Nor apparently
                    did he hold up his head again until the efficient support of his prosperous son
                    enabled him to take active measures for the recovery of his alienated estate and
                    lost position in the town. By the middle of the last decade of the 16th century
                    the poet's success in his profession was thoroughly assured, and he was on the
                    high road to wealth and fame. As actor, dramatist, and probably also as sharer
                    in the Blackfriars theatre, he was in the receipt of a large income, and
                    according to tradition received a considerable sum from the young earl of
                    Southampton, to whom his poems were dedicated. The son was now therefore as able
                    as he had always been willing to help his father to regain the position of
                    comfort and dignity he had formerly occupied. We find accordingly that in 1597
                    John and Mary Shakespeare filed a bill in Chancery against John Lambert for the
                    recovery of the Asbies estate, which had been mortgaged to his father nearly
                    twenty years before. There had indeed been some movement in the matter ten years
                    earlier, on the death of Edward Lambert the mortgagee. His son John being
                    apparently anxious to settle the dispute, it was proposed that he should pay an
                    additional sum of twenty pounds in order to convert the mortgage into a sale,
                    and that he should then receive from the Shakespeares an absolute title to the
                    estate. The arrangement was not, however, carried out, and in 1589 John
                    Shakespeare brought a bill of complaint against Lambert in the Court of Queen’s
                    Bench. Nothing further, however, seems to have been done, probably because
                    Lambert may have felt that in the low state of the Shakespeares’ fortune the
                    action could not be pressed. In 1597, however, there was a change in the
                    relative position of the litigants, John Shakespeare having now the purse of his
                    son at his command, and a bill in Chancery was accordingly filed against John
                    Lambert. The plea in support of the Shakespeares’ claim was that the original
                    conditions of the mortgage had been fulfilled, the money in discharge having
                    been offered to Edward Lambert at the proper date, but refused by him on the
                    ground that other sums were owing which must also be repaid at the same time. To
                    this plea John Lambert replied, and there is a still further “replication” on
                    the part of the Shakespeares. How the matter was eventually decided is not
                    known, no decree of the court in the case having been discovered. But the
                    probabilities are that it was settled out of court, and, as the estate did not
                    return to the Shakespeares, probably on the basis of the proposal already
                    made,—that of the payment of an additional sum by John Lambert. About the same
                    date, or rather earlier, in 1596, John Shakespeare also renewed his application
                    to the heralds’ college for a grant of arms, and this time with success. The
                    grant was made on the ground that the history and position of the Shakespeare
                    and Arden families fully entitled the applicant to receive coat armour. There
                    can be no doubt that the means required for supporting these applications were
                    supplied by the poet, and he would be well rewarded by the knowledge that in the
                    evening of his days his father had at length realized the desire of his heart,
                    being officially recognized as a “gentleman of worship.” And, what would now
                    perhaps please his father still better, ho<pb break="no"

                    his son, whose profession prevented him at the time from gaining it on his own
                    account. John Shakespeare died in 1601, having through the affectionate care of
                    his son spent the last years of his life in the ease and comfort befitting one
                    who had not only been a prosperous burgess, but chief alderman and mayor of
                    Stratford.</p>
                <p>Of Mary Arden, the poet’s mother, we know little, hardly anything directly
                    indeed; but the little known is wholly in her favour. From the provisions of her
                    father’s will it is clear that of his seven daughters she was his favourite; and
                    the links of evidence are now complete connecting her father Robert Arden with
                    the great Warwickshire family of Arden, whose members had more than once filled
                    the posts of high-sheriff and lord-lieutenant of the county. She was thus
                    descended from an old county family, the oldest in Warwickshire, and had
                    inherited the traditions of gentle birth and good breeding. Her ancestors are
                    traced back, not only to Norman, but to Anglo-Saxon times, Alwin, an early
                    representative of the family, and himself connected with the royal house of
                    Athelstane, having been <hi rend="italic">vice-comes</hi> or sheriff of
                    Warwickshire in the time of Edward the Confessor. His son Turchill retained his
                    extensive possessions under the Conqueror; and, when they were divided on the
                    marriage of his daughter Margaret to a Norman noble created by William Rufus
                    earl of Warwick, Turchill betook himself to his numerous lordships in the Arden
                    district of the county, and assumed the name of De Ardern or Arden. His
                    descendants, who retained the name, multiplied in the shire, and were united in
                    marriage from time to time with the best Norman blood of the kingdom. The family
                    of Arden thus represented the union, under somewhat rare conditions of original
                    distinction and equality, of the two great race elements that have gone to the
                    making of the typical modern Englishman. The immediate ancestors of Mary
                    Shakespeare were the Ardens of Parkhall, near Aston in the north-western part of
                    the shire. During the Wars of the Roses Robert Arden of Parkhall, being at the
                    outset of the quarrel a devoted Yorkist, was seized by the Lancastrians,
                    attached for high treason, and executed at Ludlow in 1452. He left an only son,
                    Walter Arden, who was restored by Edward IV. to his position in the country, and
                    received back his hereditary lordships and lands. At his death in 1502 he was
                    buried with great state in Aston church, where three separate monuments were
                    erected to his memory. He had married Eleanor, second daughter of John Hampden
                    of Bucks, and by her had eight children, six sons and two daughters. The eldest
                    son, Sir John Arden of Parkhall, having been for some years esquire of the body
                    of Henry VII., was knighted and rewarded by that monarch. Sir John was the
                    great-uncle of Mary Shakespeare,—his brother Thomas, the second son of Walter
                    Arden, being her grandfather. Thomas Arden is found residing at Aston Cantlowe
                    during the first half of the 16th century, and in the year 1501 he united with
                    his son Robert Arden, Mary Shakespeare’s father, in the purchase of the
                    Snitterfield estate. Mary Shakespeare was thus directly connected by birth and
                    lineage with those who had taken, and were to take, a foremost part in the great
                    conflicts which constitute turning-points in the history of the country. On her
                    father’s side she was related to Robert Arden, who in the 15th century lost his
                    life while engaged in rallying local forces on behalf of the White Rose, and on
                    her mother’s side to John Hampden, who took a still more distinguished part in
                    the momentous civil struggles of the 17th century.</p>
                <p>A very needless and abortive attempt has been made to call in question Robert
                    Arden’s social and family position on the ground that in a contemporary deed he
                    is called a husbandman <hi rend="italic">(agricola),—</hi> the assumption being
                    that a husbandman is simply a farm-labourer. But the term husbandman was often
                    used in Shakespeare’s day to desig nate a landed proprietor who farmed one of
                    his own estates. The fact of his being spoken of in official documents as a
                    husbandman does not therefore in the least affect Robert Arden’s social
                    position, or his relation to the great house of Arden, which is now established
                    on the clearest evidence. He was, however, a younger member of the house, and
                    would naturally share in the diminished fortune and obscurer career of such a
                    position. But, even as a cadet of so old and distinguished a family, he would
                    tenaciously preserve the generous traditions of birth and breeding he had
                    inherited. Mary Arden was thus a gentlewoman in the truest sense of the term,
                    and she would bring into her husband’s household elements of character and
                    culture that would be of priceless value to the family, and especially to the
                    eldest son, who naturally had the first place in her care and love. A good
                    mother is to an imaginative boy his earliest ideal of womanhood, and in her for
                    him are gathered up, in all their vital fulness, the tenderness, sympathy, and
                    truth, the infinite love, patient watchfulness, and self-abnegation of the whole
                    sex. And the experience of his mother’s bearing and example during the
                    vicissitudes of their home life must have been for the future dramatist a vivid
                    revelation of the more sprightly and gracious, as well as of the profounder
                    elements, of female character. In the earlier and prosperous days at Stratford,
                    when all within the home circle was bright and happy, and in her intercourse
                    with her boy Mary Shakespeare could freely unfold the attractive qualities that
                    had so endeared her to her father’s heart, the delightful image of the young
                    mother would melt unconsciously into the boy’s mind, fill his imagination, and
                    become a storehouse whence in after years he would draw some of the finest lines
                    in his matchless portraiture of women. In the darker days that followed he would
                    learn something of the vast possibilities of suffering, personal and
                    sympathetic, belonging to a deep and sensitive nature, and as the troubles made
                    head he would gain some insight into the quiet courage and self-possession, the
                    unwearied fortitude, sweetness, and dignity which such a nature reveals when
                    stirred to its depths by adversity, and rallying all its resources to meet the
                    inevitable storms of fate. These storms were not simply the ever-deepening
                    pecuniary embarrassments and consequent loss of social position. In the very
                    crisis of the troubles, in the spring of 1579, death entered the straitened
                    household, carrying off Ann, the younger of the only two remaining daughters of
                    John and Mary Shakespeare. A characteristic trait of the father’s grief and
                    pride is afforded by the entry in the church books that a somewhat excessive sum
                    was paid on this occasion for the tolling of the bell. Even with ruin staring
                    him in the face John Shakespeare would forego no point of customary respect nor
                    abate one jot of the ceremonial usage proper to the family of an eminent
                    burgess, although the observance might involve a very needless outlay. In
                    passing through these chequered domestic scenes and vividly realizing the
                    alternations of grief and hope, the eldest son, even in his early years, would
                    gain a fund of memorable experiences. From his native sensibility and strong
                    family affection he would passionately sympathize with his parents in their
                    apparently hopeless struggle against the slings and arrows of outrageous
                    fortune. Above all he would cherish the memory of his mother’s noble bearing
                    alike under serene and clouded skies, and learn to estimate at their true worth
                    the refined strength of inherited courage, the dignified grace and silent
                    helpfulness of inherited courtesy and genuine kindness of heart. These
                    recollections were vitalized in the sprightly intelligence, quick sympathy, and
                    loving truthfulness belonging to the female characters of his early comedies, as
                    well as in the profounder notes of womanly grief and suffering,<pb break="no"

                    depth and intensity of tone, in the early tragedies.</p>
                <p>But in addition to her constant influence and example the poet was probably
                    indebted to his mother for certain elements of his own mind and character
                    directly inherited from her. This position may be maintained without accepting
                    the vague and comparatively empty dictum that Shakespeare derived his genius
                    from his mother, as many eminent men are loosely said to have done. The sacred
                    gift of genius has ever been, and perhaps always will be, inexplicable. No
                    analysis, however complete, of the forces acting on the individual mind can
                    avail to extract this vital secret. The elements of race, country, parentage,
                    and education, though all powerful factors in its development, fail adequately
                    to account for the mystery involved in pre-eminent poetical genius. Like the
                    unseen wind from heaven it bloweth where it listeth, and the inspired voice is
                    gladly heard of men, but none can tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth.
                    while, however, genius is thus without ancestry or lineage, there are elements
                    of character and qualities of mind that, like the features of the countenance
                    and the lines of the bodily frame, appear to be clearly transmissible from
                    parent to child. Shakespeare not unfrequently recognizes this general truth,
                    especially in relation to moral qualities; and it is mainly qualities of this
                    kind that he himself appears to have inherited from his gently born and nurtured
                    mother, Mary Arden of the Asbies. At least it is hardly fanciful to say that in
                    the life and character of the poet we may trace elements of higher feeling and
                    conduct derived from the hereditary culture and courtesy, the social insight and
                    refinement, of the Ardens. Amongst such elements may be reckoned his strong
                    sense of independence and self-respect, his delicate feeling of honour, his
                    habitual consideration for others, and, above all perhaps, his deep instinctive
                    regard for all family interests and relationships, for everything indeed
                    connected with family character and position. The two epithets which those who
                    knew Shakespeare personally most habitually applied to him appear to embody some
                    of these characteristics. They unite in describing him as “gentle” and “honest”
                    in character, and of an open and free, a frank and generous disposition. The
                    epithet “gentle” may be taken to represent the innate courtesy, the delicate
                    consideration for the feelings of others, which belongs in a marked degree to
                    the best representatives of gentle birth, although happily it is by no means
                    confined to them. The second epithet, “honest,” which in the usage of the time
                    meant honourable, may be taken to express the high spirit of independence and
                    self-respect which carefully respects the just claims and rights of others. One
                    point of the truest gentle breeding, which, if not inherited from his mother,
                    must have been derived from her teaching and example, is the cardinal maxim,
                    which Shakespeare seems to have faithfully observed, as to nice exactness in
                    money matters— the maxim not lightly to incur pecuniary obligations, and if
                    incurred to meet them with scrupulous precision and punctuality. This he could
                    not have learnt from his father, who, though an honest man enough, was too eager
                    and careless to be very particular on the point. Indeed, carelessness in money
                    matters seems rather to have belonged to the Snitterfield family, the poet’s
                    uncle Henry having been often in the courts for debt, and, as we have seen, this
                    was true of his father also. But, while his father was often prosecuted for
                    debt, no trace of any such action against the poet himself, for any amount
                    however small, has been discovered. He sued others for money due to him and at
                    times for sums comparatively small, but he never appears as a debtor himself.
                    Indeed, his whole life contradicts the supposition that he would ever have
                    rendered himself liable to such a humiliation. The family troubles must have
                    very early developed and strengthened the high feeling of honour on this vital
                    point he had inherited. He must obviously have taken to heart the lesson his
                    father’s imprudence could hardly fail to impress on a mind so capacious and
                    reflective. John Shakespeare was no doubt a warm-hearted lovable man, who would
                    carry the sympathy and affection of his family with him through all his
                    troubles, but his eldest son, who early understood the secret springs as well as
                    the open issues of life, must have realized vividly the rock on which their
                    domestic prosperity had been wrecked, and before he left home he had evidently
                    formed an invincible resolution to avoid it at all hazards. This helps to
                    explain what has often excited surprise in relation to his future career—his
                    business' industry, financial skill, and steady progress to what may be called
                    worldly success. Few things are more remarkable in Shakespeare’s personal
                    history than the resolute spirit of independence he seems to have displayed from
                    the moment he left his straitened household to seek his fortunes in the world to
                    the time when he returned to live at Stratford as a man of wealth and position
                    in the town. While many of his fellow dramatists were spendthrifts, in constant
                    difficulties, leading disorderly lives, and sinking into unhonoured graves, he
                    must have husbanded his early resources with a rare amount of quiet firmness and
                    self-control. Chettle’s testimony as to Shakespeare’s character and standing
                    during his first years in London is decisive on this head. Having published a
                    posthumous work by Greene, in which Marlowe and Shakespeare were somewhat
                    sharply referred to, Chettle expressed his regret in a preface to a work of his
                    own issued a few months later, in December 1592; he intimates that at the time
                    of publishing Greene’s <hi rend="italic">Groats-worth of Wit</hi> he knew
                    neither Marlowe nor Shakespeare, and that he does not care to become acquainted
                    with the former. But having made Shakespeare’s acquaintance in the interval he
                    expresses his regret that ho should, even as editor, have published a word to
                    his disparagement, adding this remarkable testimony: “Because myself have seen
                    his demeanour, no less civil than he excellent in the qualities he professes;
                    besides, divers of worship have reported his uprightness of dealing, which
                    argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing, which approves his art.”
                    So that Shakespeare, during his earliest and most anxious years in London, had
                    not only kept himself out of debt and difficulty, but had established a
                    reputation of strictly honourable conduct, “divers of worship,” <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> men of position and authority entitled to speak on
                    such a point, “having reported his uprightness of dealing, which argued his
                    honesty.” Now, considering the poet’s associates, occupations, and surroundings,
                    this is significant testimony, and conclusively proves that, although fond of
                    social life and its enjoyments, and without a touch of harshness or severity in
                    his temper, he yet held himself thoroughly in hand, that amidst the ocean of new
                    experiences and desires on which he was suddenly launched he never abandoned the
                    helm, never lost command over his course, never sacrificed the larger interests
                    of the future to the clamorous or excessive demands of the hour. And this no
                    doubt indicates the direction in which he was most indebted to his mother. From
                    his father he might have derived ambitious desires, energetic impulses, and an
                    excitable temper capable of rushing to the verge of passionate excess, but, if
                    so, it is clear that he inherited from his mother the firmness of nerve and
                    fibre as well as the ethical strength required for regulating these violent and
                    explosive elements. If he received as a paternal heritage a very tempest and
                    whirlwind of passion, the maternal gift of temperance and<pb break="no"

                    finish in the working, would supply in some degree at least the power of
                    concentration and self-control indispensable for moulding the extremes of
                    exuberant sensibility and passionate impulse into forms of intense and varied
                    dramatic portraiture; and of course all the finer and regulative elements of
                    character and disposition derived from the spindle side of the house would,
                    throughout the poet’s early years, be strengthened and developed by his mother’s
                    constant presence, influence, and example.</p>
                <p>John and Mary Shakespeare had eight children, four sons and four daughters. Of
                    the latter, two, the first Joan and Margaret, died in infancy, before the birth
                    of the poet, and a third, Anne, in early childhood. In addition to the poet,
                    three sons, Gilbert, Richard, and Edmund, and one daughter, the second Joan,
                    lived to maturity and will be referred to again. William Shakespeare was
                    christened in Stratford church on April 26, 1564, having most probably been
                    born, according to tradition, on the 23d. In July of the same year the town was
                    visited by a severe outbreak of the plague, which in the course of a few months
                    carried off one-sixth of the inhabitants. Fortunately, however, the family of
                    the Shakespeares wholly escaped the contagion, their exemption being probably
                    due to the fact that they lived in the healthiest part of the town, away from
                    the river side, on a dry and porous soil. At the back of Henley Street, indeed,
                    were the gravel pits of the guild, which were in frequent use for repairing the
                    inundated pathways near the river after its periodical overflows. For two years
                    and a half William, their first-born son, remained the only child of his
                    parents, and all his mother’s love and care would naturally be lavished upon
                    him. A special bond would in this way be established between mother and child,
                    and, his father’s affairs being at the time in a highly prosperous state, Mary
                    Shakespeare would see to it that the boy had all the pleasures and advantages
                    suitable to his age, and which the family of a foremost Stratford burgess could
                    easily command. Healthy outdoor enjoyment is not the least valuable part of a
                    boy’s education, and the chief recreations available for the future dramatist in
                    those early years would be the sports and pastimes, the recurring festivals,
                    spectacles, and festivities, of the town and neighbourhood, especially the
                    varying round of rural occupations and the celebration in the forest farms and
                    villages of the chief incidents of the agricultural year. Seed time and harvest,
                    summer and winter, each brought its own group of picturesque merry-makings,
                    including some more important festivals that evoked a good deal of rustic pride,
                    enthusiasm, and display. There were, during these years, at least three of the
                    forest farms where the poet’s parents would be always welcome, and where the boy
                    must have spent many a happy day amidst the freedom and delights of outdoor
                    country life. At Snitterfield his grandfather would be proud enough of the
                    curly-headed youngster with the fine hazel eyes, and his uncle Henry would be
                    charmed at the boy’s interest in all he saw and heard as he trotted with him
                    through the byres and barns, the poultry yard and steading, or, from a safe nook
                    on the bushy margin of the pool, enjoyed the fun and excitement of
                    sheep-washing, or later on watched the mysteries of the shearing and saw the
                    heavy fleece fall from the sides of the palpitating victim before the sure and
                    rapid furrowing of the shears. He would no doubt also be present at the shearing
                    feast and see the queen of the festival receive her rustic guests and distribute
                    amongst them her floral gifts. At Wilmecote, in the solid oak-timbered dwelling
                    of the Asbies, with its well-stocked garden and orchard, the boy would be
                    received with cordial hospitality, as well as with the attention and respect due
                    to his parents as the proprietors and to himself as the heir of the maternal
                    estate. At Shottery the welcome of the Shakespeares would not be less cordial or
                    friendly, as there is evidence to show that as early as 1566 the families were
                    known to each other, John Shakespeare having in that year rendered Richard
                    Hathaway an important personal service. Here the poet met his future bride, Anne
                    Hathaway, in all the charm of her sunny girlhood, and they may be said to have
                    grown up together, except that from the difference of their ages she would reach
                    early womanhood while he was yet a stripling. In his later youthful years he
                    would thus be far more frequently at the Hathaway farm than at Snitterfield or
                    the Asbies. There were, however, family connexions of the Shakespeares occupying
                    farms further afield,·—Hills and Webbs at Bearley and Lamberts at
                    Barton-on-the-Heath. There was thus an exceptionally wide circle of country life
                    open to the poet during his growing years. And in those years he must have
                    repeatedly gone the whole picturesque round with the fresh senses and eager
                    feeling, the observant eye and open mind, that left every detail, from the
                    scarlet hips by the wayside to the proud tops of the eastern pines, imprinted
                    indelibly upon his heart and brain. Hence the apt and vivid references to the
                    scenes and scenery of his youth, the intense and penetrating glances at the most
                    vital aspects as well as the minutest beauties of nature, with which his dramas
                    abound. These glances are so penetrating, the result of such intimate knowledge
                    and enjoyment, that they often seem to reveal in a moment, and by a single touch
                    as it were, all the loveliness and charm of the objects thus rapidly flashed on
                    the inward eye. In relation to the scenes of his youth what fresh and delightful
                    hours at the farms are reflected in the full summer beauty and motley humours of
                    a sheep-shearing festival in the <hi rend="italic">Winter’s Tale</hi>; in the
                    autumn glow of the “sun-burnt sicklemen and sedge-crowned nymphs” of the masque
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Tempest</hi>; and in the vivid pictures of rural sights
                    and sounds in spring and winter so musically rendered in the owl and cuckoo
                    songs of <hi rend="italic">Love's Labour's Lost!</hi> But, in addition to the
                    festivities and merry-makings of the forest farms, it is clear that, in his
                    early years, the poet had some experience of country sports proper, such as
                    hunting, hawking, coursing, wild-duck shooting, and the like. Many of these
                    sports were pursued by the local gentry and the yeomen together, and the poet,
                    as the son of a well-connected burgess of Stratford, who had recently been mayor
                    of the town and possessed estates in the county, would be well entitled to share
                    in them, while his handsome presence and courteous bearing would be likely to
                    ensure him a hearty welcome. If any of the stiffer local magnates looked coldly
                    upon the high-spirited youth, or resented in any way his presence amongst them,
                    their conduct would be likely enough to provoke the kind of sportive
                    retaliations that might naturally culminate in the deer-stealing adventure.
                    However this may be, it is clear from internal evidence that the poet was
                    practically familiar with the field sports of his day.</p>
                <p>In the town the chief holiday spectacles and entertainments were those connected
                    with the Christmas, New Year, and Easter festivals, the May-day rites and games,
                    the pageants of delight of Whitsuntide, the beating of the bounds during
                    Rogation week, and the occasional representation of mysteries, moralities, and
                    stage-plays. In relation to the main bent of the poet’s mind, and the future
                    development of his powers, the latter constituted probably the most important
                    educational influence and stimulus which the social activities and public
                    entertainments of the place could have supplied. Most of these recurring
                    celebrations involved, it is true, a dramatic<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n775/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0775-0750"/> element,—some hero or exploit, some emblem or
                    allegory, being represented by means of costumed personations, pantomime, and
                    dumb show, while in many cases songs, dances, and brief dialogues were
                    interposed as part of a performance. There were masques and morris-dancing on
                    May-day, as well as mummers and waits at Christmas. In a number of towns and
                    villages the exploits of Robin Hood and his associates were also celebrated on
                    May-day, often amidst a picturesque confusion of floral emblems and forestry
                    devices. In Shakespeare’s time the May-day rites and games thus included a
                    variety of elements charged with legendary, historical, and emblematical
                    significance. But, notwithstanding this mixture of festive elements, the
                    celebration as a whole retained its leading character and purpose. It was still
                    the spontaneous meeting of town and country to welcome the fresh beauty of the
                    spring, the welcome being reflected in the open spaces of the sports by tall
                    painted masts decked with garlands, streamers, and flowery crowns, and in the
                    public thoroughfares by the leafy screens and arches, the bright diffused
                    blossoms and fragrant spoils brought from the forest by rejoicing youths and
                    maidens at the dawn. May-day was thus well fitted to be used, as it often is by
                    Shakespeare, as the comprehensive symbol of all that is delightful and
                    exhilarating in the renewed life and vernal freshness of the opening year.</p>
                <p>After May-day, Whitsuntide was at Stratford perhaps the most important season of
                    festive pageantry and scenic display. In addition to the procession of the guild
                    and trades and the usual holiday ales and sports, it involved a distinct and
                    somewhat noteworthy element of dramatic representation. And, as in the case of
                    the regular stageplays, the high-bailiff and council appear to have patronized
                    and supported the performances. We find in the chamberlain’s accounts entries of
                    sums paid “for exhibiting a pastyme at Whitsuntide.” Shakespeare himself refers
                    to these dramatic features of the celebration, and in a manner that almost
                    suggests he may in his youth have taken part in them. However this may be, the
                    popular celebrations of Shakespeare’s youth must have supplied a kind of
                    training in the simpler forms of poetry and dramatic art, and have afforded some
                    scope for the early exercise of his own powers in both directions. This view is
                    indirectly confirmed by a passage in the early scenes of <hi rend="italic">The
                        Return from Parnassus,</hi> where the academic speakers sneer at the poets
                    who come up from the country without any university training. The sneer is
                    evidently the more bitter as it implies that some of these poets had been
                    successful,—more successful than the college-bred wits. The academic critics
                    suggest that the nurseries of these poets were the country ale-house and the
                    country green, —the special stimulus to their powers being the May-day
                    celebrations, the morris-dances, the hobby-horse, and the like.</p>
                <p>But the moralities, interludes, and stage-plays proper afforded the most direct
                    and varied dramatic instruction available in Shakespeare’s youth. The earliest
                    popular form of the drama was the mystery or miracle play, dealing in the main
                    with Biblical subjects; and, Coventry being one of the chief centres for the
                    production and exhibition of the mysteries, Shakespeare had ample opportunities
                    of becoming well acquainted with them. Some of the acting companies formed from
                    the numerous trade guilds of the “shire-town” were moreover in the habit of
                    visiting the neighbouring cities for the purpose of exhibiting their plays and
                    pageants. There is evidence of their having performed at Leicester and Bristol
                    in Shakespeare’s youth, and on returning from the latter city they would most
                    probably have stopped at Stratford and given some performances there. And in any
                    case,</p>
                <p>Coventry being so near to Stratford, the fame of the multiplied pageants
                    presented during the holiday weeks of Easter and Whitsuntide, and especially of
                    the brilliant concourse that came to witness the grand series of Corpus Christi
                    plays, would have early attracted the young poet; and he must have become
                    familiar with the precincts of the Grey Friars at Coventry during the
                    celebration of these great ecclesiastical festivals. The indirect evidence of
                    this is supplied by Shakespeare’s references to the well-known characters of the
                    mysteries, such as Herod and Γilate, Cain and Judas, Termagaunt with his
                    turbaned Turks and infidels, black-burning souls, grim and gaping hell, and the
                    like. The moralities and interludes that gradually took the place of the
                    Biblical mysteries were also acted by companies of strolling players over a wide
                    area in the towns and cities of the Midland and western counties. Malone gives
                    from an eye-witness a detailed and graphic account of the public acting of one
                    of these companies at Gloucester in 1569, the year during which the poet’s
                    father as high-bailiff had brought the stage-players into Stratford and
                    inaugurated a series of performances in the guild hall. The play acted at
                    Gloucester was <hi rend="italic">The Cradle of Security,</hi> one of the most
                    striking and popular of the early moralities or interludes. Willis, the writer
                    of the account, was just Shakespeare’s age, having been born in 1564. As a boy
                    of five years old he had been taken by his father to see the play, and, standing
                    between his father’s knees, watched the whole performance with such intense
                    interest that, writing about it seventy years afterwards, he says, “the subject
                    took such an impression upon me that when I came afterwards towards man’s estate
                    it was as fresh in my memory as if I had seen it newly enacted.” In proof of
                    this he gives a clear and detailed outline of the play. Willis was evidently a
                    man of no special gifts, and, if the witnessing a play when a child could
                    produce on an ordinary mind so memorable an impression, we may imagine what the
                    effect would be on the mind of the marvellous boy who, about the same time and
                    under like circumstances, was taken by his father to see the performances at
                    Stratford. The company that first visited Stratford being a distinguished one,
                    their plays were probably of a higher type and better acted than <hi
                        rend="italic">The Cradle of Security</hi> at Gloucester; and their effect on
                    the young poet would be the more vivid and stimulating from the keener
                    sensibilities and latent dramatic power to which in his case they appealed.
                    These early impressions would be renewed and deepened with the boy’s advancing
                    years. During the decade of Shakespeare’s active youth from 1573 to 1584 the
                    best companies in the kingdom constantly visited Stratford, and he would thus
                    have the advantage of seeing the finest dramas yet produced acted by the best
                    players of the time. This would be for him a rich and fruitful experience of the
                    flexible and impressive form of art which at a moment of exuberant national
                    vitality was attracting to itself the scattered forces of poetic genius, and
                    soon gained a position of unrivalled supremacy. As he watched the performance in
                    turn of the various kinds of interlude, comedy, and pastoral, of chronicle and
                    biographical plays, of historical, domestic, or realistic tragedy, he would gain
                    in instructive insight into the wide scope and vast resources of the rising
                    drama. And he would have opportunities of acquiring some knowledge of stage
                    business, management, and effects, as well as of dramatic form. Amongst the
                    companies that visited Stratford were those of the powerful local earls of
                    Leicester, Warwick, and Worcester, whose members were largely recruited from the
                    Midland counties. The earl of Leicester’s company, the most eminent of all,
                    included several Warwickshire men, while some of the leading members, like the
                    elder Burbage, appear to have<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0776-0751"/> been natives of Stratford or the immediate
                    neighbourhood. And the poet’s father being, as we have seen, so great a friend
                    of the players, and during his most prosperous years in constant communication
                    with them, his son would have every facility for studying their art. Curiosity
                    and interest and the like would prompt him to find out all he could about the
                    use of the stage “books,” the distribution of the parts, the cues and exits, the
                    management of voice and gesture, the graduated passion and controlled power of
                    the leading actors in the play, the just subordination of the less important
                    parts, and the measure and finish of each on which the success of the whole so
                    largely depended. It is not improbable, too, that in connexion with some of the
                    companies Shakespeare may have tried his hand both as poet and actor even before
                    leaving Stratford. His poetical powers could hardly be unknown, and he may have
                    written scenes and passages to fill out an imperfect or complete a defective
                    play; and from his known interest in their work he may have been pressed by the
                    actors to appear in some secondary part on the stage. In any case he would be
                    acquainted with some of the leading players in the best companies, so that when
                    he decided to adopt their profession he might reasonably hope on going to London
                    to find occupation amongst them without much difficulty or delay.</p>
                <p>Shakespeare received the technical part or scholastic elements of his education
                    in the grammar school of his native town. The school was an old foundation
                    dating from the second half of the 15th century and connected with the guild of
                    the Holy Cross. But, having shared the fate of the guild at the suppression of
                    religious houses, it was restored by Edward VI. in 1553, a few weeks before his
                    death. The “King’s New School,” as it was now called, thus represented the fresh
                    impulse given to education throughout the kingdom during the reign of Henry
                    VIII.’s earnest-minded son, and well sustained under the enlightened rule of his
                    sister, the learned virgin queen. What the course of instruction was in these
                    country schools during the second half of the 16th century has recently been
                    ascertained by special research,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    and may be stated, at least in outline, with some degree of certainty and
                    precision. As might have been expected, Latin was the chief scholastic drill,
                    the thorough teaching of the Roman tongue being, as the name implies, the very
                    purpose for which the grammar schools were originally founded. The regular
                    teaching of Greek was indeed hardly introduced into the country schools until a
                    somewhat later period. But the knowledge of Latin, as the language of all the
                    learned professions, still largely used in literature, was regarded as quite
                    indispensable. Whatever else might be neglected, the business of
                    “gerund-grinding” was vigorously carried on, and the methods of teaching, the
                    expedients and helps devised for enabling the pupils to read, write, and talk
                    Latin, if rather complex and operose, were at the same time ingenious and
                    effective. As a rule the pupil entered the grammar school at seven years old,
                    having already acquired either at home or at the petty school the rudiments of
                    reading and writing. During the first year the pupils were occupied with the
                    elements of Latin grammar, the accidence, and lists of common words which were
                    committed to memory and repeated two or three times a week, as well as further
                    impressed upon their minds by varied exercises. In the second year the grammar
                    was fully mastered, and the boys were drilled in short phrase-books, such as the
                        <hi rend="italic">Sententias Pueriles,</hi> to increase their familiarity
                    with the structure and idioms of the language. In the third year the books used
                    were Aesop’s <hi rend="italic">Fables,</hi> Cato’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Maxims,</hi> and some good manual of school conversation, such as the <hi
                        rend="italic">Confabulationes Pueriles.</hi> The most popular of these
                    manuals in Shakespeare’s day was that by the eminent scholar and still more
                    eminent teacher Corderius. His celebrated <hi rend="italic">Colloquies</hi> were
                    probably used in almost every school in the kingdom; and Hoole, writing in 1652,
                    says that the worth of the book had been proved “by scores if not hundreds of
                    impressions in this and foreign countries.” Bayle, indeed, says that from its
                    universal use in the schools the editions of the book might be counted by
                    thousands. This helps to illustrate the colloquial use of Latin, which was so
                    essential a feature of grammar school discipline in the 16th and 17th centuries.
                    The evidence of Brinsley, who was Shakespeare’s contemporary, conclusively
                    proves that the constant speaking of Latin by all the boys of the more advanced
                    forms was indispensable even in the smallest and poorest of the country grammar
                    schools. The same holds true of letter-writing in Latin; and this, as we know
                    from the result, was diligently and successfully practised in the Stratford
                    grammar school. During his school days, therefore, Shakespeare would be
                    thoroughly trained in the conversational and epistolary use of Latin, and
                    several well-known passages in his dramas show that he did not forget this early
                    experience, but that like everything else he acquired it turned to fruitful uses
                    in his hands. The books read in the more advanced forms of the school were the
                        <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi> of Mantuanus, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tristia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> of Ovid, Cicero’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Offices, Orations,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Georgics</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> of Virgil,
                    and in the highest form parts of Juvenal, of the comedies of Terence and
                    Plautus, and of the tragedies of Seneca. Shakespeare, having remained at school
                    for at least six years, must have gone through a greater part of this course,
                    and, being a pupil of unusual quickness and ability, endowed with rare strength
                    of mental grip and firmness of moral purpose, he must during those years have
                    acquired a fair mastery of Latin, both colloquial and classical. After the
                    difficulties of the grammar had been overcome, his early intellectual cravings
                    and poetic sensibilities would be alike quickened and gratified by the new world
                    of heroic life and adventure opened to him in reading such authors as Ovid and
                    Virgil. Unless the teaching at Stratford was very exceptionally poor he must
                    have become so far familiar with the favourite school authors, such as Ovid,
                    Tully, and Virgil, as to read them intelligently and with comparative ease.</p>
                <p>And there is no reason whatever for supposing that the instruction at the
                    Stratford grammar school was less efficient than in the grammar schools of other
                    provincial towns of about the same size. There is abundant evidence to show
                    that, with the fresh impulse given to education under energetic Protestant
                    auspices in the second half of the 16th century, the teaching even in the
                    country grammar schools was as a rule painstaking, intelligent, and fruitful.
                    Brinsley himself was for many years an eminent and successful teacher in the
                    grammar school of Ashby-de-la-Zouche, a small town on the borders of
                    Warwickshire, only a few miles indeed from Coventry; and in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Lucius Literarius,</hi> referring to a book of exercises on
                    the Latin accidence and grammar he had prepared, he says that he had chiefly
                    followed the order of the questions “of that ancient schoolmaster Master
                    Brunsword of Maxfield (Macclesfield) in Cheshire, so much commended for his
                    order and schollers; who, of all other, commeth therein the neerest unto the
                    marke.” Another provincial schoolmaster, Mr Robert Doughty, a contemporary of
                    Shakespeare, who was for nearly fifty years at the head of the Wakefield grammar
                    school, is celebrated by Hoole, not only as an eminent teacher who had
                    constantly sent out good scholars, but as one who had produced a class of
                    teachers emulating his own educational zeal and intelligence. The masters of the
                    Stratford grammar school in Shakespeare’s time seem to have been men of a
                    similar stamp. One of them, John Brunsword, who held the post for three years
                    during the poet’s childhood, was almost certainly a relative, probably a son, of
                    the eminent Macclesfield master whoso character and work Brinsley praises so
                    highly. At least, Brunsword being an uncommon name, when we find it borne by two
                    grammar-school masters in neighbouring counties who flourished either together
                    or in close succession to each other, it is natural to conclude that there must
                    have been some relationship between<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n777/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0777-0752"/> them, and if so we may be sure that the
                    Stratford master, who was evidently the younger man, had been well trained and
                    must have proved an efficient teacher. The masters who followed Brunsword were
                    university men of at least average attainments and ability, as they rapidly
                    gained promotion in the church. Thomas Hunt, who was head-master during the most
                    important years of Shakespeare’s school course, became incumbent of the
                    neighbouring village of Luddington; and, if there is any truth in the tradition
                    that the poet’s marriage was celebrated there, it is not improbable that, front
                    having been a favourite pupil, he may have become the personal friend of his
                    former master. In any case, during the years of his school attendance the poet
                    must have gained sufficient knowledge of Latin to read for his own instruction
                    and delight the authors included in the school curriculum who had struck his
                    fancy and stimulated his awakening powers. While his writings supply clear
                    evidence in support of this general position, they also bring out vividly the
                    fact that Ovid was a special favourite with Shakespeare at the outset of his
                    career. The influence of this romantic and elegiac Roman poet is indeed strongly
                    marked and clearly traceable in the poems as well as in the early plays.</p>
                <p>According to Rowe’s account, Shakespeare was withdrawn from school about 1578, a
                    year or two before he had completed the usual course for boys going into
                    business or passing on to the universities. The immediate cause of the
                    withdrawal seems to have been the growing embarrassments of John Shakespeare’s
                    affairs, the boy being wanted at home to help in the various departments of his
                    father’s business. The poet had just entered on his fifteenth year, and his
                    school attainments and turn for affairs, no less than his native energy and
                    ability, fitted him for efficient action in almost any fairly open career. But
                    open careers were not numerous at Stratford, and John Shakespeare’s once
                    prosperous way of life was now hampered by actual and threatening difficulties
                    which the zeal and affection of his son were powerless to remove or avert. No
                    doubt the boy did his best, trying to understand his father’s position, and
                    discharging with prompt alacrity any duties that came to be done. But he would
                    soon discover how hopeless such efforts were, and with this deepening conviction
                    there would come upon him the reaction of weariness and disappointment, which is
                    the true <hi rend="italic">inferno</hi> of ardent youthful minds. His father’s
                    difficulties were evidently of the chronic and complicated kind against which
                    the generous and impulsive forces of youth and inexperience are of little avail.
                    And, after his son had done his utmost to relieve the sinking fortunes of the
                    family, the aching sense of failure would be among the bitterest experiences of
                    his early years, would be indeed a sharp awakening to the realities and
                    responsibilities of life. Within the narrow circle of his own domestic
                    relationships and dearest interests he would feel with Hamlet that the times
                    were out of joint, and in his gloomier moods be ready to curse the destiny that
                    seemed to lay upon him, in part at least, the burden of setting the obstinately
                    crooked straight. As a relief from such moods and a distraction from the
                    fruitless toils of home affairs, he would naturally plunge with keener zest into
                    such outlets for youthful energy and adventure as the town and neighbourhood
                    afforded. What the young poet’s actual occupations were during the four years
                    and a half that elapsed between his leaving school and his marriage we have no
                    adequate materials for deciding in any detail. But the local traditions on the
                    subject would seem to indicate that after the adverse turn in his fortunes John
                    Shakespeare had considerably contracted the area of his commercial transactions.
                    Having virtually alienated his wife’s patrimony by the mortgage of the Asbies
                    and the disposal of all interest in the Snitterfield property, he seems to have
                    given up the agricultural branches of his business, retaining only his original
                    occupation of dealer in leather, skins, and sometimes carcases as well. His
                    wider speculations had probably turned out ill, and having no longer any land of
                    his own he apparently relinquished the corn and timber business, restricting
                    himself to the town trades of fellmonger, wool-stapler, and butcher. Aubrey at
                    least had heard that Shakespeare after leaving school assisted his father in
                    these branches,—and at times with a deal of youthful extravagance indicative of
                    irrepressible energy and spirit. Aubrey also reports, on the authority of
                    Beeston, and as incidentally proving he knew Latin fairly well, that for a time
                    the poet was a teacher in a country school; while Malone believed from the
                    internal evidence of his writings that he had spent two or three years in a
                    lawyer’s office. These stories may be taken to indicate, what is no doubt true,
                    that at a time of domestic need the poet was ready to turn his hand to anything
                    that offered. It is no doubt also true that he would prefer the comparative
                    retirement and regularity of teaching or clerk’s work to the intermittent
                    drudgery and indolence of a retail shop in a small market-town. There is,
                    however, no direct evidence in favour of either supposition; and the indirect
                    evidence for the lawyer’s office theory which has found favour with several
                    recent critics is by no means decisive. Whether engaged in a lawyer’s office or
                    not, we may be quite sure that during the years of adolescence he was actively
                    occupied in work of some kind or other. He was far too sensible and energetic to
                    remain without employment; shapeless idleness had no attraction for his healthy
                    nature, and his strong family feeling is certainly in favour of the tradition
                    that for a time he did his best to help his father in his business.</p>
                <p>But, however he may have been employed, this interval of home life was for the
                    poet a time of active growth and development, and no kind of business routine
                    could avail to absorb his expanding powers or repress the exuberant vitality of
                    his nature. During these critical years, to a vigorous and healthy mind such as
                    Shakespeare possessed, action—action of an adventurous and recreative kind, in
                    which the spirit is quickened and refreshed by new experiences—must have become
                    an absolute necessity of existence. The necessity was all the more urgent in
                    Shakespeare’s case from the narrower circle within which the once prosperous and
                    expanding home life was now confined. We have seen that the poet occasionally
                    shared the orthodox field sports organized by the country gentlemen, where
                    landlords and tenants, yeomen and squires, animated by a kindred sentiment, meet
                    to a certain extent on common ground. But this long-drawn pursuit of pleasure as
                    an isolated unit in a local crowd would hardly satisfy the thirst for passionate
                    excitement and personal adventure which is so dominant an impulse in the hey-day
                    of youthful blood. It is doubtful, too, whether in the decline of his father’s
                    fortunes Shakespeare would have cared to join the prosperous concourse of local
                    sportsmen. He would probably be thrown a good deal amongst a somewhat lower,
                    though no doubt energetic and intelligent, class of town companions. And they
                    would devise together exploits which, if somewhat irregular, possessed the
                    inspiring charm of freedom and novelty, and would thus be congenial to an ardent
                    nature with a passionate interest in life and action. Such a nature would
                    eagerly welcome enterprises with a dash of hazard and daring in them, fitted to
                    bring the more resolute virtues into play, and develop in moments of emergency
                    the manly qualities of vigilance and promptitude, courage and endurance,
                    dexterity and skill. It would seem indeed at first sight as though a quiet
                    neighbourhood like Stratford could afford little scope for such adventures. But
                    even at Stratford there were always the forest and the river, the outlying farms
                    with adjacent parks and manor houses, the wide circle of picturesque towns and
                    villages with their guilds and clubs, their local Shallows and Slenders,
                    Dogberries and Verges; and in the most quiet neigh<pb break="no"

                    adventures are to the adventurous. That this dictum was verified in
                    Shakespeare’s experience seems clear alike from the internal evidence of his
                    writings and the concurrent testimony of local tradition. In its modern form the
                    story of the Bidford challenge exploit may indeed be little better than a myth.
                    But in substance it is by no means incredible, and if we knew all about the
                    incident we should probably find there were other points to be tested between
                    the rival companies besides strength of head to resist the effects of the
                    well-known Bidford beer. The prompt refusal to return with his companions and
                    renew the contest on the following day,—a decision playfully expressed and
                    emphasized in the well-known doggrel lines,— implies that in Shakespeare’s view
                    such forms of good fellowship were to be accepted on social not self-indulgent
                    grounds, that they were not to be resorted to for the sake of the lower
                    accessories only, or allowed to grow into evil habits from being unduly repeated
                    or prolonged. It is clear that this general principle of recreative and
                    adventurous enterprise, announced more than once in his writings, guided his own
                    conduct even in the excitable and impulsive season of youth and early manhood.
                    If he let himself go, as he no doubt sometimes did, it was only as a good rider
                    on coming to the turf gives the horse his head in order to enjoy the
                    exhilaration of a gallop, having the bridle well in hand the while, and able to
                    rein in the excited steed at a moment’s notice. It may be said of Shakespeare at
                    such seasons, as of his own Prince Hal, that he—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l part="F">“Obscur’d his contemplation</l>
                    <l>Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,</l>
                    <l>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</l>
                    <l>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>The deer-stealing tradition illustrates the same point; and though belonging
                    perhaps to a rather later period it may be conveniently noticed here. This
                    fragment of Shakespeare’s personal history rests on a much surer basis than the
                    Bidford incident, being supported not only by early multiplied and constant
                    traditions, but by evidence which the poet himself has supplied. Rowe’s somewhat
                    formal version of the narrative is to the effect that Shakespeare in his youth
                    was guilty of an extravagance which, though unfortunate at the time, had the
                    happy result of helping to develop his dramatic genius. This misfortune was that
                    of being engaged with some of his companions more than once in robbing a park
                    belonging to Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote. Sir Thomas, it is said, prosecuted
                    him sharply for the offence, and in retaliation he wrote a satirical ballad upon
                    him, which so incensed the baronet that Shakespeare thought it prudent to leave
                    Stratford and join his old friends and associates the players in London. Other
                    versions of the tradition exist giving fresh details, some of which are on the
                    face of them later additions of a fictitious and fanciful kind. But it would be
                    useless to discuss the accretions incident to any narrative, however true,
                    orally transmitted through two or three generations before being reduced to a
                    written shape. All that can be required or expected of such traditions is that
                    they should contain a kernel of biographical fact, and be true in substance
                    although possibly not in form. And tried by this test the tradition in question
                    must certainly be accepted as a genuine contribution to our knowledge of the
                    poet’s early years. Indeed it could hardly have been repeated again and again by
                    inhabitants of Stratford within a few years of Shakespeare’s death if it did not
                    embody a characteristic feature of his early life which was well known in the
                    town. This feature was no doubt the poet’s love of woodland life, and the
                    woodland sports through which it is realized in the most animated and vigorous
                    form.</p>
                <p>The neighbourhood of Stratford in Shakespeare’s day afforded considerable scope
                    for this kind of healthy recreation. There was the remnant of the old Λrden
                    forest, which, though still nominally a royal domain, was virtually free for
                    many kinds of sport. Indeed, the observance of the forest laws had fallen into
                    such neglect in the early years of Elizabeth’s reign that even unlicensed
                    deerhunting in the royal domains was common enough. And hardly any attempt was
                    made to prevent the pursuit of the smaller game belonging to the warren and the
                    chase. Then, three or four miles to the east of Stratford, between the Warwick
                    road and the river, stretched the romantic park of Fulbroke, which, as the
                    property of an attainted exile, sequestered though not seized by the crown, was
                    virtually open to all comers. There can be little doubt that when Shakespeare
                    and his companions wished a day’s outing in the woods they usually resorted to
                    some part of the Arden forest still available for sporting purposes. But
                    sometimes, probably on account of its greater convenience, they seem to have
                    changed the venue to Fulbroke Park, and there they might easily come into
                    collision with Sir Thomas Lucy’s keepers. There has been a good deal of
                    discussion as to the scene of the traditional adventure, but the probabilities
                    of the case are strongly in favour of Fulbroke. When Sir Walter Scott visited
                    Sir Thomas Lucy at Charlecote in 1828, Sir Thomas told him that the park from
                    which Shakespeare stole the deer was not Charlecote, but one belonging to a
                    mansion at some distance, the context indicating Fulbroke as the scene of the
                    exploit. And Mr Bracebridge, in his interesting pamphlet <hi rend="italic"
                        >Shakespeare no Deer-Stealer,</hi> has thrown fresh light on the subject,
                    and made the whole incident more intelligible by marshalling the reasons in
                    favour of this view. The park had, it seems, been held by the Lucys under the
                    crown in the time of Henry V1II., but was afterwards granted by Queen Mary to
                    one of her privy councillors,—Sir Francis Engeliield. Being a devoted Romanist,
                    he fled to Spain on the accession of Elizabeth and was subsequently adjudged a
                    traitor, the Fulbroke estate being sequestered though not administered by the
                    crown. The park being thus without a legal custodian for more than a quarter of
                    a century became disparked, the palings having fallen into decay and the fences
                    being in many places broken down. The deer with which it abounded were thus left
                    without any legal protection, and might be hunted at will by enterprising
                    sportsmen. The only person likely to check this freedom or to attempt to do so
                    was Sir Thomas Lucy, whose own park of Charlecote ran for a mile along the other
                    side of the river just below Fulbroke. As the nearest large landed proprietor,
                    having a direct interest in the state of the neighbouring park, he might
                    naturally think himself entitled to act as a kind of <hi rend="italic">ad
                        interim</hi> custodian of Fulbroke. And with his aristocratic feeling, his
                    severe and exacting temper, he would be likely enough to push his temporary
                    guardianship of custom or courtesy into an exclusive right, at least so far as
                    the venison of the park was concerned. In any case Sir Thomas’s keepers would
                    occasionally perambulate Fulbroke Park as a protection to Charlecote, and in
                    doing so they probably came upon Shakespeare and his companions after they had
                    brought down a buck and were about to break it up for removal. Or the hunted
                    deer may have crossed the river at the shallow ford between the two parks, and,
                    pursued by the eager sportsmen, have been brought down within the Charlecote
                    grounds. In either case the keepers would denounce the trespass, and possibly
                    with menacing and abusive words demand the buck for their master. On being
                    treated in this insulting way, Shakespeare, who had pride and personal dignity
                    as well as courage, would deny any intentional or actual trespass, refuse to
                    give up the venison, and plainly tell the keepers that they might report the
                    matter to Sir Thomas Lucy and he would answer for himself and his companions. On
                    finding what had happened, Sir Thomas would be all the more incensed and
                    indignant from the consciousness that he had pushed his claims beyond the point
                    at which they could legally be enforced. And, being to some extent in a false
                    position, he would be proportionately wrathful and vindictive against the
                    youthful sportsmen, and especially against their leader who had dared to resist
                    and defy his authority. Sir Thomas was the great man of Stratford, who came
                    periodically to the town on magistrate’s business, was appealed to as arbitrator
                    in special cases, and entertained by the corporation during his visits. In
                    character he seems to have combined aristocratic pride and narrowness with the
                    harshness and severity of the Puritan temper. As a landed proprietor and local
                    magnate he was exacting and exclusive, looking with a kind of Puritanical
                    sourness on all youthful frolics, merriment, and recreation. He would thus have
                    a natural antipathy to young Shakespeare’s free, generous, and enjoying nature,
                    and would resent as an unpardonable outrage his high-spirited conduct in
                    attempting to resist any claims he chose to make. Sir Thomas would no doubt vent
                    his indignation to the authorities at Stratford, and try to set the law in
                    motion, and failing in this might have threatened, as Justice Shallow does, to
                    make a Star-Chamber matter of it. This was the kind of extreme course which a
                    man in his position might take where there was no available local redress for
                    any wrong he imagined himself to have suffered. And<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0779-0754"/> the Stratford authorities, being naturally
                    anxious to propitiate the great man, may have suggested that it would be well if
                    young Shakespeare could be out of the way for a time. This would help him to
                    decide on the adoption of a plan already seriously entertained of going to
                    London to push his fortune among the players.</p>
                <p>There is, however, another aspect in which this traditional incident may be
                    looked at, which seems at least worthy of consideration. It is possible that Sir
                    Thomas Lucy may have been prejudiced against the Shakespeares on religious
                    grounds, and that this feeling may have prompted him to a display of exceptional
                    severity against their eldest son. As we have seen, he was a narrow and extreme,
                    a persecuting and almost fanatical Protestant, and several events had recently
                    happened calculated to intensify his bitterness against the Romanists. In
                    particular, Mary Shakespeare’s family connexions—the Ardens of Parkhall —had
                    been convicted of conspiracy against the queen’s life. The son-in-law of Edward
                    Arden, John Somerville, a rash and “hot-spirited young gentleman,” instigated by
                    Hall, the family priest, had formed the design of going to London and
                    assassinating Queen Elizabeth with his own hand. He started on his journey in
                    November 1583, but talked so incautiously by the way that he was arrested,
                    conveyed to the Tower, and under a threat of the rack confessed everything,
                    accusing his father-in-law as an accomplice and the priest as the instigator of
                    the crime. All three were tried and convicted, their fate being probably
                    hastened, as Dugdale states, by the animosity of Leicester against the Ardens.
                    Somerville strangled himself in prison, and Edward Arden was hanged at Tyburn.
                    These events produced a deep impression in Warwickshire, and no one in the
                    locality would be more excited by them than Sir Thomas Lucy. His intensely
                    vindictive feeling against the Romanists was exemplified a little later by his
                    bringing forward a motion in parliament in favour of devising some new and
                    lingering tortures for the execution of the Romanist conspirator Parry. As Mr
                    Froude puts it, “Sir Thomas Lucy,— Shakespeare’s Lucy, the original perhaps of
                    Justice Shallow, with an English fierceness at the bottom of his stupid
                    nature,—having studied the details of the execution of Gerard, proposed in the
                    House of Commons ‘that some new law should be devised for Parry’s execution,
                    such as might be thought fittest for his extraordinary and horrible treason.’”
                    The Ardens were devoted Romanists; the terrible calamity that had befallen the
                    family occurred only a short time before the deer-stealing adventure; and the
                    Shakespeares themselves, so far from being Puritans, were suspected by many of
                    being but indifferent Protestants. John Shakespeare was an irregular attendant
                    at church, and soon ceased to appear there at all, so that Sir Thomas Lucy
                    probably regarded him as little better than a recusant. In any case Sir Thomas
                    would be likely to resent the elder Shakespeare’s convivial turn and profuse
                    hospitality as alderman and bailiff, and especially his official patronage of
                    the players and active encouragement of their dramatic representations in the
                    guild hall. The Puritans had a rooted antipathy to the stage, and to the
                    jaundiced eye of the local justice the reverses of the Shakespeares would
                    probably appear as a judgment on their way of life. He would all the more
                    eagerly seize any chance of humiliating their eldest son, who still held up his
                    head and dared to look upon life as a scene of cheerful activity and occasional
                    enjoyment. The young poet, indeed, embodied the very characteristics most
                    opposed to Sir Thomas’s dark and narrow conceptions of life and duty. His
                    notions of public duty were very much restricted to persecuting the Romanists
                    and preserving the game on Protestant estates. And Shakespeare probably took no
                    pains to conceal his want of sympathy with these supreme objects of aristocratic
                    and Puritanical zeal. And Sir Thomas, having at length caught him, as he
                    imagined, in a technical trespass, would be sure to pursue the culprit with the
                    unrelenting rigour of his hard and gloomy nature. But, whatever may have been
                    the actual or aggravating circumstances of the original offence, there can be no
                    doubt that an element of truth is contained in the deerstealing tradition. The
                    substantial facts in the story are that Shakespeare in his youth was fond of
                    woodland sport, and that in one of his hunting adventures he came into collision
                    with Sir Thomas Lucy’s keepers, and fell under the severe ban of that local
                    potentate. The latter point is indirectly confirmed by Shakespeare’s inimitable
                    sketch of the formal country justice in the <hi rend="italic">Second Part of
                        Henry IV.</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Merry Wives of Windsor,—</hi>
                    Robert Shallow, Esq., being sufficiently identified with Sir Thomas Lucy by the
                    pointed allusion to the coat of arms, as well as by other allusions of a more
                    indirect but hardly less decisive kind. To talk of the sketch as an act of
                    revenge is to treat it too seriously, or rather in too didactic and pedestrian a
                    spirit. Having been brought into close relations with the justice, Shakespeare
                    could hardly be expected to resist the temptation of turning to dramatic account
                    so admirable a subject for humorous portraiture. The other point of the
                    tradition, Shakespeare’s fondness for woodland life, is supported by the
                    internal evidence of his writings, and especially by the numerous allusions to
                    the subject in his poems and earlier plays. The many references to woods and
                    sports in the poems are well known; and in the early plays the allusions are not
                    less frequent and in some respects even more striking. Having no space, however,
                    to give these in detail, a general reference must suffice. The entire action of
                        <hi rend="italic">Lords Labour's Lost</hi> takes place in a royal park,
                    while the scene of the most critical events of the <hi rend="italic">Two
                        Gentlemen of Verona</hi> is a forest inhabited by generous outlaws whose
                    offences appear to have been youthful follies, and who on being pardoned by the
                    duke become his loyal followers. In these early plays it seems as though
                    Shakespeare could hardly conceive of a royal palace or capital city without a
                    forest close at hand as the scene of princely sport, criminal intrigue, or fairy
                    enchantment. Outside the gates of Athens swept over hill and dale the wonderful
                    forest which is the scene of the <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Nights Dream;</hi>
                    and in <hi rend="italic">Titus Andronicus</hi> imperial Rome seems to be almost
                    surrounded by the brightness and terror, the inspiring charm and sombre shades
                    of rolling forest lawns and ravines, the “ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods.”</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt, therefore, that during the years of home life at Stratford
                    Shakespeare was often in the forest. But in the latter part of the time he would
                    be found still more frequently hastening through the fields to Shottery, paying
                    long visits at the Hathaway farm, followed by late and reluctant leave-takings.
                    For the next important fact in Shakespeare’s history is his marriage with Anne
                    Hathaway. This event, or rather the formal and ecclesiastical part of it, took
                    place in the end of November 1582, the bond for the licence from the consistory
                    court being dated on the 28th of the month. Mr Halliwell-Phillipps has, however,
                    sufficiently proved by detailed instances that the formal and public part of the
                    ceremony would, according to the usage of the time, have been preceded some
                    months earlier by the betrothal or pre-contract, which was in itself of legal
                    validity. Shakespeare’s marriage may therefore be dated from the summer of 1582,
                    he being then in his nineteenth year, while his bride was between seven and
                    eight years older. Many of the poet’s biographers have assumed that the marriage
                    was a hasty, unsuitable, and in its results an unhappy one. It is necessary
                    therefore to repeat with all possible<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0780-0755"/> emphasis the well-founded statement of Mr
                    Halliwell-Phillipps that “there is not a particle of direct evidence” for either
                    of these suppositions. The marriage could hardly have been a hasty one, for, as
                    we have seen, the two families had been intimate for fifteen years, and
                    Shakespeare had known Anne Hathaway from his early boyhood. As to whether it was
                    suitable or not Shakespeare himself was the best and only adequate judge, and
                    there is not, in the whole literature of the subject, even the shadow of a
                    successful appeal against his decision. And, so far from the marriage having
                    been unhappy, all the evidence within our reach goes to show that it was not
                    only a union of mutual affection but a most fortunate event for the poet
                    himself, as well as for the wife and mother who remained at the head of his
                    family, venerated and loved by her children, and a devoted helpmate to her
                    husband to the very end. Looking at the matter in its wider aspects, and
                    especially in relation to his future career, it may be said that Shakespeare’s
                    early marriage gave him at the most emotional and unsettled period of life a
                    fixed centre of affection and a supreme motive to prompt and fruitful exertion.
                    This would have a salutary and steadying effect on a nature so richly endowed
                    with plastic fancy and passionate impulse, combined with rare powers of
                    reflective foresight and selfcontrol. If Shakespeare’s range and depth of
                    emotional and imaginative genius had not been combined with unusual force of
                    character and strength of ethical and artistic purpose, and these elements had
                    not been early stimulated to sustained activity, he could never have had so
                    great and uninterrupted a career. And nothing perhaps is a more direct proof of
                    Shakespeare’s manly character than the prompt and serious way in which, from the
                    first, he assumed the full responsibility of his acts, and unflinchingly faced
                    the wider range of duties they entailed. He himself has told us that</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>“Love is too young to know what conscience is:</l>
                    <l>Yet who knows not conscience is born of love ?”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>and it remains true that conscience, courage, simplicity, and nobleness of
                    conduct are all, in generous natures, evoked and strengthened by the vital touch
                    of that regenerating power. Shakespeare’s whole course was changed by the new
                    influence; and with his growing responsibilities his character seems to have
                    rapidly matured, and his powers to have found fresh and more effective
                    development. His first child Susanna was born in May 1583, and, as she was
                    baptized on the 26th, the day of her birth may have been the 23d, which would be
                    exactly a month after her father completed his nineteenth year. In February 1585
                    the family was unexpectedly enlarged by the birth of twins, a boy and a girl,
                    who were named respectively Hamnet and Judith, after Hamnet and Judith Sadler,
                    inhabitants of Stratford, who were lifelong friends of Shakespeare. Before he
                    had attained his majority the poet had thus a wife and three children dependent
                    upon him, with little opportunity or means apparently of advancing his fortunes
                    in Stratford. The situation was in itself sufficiently serious. But it was
                    complicated by his father’s increasing embarrassments and multiplied family
                    claims. Four children still remained in Henley Street to be provided for,—the
                    youngest, Edmund, born in May 1580, being scarcely five years old. John
                    Shakespeare, too, was being sued by various creditors, and apparently in some
                    danger of being arrested for debt. All this was enough to make a much older man
                    than the poet look anxiously about him. But, with the unfailing sense and
                    sagacity he displayed in practical affairs, he seems to have formed a sober and
                    just estimate of his own powers, and made a careful survey of the various fields
                    available for their remunerative exercise. As the result of his delibera tions
                    he decided in favour of trying the metropolitan stage and theatre. He had
                    already tested his faculty of acting by occasional essays on the provincial
                    stage; and, once in London amongst the players, where new pieces were constantly
                    required, he would have full scope for the exercise of his higher powers as a
                    dramatic poet. At the outset he could indeed only expect to discharge the lower
                    function, but. with the growing popular demand for dramatic representations, the
                    actor’s calling, though not without its social drawbacks, was in the closing
                    decades of the 16th century a lucrative one. Greene, in his autobiographical
                    sketch <hi rend="italic">Never Too Late,</hi> one of the most interesting of his
                    prose tracts, illustrates this point in the account he gives of his early
                    dealings with the players and experiences as a writer for the stage. Speaking
                    through his hero Francesco, he says that “when his fortunes were at the lowest
                    ebb he fell in amongst a company of players who persuaded him to try his wit in
                    writing of comedies, tragedies, or pastorals, and if he could perform anything
                    worth the stage, then they would largely reward him for his pains.” Succeeding
                    in the work, he was so well paid that he soon became comparatively wealthy, and
                    went about with a well-filled purse. Although writing from the author’s rather
                    than the actor’s point of view, Greene intimates that the players grew rapidly
                    rich and were entitled both to praise and profit so long as they were “neither
                    covetous nor insolent.” In the <hi rend="italic">Return from Parnassus</hi>
                    (1601) the large sums, fortunes indeed, realized by good actors are referred to
                    as matter of notoriety. One of the disappointed academic scholars, indeed,
                    moralizing on the fact with some bitterness, exclaims,—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>“England affords those glorious vagabonds,</l>
                    <l>That carried erst their fardles on their backs,</l>
                    <l>Coursers to ride on through the gazing streets,</l>
                    <l>Sweeping it in their glaring satin suits,</l>
                    <l>And pages to attend their masterships:</l>
                    <l>With mouthing words that better wits have framed</l>
                    <l>They purchase lands, and now esquires are made.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>And in a humorous sketch entitled <hi rend="italic">Ratseis Ghost,</hi> and
                    published in the first decade of the 17th century, au apparent reference to
                    Shakespeare himself brings out the same point. The hero of the tract, Ratsey, a
                    highwayman, having compelled a set of strolling players to act before him,
                    advised their leader to leave the couutry and get to London, where, having a
                    good presence for the stage and a turn for the work, he would soon fill his
                    pockets, adding, “When thou feelest thy purse well-lined, buy thee some place of
                    lordship in the country, that, growing weary of playing, thy money may bring
                    thee dignity and reputation.” The player, thanking him for his advice, replies,
                    “I have heard indeed of some that have gone to London very meanly, who have in
                    time become exceedingly wealthy.” The movement to the London stage was therefore
                    from a worldly point of view a prudent one, and for the higher purposes of
                    Shakespeare’s life it was equally wise and necessary. For besides the economic
                    and practical considerations in favour of the step there must have pressed on
                    the poet’s mind the importance of a wider sphere of life and action for the
                    enlargement of his inward horizon, and the effective development of his poetical
                    and dramatic gifts.</p>
                <p>The exact date of this event—of Shakespeare’s leaving Stratford for London—cannot
                    be fixed with any certainty. All the probabilities of the case, however,
                    indicate that it must have taken place between the spring of 1585 and the autumn
                    of 1587. In the latter year three of the leading companies visited Stratford,
                    those belonging to the queen, Lord Leicester, and Lord Essex; and, as Lord
                    Leicester’s included three of Shakespeare’s fellow townsmen,—Burbage, Heminge,
                    and Greene,—it is not improbable that he may then have decided on trying his
                    fortune in London.<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n781/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0781-0756"/> At the same time it is quite possible, and on
                    some grounds even likely, that the step may have been taken somewhat earlier.
                    But for the five years between 1587 and 1592 we have no direct knowledge of
                    Shakespeare’s movements at all, the period being a complete biographical blank,
                    dimly illuminated at the outset by one or two doubtful traditions. We have
                    indeed the assurance that after leaving Stratford he continued to visit his
                    native town at least once every year; and if he had left in 1586 we may
                    confidently assume that he returned the next year for the purpose, amongst
                    others, of consulting with his father and mother about the Asbies mortgage and
                    of taking part with them in their action against John Lambert. His uniting with
                    them in this action deserves special notice, as showing that he continued to
                    take the keenest personal interest in all home affairs, and, although living
                    mainly in London, was still looked upon, not only as the eldest son, but as the
                    adviser and friend of the family. The anecdotes of Shakespeare’s occupations on
                    going to London are, that at first he was employed in a comparatively humble
                    capacity about the theatre, and that for a time he took charge of the horses of
                    those who rode to see the plays, and was so successful in this work that he soon
                    had a number of juvenile assistants who were known as Shakespeare’s boys. Even
                    in their crude form these traditions embody a tribute to Shakespeare’s business
                    promptitude and skill. If there is any truth in them they may be taken to
                    indicate that while filling some subordinate post in the theatre Shakespeare
                    perceived a defective point in the local arrangements, or heard the complaints
                    of the mounted gallants as to the difficulty of putting up their horses. His
                    provisions for meeting the difficulty seem to have been completely and even
                    notoriously successful. There were open sheds or temporary stables in connexion
                    with the theatre in Shoreditch, and Shakespeare’s boys, if the tradition is
                    true, probably each took charge of a horse in these stables while its owner was
                    at the play. But in any case this would be simply a brief episode in
                    Shakespeare’s multifarious employments when he first reached the scene of his
                    active labours in London. He must soon have had more serious and absorbing
                    professional occupations in the green room, on the stage, and in the laboratory
                    of his own teeming brain, “the quick forge and working house of thought.”</p>
                <p>But his leisure hours during his first years in London would naturally be devoted
                    to continuing his education and equipping himself as fully as possible for his
                    future work. It was probably during this time, as Mr Halliwell-Phillipps
                    suggests, that he acquired the working knowledge of French and Italian that his
                    writings show he must have possessed. And it is perhaps now possible to point
                    out the sources whence his knowledge of these languages was derived, or at least
                    the master under whom he chiefly studied them. The most celebrated and
                    accomplished teacher of French and Italian in Shakespeare’s day was the resolute
                    John Florio, who, after leaving Magdalen College, Oxford, lived for years in
                    London, engaged in tutorial and literary work and intimately associated with
                    eminent men of letters and their noble patrons. After the accession of James I.,
                    Florio was made tutor to Prince Henry, received an appointment about the court,
                    became the friend and personal favourite of Queen Anne (to whom he dedicated the
                    second edition of his Italian dictionary, entitled the <hi rend="italic">World
                        of Words),</hi> and died full of years and honours in 1625, having survived
                    Shakespeare nine years. Florio had married the sister of Daniel the poet, and
                    Ben Jonson presented a copy of <hi rend="italic">The Fox</hi> to him, with the
                    inscription, “To his loving father and worthy friend Master John Florio, Ben
                    Jonson seals this testimony of his friendship and love.” Daniel writes a poem of
                    some length in praise of his translation of Montaigne, while other contemporary
                    poets contribute commendatory verses which are prefixed to his other
                    publications. There are substantial reasons for believing that Shakespeare was
                    also one of Florio’s friends, and that during his early years in London he
                    evinced his friendship by yielding for once to the fashion of writing this kind
                    of eulogistic verse. Prefixed to Florio’s <hi rend="italic">Second Fruits,</hi>
                    Prof. Minto discovered a sonnet so superior and characteristic that he was
                    impressed with the conviction that Shakespeare must have written it. The
                    internal evidence is in favour of this conclusion, while Mr Minto’s critical
                    analysis and comparison of its thought and diction with Shakespeare’s early work
                    tends strongly to support the reality and value of the discovery. In his next
                    work, produced four years later, Florio claims the sonnet as the work of a
                    friend “who loved better to be a poet than to be called one,” and vindicates it
                    from the indirect attack of a hostile critic, II. S., who had also disparaged
                    the work in which it appeared. There are other points of connexion between
                    Florio and Shakespeare. The only known volume that certainly belonged to
                    Shakespeare and contains his autograph is Florio’s version of Montaigne’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Essays</hi> in the British Museum; and critics have from time
                    to time produced evidence to show that Shakespeare must have read it carefully
                    and was well acquainted with its contents. Victor Hugo in a powerful critical
                    passage strongly supports this view. The most striking single proof of the point
                    is Gonzalo’s ideal republic in the <hi rend="italic">Tempest,</hi> which is
                    simply a passage from Florio’s version turned into blank verse. Florio and
                    Shakespeare were both, moreover, intimate personal friends of the young earl of
                    Southampton, who, in harmony with his generous character and strong literary
                    tastes, was the munificent patron of each. Shakespeare, it will be remembered,
                    dedicated his <hi rend="italic">Venus and Adonis</hi> and his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lucrece</hi> to this young nobleman; and three years later, in 1598, Florio
                    dedicated the first edition of his Italian dictionary to the earl in terms that
                    almost recall Shakespeare’s words. Shakespeare had said in addressing the earl,
                    “What I have done is yours, what I have to do is yours, being part in all I have
                    devoted yours.” And Florio says, “In truth I acknowledge an entire debt, not
                    only of my best knowledge, but of all, yea of more than I know or can to your
                    bounteous lordship, most noble, most virtuous, and most honourable earl of
                    Southampton, in whose pay and patronage I have lived some years, to whom I owe
                    and vow the years I have to live.” Shakespeare was also familiar with Florio’s
                    earlier works, his <hi rend="italic">First Fruits</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Second Fruits,</hi> which were simply carefully prepared manuals for the
                    study of Italian, containing an outline of the grammar, a selection of dialogues
                    in parallel columns of Italian and English, and longer extracts from classical
                    Italian writers in prose and verse. We have collected various points of indirect
                    evidence showing Shakespeare’s familiarity with these manuals, but these being
                    numerous and minute cannot be given here. It must suffice to refer in
                    illustration of this point to a single instance—the lines in praise of Venice
                    which Holofernes gives forth with so much unction in <hi rend="italic">Love’s
                        Labour’s Lost.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">First Fruits</hi> was published in
                    1578, and was for some years the most popular manual for the study of Italian.
                    It is the book that Shakespeare would naturally have used in attempting to
                    acquire a knowledge of the language after his arrival in London; and on finding
                    that the author was the friend of some of his literary associates he would
                    probably have sought his acquaintance and secured his personal help. As Florio
                    was also a French scholar and habitually taught both languages, Shakespeare
                    probably owed to him his knowledge of French as well as of Italian. If the
                        sonnet<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n782/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0782-0757"/> is accepted as Shakespeare’s work he must
                    have made Florio’s acquaintance within a year or two after going to London, as
                    in 1591 he appears in the character of a personal friend and well-wisher. In any
                    case Shakespeare would almost certainly have met Florio a few years later at the
                    house of Lord Southampton, with whom the Italian scholar seems to have
                    occasionally resided. It also appears that he was in the habit of visiting at
                    several titled houses, amongst others those of the earl of Bedford and Sir John
                    Harrington. It seems also probable that he may have assisted Harrington in his
                    translation of Ariosto. Another and perhaps even more direct link connecting
                    Shakespeare with Florio during his early years in London is found in their
                    common relation to the family of Lord Derby. In the year 1585 Florio translated
                    a letter of news from Rome, giving an account of the sudden death of Pope
                    Gregory XIII. and the election of his successor. This translation, published in
                    July 1585, was dedicated “To the Right Excellent and Honourable Lord, Henry Earl
                    of Derby,” in terms expressive of Florio’s strong personal obligations to the
                    earl and devotion to his service. Three years later, on the death of Leicester
                    in 1588, Lord Derby’s eldest son Ferdinando Lord Strange became the patron of
                    Leicester’s company of players, which Shakespeare had recently joined. The new
                    patron must have taken special interest in the company, as they soon became
                    (chiefly through his influence) great favourites at court, superseding the
                    Queen’s players, and enjoying something like a practical monopoly of royal
                    representations. Shakespeare would thus have the opportunity of making Florio’s
                    acquaintance at the outset of his London career, and everything tends to show
                    that he did not miss the chance of numbering amongst his personal friends so
                    accomplished a scholar, so alert, energetic, and original a man of letters, as
                    the resolute John Florio. Warburton, it is well-known, had coupled Florio’s name
                    with Shakespeare in the last century. He suggested, or rather asserted, that
                    Florio was the original of Holofernes in <hi rend="italic">Lovés Labour's
                        Lost.</hi> Of all Warburton’s arbitrary conjectures and dogmatic assumptions
                    this is perhaps the most infelicitous. That a scholar and man of the world like
                    Florio, with marked literary powers of his own, the intimate friend and
                    associate of some of the most eminent poets of the day, living in princely and
                    noble circles, honoured by royal personages and welcomed at noble houses,—that
                    such a man should be selected as the original of a rustic pedant and dominie
                    like Holofernes, is surely the climax of reckless guesswork and absurd
                    suggestion. There is, it is true, a distant connexion between Holofernes and
                    Italy—the pedant being a well-known figure in the Italian comedies that
                    obviously affected Shakespeare’s early work. This usage calls forth a kind of
                    sigh from the easy-going and tolerant Montaigne as he thinks of his early tutors
                    and youthful interest in knowledge. “I have in my youth,” he tells us,
                    “oftentimes been vexed to see a pedant brought in in most of Italian comedies
                    for a vice or sport-maker, and the nickname of magister (dominie) to be of no
                    better signification amongst us.” We may be sure that, if Shakespeare knew
                    Florio before he produced <hi rend="italic">Lovés Labour's Lost,</hi> it was not
                    as a sport-maker to be mocked at, but as a friend and literary associate to whom
                    he felt personally indebted.</p>
                <p>But, whatever his actual relation to the Italian scholar may have been,
                    Shakespeare, on reaching London and beginning to breathe its literary
                    atmosphere, would naturally betake himself to the study of Italian. At various
                    altitudes the English Parnassus was at that time fanned by soft airs, swept by
                    invigorating breezes, or darkened by gloomy and infected vapours from the south.
                    In other words, the influence of Italian literature, so dominant in England
                    during the second half of the 16th century, may be said to have reached its
                    highest point at the very time when Shakespeare entered on his poetic and
                    dramatic labours. This influence was in part a revival of the strong impulse
                    communicated to English literature from Italy in Chaucer’s day. The note of the
                    revival was struck in the title of Thomas’s excellent Italian manual, “Principal
                    rules of Italian grammar, with a dictionarie for the better understanding of <hi
                        rend="italic">Boccace, Petrarcha,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dante"</hi>
                    (1550). The first fruits of the revival were the lyrical poems of Surrey and
                    Wyatt, written somewhat earlier, but published for the first time in Tottle’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Miscellany</hi> (1557). The sonnets of these poets—the
                    first ever written in English—produced in a few years the whole musical choir of
                    Elizabethan sonneteers. Surrey and Wyatt were sympathetic students of Petrarch,
                    and, as Puttenham says, reproduced in their sonnets and love poems much of the
                    musical sweetness, the tender and refined sentiment, of the Petrarchian lyric.
                    This perhaps can hardly in strictness of speech be called a revival, for, strong
                    as was the influence of Boccaccio, and in a less degree of Dante, during the
                    first period of English literature, the lyrical poetry of the south, as
                    represented by Petrarch, affected English poetry almost for the first time in
                    the 16th century. This influence, as subsequently developed by Lyly in his prose
                    comedies and romances, indirectly affected the drama, and clear traces of it are
                    to be found in Shakespeare’s own work. Surrey, however, rendered the
                    Elizabethans a still greater service by introducing from Italy the unrhymed
                    verse, which, with the truest instinct, was adopted by the great dramatists as
                    the metrical vehicle best fitted to meet the requirements of the most flexible
                    and expressive form of the poetic art. But, although in part the revival of a
                    previous impulse, the Italian literature that most powerfully affected English
                    poetry during the Elizabethan period was in the main new. During the interval
                    the prolific genius of the south had put forth fresh efforts which combined, in
                    new and characteristic products, the forms of classical poetry and the substance
                    of southern thought and feeling with the spirit of mediaeval romance. The
                    chivalrous and martial epics of Ariosto and Tasso represented a new school of
                    poetry which embraced within its expanding range every department of imaginative
                    activity. There appeared in rapid succession romantic pastorals, romantic
                    elegies, romantic satires, and romantic dramas, as well as romantic epics. The
                    epics were occupied with marvels of knightly daring and chivalrous adventure,
                    expressed in flowing and melodious numbers; while the literature as a whole
                    dealt largely in the favourite elements of ideal sentiment, learned allusion,
                    and elaborate ornament, and was brightened at intervals by grave and sportive,
                    by highly wrought but fanciful, pictures of courtly and Arcadian life. While
                    Sidney and Spenser represented in England the new school of allegorical and
                    romantic pastoral and epic, Shakespeare and his associates betook themselves to
                    the study of the romantic drama and the whole dramatic element in recent and
                    contemporary southern literature. The Italian drama proper, so far as it
                    affected the form adopted by English playwrights, had indeed virtually done its
                    work before any of Shakespeare’s characteristic pieces were produced. His
                    immediate predecessors, Greene, Peele, and Lodge, Nash, Kyd, and Marlowe, had
                    all probably studied Italian models more carefully than Shakespeare himself ever
                    did; and the result is seen in the appearance among these later Elizabethans of
                    the romantic drama, which united the better elements of the English academic and
                    popular plays with features of diction and fancy, incident and structure, that
                    were virtually new. Many members of this dramatic group were, like Greene, good
                    Italian scholars, had themselves travelled in Italy, knew the Italian stage at
                        first<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n783/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0783-0758"/> hand, and, as their writings show, were well
                    acquainted with recent Italian literature. But the dramatic element in that
                    literature extended far beyond the circle of regular plays, whether tragedies,
                    comedies, or pastorals. It included the collections of short prose stories which
                    appeared, or were published for the first time, in such numbers during the 16th
                    century, the novels or novelettes of Ser Giovanni, Cinthio, Bandello, and their
                    associates. These stories, consisting of the humorous and tragic incidents of
                    actual life, told in a vivid and direct way, naturally attracted the attention
                    of the dramatists. We know from the result that Shakespeare must have studied
                    them with some care, as he derived from this source the plots and incidents of
                    at least a dozen of his plays. Many of the stories, it is true, had already been
                    translated, either directly from the Italian, or indirectly from French and
                    Latin versions. Of Cinthio’s hundred tales, however, only two or three are known
                    to have been rendered into English; and Shakespeare derived the story of Othello
                    from the untranslated part of this collection. Many of the Italian stories
                    touched on darker crimes or more aggravated forms of violence than those
                    naturally prompted by jealousy and revenge, and are indeed revolting from the
                    atrocities of savage cruelty and lust related so calmly as to betray a kind of
                    cynical insensibility to their true character. Shakespeare, however, with the
                    sound judgment and strong ethical sense that guided the working of his dramatic
                    genius, chose the better and healthier materials of this literature, leaving the
                    morbid excesses of criminal passion to Webster and Ford. But the Italian
                    influence on Shakespeare’s work is not to be estimated merely by the outlines of
                    plot and incident ho borrowed from southern sources and used as a kind of canvas
                    for his matchless portraiture of human character and action. It is apparent also
                    in points of structure and diction, in types of character and shades of local
                    colouring, which realize and express in a concentrated form the bright and
                    lurid, the brilliant and passionate, features of southern life. The great
                    majority of the <hi rend="italic">dramatis personne</hi> in his comedies, as
                    well as in some of the tragedies, have Italian names, and many of them, such as
                    Mercutio and Gratiano on the one hand, Iachimo and Iago on the other, are as
                    Italian in nature as in name. The moonlight scene in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Merchant of Venice</hi> is Southern in every detail and incident. And, as
                    M. Philarète Chasles justly points out, <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet</hi>
                    is Italian throughout, alike in colouring, incident, and passion. The
                    distinctive influence is further traceable in Shakespeare’s use of Italian
                    words, phrases, and proverbs, some of which, such as “tranect” (from <hi
                        rend="italic">tranare),</hi> or possibly, as Rowe suggested, “traject” <hi
                        rend="italic">(traghetto),</hi> are of special local significance. In the
                    person of Hamlet Shakespeare even appears as a critic of Italian style.
                    Referring to the murderer who in the players’ tragedy poisons the sleeping duke,
                    Hamlet exclaims, “He poisons him in the garden for his estate. His name’s
                    Gonzago: the story is extant and written in very choice Italian.” In further
                    illustration of this point Mr Grant White has noted some striking turns of
                    thought and phrase which seem to show that Shakespeare must have read parts of
                    Berni and Ariosto in the original. No doubt in the case of Italian poets, as in
                    the case of Latin authors like Ovid, whose works he was familiar with in the
                    original, Shakespeare would also diligently read the translations, especially
                    the translations into English verse. For in reading such works as Golding’s
                    Ovid, Harrington’s Ariosto, and Fairfax’s Tasso, he would be increasing his
                    command over the elements of expressive phrase and diction which were the verbal
                    instruments, the material vehicle, of his art. But, besides studying the
                    translations of the Italian poets and prose writers made available for English
                    readers, he would naturally desire to possess, and no doubt acquired for
                    himself, the key that would unlock the whole treasure-house of Italian
                    literature. The evidence of Shakespeare’s knowledge of French is more abundant
                    and decisive, so much so as hardly to need express illustration. There can be
                    little doubt therefore that, during his early years in London, ho acquired a
                    fair knowledge both of French and Italian.</p>
                <p>But, while pursuing these collateral aids to his higher work, there is abundant
                    evidence that Shakespeare also devoted himself to that work itself. As early as
                    1592 he is publicly recognized, not only as an actor of distinction, but as a
                    dramatist whose work had excited the envy and indignation of his contemporaries,
                    and especially of one so accomplished and so eminent, so good a scholar and
                    master of the playwright’s craft, as Robert Greene. Greene had, it is true, a
                    good deal of the irritability and excitable temper often found in the
                    subordinate ranks of poetical genius, and he often talks of himself, his doings,
                    and associates in a highly-coloured and extravagant way. But his reference to
                    Shakespeare is specially deliberate, being in the form of a solemn and last
                    appeal to his friends amongst the scholarly dramatists to relinquish their
                    connexion with the presumptuous and ungrateful stage. In his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Groatsworth of Wit,</hi> published by his friend Chettle a few weeks after
                    his death, Greene urges three of his friends, apparently Marlowe, Lodge, and
                    Peele, to give up writing for the players. “Base-minded men, all three of you,
                    if by my misery ye be not warned; for unto none of you like me sought those burs
                    to cleave; those puppets, I mean, who speak from our mouths, those anticks
                    garnisht in our colours. Is it not strange that I, to whom they have all been
                    beholding; is it not like that you, to whom they have all been beholding, shall
                    (were ye in that case that I am now) be both of them at once forsaken? Yes,
                    trust them not <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> there is an upstart Crow, beautified
                    in our feathers, that, with his <hi rend="italic">tiger’s heart wrapt in a
                        player’s hide,</hi> supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse
                    as the best of you, and, being an absolute <hi rend="italic">Johannes fac
                        totum,</hi> is, in his own conceit, the only Shakescene in a country. Oh
                    that I might intreat your rare wits to be employed in more profitable courses,
                    and let these apes imitate your past excellence, and never more acquaint them
                    with your admired inventions.” This curious passage tells us indirectly a good
                    deal about Shakespeare. It bears decisive testimony to his assured position and
                    rapid advance in his profession. The very term of reproach applied to him,
                    “Johannes Factotum,” is a tribute to Shakespeare’s industry and practical
                    ability. From the beginning of his career he must have been in the widest and
                    best sense a utility man, ready to do any work connected with the theatre and
                    stage, and eminently successful in anything he undertook. In the first instance
                    he had evidently made his mark as an actor, as it is in that character he is
                    referred to by Greene, and denounced for going beyond his province and usurping
                    the functions of the dramatist. Greene’s words imply that Shakespeare not only
                    held a foremost place as an actor, but that ho was already distinguished by his
                    dramatic success in revising and rewriting existing plays. This is confirmed by
                    the parodied line from the <hi rend="italic">Third Part of Henry VI.,</hi>
                    recently revised if not originally written by Shakespeare. This must have been
                    produced before Greene’s death, which took place in September 1592. Indeed, all
                    the three parts of <hi rend="italic">Henry VI.</hi> in the revised form appear
                    to have been acted during the spring and summer of that year. It is not
                    improbable that two or three of Shakespeare’s early comedies may also have been
                    produced before Greene’s death. And if so, his resentment, ns an academic
                    scholar, against the country actor who had not<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n784/mode/1up"

                    Greene himself in his chosen field of romantic comedy becomes intelligible
                    enough. Even in his wrath, however, Greene bears eloquent witness to
                    Shakespeare’s diligence, ability, and marked success, both as actor and
                    playwright. All this is fully confirmed by the more deliberate and detailed
                    language of Chettle’s apology, already quoted. Of Shakespeare’s amazing industry
                    and conspicuous success the next few years supply ample evidence. Within six or
                    seven years he not only produced the brilliant reflective and descriptive poems
                    of <hi rend="italic">Venus and Adonis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lucrece,</hi>
                    but at least fifteen of his dramas, including tragedies, comedies, and
                    historical plays. Having found his true vocation, Shakespeare works during these
                    years as a master, having full command over the materials and resources of his
                    art. The dramas produced have a fulness of life and a richness of imagery, a
                    sense of joyousness and power, that speak of the writer’s exultant absorption
                    and conscious triumph in his chosen work. The sparkling comedies and great
                    historical plays belonging to this period evince the ease and delight of an
                    exuberant mind realizing its matured creations.</p>
                <p>Nor after all is this result so very surprising. Shakespeare entered on his
                    London career at the very moment best fitted for the full development of his
                    dramatic genius. From the accession of Elizabeth all the dominant impulses and
                    leading events of her reign had prepared the way for the splendid triumph of
                    policy and arms that closed its third decade, and for the yet more splendid
                    literary triumph of the full-orbed drama that followed. After the gloom and
                    terror of Mary’s reign the coming of Elizabeth to the crown was hailed with
                    exultation by the people, and seemed in itself to open a new and brighter page
                    of the nation’s history. Elizabeth’s personal charms and mental gifts, her high
                    spirit and dauntless courage, her unfailing political tact and judgment, her
                    frank bearing and popular address, combined with her unaffected love for her
                    people and devotion to their interests, awakened the strongest feelings of
                    personal loyalty, and kindled into passionate ardour the spirit of national
                    pride and patriotism that made the whole kingdom one. The most powerful
                    movements of the time directly tended to reinforce and concentrate these
                    awakened energies. While the Reformation and Renaissance impulses had
                    liberalized men’s minds and enlarged their moral horizon, the effect of both was
                    at first of a political and practical rather than of a purely religious or
                    literary kind. The strong and exhilarating sense of civil and religious freedom
                    realized through the Reformation was inseparably associated with the exultant
                    spirit of nationality it helped to stimulate and diffuse. The pope, and his
                    emissaries the Jesuits, were looked upon far more as foreign enemies menacing
                    the independence of the kingdom than as religious foes and firebrands seeking to
                    destroy the newly established faith. The conspiracies, fomented from abroad,
                    that gathered around the captive queen of Scots, the plots successively formed
                    for the assassination of Elizabeth, were regarded as murderous assaults on the
                    nation’s life, and the Englishmen who organized them abroad or aided them at
                    home were denounced and prosecuted with pitiless severity as traitors to their
                    country. Protestantism thus came to be largely identified with patriotism, and
                    all the active forces of the kingdom, its rising wealth, energy, and
                    intelligence, were concentrated to defend the rights of the liberated empire
                    against the assaults of despotic Europe represented by Rome and Spain. These
                    forces gained volume and impetus as the nation was thrilled by the details of
                    Alva’s ruthless butcheries, and the awful massacre of St Bartholomew, until at
                    length they were organized and hurled with resistless effect against the
                    grandest naval and military armament ever equipped by a Continental power,—an
                    armament that had been sent forth with the assurance of victory by the
                    wealthiest, most absolute, and most determined monarch of the time. There was a
                    vigorous moral element in that national struggle and triumph. It was the spirit
                    of freedom, of the energies liberated by the revolt from Rome, and illuminated
                    by the fair humanities of Greece and Italy, that nerved the arm of that happy
                    breed of men in the day of battle, and enabled them to strike with fatal effect
                    against the abettors of despotic rule in church and state. The material results
                    of the victory were at once apparent. England became mistress of the seas, and
                    rose to an assured position in Europe as a political and maritime power of the
                    first order. The literary results at home were equally striking. The whole
                    conflict reacted powerfully on the genius of the race, quickening into life its
                    latent seeds of reflective knowledge and wisdom, of poetical and dramatic
                    art.</p>
                <p>Of these effects the rapid growth and development of the national drama was the
                    most brilliant and characteristic. There was indeed at the time a unique
                    stimulus in this direction. The greater number of the eager excited listeners
                    who crowded the rude theatres from floor to roof had shared in the adventurous
                    exploits of the age, while all felt the keenest interest in life and action. And
                    the stage represented with admirable breadth and fidelity the struggling forces,
                    the mingled elements, humorous and tragic, the passionate hopes, deep-rooted
                    animosities, and fitful misgivings of those eventful years. The spirit of the
                    time had made personal daring a common heritage: with noble and commoner, gentle
                    and simple, alike, love of queen and country was a romantic passion, and heroic
                    self-devotion at the call of either a beaten way of ordinary life. To act with
                    energy and decision in the face of danger, to strike at once against any odds in
                    the cause of freedom and independence, was the desire and ambition of all. This
                    complete unity of national sentiment and action became the great characteristic
                    of the time. The dangers threatening the newly liberated kingdom were too real
                    and pressing to admit of anything like seriously divided councils, or bitterly
                    hostile parties within the realm. Everything thus conspired to give an
                    extraordinary degree of concentration and brilliancy to the national life. For
                    the twenty years that followed the destruction of the Armada London was the
                    centre and focus of that life. Here gathered the soldiers and officers who had
                    fought against Spain in the Low Countries, against France in Scotland, and
                    against Rome in Ireland. Along the river side, and in noble houses about the
                    Strand, were the hardy mariners and adventurous sea captains, such as Drake,
                    Hawkins, and Frobisher, who had driven their dauntless keels into unknown seas,
                    who had visited strange lands and alien races in order to enlarge the knowledge,
                    increase the dominions, and augment the wealth of their fellow-countrymen. Here
                    assembled the noble councillors, scholars, and cavaliers whose foresight and
                    skill guided the helm of state, whose accomplishment in letters and arms gave
                    refinement and distinction to court pageants and ceremonials, and whose
                    patronage and support of the rising drama helped to make the metropolitan
                    theatre the great centre of genius and art, the great school of historical
                    teaching, the great mirror of human nature in all the breadth and emphasis of
                    its interests, convictions, and activities. The theatre was indeed the living
                    organ through which all the marvellous and mingled experiences of a time
                    incomparably rich in vital elements found expression. There was no other, no
                    organized or adequate means, of popular expression at all. Books were a
                        solitary<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n785/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0785-0760"/> entertainment in the hands of few; newspapers
                    did not exist; and the modern relief of incessant public meetings was,
                    fortunately perhaps, an unknown luxury. And yet, amidst the plenitude of
                    national life centred in London, the need for some common organ of expression
                    was never more urgent or imperious. New and almost inexhaustible springs from
                    the well-heads of intellectual life had for years been gradually fertilizing the
                    productive English mind. The heroic life of the past, in clear outline and
                    stately movement, had been revealed in the recovered masterpieces of Greece and
                    Rome. The stores of more recent wisdom and knowledge, discovery and invention,
                    science and art, were poured continually into the literary exchequer of the
                    nation, and widely diffused amongst eager and open-minded recipients. Under this
                    combined stimulus the national intellect and imagination had already reacted
                    fruitfully in ways that were full of higher promise. The material results of
                    these newly awakened energies were, as we have seen, not less signal or
                    momentous. The number, variety, and power of the new forces thus acting on
                    society effected in a short period a complete moral revolution. The barriers
                    against the spread of knowledge and the spirit of free inquiry erected and long
                    maintained by mediaeval ignorance and prejudice were now thrown down. The bonds
                    of feudal authority and Romish domination that had hitherto forcibly repressed
                    the expanding national life were effectually broken. Men opened their eyes upon
                    a new world which it was an absorbing interest and endless delight to explore,
                    —a new world physically, where the old geographical limits had melted into the
                    blue haze of distant horizons—a new world morally, where the abolition of alien
                    dogma and priestly rule gave free play to fresh and vigorous social energies;
                    and, above all, more surprising and mysterious than all, they opened their eyes
                    with a strange sense of wonder and exultation on the new world of the
                    emancipated human spirit. At no previous period had the popular curiosity about
                    human life and human affairs been so vivid and intense. In an age of deeds so
                    memorable, man naturally became the centre of interest, and the whole world of
                    human action and passion, character and conduct, was invested with irresistible
                    attraction. All ranks and classes had the keenest desire to penetrate the
                    mysterious depths, explore the unknown regions, and realize as fully as might be
                    the actual achievements and ideal possibilities of the nature throbbing with so
                    full a pulse within themselves and reflected so powerfully in the world around
                    them. Human nature, released from the oppression and darkness of the ages, and
                    emerging with all its infinite faculties and latent powers into the radiant
                    light of a secular day, was the new world that excited an admiration more
                    profound and hopes far more ardent than any recently discovered lands beyond the
                    sinking sun. At the critical moment Shakespeare appeared as the Columbus of that
                    new world. Pioneers had indeed gone before and in a measure prepared the way,
                    but Shakespeare still remains the great discoverer, occupying a position of
                    almost lonely grandeur in the isolation and completeness of his work.</p>
                <p>Never before, except perhaps in the Athens of Pericles, had all the elements and
                    conditions of a great national drama met in such perfect union. As we have seen,
                    the popular conditions supplied by the stir of great public events and the
                    stimulus of an appreciative audience were present in exceptional force. With
                    regard to the stage conditions,— the means of adequate dramatic
                    representation,—public theatres had for the first time been recently established
                    in London on a permanent basis. In 1574 a royal licence had been granted by the
                    queen to the earl of Leicester’s company “to use, exercise, and occupy the art
                    and faculty of playing Comedies, Tragedies, Interludes, and Stage Plays, and
                    such other like as they have been already used and studied, as well for the
                    recreation of our loving subjects as for our solace and pleasure when we shall
                    think good to see them”; and, although the civil authorities resisted the
                    attempt to establish a public theatre within the city, two or three were
                    speedily erected just outside its boundaries, in the most convenient and
                    accessible suburbs,—the Curtain and the Theatre in Shoreditch, beyond the
                    northern boundary, and the Blackfriars theatre within the precincts of the
                    dissolved monastery, just beyond the civic jurisdiction on the western side. A
                    few years later other houses were built on the southern side of the river,—the
                    Rose near the foot of London Bridge, and the Hope and Swan further afield. There
                    was also at Newington Butts a place of recreation and entertainment for the
                    archers and holiday people, with a central building which, like the circus at
                    Paris Garden, was used during the summer months for dramatic purposes. These
                    theatres were occupied by different companies in turn, and Shakespeare during
                    his early years in London appears to have acted at several of them. But from his
                    first coming up it seems clear that he was more identified with the earl of
                    Leicester’s players, of whom his energetic fellow townsman, James Burbage, was
                    the head, than with any other group of actors. To Burbage indeed belongs the
                    distinction of having first established public theatres as a characteristic
                    feature of metropolitan life. His spirit and enterprise first relieved the
                    leading companies from the stigma of being strolling players, and transferred
                    their dramatic exhibitions, hitherto restricted to temporary scaffolds in the
                    court-yards of inns and hostelries, to the more reputable stage and convenient
                    appliances of a permanent theatre. In 1575 Burbage, having secured the lease of
                    a piece of land at Shoreditch, erected there the house which proved so
                    successful, and was known for twenty years as <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                    Theatre, from the fact that it was the first ever erected in the metropolis. He
                    seems also to have been concerned in the erection of a second theatre in the
                    same locality called the Curtain; and later on, in spite of many difficulties,
                    and a great deal of local opposition, he provided the more celebrated home of
                    the rising drama known as the Blackfriars theatre. When Shakespeare went to
                    London there were thus theatres on both sides of the water—the outlying houses
                    being chiefly used during the summer and autumn months, while the Blackfriars,
                    being roofed in and protected from the weather, was specially used for
                    performances during the winter season. In spite of the persistent opposition of
                    the lord mayor and city aldermen, the denunciations of Puritan preachers and
                    their allies in the press, and difficulties arising from intermittent attacks of
                    the plague and the occasional intervention of the court authorities, the
                    theatres had now taken firm root in the metropolis; and, strong in royal favour,
                    in noble patronage, and above all in popular support, the stage had already
                    begun to assume its higher functions as the living organ of the national voice,
                    the many-coloured mirror and reflexion of the national life. A few years later
                    the companies of players and the theatres they occupied were consolidated and
                    placed on a still firmer public basis. For some years past, in addition to the
                    actors really or nominally attached to noble houses, there had existed a body of
                    twelve performers, selected by royal authority (in 1583) from different
                    companies and known as the Queen’s players. The earl of Leicester’s, being the
                    leading company, had naturally furnished a number of recruits to the Queen’s
                    players, whose duty it was to act at special seasons before Her Majesty and the
                    court. But within a few years after Shakespeare arrived in London the chief<pb

                    companies, specially licensed and belonging respectively to the Lord Chamberlain
                    and the Lord Admiral. Under the new arrangement the earl of Leicester’s actors
                    (who, as already stated, after the earl’s death in 1588 found for a time a new

                    Lord Chamberlain. James Burbage had already retired from the company, his place
                    being taken by his more celebrated son Richard Burbage, the Garrick of the
                    Elizabethan stage, who acted with so much distinction and success all the great
                    parts in Shakespeare’s leading plays. In order that the Lord Chamberlain’s
                    company might have houses of their own both for summer and winter use, Richard
                    Burbage, his brother Cuthbert, and their associates, including Shakespeare,
                    undertook in 1599 to build a new theatre on the bank side, not far from the old
                    Paris Garden circus. We know from a subsequent document, which refers
                    incidentally to the building of this theatre, that the Burbages had originally
                    introduced Shakespeare to the Blackfriars company. He had indeed proved himself
                    so useful, both as actor and poet, that they were evidently glad to secure his
                    future services by giving him a share as part proprietor in the Blackfriars
                    property. The new theatre now built by the company was that known as the Globe,
                    and it was for fifteen years, during the summer and autumn months, the popular
                    and highly successful home of the Shakespearian drama. Three years earlier
                    Richard Burbage and his associates had rebuilt the Blackfriars theatre on a more
                    extended scale; and this well-known house divided with the Globe the honour of
                    producing Shakespeare’s later and more important plays. Shakespeare’s position
                    indeed of actor and dramatist is identified with these houses and with the Lord
                    Chamberlain’s company to which they belonged. On the accession of James I., this
                    company, being specially favoured by the new monarch, received a fresh royal
                    charter, and the members of it were henceforth known as the King’s servants. In
                    the early years of Shakespeare’s career the national drama had thus a permanent
                    home in theatres conveniently central on either side of the river, and crowded
                    during the summer and winter months by eager and excited audiences. Even before
                    the building of the Globe, the house at Newington where three of Marlowe’s most
                    important plays and some of Shakespeare’s early tragedies were produced was
                    often crowded to the doors. In the summer of 1592, when the <hi rend="italic"
                        >First Part of Henry VI.,</hi> as revised by Shakespeare, was acted, the
                    performance was so popular that, we are told by Nash, ten thousand spectators
                    witnessed it in the course of a few weeks. It is true that even in the best
                    theatres the appliances in the way of scenes and stage machinery were of the
                    simplest description, change of scene being often indicated by the primitive
                    device of a board with the name painted upon it. But players and playwrights,
                    both arts being often combined in the same person, knew their business
                    thoroughly well, and justly relied for success on the more vital attractions of
                    powerful acting, vigorous writing, and practised skill in the construction of
                    their pieces. In the presence of strong passions expressed in kindling words and
                    powerfully realized in living action, gesture, and incident, the absence of
                    canvas sunlight and painted gloom was hardly felt. Or, as the stirring choruses
                    in <hi rend="italic">Henry V.</hi> show, the want of more elaborate and
                    realistic scenery was abundantly supplied by the excited fancy, active
                    imagination, and concentrated interest of the spectators.</p>
                <p>The dramatic conditions of a national theatre were indeed, at the outset of
                    Shakespeare’s career, more complete, or rather in a more advanced state of
                    development, than the playhouses themselves or their stage accessories. If
                    Shakespeare was fortunate in entering on his London work amidst the full tide of
                    awakened patriotism and public spirit, he was equally fortunate in finding ready
                    to his hand the forms of art in which the rich and complex life of the time
                    could be adequately expressed. During the decade in which Shakespeare left
                    Stratford the playwright’s art had undergone changes so important as to
                    constitute a revolution in the form and spirit of the national drama. For twenty
                    years after the accession of Elizabeth the two roots whence the English drama
                    sprung—the academic or classical, and the popular, developed spontaneously in
                    the line of mysteries, moralities, and interludes—continued to exist apart, and
                    to produce their accustomed fruit independently of each other. The popular
                    drama, it is true, becoming more secular and realistic, enlarged its area by
                    collecting its materials from all sources,—from novels, tales, ballads, and
                    histories, as well as from fairy mythology, local superstitions, and folklore.
                    But the incongruous materials were, for the most part, handled in a crude and
                    semi-barbarous way, with just sufficient art to satisfy the cravings and
                    clamours of unlettered audiences. The academic plays, on the other hand, were
                    written by scholars for courtly and cultivated circles, were acted at the
                    universities, the inns of court, and at special public ceremonials, and followed
                    for the most part the recognized and restricted rules of the classic drama. But
                    in the third decade of Elizabeth’s reign another dramatic school arose
                    intermediate between the two elder ones, which sought to combine in a newer and
                    higher form the best elements of both. The main impulse guiding the efforts of
                    the new school may be traced indirectly to a classical source. It was due, not
                    immediately to the masterpieces of Greece and Rome, but to the form which
                    classical art had assumed in the contemporary drama of Italy, France, and Spain,
                    especially of Italy, which was that earliest developed and best known to the new
                    school of poets and dramatists. This southern drama, while academic in its
                    leading features, had nevertheless modern elements blended with the ancient
                    form. As the Italian epics, following in the main the older examples, were still
                    charged with romantic and realistic elements unknown to the classical epic, so
                    the Italian drama, constructed on the lines of Seneca and Plautus, blended with
                    the severer form essentially romantic features. With the choice of heroic
                    subjects, the orderly development of the plot, the free use of the chorus, the
                    observance of the unities, and constant substitution of narrative for action
                    were united the vivid colouring of poetic fancy and diction, and the use of
                    materials and incidents derived from recent history and contemporary life. The
                    influence of the Italian drama on the new school of English playwrights was,
                    however, very much restricted to points of style and diction of rhetorical and
                    poetical effect. It helped to produce among them the sense of artistic
                    treatment, the conscious effort after higher and more elaborate forms and
                    vehicles of imaginative and passionate expression. For the rest, the rising
                    English drama, in spite of the efforts made by academic critics to narrow its
                    range and limit its interests, retained and thoroughly vindicated its freedom
                    and independence. The central characteristics of the new school are sufficiently
                    explained by the fact that its leading representatives were all of them scholars
                    and poets, living by their wits and gaining a somewhat precarious livelihood
                    amidst the stir and bustle, the temptations and excitement, of concentrated
                    London life. The distinctive note of their work is the reflex of<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0787-0762"/> their position as academic scholars working
                    under poetic and popular impulses for the public theatres. The new and striking
                    combination in their dramas of elements hitherto wholly separated is but the
                    natural result of their attainments and literary activities. From their
                    university training and knowledge of the ancients they would be familiar with
                    the technical requirements of dramatic art, the deliberate handling of plot,
                    incident, and character, and the due subordination of parts essential for
                    producing the effect of an artistic whole. Their imaginative and emotional
                    sensibility, stimulated by their studies in Southern literature, would naturally
                    prompt them to combine features of poetic beauty and rhetorical finish with the
                    evolution of character and action; while from the popular native drama they
                    derived the breadth of sympathy, sense of humour, and vivid contact with actual
                    life which gave reality and power to their representations.</p>
                <p>The leading members of this group or school were Kyd, Greene, Lodge, Nash, Peele,
                    and Marlowe, of whom, in relation to the future development of the drama,
                    Greene, Peele, and Marlowe are the most important and influential. They were
                    almost the first poets and men of genius who devoted themselves to the
                    production of dramatic pieces for the public theatres. But they all helped to
                    redeem the common stages from the reproach their rude and boisterous pieces had
                    brought upon them, and make the plays represented poetical and artistic as well
                    as lively, bustling, and popular. Some did this rather from a necessity of
                    nature and stress of circumstance than from any higher aim or deliberately
                    formed resolve. But Marlowe, the greatest of them, avowed the redemption of the
                    common stage as the settled purpose of his labours at the outset of his dramatic
                    career. And during his brief and stormy life he nobly discharged the
                    self-imposed task. His first play, <hi rend="italic">Tamburline the Great,</hi>
                    struck the authentic note of artistic and romantic tragedy. With all its
                    extravagance, and over-straining after vocal and rhetorical effects, the play
                    throbs with true passion and true poetry, and has throughout the stamp of
                    emotional intensity and intellectual power. His later tragedies, while marked by
                    the same features, bring into fuller relief the higher characteristics of his
                    passionate and poetical genius. Alike in the choice of subject and method of
                    treatment Marlowe is thoroughly independent, deriving little, except in the way
                    of general stimulus, either from the classical or popular drama of his day. The
                    signal and far-reaching reform he effected in dramatic metre by the introduction
                    of modulated blank verse illustrates the striking originality of his genius.
                    Gifted with a fine ear for the music of English numbers, and impatient of “the
                    gigging veins of rhyming mother wits,” he introduced the noble metre which was
                    at once adopted by his contemporaries and became the vehicle of the great
                    Elizabethan drama. The new metre quickly abolished the rhyming couplets and
                    stanzas that had hitherto prevailed on the popular stage. The rapidity and
                    completeness of this metrical revolution is in itself a powerful tribute to
                    Marlowe’s rare insight and feeling as a master of musical expression. The
                    originality and importance of Marlowe’s innovation are not materially affected
                    by the fact that one or two classical plays, such as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gorboduc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jocasta,</hi> had been already written
                    in unrhymed verse. In any case these were private plays, and the monotony of
                    cadence and structure in the verse excludes them from anything like serious
                    comparison with the richness and variety of vocal effect produced by the skilful
                    pauses and musical interlinking of Marlowe’s heroic metre. Greene and Peele did
                    almost as much for romantic comedy as Marlowe had done for romantic tragedy.
                    Greene’s ease and lightness of touch, his freshness of feeling and play of
                    fancy, his vivid sense of the pathos and beauty of homely scenes and thorough
                    enjoyment of English rural life, give to his dramatic sketches the blended charm
                    of romance and reality hardly to be found elsewhere except in Shakespeare’s
                    early comedies. In special points of lyrical beauty and dramatic portraiture,
                    such as his sketches of pure and devoted women and of witty and amusing clowns,
                    Greene anticipated some of the more delightful and characteristic features of
                    Shakespearian comedy. Peele’s lighter pieces and Lyly’s prose comedies helped in
                    the same direction. Although not written for the public stage, Lyly’s court
                    comedies were very popular, and Shakespeare evidently gained from their light
                    and easy if somewhat artificial tone, their constant play of witty banter and
                    sparkling repartee, valuable hints for the prose of his own comedies. Marlowe
                    again prepared the way for another characteristic development of Shakespeare’s
                    dramatic art. His <hi rend="italic">Edward II.</hi> marks the rise of the
                    historical drama, as distinguished from the older chronicle play, in which the
                    annals of a reign or period were thrown into a series of loose and irregular
                    metrical scenes. Peele’s <hi rend="italic">Edward I.,</hi> Marlowe’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Edward II.,</hi> and the fine anonymous play of <hi
                        rend="italic">Edward III.,</hi> in which many critics think Shakespeare’s
                    hand may be traced, show how thoroughly the new school had felt the rising
                    national pulse, and how promptly it responded to the popular demand for the
                    dramatic treatment of history. The greatness of contemporary events had created
                    a new sense of the grandeur and continuity of the nation’s life, and excited
                    amongst all classes a vivid interest in the leading personalities and critical
                    struggles that had marked its progress. There was a strong and general feeling
                    in favour of historical subjects, and especially historical subjects having in
                    them elements of tragical depth and intensity. Shakespeare’s own early
                    plays—dealing with the distracted reign of King John, the Wars of the Roses, and
                    the tragical lives of Richard II. and Richard III.—illustrate this bent of
                    popular feeling. The demand being met by men of poetical and dramatic genius
                    reacted powerfully on the spirit of the age, helping in turn to illuminate and
                    strengthen its loyal and patriotic sympathies.</p>
                <p>This is in fact the key-note of the English stage in the great period of its
                    development. It was its breadth of national interest and intensity of tragic
                    power that made the English drama so immeasurably superior to every other
                    contemporary drama in Europe. The Italian drama languished because, though
                    carefully elaborated in point of form, it had no fulness of national life, no
                    common elements of ethical conviction or aspiration, to vitalize and ennoble it.
                    Even tragedy, in the hands of Italian dramatists, had no depth of human passion,
                    no energy of heroic purpose, to give higher meaning and power to its evolution.
                    In Spain the dominant courtly and ecclesiastical influences limited the
                    development of the national drama, while in France it remained from the outset
                    under the artificial restrictions of classical and pseudo-classical traditions.
                    Shakespeare’s predecessors and contemporaries, in elevating the common stages,
                    and filling them with poetry, music, and passion, had attracted to the theatre
                    all classes, including the more cultivated and refined; and the intelligent
                    interest, energetic patriotism, and robust life of so representative an English
                    audience supplied the strongest stimulus to the more perfect development of the
                    great organ of national expression. The forms of dramatic art, in the three main
                    departments of comedy, tragedy, and historical drama, had been, as we have seen,
                    clearly discriminated and evolved in their earlier stages. It was a moment of
                    supreme promise and expectation, and in the accidents of earth, or, as we may
                    more appropriately and J gratefully say, in the ordinances of heaven, the
                        supreme<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0788-0763"/> poet and dramatist appeared to more than
                    fulfil the utmost promise of the time. By right of imperial command over all the
                    resources of imaginative insight and expression Shakespeare combined the rich
                    dramatic materials already prepared into more perfect forms, and carried them to
                    the highest point of ideal development. He quickly surpassed Marlowe in passion,
                    music, and intellectual power; Greene in lyrical beauty, elegiac grace, and
                    narrative interest; Peele in picturesque touch and pastoral sweetness; and Lyly
                    in bright and sparkling dialogue. And having distanced the utmost efforts of his
                    predecessors and contemporaries he took his own higher way, and reigned to the
                    end without a rival in the new world of supreme dramatic art he had created. It
                    is a new world, because Shakespeare’s work alone can be said to possess the
                    organic strength and infinite variety, the throbbing fulness, vital complexity,
                    and breathing truth, of nature herself. In points of artistic resource and
                    technical ability—such as copious and expressive diction, freshness and
                    pregnancy of verbal combination, richly modulated verse, and structural skill in
                    the handling of incident and action—Shakespeare’s supremacy is indeed
                    sufficiently assured. But, after all, it is of course in the spirit and
                    substance of his work, his power of piercing to the hidden centres of character,
                    of touching the deepest springs of impulse and passion, out of which are the
                    issues of life, and of evolving those issues dramatically with a flawless
                    strength, subtlety, and truth, which raises him so immensely above and beyond
                    not only the best of the playwrights who went before him, but the whole line of
                    illustrious dramatists that came after him. It is Shakespeare’s unique
                    distinction that he has an absolute command over all the complexities of thought
                    and feeling that prompt to action and bring out the dividing lines of character.
                    He sweeps with the hand of a master the whole gamut of human experience, from
                    the lowest note to the very top of its compass, from the sportive childish
                    treble of Mamilius and the pleading boyish tones of Prince Arthur, up to the
                    spectre-haunted terrors of Macbeth, the tropical passion of Othello, the
                    agonized sense and tortured spirit of Hamlet, the sustained elemental grandeur,
                    the Titanic force and utterly tragical pathos, of Lear.</p>
                <p>Shakespeare’s active dramatic career in London lasted about twenty years, and may
                    be divided into three tolerably symmetrical periods. The first extends from the
                    year 1587 to about 1593-94; the second from this date to the end of the century;
                    and the third from 1600 to about 1608, soon after which time Shakespeare ceased
                    to write regularly for the stage, was less in London and more and more at
                    Stratford. Some modern critics add to these a fourth period, including the few
                    plays which from internal as well as external evidence must have been among the
                    poet’s latest productions. As the exact dates of these plays are unknown, this
                    period may be taken to extend from 1608 to about 1612. The three dramas produced
                    during these years are, however, hardly entitled to be ranked as a separate
                    period. They may rather be regarded as supplementary to the grand series of
                    dramas belonging to the third and greatest epoch of Shakespeare’s productive
                    power. To the first period belong Shakespeare’s early tentative efforts in
                    revising and partially rewriting plays produced by others that already had
                    possession of the stage. These efforts are illustrated in the three parts of <hi
                        rend="italic">Henry VI.,</hi> especially the second and third parts, which
                    bear decisive marks of Shakespeare’s hand, and were to a great extent recast and
                    rewritten by him. It is clear from the internal evidence thus supplied that
                    Shakespeare was at first powerfully affected by “Marlowe’s mighty line.” This
                    influence is so marked in the revised second and third parts of <hi
                        rend="italic">Henry VI.</hi> as to induce some critics to believe Marlowe
                    must have had a hand in the revision. These passages are, however, sufficiently
                    explained by the fact of Marlowe’s influence during the first period of
                    Shakespeare’s career. To the same period also belong the earliest tragedy, that
                    of <hi rend="italic">Titus Andronicus,</hi> and the three comedies— <hi
                        rend="italic">Love’s Labour ’s Lost, The Comedy of Errors,</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Two Gentlemen of Verona.</hi> These dramas are all marked by
                    the dominant literary influences of the time. They present features obviously
                    due to the revived and widespread knowledge of classical literature, as well as
                    to the active interest in the literature of Italy and the South. <hi
                        rend="italic">Titus Andronicus,</hi> in many of its characteristic features,
                    reflects the form of Roman tragedy almost universally accepted and followed in
                    the earlier period of the drama. This form was supplied by the Latin plays of
                    Seneca, their darker colours being deepened by the moral effect of the judicial
                    tragedies and military conflicts of the time. The execution of the Scottish
                    queen and the Catholic conspirators who had acted in her name, and the
                    destruction of the Spanish Armada, had given an impulse to tragic
                    representations of an extreme type. This was undoubtedly rather fostered than
                    otherwise by the favourite exemplars of Roman tragedy. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Medea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thyestes</hi> of Seneca are crowded with
                    pagan horrors of the most revolting kind. It is true these horrors are usually
                    related, not represented, although in the <hi rend="italic">Medea</hi> the
                    maddened heroine kills her children on the stage. But from these tragedies the
                    conception of the physically horrible as an element of tragedy was imported into
                    the early English drama, and intensified by the realistic tendency which the
                    events of the time and the taste of their ruder audiences had impressed upon the
                    common stages. This tendency is exemplified in <hi rend="italic">Titus
                        Andronicus,</hi> obviously a very early work, the signs of youthful effort
                    being apparent not only in the acceptance of so coarse a type of tragedy but in
                    the crude handling of character and motive, and the want of harmony in working
                    out the details of the dramatic conception. Kyd was the most popular
                    contemporary representative of the bloody school, and in the leading motives of
                    treachery, concealment, and revenge there are points of likeness between <hi
                        rend="italic">Titus Andronicus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Spanish
                        Tragedy.</hi> But how promptly and completely Shakespeare’s nobler nature
                    turned from this lower type is apparent from the fact that he not only never
                    reverted to it but indirectly ridicules the piled-up horrors and extravagant
                    language of Kyd’s plays.</p>
                <p>The early comedies in the same way are marked by the dominant literary influences
                    of the time, partly classic partly Italian. In the <hi rend="italic">Comedy of
                        Errors,</hi> for example, Shakespeare attempted a humorous play of the old
                    classical type, the general plan and many details being derived directly from
                    Plautus. In <hi rend="italic">Love’s Labour 's Lost</hi> many characteristic
                    features of Italian comedy are freely introduced: the pedant Holofernes, the
                    curate Sir Nathaniel, the fantastic braggadocio soldier Armado, are all
                    well-known characters of the contemporary Italian drama. Of this comedy, indeed,
                    Gervinus says, “the tone of the Italian school prevails here more than in any
                    other play. The redundance of wit is only to be compared with a similar
                    redundance of conceit in Shakespeare’s narrative poems, and with the Italian
                    style which he had early adopted.” These comedies display another sign of early
                    work in the mechanical exactness of the plan and a studied symmetry in the
                    grouping of the chief personages of the drama. In the <hi rend="italic">Two
                        Gentlemen of Verona,</hi> as Prof. Dowden points out, “Proteus the fickle is
                    set against Valentine the faithful, Silvia the light and intellectual against
                    Julia the ardent and tender, Lance the humourist against Speed the wit.” So in
                        <hi rend="italic">Love’s Labour ’s Lost,</hi> the king and his three
                        fellow-<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n789/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0789-0764"/> students balance the princess and her three
                    ladies, and there is a symmetrical play of incident between the two groups. The
                    arrangement is obviously more artificial than spontaneous, more mechanical than
                    vital and organic. But towards the close of the first period Shakespeare had
                    fully realized his own power and was able to dispense with these artificial
                    supports. Indeed, having rapidly gained knowledge and experience, he had before
                    the close written plays of a far higher character than any which even the ablest
                    of his contemporaries had produced. He had firmly laid the foundation of his
                    future fame in the direction both of comedy and tragedy, for, besides the
                    comedies already referred to, the first sketches of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hamlet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet,</hi> and the tragedy of
                        <hi rend="italic">Richard III.,</hi> may probably be referred to this
                    period.</p>
                <p>Another mark of early work belonging to these dramas is the lyrical and elegiac
                    tone and treatment associated with the use of rhyme, of rhyming couplets and
                    stanzas. Spenser’s musical verse had for the time elevated the character of
                    rhyming metres by identifying them with the highest kinds of poetry, and
                    Shakespeare was evidently at first affected by this powerful impulse. He rhymed
                    with great facility, and delighted in the gratification of his lyrical fancy and
                    feeling which the more musical rhyming metres afforded. Rhyme accordingly has a
                    considerable and not inappropriate place in the earlier romantic comedies. The
                        <hi rend="italic">Comedy of Errors</hi> has indeed been described as a kind
                    of lyrical farce in which the opposite qualities of elegiac beauty and comic
                    effect are happily blended. Rhyme, however, at this period of the poet’s work is
                    not restricted to the comedies. It is largely used in the tragedies and
                    histories as well, and plays even an important part in historical drama so late
                    as <hi rend="italic">Richard II.</hi> Shakespeare appears, however, to have
                    worked out this favourite vein, and very much taken leave of it, by the
                    publication of his descriptive and narrative poems, the <hi rend="italic">Venus
                        and Adonis</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Lucrece,</hi> although the
                    enormous popularity of these poems might almost have tempted him to return again
                    to the abandoned metrical form. The only considerable exception to the disuse of
                    rhyming metres and lyrical treatment is supplied by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sonnets,</hi> which, though not published till 1609, were probably begun
                    early, soon after the poems, and written at intervals during eight or ten of the
                    intervening years. Into the many vexed questions connected with the history and
                    meaning of these poems it is impossible to enter. The attempts recently made by
                    the Rev. W. A. Harrison and Mr T. Tyler to identify the “dark lady” of the later
                    sonnets, while of some historical interest, cannot be regarded as successful.
                    And the identification, even if rendered more probable by the discovery of fresh
                    evidence, would not clear up) the difficulties, biographical, literary, and
                    historical, connected with these exquisite poems. It is perhaps enough to say
                    with Prof. Dowden that in Shakespeare’s case the most natural interpretation is
                    the best, and that, so far as they throw light on his personal character, the
                    sonnets show that “he was capable of measureless personal devotion; that he was
                    tenderly sensitive, sensitive above all to every diminution or alteration of
                    that love his heart so eagerly craved; and that, when wronged, although he
                    suffered anguish, he transcended his private injury and learned to forgive.”</p>
                <p>Whatever question may be raised with regard to the superiority of some of the
                    plays belonging to the first period of Shakespeare’s dramatic career, there can
                    be no question at all as to any of the pieces belonging to the second period,
                    which extends to the end of the century. During these years Shakespeare works as
                    a master, having complete command over the materials and resources of the most
                    mature and flexible dramatic art. “To this stage,”</p>
                <p>says Mr Swinburne, “belongs the special faculty of faultless, joyous, facile
                    command upon each faculty required of the presiding genius for service or for
                    sport. It is in the middle period of his work that the language of Shakespeare
                    is most limpid in its fulness, the style most pure, the thought most transparent
                    through the close and luminous raiment of perfect expression.” This period
                    includes the magnificent series of historical plays— <hi rend="italic">Richard
                        II.,</hi> the two parts of <hi rend="italic">Henry IV.,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Henry V</hi>.—and a double series of brilliant comedies. The
                        <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Night's Dream, All's Well that ends Well,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Merchant of Venice</hi> were produced before 1598, and
                    during the next three years there appeared a still more complete and
                    characteristic group including <hi rend="italic">Much ado about Nothing, As you
                        Like it,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night.</hi> These comedies and
                    historical plays are all marked by a rare harmony of reflective and imaginative
                    insight, perfection of creative art, and completeness of dramatic effect. Before
                    the close of this period, in 1598, Francis Meres paid his celebrated tribute to
                    Shakespeare’s superiority in lyrical, descriptive, and dramatic poetry,
                    emphasizing his unrivalled distinction in the three main departments of the
                    drama,—comedy, tragedy, and historical play. And from this time onwards the
                    contemporary recognitions of Shakespeare’s eminence as a poet and dramatist
                    rapidly multiply, the critics and eulogists being in most cases well entitled to
                    speak with authority on the subject.</p>
                <p>In the third period of Shakespeare’s dramatic career years had evidently brought
                    enlarged vision, wider thoughts, and deeper experiences. While the old mastery
                    of art remains, the works belonging to this period seem to bear traces of more
                    intense moral struggles, larger and less joyous views of human life, more
                    troubled, complex, and profound conceptions and emotions. Comparatively few
                    marks of the lightness and animation of the earlier works remain, but at the
                    same time the dramas of this period display an unrivalled power of piercing the
                    deepest mysteries and sounding the most tremendous and perplexing problems of
                    human life and human destiny. To this period belong the four great tragedies—
                        <hi rend="italic">Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, Lear;</hi> the three Roman
                    plays— <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus, Julius Caesar, Anthony and Cleopatra</hi>;
                    the two singular plays whose scene and personages are Greek but whose action and
                    meaning are wider and deeper than either Greek or Roman life— <hi rend="italic"
                        >Troilus and Cressida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens;</hi> and
                    one comedy— <hi rend="italic">Measure for Measure,</hi> which is almost tragic
                    in the depth and intensity of its characters and incidents. The four great
                    tragedies represent the highest reach of Shakespeare’s dramatic power, and they
                    sufficiently illustrate the range and complexity of the deeper problems that now
                    occupied his mind. <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Measure
                        for Measure,</hi> however, exemplify the same tendency to brood with
                    meditative intensity over the wrongs and miseries that afflict humanity. These
                    works sufficiently prove that during this period Shakespeare gained a disturbing
                    insight into the deeper evils of the world, arising from the darker passions,
                    such as treachery and revenge. But it is also clear that, with the larger vision
                    of a noble, well-poised nature, he at the same time gained a fuller perception
                    of the deeper springs of goodness in human nature, of the great virtues of
                    invincible fidelity and unwearied love, and he evidently received not only
                    consolation and calm but new stimulus and power from the fuller realization of
                    these virtues. The typical plays of this period thus embody Shakespeare’s ripest
                    experience of the great issues of life. In the four grand tragedies the central
                    problem is a profoundly moral one. It is the supreme internal conflict of good
                    and evil amongst the central forces and higher elements of human nature, as
                    appealed to and developed by sudden and powerful temptation, smitten by
                        accumu-<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n790/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0790-0765"/> lated wrongs, or plunged in overwhelming
                    calamities. As the result, we learn that there is something infinitely more
                    precious in life than social ease or worldly success—nobleness of soul, fidelity
                    to truth and honour, human love and loyalty, strength and tenderness, and trust
                    to the very end. In the most tragic experiences this fidelity to all that is
                    best in life is only possible through the loss of life itself. But when
                    Desdemona expires with a sigh and Cordelia’s loving eyes are closed, when Hamlet
                    no more draws his breath in pain and the tempest-tossed Lear is at last
                    liberated from the rack of this tough world, we feel that, death having set his
                    sacred seal on their great sorrows and greater love, they remain with us as
                    possessions for ever. In the three dramas belonging to Shakespeare’s last
                    period, or rather which may be said to close his dramatic career, the same
                    feeling of severe but consolatory calm is still more apparent. If the deeper
                    discords of life are not finally resolved, the virtues which soothe their
                    perplexities and give us courage and endurance to wait, as well as confidence to
                    trust the final issues,—the virtues of forgiveness and generosity, of
                    forbearance and self-control,—are largely illustrated. This is a characteristic
                    feature in each of these closing dramas, in the <hi rend="italic">Winter’s Tale,
                        Cymbeline,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tempest.</hi> The <hi
                        rend="italic">Tempest</hi> is supposed, on tolerably good grounds, to be
                    Shakespeare’s last work, and in it we see the great magician, having gained by
                    the wonderful experience of life, and the no less wonderful practice of his art,
                    serene wisdom, clear and enlarged vision, and beneficent self-control, break his
                    magical wand and retire from the scene of his triumphs to the home he had chosen
                    amidst the woods and meadows of the Avon, and surrounded by the family and
                    friends he loved.</p>
                <p>We must now briefly summarize the few remaining facts of the poet’s personal
                    history. The year 1596 was marked by considerable family losses. In August
                    Shakespeare’s only son Hamnet died in the twelfth year of his age. With his
                    strong domestic affections and cherished hopes of founding a family, the early
                    death of his only boy must have been for his father a severe blow. It was
                    followed in December by the death of Shakespeare’s uncle Henry, the friend of
                    his childhood and youth, the protector and encourager of his boyish sports and
                    enterprises at Bearley, Snitterfield, and Fulbroke. A few months later the
                    Shakespeare household at Snitterfield, so intimately associated for more than
                    half a century with the family in Henley Street, was finally broken up by the
                    death of the poet’s aunt Margaret, his uncle Henry’s widow. Although the death
                    of his son and heir had diminished the poet’s hope of founding a family, he did
                    not in any way relax his efforts to secure a permanent and comfortable home for
                    his wife and daughters at Stratford. As early as 1597, when he had pursued his
                    London career for little more than ten years, he had saved enough to purchase
                    the considerable dwellinghouse in New Place, Stratford, to which he afterwards
                    retired. This house, originally built by Sir Hugh Clopton and called the “Great
                    House,” was one of the largest mansions in the town, and the fact of Shakespeare
                    having acquired such a place as his family residence would at once increase his
                    local importance. From time to time he made additional purchases of land about
                    the house and in the neighbourhood. In 1602 he largely increased the property by
                    acquiring 107 acres of arable land, and later on he added to this 20 acres of
                    pasture land, with a convenient cottage and garden in Chapel Lane, opposite the
                    lower grounds of the house. Within a few years his property thus comprised a
                    substantial dwelling-house with large garden and extensive outbuildings, a
                    cottage fronting the lower road, and about 137 acres of arable and pasture land.
                    During these years Shakespeare made another important purchase that added
                    considerably to his income. From the letter of a Stratford burgess to a friend
                    in London, it appears that as early as 1597 Shakespeare had been making inquiry
                    about the purchase of tithes in the town and neighbourhood. And in 1605 he
                    bought the unexpired lease of tithes, great and small, in Stratford and two
                    adjoining hamlets, the lease having still thirty years to run. This purchase
                    yielded him an annual income of &lt;£38 a year, equal to upwards of £350 a year
                    of our present money. The last purchase of property made by Shakespeare of which
                    we have any definite record is at once so interesting and so perplexing as to
                    have stimulated various conjectures on the part of his biographers. This
                    purchase carries us away from Stratford back to London, to the immediate
                    neighbourhood of Shakespeare’s dramatic labours and triumphs. It seems that in
                    March 1613 he bought a house with a piece of ground attached to it a little to
                    the south-west of St Paul’s cathedral, and not far from the Blackfriars theatre.
                    The purchase of this house in London after he had been for some years settled at
                    Stratford has led some critics to suppose that Shakespeare had not given up all
                    thought of returning to the metropolis, or at least of spending part of the year
                    there with his family in the neighbourhood he best knew and where he was best
                    known. The ground of this supposition is, however, a good deal destroyed by the
                    fact that soon after acquiring this town house Shakespeare let it for a lease of
                    ten years. He may possibly have bought the property as a convenience to some of
                    his old friends who were associated with him in the purchase. In view of future
                    contingencies it would obviously be an advantage to have a substantial dwelling
                    so near the theatre in the hands of a friend. It was indeed by means of a
                    similar purchase that James Burbage had originally started and established the
                    Blackfriars theatre.</p>
                <p>The year 1607-8 would be noted in Shakespeare’s family calendar as one of vivid
                    and chequered domestic experiences. On the 5th of June his eldest daughter
                    Susanna, who seems to have inherited something of her father’s genius, was
                    married to Dr John Hall, a medical man of more than average knowledge and
                    ability, who had a considerable practice in the neighbourhood of Stratford, and
                    who was deservedly held in high repute. The newly married couple settled in one
                    of the picturesque houses of the wooded suburb between the town and the church
                    known as Old Stratford. But before the end of the year the midsummer marriage
                    bells had changed to sadder music. In December Shakespeare lost his youngest
                    brother, Edmund, at the early age of twenty-seven. He had become an actor, most
                    probably through his brother’s help and influence, and was, at the time of his
                    death, living in London. He was buried at Southwark on the last day of the year.
                    Two months later there was family rejoicing in Dr Hall’s house at the birth of a
                    daughter. christened Elizabeth, the only offspring of the union, and the only
                    grandchild Shakespeare lived to see. The rejoicing at this event would be fully
                    shared by the household in New Place, and especially by Shakespeare himself,
                    whose cherished family hopes would thus be strengthened and renewed. Six months
                    later in this eventful year, fortune again turned her wheel. Early in September
                    Shakespeare’s mother, Mary Arden of the Asbies, died, having lived long enough
                    to see and welcome her great-grandchild as a fresh bond of family life. She was
                    buried at Stratford on the 9th of September, having survived her husband, who
                    was buried on the 8th of September 1601, exactly seven years. Mary Shakespeare
                    died full of years and honour and coveted rewards. For more than a decade she
                    had witnessed and shared the growing prosperity of her eldest son, and felt the
                    mother’s thrill of joy and pride in the success that had crowned his
                        brilliant<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n791/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0791-0766"/> career. The loss of his mother would be
                    deeply felt by her favourite son, but there was no bitterness in the
                    bereavement, and it even seems to have exerted a tranquillizing, elevating
                    effect on the poet’s mind and character. As he laid her in the grave he would
                    recall and realize afresh the early years during which her loving presence and
                    influence were the light and guide of his boyish life. With these vivid and
                    varied family experiences a strong wave of home-yearning seems to have set in,
                    which gradually drew the poet wholly back to Stratford. During the autumn visit
                    connected with his mother’s death Shakespeare must have remained several weeks
                    at the New Place, for on the 16th of October he acted as godfather to the infant
                    son of an old personal friend, Henry Walker, who was an alderman of the borough.
                    The child was called William after his godfather, and the poet must have taken a
                    special interest in the boy, as he remembered him in his will.</p>
                <p>It seems most probable that soon after the chequered domestic events of this
                    year, as soon as he could conveniently terminate his London engagements,
                    Shakespeare decided on retiring to his native place. He had gained all he cared
                    for in the way of wealth and fame, and his strongest interests, personal and
                    relative, were now centred in Stratford. But on retiring to settle in his native
                    town he had nothing of the dreamer, the sentimentalist, or the recluse about
                    him. His healthy natural feeling was far too strong, his character too manly and
                    well-balanced, to admit of any of the so-called eccentricities of genius. He
                    retired as a successful professional man who had gained a competence by his own
                    exertions and wished to enjoy it at leisure in a simple, social, rational way.
                    He knew that the competence he had gained, the lands and wealth he possessed,
                    could only be preserved, like other valuable possessions, by good management and
                    careful husbandry. And, taught by the sad experience of his earlier years, he
                    evidently guided the business details of his property with a firm and skilful
                    hand, was vigilant and scrupulously just in his dealings, respecting the rights
                    of others, and, if need be, enforcing his own. He sued his careless and
                    negligent debtors in the local court of record, had various commercial
                    transactions with the corporation, and took an active interest in the affairs of
                    the borough. And he went now and then to London, partly on business connected
                    with the town, partly no doubt to look after the administration and ultimate
                    disposal of his own theatrical property, and partly it may be assumed for the
                    pleasure of seeing his old friends and fellow dramatists. Even at Stratford,
                    however, Shakespeare was not entirely cut off from his old associates in arts
                    and letters, his hospitable board being brightened at intervals by the presence,
                    and animated by the wit, humour, and kindly gossip, of one or more of his chosen
                    friends. Two amongst the most cherished of his companions and fellow poets,
                    Drayton and Ben Jonson, had paid a visit of this kind to Stratford, and been
                    entertained by Shakespeare only a few days before his death, which occurred
                    almost suddenly on the 23d of April 1616. After three days’ illness the great
                    poet was carried off by a sharp attack of fever, at that time one of the
                    commonest scourges, even of country towns, and often arising then as now, only
                    more frequently then than now, from the neglect of proper sanitary precautions.
                    According to tradition the 23d of April was Shakespeare’s birthday, so that he
                    died on the completion of the 52d year of his age. Three days later he was laid
                    in the chancel of Stratford church, on the north wall of which his monument,
                    containing his bust and epitaph, was soon afterwards placed, most probably by
                    the poet’s son-in-law, Dr John Hall. Shakespeare’s widow, the Anne Hathaway of
                    his youth, died in 1623, having survived the poet seven years, exactly the same
                    length of time that his mother Mary Arden had outlived her husband. Elizabeth
                    Hall, the poet’s grandchild, was married twice, first to Mr Thos. Nash of
                    Stratford, and in 1649, when she had been two years a widow, to Mr afterwards
                    Sir John Barnard of Abington in Northamptonshire. Lady Barnard had no family by
                    either husband, and the three children of the poet’s second daughter Judith (who
                    had married Richard Quiney of Stratford, two months before her father’s death)
                    all died comparatively young. At Lady Barnard’s death in 1670 the family of the
                    poet thus become extinct. By his will made a few weeks before his death
                    Shakespeare left his landed property, the whole of his real estate indeed, to
                    his eldest daughter Mrs Susanna Hall, under strict entail to her heirs. He left
                    also a substantial legacy to his second daughter and only remaining child Mrs
                    Judith Quiney, and a remembrance to severaΓ of his friends, including his old
                    associates at the Blackfriars theatre, Burbage, Heminge, and Condell,—the two
                    latter of whom edited the first collection of his dramas published in 1623. The
                    will also included a bequest to the poor of Stratford.</p>
                <p>From this short sketch it will be seen that all the best known facts of
                    Shakespeare’s personal history bring into vivid relief the simplicity and
                    naturalness of his tastes, his love of the country, the strength of his domestic
                    affections, and the singularly firm hold which the conception of family life had
                    upon his imagination, his sympathies, and his schemes of active labour. He had
                    loved the country with ardent enthusiasm in his youth, when all nature was
                    lighted with the dawn of rising passion and kindled imagination; and after his
                    varied London experience we may well believe that he loved it still more with a
                    deeper and calmer love of one who had looked through and through the brilliant
                    forms of wealthy display, public magnificence, and courtly ceremonial, who had
                    scanned the heights and sounded the depths of existence, and who felt that for
                    the king and beggar alike this little life of feverish joys aud sorrows is
                    soothed by natural influences, cheered by sunlight and green shadows, softened
                    by the perennial charm of hill and dale and rippling stream, and when the spring
                    returns no more is rounded with a sleep. In the more intimate circle of human
                    relationships he seems clearly to have realized that the sovereign elixir
                    against the ills of life, the one antidote of its struggles and difficulties,
                    its emptiness and unrest, is vigilant charity, faithful love in all its forms,
                    love of home, love of kindred, love of friends, love of everything simple, just,
                    and true. The larger and more sacred group of those serene and abiding
                    influences flowing from well-centred affections was naturally identified with
                    family ties, and it is clear that the unity and continuity of family life
                    possessed Shakespeare’s imagination with the strength of a dominant passion and
                    largely determined the scope and direction of his practical activities. As we
                    have seen, he displayed from the first the utmost prudence and foresight in
                    securing a comfortable home for his family, and providing for the future welfare
                    of his children. The desire of his heart evidently was to take a good position
                    and found a family in his native place. And if this was a weakness he shares it
                    with other eminent names in the republic of letters. In Shakespeare’s case the
                    desire may have been inherited, not only from his father, who had pride, energy,
                    and ambition, but especially from his gently descended mother, Mary Arden of the
                    Asbies. But, whatever its source, the evidence in favour of this cherished
                    desire is unusually full, clear, and decisive. While the poet had no doubt
                    previously assisted his father to retrieve his position in the world, the first
                    important step in building up the family name was the grant of arms or armorial
                    bearings to John Shakespeare in the year 1596. The<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0792-0767"/> father, it may be assumed, had applied to the
                    heralds’ college for the grant at the instance and by the help of his son. In
                    this document, the draft of which is still preserved, the grounds on which the
                    arms are given are stated as two :—(1) because John Shakespeare’s ancestors had
                    rendered valuable services to Henry VII.; and (2) that he had married Mary,
                    daughter and one of the heirs of Robert Arden of Wilmcote, in the said county,
                    gentleman. In the legal conveyances of property to Shakespeare himself after the
                    grant of arms he is uniformly described as “William Shakespeare of
                    Stratford-upon-Avon, gentleman.” He is so described in the midst of his London
                    career, and this sufficiently indicates that Stratford was even then regarded as
                    his permanent residence or home. In the following year another important step
                    was taken towards establishing the position of the family. This was an
                    application by John and Mary Shakespeare to the Court of Chancery for the
                    recovery of the estate of the Asbies, which, under the pressure of family
                    difficulties, had been mortgaged in 1578 to Edward Lambert. The issue of the
                    suit is not known, but, as we have seen, the pleadings on either side occupy a
                    considerable space and show how resolutely John Shakespeare was bent on
                    recovering his wife’s family estate.</p>
                <p>Turning to the poet himself, we have the significant fact that during the next
                    ten years he continued, with steady persistency, to build up the family fortunes
                    by investing all his savings in real property,—in houses and land at Stratford.
                    While many of his associates and partners in the Blackfriars company remained on
                    in London, living and dying there, Shakespeare seems to have early realized his
                    theatrical property for the sake of increasing the acreage of his arable and
                    pasture land in the neighbourhood of Stratford. In 1598, the year after the
                    purchase of New Place, his family are not only settled there, but he is publicly
                    ranked among the most prosperous and well-to-do citizens of Stratford. In that
                    year, there being some anticipation of a scarcity of corn, an official statement
                    was drawn up as to the amount of wheat in the town. From the list contained in
                    this document of the chief householders in Chapel Ward, where New Place was
                    situated, we find that out of twenty holders of corn enumerated only two have
                    more in stock than William Shakespeare. Other facts belonging to the same year,
                    such as the successful appeal of a fellow-townsman for important pecuniary help,
                    and the suggestion from an alderman of the borough that, for the sake of
                    securing certain private and public benefits, he should be encouraged to
                    complete a contemplated purchase of land at Shottery, show that Shakespeare was
                    now recognized as a local proprietor of wealth and influence, and that he had so
                    far realized his early desire of taking a good position in the town and
                    neighbourhood. It will be noted, too, that all the leading provisions of
                    Shakespeare’s will embody the same cherished family purpose. Instead of dividing
                    his property between his two daughters, he left, as we have seen, the whole of
                    his estate, the whole of his real property indeed, to his eldest daughter Mrs
                    Susanna Hall, with a strict entail to the heirs of her body. This indicates in
                    the strongest manner the fixed desire of his heart to take a permanent position
                    in the locality, and, if possible, strike the family roots deeply into their
                    native soil. That this purpose was realized in his own case seems clear from the
                    special respect paid to his memory. He was buried, as we have seen, in the
                    chancel of the parish church, where as a rule only persons of family and
                    position could be interred. His monument, one of the most considerable in the
                    church, holds a place of honour on the north wall of the chancel, just above the
                    altar railing. While this tribute of marked official respect may be due in part,
                    as the epitaph intimates, to his eminence as a poet, it was no doubt, in a
                    country district like Stratford, due still more to his local importance as a
                    landed proprietor of wealth and position. Indeed, as a holder of the great
                    tithes he was by custom and courtesy entitled to burial in the chancel.</p>
                <p>If there is truth in the early tradition that Shakespeare originally left
                    Stratford in consequence of the sharp prosecution of Sir Thomas Lucy, who
                    resented with narrow bitterness and pride the presumption and audacity of the
                    high-spirited youth found trespassing on his grounds, the victim of his petty
                    wrath was in the end amply avenged. After a career of unexampled success in
                    London Shakespeare returned to his native town crowned with wealth and honours,
                    and, having spent the last years of his life in cordial intercourse with his old
                    friends and fellow townsmen, was followed to the grave with the affectionate
                    respect and regret of the whole Stratford community. This feeling was indeed, we
                    may justly assume, fully shared by all who had ever known the great poet. His
                    contemporaries and associates unanimously bear witness to Shakespeare’s frank,
                    honourable, loving nature. Perhaps the most striking expression of this common
                    feeling comes from one who in character, disposition, and culture was so
                    different from Shakespeare as his friend and fellow-dramatist Ben Jonson. Even
                    his rough and cynical temper could not resist the charm of Shakespeare’s genial
                    character and gracious ways. “I loved the man,” he says, “and do honour his
                    memory on this side idolatry as much as any. He was indeed honest, and of an
                    open and free nature, had an excellent phantasy, brave notions, and gentle
                    expressions.” As the genius of Shakespeare united the most opposite gifts, so
                    amongst his friends are found the widest diversity of character, endowment, and
                    disposition. This is only another way of indicating the breadth of his
                    sympathies, the variety of his interests, the largeness and exuberant vitality
                    of his whole nature. He touched life at so many points, and responded so
                    instinctively to every movement in the complex web of its throbbing activities,
                    that nothing affecting humanity was alien either to his heart or brain. To one
                    so gifted with the power of looking below the surface of custom and convention,
                    and perceiving, not only the deeper elements of rapture and anguish to which
                    ordinary eyes are blind, but the picturesque, humorous, or pathetic varieties of
                    the common lot, every form of human experience, every type of character, would
                    have an attraction of its own. In the view of such a mind nothing would be
                    common or unclean. To Shakespeare all aspects of life, even the humblest, had
                    points of contact with his own. He could talk simply and naturally without a
                    touch of patronage or condescension to a hodman on his ladder, a costermonger at
                    his stall, the tailor on his board, the cobbler in his combe, the hen-wife in
                    her poultry-yard, the ploughman in his furrow, or the base mechanicals at the
                    wayside country inn. He could watch with full and humorous appreciation the
                    various forms of brief authority and petty officialism, the bovine stolidity and
                    empty consequence of the local Dogberries and Shallows, the strange oaths and
                    martial swagger of a Pistol, a Bardolph, or a Parolles, the pedantic talk of a
                    Holofernes, the pragmatical saws of a Polonius, or the solemn absurdities of a
                    self-conceited Malvolio. On the other hand he could seize from the inner side by
                    links of vital affinity every form of higher character, passionate, reflective,
                    or executive,—lover and prince, duke and captain, legislator and judge,
                    counsellor and king,— and portray with almost equal ease and with vivid
                    truthfulness men and women of distant ages, of different races, and widely
                    sundered nationalities.</p>
                <p>As in his dramatic world he embraces the widest variety of human experience, so
                    in his personal character he may<pb break="no"

                    the widest range of qualities, including some apparently the most opposed. He
                    was a vigilant and acute man of business, of great executive ability, with a
                    power of looking into affairs which included a thorough mastery of tedious legal
                    details. But with all his worldly prudence and foresight he was at the same time
                    the most generous and affectionate of men, honoured and loved by all who knew
                    him, with the irresistible charm that belongs to simplicity and directness of
                    character, combined with thoughtful sympathy and real kindness of heart. And,
                    while displaying unrivalled skill, sagacity, and firmness in business
                    transactions and practical affairs, he could promptly throw the whole burden
                    aside, and in the exercise of his noble art pierce with an eagle’s wing the very
                    highest heaven of invention. That Indeed was his native air, his true home, his
                    permanent sphere, where he still rules with undisputed sway. He occupies a
                    throne apart in the ideal and Immortal kingdom of supreme creative art, poetical
                    genius, and dramatic truth. (T. S. B.)</p>
