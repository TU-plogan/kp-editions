                <p><label type="entry">SARSAPARILLA</label>, a popular alterative remedy, prepared
                    from the long fibrous roots of several species of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Smilax,</hi> indigenous to Central America, and extending from the southern and
                    western coasts of Mexico in the north to Peru in the south. These plants grow in
                    swampy forests seldom visited by European travellers, and, being dioecious and
                    varying much in the form of leaf in different individuals, they are but
                    imperfectly known to botanists, only two species having been identified as yet
                    with any degree of certainty. These are <hi rend="italic">Smilax
                    officinalis,</hi> Kth., and <hi rend="italic">S. medica,</hi> Schlecht. and
                    Cham., which yield respectively the so-called “Jamaica” and the Mexican
                    varieties. The introduction of sarsaparilla into European medicine dates from
                    the middle of the 16th century. Monardes, a physi cian of Seville, records that
                    it was brought to that city from New Spain about 1536-45, that a better sort
                    soon afterwards came from Honduras, and that an excellent variety of a darker
                    colour, and consisting of larger roots, was subsequently imported from
                    Guayaquil. Sarsaparilla must have come into extensive use soon afterwards, for
                    Gerard, about the close of the century, states that it was imported into England
                    from Peru in great abundance.</p>
                <p>When boiled in water the root affords a dark extractive matter, the exact nature
                    of which has not been determined; the quantity of extract yielded by the root is
                    used as a criterion of its quality. Boiling alcohol extracts from the root a
                    neutral substance in the form of crystalline prisms, which crystallize in scales
                    from boiling water. This body, which is named <hi rend="italic">parillin,</hi>
                    is allied to the saponin of quillaia bark, from which it differs in not exciting
                    sneezing. The presence in the root of starch, resin, and oxalate of lime is
                    revealed by the use of the microscope. Sarsaparilla is chiefly used in medicine
                    in the form of decoction and fluid extract. It is regarded by many as a valuable
                    alterative and diaphoretic in chronic rheumatism, syphilis, and various skin
                    diseases, but by others as possessing little if any remedial value. It is
                    frequently prescribed in combination with powerful medicines, such as iodide of
                    potassium or bichloride of mercury.</p>
                <p>The varieties of sarsaparilla met with in commerce at present are the following
                    :—Jamaica, Lima, Honduras, Guatemala, Guayaquil, and Mexican. Of these the
                    first-named is the most highly esteemed, as yielding the largest amount of
                    extract, viz., from 33 to 44 per cent.; it is the only kind admitted into the
                    British pharmacopceia. On the Continent, and more especially in Italy, the
                    varieties having a white starchy bark, like those of Honduras and Guatemala, are
                    preferred. “Jamaica” sarsaparilla is not produced there, but derives its name
                    from the fact that Jamaica was at one time the emporium for sarsaparilla, which
                    was brought thither from Honduras, New Spain, and Peru. Sarsaparilla is grown to
                    a small extent in Jamaica, and is occasionally exported thence to the London
                    market in small quantities, but its orange colour and starchy bark are so
                    different in appearance from the thin reddish-brown bark of the genuine drug,
                    that it does not meet with a ready sale. The Jamaica sarsaparilla of trade is
                    collected on the Cordilleras of Chiriqui, in that part of the isthmus of Panama
                    which adjoins Costa Rica, where the plant yielding it grows at an elevation of
                    4000 to 8000 feet, and is brought down to Boca del Toro on the Atlantic coast
                    for shipment. It is met with in commerce in the form of hanks about 18 inches
                    long and 4 inches in diameter, loosely wound round with a long root of the same
                    drug. The root bark is of a reddish-brown colour, thin and shrivelled, and there
                    is an abundance of rootlets, which are technically known by the name of “beard.”
                    Lima sarsaparilla resembles the Jamaica kind, but the roots are of a paler brown
                    colour, and are formed into cylindrical bundles of similar length, but only
                    about 2½ inches in diameter. Honduras sarsaparilla occurs in the form of
                    cylindrical rolls about 30 inches long and 4 or more in diameter, closely wound
                    round with a long root so as to form a neat bundle. The roots are less wrinkled,
                    and the bark is whiter and more starchy, than in the Jamaica kind. It is
                    exported from Belize to the extent of about 10,000 lb annually. Guatemala
                    sarsaparilla is very similar to that of Honduras, but has a more decided orange
                    hue, and the bark shows a tendency to split off. Guayaquil sarsaparilla is
                    obtained chiefly in the valley of Alausi, on the western side of the equatorial
                    Andes. The roots are roughly packed in large bales and are not made into
                    separate hanks, and the chump or rootstock is often allowed to remain attached
                    to the roots. The bark is thick and furrowed, and of a pale fawn colour
                    internally; the rootlets are few, and the root itself is of larger diameter than
                    in the other kinds. Sometimes there is attached to the rootstock a portion of
                    stem, which is round and not prickly, differing in these respects from that of
                    <hi rend="italic">Smilax officinalis,</hi> which is square and prickly. Mexican
                    sarsaparilla also is not made up into hanks, but is packed in straight lengths
                    of about 3 feet into bales, the chump and portions of an angular but not square
                    stem being frequently attached to the roots. The latter are slender, shrivelled,
                    and nearly devoid of rootlets. This kind of sarsaparilla is collected on the
                    eastern slope of the Mexican Andes throughout the year, and is the produce of
                    <hi rend="italic">Smilax medica,</hi> Schlecht. and Cham.</p>
                <p>The collection of sarsaparilla root is a very tedious business; a single root
                    takes an Indian half a day or sometimes even a day and a half to unearth it. The
                    roots extend horizontally in the ground on all sides for about 9 feet, and from
                    these the earth has to be carefully scraped away and other roots cut through
                    where such come across them. A plant four years old will yield 16 lb of fresh<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n333/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0333-0314"/> root, and a well-grown one from 32 to 64 lb, but
                    more than half the weight is lost in drying. The more slender roots are
                    generally left, and the stem is cut down near to the ground, the crown of the
                    root being covered with leaves and earth. Thus treated, the plant continues to
                    grow, and roots may again be cut from it after the lapse of two years, but the
                    yield will be smaller and the roots more slender and less starchy. In some
                    varieties, as the Guayaquil and Mexican, the whole plant, including the
                    rootstock, is pulled up. The Indians are guided in their selection of roots by
                    the number of stems arising from the roots, by the thinness of the leaves, and
                    the closeness with which the stem is beset with prickles.</p>
                <p>In several species of <hi rend="italic">Smilax</hi> the roots become thickened
                    here and there into largo tuberous swellings 4 to 6 inches long, and one or two
                    inches in thickness. These tubers form a considerable article of trade in China,
                    but are used to a limited extent only on the Continent, under the name of China
                    root, although introduced into Europe about the same time as sarsaparilla. China
                    root is obtained both in China and India from <hi rend="italic">Smilax
                    glabra</hi> and <hi rend="italic">S. lanceaefolia,</hi> Roxburgh, and <hi
                    rend="italic">S. China,</hi> L. A similar root is yielded by <hi rend="italic"
                    >S. pseudo-China,</hi> L., and S. <hi rend="italic">tamnoides</hi> in the United
                    States from New Jersey southwards; by <hi rend="italic">S. balbisiana,</hi>
                    Kth., in the West Indies, and by <hi rend="italic">S. Japicanga</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">S. syringoides,</hi> Griseb., and S. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brasiliensis,</hi> Spreng., in South America. All these are used as an
                    alterative remedy in the localities where they grow. The amount of China root
                    exported to Europe from Canton in 1872 was only 51,200 lb, although in the same
                    year as much as 1,367,733 lb was exported from the city of Hankow to other
                    Chinese ports. In 1882 Bombay imported from China 945 cwts. of the root. The
                    name of Indian sarsaparilla is given to the roots of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hemidesmus indicus,</hi> R. Br., an Asclepiadaceous plant indigenous to India.
                    These roots are readily distinguished from those of true sarsaparilla by their
                    loose cracked bark and by their odour and taste, recalling those of melilot.</p>
