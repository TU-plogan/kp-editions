                    occupies the eastern part of the great central plateau of Russia, which gently
                    slopes towards the south so as imperceptibly to merge into the steppe region;
                    its eastern slope, deeply cut into by ravines, abruptly falls towards the Volga.
                    As the higher parts of the plateau range from 700 to 900 feet above the sea,
                    while the Volga flows at an elevation of only 20 feet at Khvalynsk in the north,
                    and is 48 feet beneath sea-level at Sarepta, the steep ravine-cut slopes of the
                    plateau give a hilly aspect to the banks of the river. In the south, and
                    especially in the narrow strip above mentioned, the country assumes the
                    characteristics of true elevated steppes, intersected with waterless
                    ravines.</p>
                <p>Every geological formation from the Carboniferous up to the Miocene is
                    represented in Saratoff; the older ones are, however, mostly concealed under the
                    Cretaceous, whose fossiliferous marls, flint-bearing clays, and iron-bearing
                    sandstones cover broad areas. The Jurassic deposits seldom make their appearance
                    from beneath them. Eocene sands, sandstones, and marls, rich in marine fossils
                    and in fossil wood, extend over large tracts in the east. The boulder-clay of
                    the Finland and Olonetz ice-sheet penetrates in Saratoff as far south-east as
                    the valleys of the Medvyeditsa and the Sura; while extensive layers of loess and
                    other deposits of the Lacustrine or Post-Glacial period appear in the south-east
                    and elsewhere above the Glacial deposits. Iron-ore is abundant; chalk, lime, and
                    white pottery clay are extracted to a limited degree. The mineral waters at
                    Sarepta, formerly much visited, have been superseded in public favour by those
                    of Caucasus.</p>
                <p>Saratoff is well watered, especially in the north. The Volga, from 1 to 7 miles
                    in width, separates it from Samara and Astrakhan for a length of 500 miles; its
                    tributaries are but small, except the Sura, which rises in Saratoff and serves
                    for the northward transit of timber. The tributaries of the Don are more
                    important; the upper Medvyeditsa and the Khoper, which both have a southward
                    course parallel to the Volga and water Saratoff each for about 200 miles, are
                    navigated notwithstanding their shallows, ready-made boats being brought in
                    separate pieces from the Volga for that purpose. The Ilovla, which flows in the
                    same direction into the Don, is separated from the Volga only by a strip of land
                    15 miles wide; Peter I. proposed to utilize it as a channel for connecting the
                    Don with the Volga, but the idea was never carried out, and the two rivers are
                    now connected by the railway (52 miles) from Tsaritsyn to Kalatch which crosses
                    the southern extremity of Saratoff.</p>
                <p>Lakes and marshes occur only in a few river-valleys. The region is rapidly drying
                    up, and the forests diminishing. In the south, about Tsaritsyn, where the hills
                    were densely covered with them a few centuries ago, they have almost wholly
                    disappeared. In the north they still cover more than a third of the surface, the
                    aggregate area under wood being reckoned at 2,661,000 acres. The remainder is
                    distributed as follows :—arable land, 11,509,000 acres; prairies and pasture
                    lands, 3,799,000; uncultivable,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n324/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0324-0305"/> 2,049,800. Such is the scarcity of timber that
                    the peasants’ houses are made of clay, the corner posts and door and window
                    frames being largely shipped from the wooded districts of the middle Volga. The
                    climate is severe and quite continental. The average yearly temperatures are 41°
                    .5 at Saratoff (January, 12°·4; July, 71°·5) and 44°.4 at Tsaritsyn (January,
                    13°·2; July, 74°·6). The average range of temperature is as much as 119°. The
                    Volga is frozen for an average of 162 days at Saratoff and 153 days at
                    Tsaritsyn. The soil is very fertile, especially in the north, where a thick
                    sheet of black-earth covers the plateaus; sandy clay and salt clay appear in the
                    south.</p>
                <p>The population is very various, emigrants from all parts of Russia being mixed
                    with Finnish and Tartar stems and with German colonists. The Great Russians
                    constitute 75 per cent. of the population, Little Russians 7 per cent., Germans
                    7, Mordvinians 6, and Tartars 3·5 per cent. The Tchuvashes may number about
                    11,000, Mesclieriaks about 3000, and Poles about 5000. All are unequally
                    distributed, Little Russians being more numerous in the districts of Atkarsk,
                    Bałashoff, Tsaritsyn, and Kamyshin (18 to 13 per cent.), the Mordvinians in
                    Kuznetsk and Petrovsk (16 per cent.), and the Germans in Kamyshin (40 per
                    cent.). The immigration of the Germans took place in 1763-1765, and their
                    wealthy colonies have the aspect of minor West-European towns (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Samara).</hi></p>
                <p>Only 285,140 of the population reside in ten towns, the remainder (1,827,937)
                    being distributed over 5602 villages, of which some have from 5000 to 12,000
                    inhabitants, and no less than 150 reckon more than 2000. The annual mortality is
                    42 per 1000 (1882), but this high figure is more than compensated for by the
                    births, which in the same year were 51 per 1000. The chief occupation is
                    agriculture. More than one half of the arable land (6,210,000 acres) was under
                    crops in 1881. In 1884 the returns were rye, 3,374,000 quarters (1,608,300 in
                    1883); wheat, 850,700; barley, 103,400; oats, 1,657,700 (2,432,700 in 1883); and
                    various, 764,400. Drought, and sometimes also noxious insects, cause great
                    fluctuations in the harvest; but nevertheless almost every season leaves a
                    considerable balance of corn for export. Oil-yielding plants are also
                    cultivated; linseed in all districts except Tsaritsyn; mustard, both for grain
                    and oil, extensively about Sarepta and in the Kamyshin district; and sunflower
                    (140,000 quarters) in the northern districts. Gardening is a considerable source
                    of income around Saratoff, Volsk, Atkarsk, and Kamyshin. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >molokan</hi> dissenters have great plantations of water-melons, melons,
                    pumpkins, &amp;c. The peasants of Saratoif are no better off than those of the
                    other governments of south-east Russia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Samara).</hi>
                    Years of scarcity are common, and invariably mean ruin for the peasants.
                    Cattle-breeding, formerly a large source of income, is rapidly falling off.
                    Between 1877 and 1882 there was a decrease of 271,000 head, and murrain swept
                    away large numbers of cattle in 1883.</p>
                <p>Manufactures are developing but slowly, the chief of them, those dealing with
                    animal produce, being checked by the falling off in cattle-breeding. The 6500
                    industrial manufacturing establishments of Saratoff employed an aggregate of
                    only 17,500 workmen, with an annual production of but 20,973,500 roubles
                    (£2,097,350) in 1882. The most considerable were—cottons, £17,200; woollen
                    cloth, £64,480; tanneries, £85,830; tallow, soap, wax-candles, flour,
                    £1,217,800; oils, £125,360; distilleries, £255,780; iron, £15,390; and
                    machinery, £37,195. Various petty trades are rapidly developing among the
                    peasantry. Shipbuilding is carried on in the Volga villages; wooden vessels and
                    implements are made in the north, and pottery in several villages; and quite
                    recently the fabrication of lead-pencils has been added at Buturlinovka. Very
                    many peasants have still every year to leave their homes in search of work on
                    the Volga and elsewhere. An active trade is carried on by the merchants of the
                    chief towns,—corn, hides, tallow, oils, being exported; the merchants of
                    Saratoff, moreover, are intermediaries in the trade of south-east Russia with
                    the central provinces. The chief ports are Saratoff, Tsaritsyn, Kamyshin, and
                    Khvalynsk.</p>
                <p>Saratoff is divided into 10 districts, the chief towns of which and their
                    populations in 1882 were as follows:—Saratoff (112,430 inhabitants); Atkarsk
                    (7610); Bałashoff (10,090); Kamyshin (14,460); Khvalynsk (17,650); Kuznetsk
                    (17,930); Petrovsk (15,020); Serdobsk (10,360); Tsaritsyn (31,220); and Volsk or
                    Voljsk (34,930). The German colony of Sarepta, although without municipal
                    institutions, is a lively little town with 5650 inhabitants, which carries on an
                    active trade in mustard, woollen cloth, and various manufactured wares. Dubovka
                    (13,450 inhabitants) derives its importance from its traffic with the Don; the
                    villages Samoiłovka in the district of Bałashoff and Kołoyar in Volsk have each
                    more than 11,000 inhabitants; Bałanda and Arkadak are important
                    grain-markets.</p>
                <p>The district of Saratoff has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic Period;
                    its inhabitants of a later epoch have left numerous bronze remains in the <hi
                    rend="italic">kurgans,</hi> but the question of their ethnological position is
                    still unsettled. In the 8th and 9th centuries the half-</p>
                <p>nomad Burtases peopled the territory and recognized the authority of the Khazar
                    princes. Whether the Burtases were the ancestors of the Mordvinians—as some
                    ethnologists are inclined to admit— has not yet been determined. At the time of
                    the Mongolian invasion, the Tartars took possession of the territory, and one of
                    their settlements around the khan’s palace at Urek, 10 miles from Saratoff,
                    seems to have had some importance, as well as those about Tsaritsyn and Dubovka.
                    The incursions of the Crimean Tartars devastated the country about the 15th
                    century, and after the fall of Kazan and Astrakhan the territory was annexed to
                    Moscow. Saratoff and Tsaritsyn, both protected by forts, arose in the second
                    half of the 16th century; but the forests and deep ravines of the territory
                    continued for two centuries more to give shelter to numerous bands of squatters,
                    Raskolniks, and runaway serfs, who did not recognize the authority of Moscow;
                    they sometimes robbed the caravans of boats on the Volga and were ready to
                    support the insurrections both of Razin and of the impostors of the 18th
                    century. Dmitrievsk (now Kamyshin) and Petrovsk were founded about the end of
                    the 17th century, and a palisaded wall was erected between the Volga and the
                    Don, while other lines of military posts were kept in the north and west. A
                    special “voisko” of Volga Cossacks was founded in 1731, but as they also joined
                    the rebellions they were soon transferred to the Terek. Regular colonization may
                    be said to have begun only at the end of the 18th century, when Catherine II.
                    called back the runaway dissenters, invited German colonists, and ordered her
                    courtiers to settle here their serfs, deported from central Russia. In this way
                    the population of the lieutenancy, which extended also along the left bank of
                    the Volga, reached 640,000 in 1777. It exceeded one million in 1817. In 1851 the
                    territory on the left bank of the Volga was transferred to the new Samara
                    government. (P. A. K. )</p>
