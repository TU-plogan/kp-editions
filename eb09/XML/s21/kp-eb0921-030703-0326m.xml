                    <hi rend="italic">Sardaigne,</hi> Span. <hi rend="italic">Cerdeña,</hi> called
                    by the ancient Greeks 'Ιχνούσα, from a fancied resemblance to the print of a
                    foot), an island in the Mediterranean, about 140 miles from the west coast of
                    Italy, of which kingdom it forms a part. It is separated from the island of
                    Corsica by the Strait of Bonifacio, which is about 7½ miles wide, and only about
                    50 fathoms deep. Sardinia lies between 8° 4' and 9° 49' E. long., and extends
                    from 38° 55' to 41° 16' N. lat. The length from Cape Teulada in the south-west
                    to Cape Longo Sardo in the north is about 160 miles, the breadth from Cape
                    Comino to Cape Caccia about 68 miles. The area of the island is 9187 square
                    miles,—that of the department <hi rend="italic">(compartimento),</hi> including
                    the small islands adjacent, being 9294 square miles. It ranks sixth in point of
                    size among the islands of Europe, coming next after Sicily.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the island is mountainous, especially in the east, where the
                    mountains stretch almost continuously from north to south, and advance close up
                    to the coast. The elevations, however, are not so high as in the sister island
                    of Corsica. The culminating point is Monte Gennargentu, which rises, about 22
                    miles from the east coast, almost exactly on the parallel of 40° N., to the
                    height of 6250 feet, and is consequently little more than two-thirds of the
                    height of the chief peaks of Corsica. On the east side the principal breach in
                    the continuity of the mountains occurs in the north, where a narrow valley
                    opening to the east at the Gulf of Terranova cuts off the mountains of Limpara
                    in the extreme north-east. The western half of the island has more level land.
                    The principal plain, that of the Campidano, stretches from southeast to
                    north-west, between the Gulf of Cagliari and that of Oristano, and nowhere
                    attains a greater elevation than 250 feet. At both ends it sinks to a much lower
                    level, and has a number of shallow lagoons encroaching on it from the sea. In
                    the corner of the island situated to the south-west of the Campidano there are
                    two small isolated mountains rising to the height of from 3000 to 4000 feet,
                    which are of importance as containing the chief mineral wealth of the island. A
                    small valley runs between them from the southern end of the Campidano to
                    Iglesias, the mining centre of Sardinia. North of the Gulf of Oristano mountains
                    again appear. The extinct volcano of Monte Ferru there rises to the height of
                    4400 feet, and the streams of basalt which have issued from it in former<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n327/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0327-0308"/> ages form the ridge or saddle, about 2000 feet
                    high, connecting this mountain with the highland area on the east. Still further
                    north a trachytic plateau, intersected by numerous deep river valleys, occupies
                    a considerable tract, advancing up to the plain of Sassari on the north
                    coast.</p>
                <p>The rivers are numerous but short. The principal is the Oristano, which enters
                    the gulf of the same name on the west coast.</p>
                <p>Geologically the island is composed mainly of granite and other crystalline
                    rocks. Granite predominates especially in the east, and the mountains of that
                    part of the island were apparently at one time continuous with the similarly
                    constituted mountains of Corsica. Granitic spurs likewise extend to the
                    south-west, and appear in the capes of Spartivento and Teulada. Altogether this
                    rock is estimated to cover one-half of the entire surface. In the west of the
                    island the principal crystalline rocks are porphyritic in structure; sedimentary
                    deposits are comparatively unimportant, and such as are present are mainly
                    cither of very ancient or of recent geological date. Silurian formations attain
                    their most considerable development in the south-west round Iglesias, where
                    there occurred the contemporaneous porphyritic outpourings containing the most
                    numerous mineral veins of the island. Between the deposits of Silurian and those
                    of Cretaceous times there are none of any consequence except a few patches of
                    Devonian round the slopes of Gennargentu, interesting as containing some beds of
                    true coal. The members of the Cretaceous system occupy considerable tracts in
                    the southwest, east (round the Gulf of Orosei), and north-west (in the mountains
                    of Nurra), and a smaller area in the southwest (in the island of San Antioco).
                    Tertiary formations are still more largely developed. They cover the whole plain
                    of the Campidano, the west coast opposite the island of San Antioco, and the
                    narrow valley in the north-east already mentioned. The basalts of Monte Ferru
                    are also of Tertiary date, and it does not appear to have been till that epoch
                    that Sardinia formed a single island.</p>
                <p>In variety of mineral wealth the southern half of Sardinia is the richest
                    province of Italy, and it stands second in the annual value of its mineral
                    products. The chief minerals are sulphates of lead more or less argentiferous
                    (galena), sulphates and silicates of zinc, ordinary iron pyrites, sulphates of
                    iron and copper, of antimony, and of arsenic, besides cobalt, nickel, and
                    silver. The coal on the flanks of Gennargentu is of good enough quality to
                    furnish a valuable fuel, and is found in sufficiently thick seams to be workable
                    if only the means of transport were present, but its situation is such as to
                    render it of no economical importance. In the Tertiary deposits of the
                    south-west there are some veins of manganese ore, and also some beds of lignite
                    which are worked as a source of fuel for local use. The mineral wealth of
                    Sardinia was known in ancient times, and mines were worked both by the
                    Carthaginians and the Romans. During the Middle Ages they were for the most part
                    neglected, but the industry was revived in modern times, and has been greatly
                    developed in recent years. Upwards of 70 mines have now been opened, most of
                    them in the district of which Iglesias is the centre, but a few near the
                    southern part of the east coast, where Muravera is the chief town. The mines are
                    mostly of argentiferous lead, silver, zinc, and iron. The ores are mainly
                    exported in the raw state, only the inferior sorts being smelted in the island.
                    Among other mineral products are building stones (granite, marble, &amp;c.),
                    alabaster, and salt.</p>
                <p>The climate of Sardinia is similar to that of the rest of the Mediterranean
                    region, and the southern half of the island shares in the nearly rainless
                    summers characteristic of the southern portions of the Mediterranean peninsulas.
                    At Cagliari there are on an average only seven days on which rain falls during
                    June, July, and August. Throughout the island these months are the driest in the
                    year, and hence vegetation on the lower ground at least is generally at a
                    standstill during that period, and shrubs with broad leathery leaves fitted to
                    withstand the drought (the so-called <hi rend="italic">maquis)</hi> are as
                    characteristic here as in Corsica and on the mainland. Winter is the rainiest
                    season of the year; but the heat and drought of summer (mean temperature 95° F.)
                    make that the most unpleasant of the seasons, while in the low grounds the
                    prevalence of malaria renders it a most unhealthy one, especially for visitors.
                    Autumn, which is prolonged into December, is the most agreeable season; there is
                    then neither heat nor cold, nor mist nor fever, and at that period birds of
                    passage begin to immigrate in large numbers.</p>
                <p>The agricultural products of the island are greatly inferior to what might be
                    expected in view of the natural fertility of the soil. Two causes are assigned
                    for this. The first is the minute subdivision of the land, which, as in Corsica,
                    is carried to such an extent that where an owner has as much as 100 acres his
                    property is divided into 25 or 30 lots surrounded by parcels of land belonging
                    to other owners. In such circumstances it is neither possible to apply adequate
                    capital to the cultivation of the ground, nor for the owners to acquire the
                    requisite capital. The second cause is the malaria which renders certain
                    districts possessed of a fertile soil quite uninhabitable; and this second cause
                    can be remedied only when a remedy has been found for the first, for, as the
                    malaria is undoubtedly one cause of diminished cultivation, it is equally
                    certain that want of cultivation is one of the causes of the malaria. In ancient
                    times Sardinia was one of the granaries of Rome; now cereals take a
                    comparatively unimportant place among the exports, and this export is balanced
                    by a considerable import of the same commodity. The chief products of
                    agriculture are wheat, barley, and beans, the last furnishing an important
                    element of the food of the people, olives run wild in many places, and are grown
                    in sufficient abundance to meet the local demand.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n328/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0328-0309"/> Almonds, oranges, and citrons are also largely
                    cultivated, and the oranges of San Vito, near Muravera, and of Milis, a few
                    miles to the north of Oristano, are noted for their excellence; the white wines
                    of the banks of the Oristano are of good repute; and among other products of the
                    island are mulberries, tobacco, madder, anil hemp. Forests of oak, cork-oak,
                    firs, and pines, though greatly reduced in extent, still cover, it is said,
                    about one-fifth of the surface. The rearing of live-stock receives more
                    attention than agriculture proper. No artificial pasture-grasses are grown, but
                    the natural pastures beside the numerous rivers yield abundance of food, except
                    during the dry season, when the horses, asses, cattle, sheep, and goats have to
                    content themselves with straw, some dried beans, and a little barley. Most
                    attention is bestowed on horses. At one time the Sardinian Government
                    endeavoured to keep a stud on the island for rearing horses for the Piedmontese
                    cavalry, but the persons employed (natives of the mainland) were unable to
                    withstand the malaria. There are some large private establishments for the
                    rearing of horses, however, and the tending of live-stock generally forms so
                    important a part of the occupations of the people that animals rank next after
                    minerals among the exports of the island. Of the wild animals, the wild sheep
                    known as the musimon, or European mutllon, formerly an inhabitant of all the
                    mountains of the Mediterranean peninsulas and islands, and now confined to
                    Sardinia and Corsica, is the most interesting. Among the noxious animals are
                    scorpions and tarantulas.</p>
                <p>The lagoons near the coast on the south and west abound in mullets, eels,
                    mussels, and crabs, which are caught in great numbers by the natives, while the
                    fisheries round Sardinia, as round Corsica, are in the hands of Italians from
                    the mainland. The anchovy, sardine, and coral fisheries are all lucrative. The
                    coral is said to be of excellent quality, and is exported to the markets of
                    Genoa and Marseilles.</p>
                <p>The external commerce of the island has nearly trebled itself in the twenty-five
                    years 1856-81, the imports and exports each amounting in the latter year to
                    about £1,500,000 (about £2, 4s. per head of population). This increase is
                    chiefly owing to the development of the mining industry, ores making up nearly
                    one-third of the total value of the exports. Live animals make up about a fourth
                    of the total value, and cereals, which come next in order, about one-seventh.
                    The chief imports are cotton and other manufactures and colonial products. The
                    inland trade has been greatly promoted within the last fifty years by the
                    construction of roads and railways. Before 1828 there were no roads at all in
                    the island; the tracks which existed could be traversed only on foot or on
                    horseback. But upwards of 1500 miles of national and provincial roads, all well
                    made and well kept, have since then been constructed. Of railways, introduced
                    since 1870, there are now 265 miles in all (equal to about 1 mile of railway for
                    every 34 square miles of surface).</p>
                <p>For administrative purposes Sardinia, like the rest of Italy, is divided into
                    provinces and circles <hi rend="italic">(circondarii').</hi> The following table
                    gives the names of these divisions with the population according to the last
                    census (end of 1881) :—</p>

                <p>The whole population of the department is thus 682,002, equal to about 74 to the
                    square mile, Sardinia being the least populous of all the great divisions of the
                    kingdom, in which the average density is 255 to the square mile. The population
                    is, however, increasing at a rather more rapid rate than on the mainland.
                    Between 1871 and 1881 it increased by about 46,000, or 7.18 per cent., while the
                    average rate of increase throughout the kingdom was only 6·16 per cent.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Sardinia are a hardy race, of about middle height, and of dark
                    complexion. They are little accustomed to hard work, but this is one of the
                    consequences of the backward state of their civilization and of the impediments
                    already indicated to the development of the resources of the island. Education,
                    as in many other parts of Italy, is very far behind, notwithstanding the law
                    which makes elementary education compulsory; but here, as throughout the
                    kingdom, it is rapidly extending. In 1880-81 only 37,197 children, or less than
                    one-eighteenth of the population, were in attendance at the elementary schools,
                    but this number was double what it had been in 1861-62. At Cagliari there is a
                    university, attended by from 300 to 400 students.</p>
                <p>The people are lively in their disposition, fond of music and poetry, remarkably
                    hospitable, and strong in their family attachments. With this last trait,
                    however, is connected the chief blot on their character—their addiction to the
                    practice of the <hi rend="italic">vendetta,</hi> which prevails here as in
                    Corsica, and according to which an outrage on one’s honour is wiped out in
                    blood, and the cause of one member of a family is taken up by the rest, so that
                    the death of one victim leads to the sacrifice of many others. But the practice
                    is said to be becoming every day more rare, and never to be resorted to except
                    in case of serious offence.</p>
                <p>The capital of the island is Cagliari, but Sassari in the north has an equally
                    large population (about 34,000). The other chief towns are Tempio, Algliero,
                    Iglesias, and oristano. Cagliari, Alghero, and Castel Sardo are fortified.</p>
                <p>The antiquities of the island are numerous and of peculiar interest. The most
                    remarkable of these are the monuments called <hi rend="italic">nurhags</hi>
                    (variously spelled also <hi rend="italic">nuraghc, mcraghi,</hi> &amp;c.), of
                    which there are upwards of 3000 scattered over the island. They are round
                    structures having the form of truncated cones, and are generally built of the
                    hardest materials the island supplies (granite, basalt, trachyte, limestone,
                    &amp;c.). The stone is roughly hewn into large blocks, which are laid in regular
                    horizontal courses but not cemented. The blocks in the lower courses are
                    sometimes more than three feet in length. Entrance is obtained by a very low
                    opening at the base to an inner chamber; and, when there are two or, as in some
                    cases, three stories, these are connected by means of a spiral staircase. The
                    origin and use of these structures are both matters of speculation. The rarity
                    of human remains in them is against the idea that they were used as tombs, while
                    the absence of any relics pertaining to a religious ceremonial is equally
                    adverse to the supposition that they were used as temples. Next to the nurhags
                    the most interesting of the remains of antiquity are tho so-called tombs of the
                    giants, which appear to have been actually used as places of burial, although,
                    as the name given to them indicates, their dimensions are greatly in excess of
                    those of the human body. Besides these there are tombs the structure of which
                    leads to the belief that they must be relics of an Egyptian colony.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> According to Prof. Crespi, of the university of
                    Cagliari, the tombs just referred to are not the only signs of an early Egyptian
                    settlement in the island of Sardinia. Various remains are said to prove beyond
                    doubt that Egyptians must have founded at least two colonies in very remote
                    times—one at tho ancient town of Tharrus on the small peninsula of San Marco at
                    the northern extremity of the Gulf of Oristano, and the other at Caralis, the
                    present Cagliari. But even before the Egyptians Prof. Crespi believes that the
                    Phoenicians had established a colony on the small island of San Antioco, and had
                    built there the town of Sulcis, the ruins of which are still to be seen near the
                    town of San Antioco. Of Phoenicians and Egyptians, however, there are no
                    trustworthy historical records, and the first settlers whose arrival is
                    historically accredited were the Carthaginians, who succeeded in making
                    themselves masters of the island under Hasdrubal in 512 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c</hi>. The island remained in Carthaginian hands for upwards of two hundred
                    and seventy years, and then passed into those of tho Romans, who took advantage
                    of the war in which Carthage was involved with her mercenary troops after the
                    close of the First Punic War to seize the island (238 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.).</hi> Thenceforward the island remained in possession of the Romans till
                    near the fall of the empire of the West, when Sardinia also began to suffer from
                    the ravages of the northern hordes by which Italy was at that time overrun and
                    the empire of the West overthrown. About the middle of the 5th century the
                    island was occupied by the Vandals under Genseric, but in the first half of the
                    following century these were expelled by Belisarius. Very soon after, however,
                    Goths succeeded the Vandals, and after these had in their turn been driven out
                    by Narses the natives managed to expel the Romans and to achieve their
                    independence (665). The Sardinians thereupon elected the leader in the revolt
                    against Rome king of the island, and by <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> him the
                    island was divided into the four grand-judicatures of Cagliari, Arborea, Torres,
                    and Gallura. The grand-justices or rulers of these four divisions continued to
                    retain a considerable amount of power during a large part of the Middle Ages.
                    But from the early part of the 8th century down to the middle of the 11th their
                    influence was greatly impaired by repeated inroads of the Saracens, who landed
                    now on one coast now on another, and kept the inhabitants in a constant state of
                    alarm. This state of matters was at last put an end to by the Genoese and
                    Pisans, who, acting under the sanction of the pope, despatched a fleet against
                    that of the Saracens. A battle ensued in the Bay of Cagliari; the Saracens were
                    completely defeated, and the allies landed on the island (1050). Very soon the
                    Pisans adroitly managed to rid themselves of the Genoese, and to gain possession
                    of almost the entire island, deposing the grand-justices of Cagliari, Torres,
                    and Gallura. With the Pisans the greater part of the island remained till 1325,
                    when the pope gave Sardinia to the king of Aragon, who combined with the
                    grand-justice of Arborea to drive out the former rulers. But, this being
                    accomplished, war soon broke out between the two, and numerous successes were
                    gained by the grand-justice Marian IV. and his daughter Eleonora acting as
                    regent on behalf of her son Marian V., a minor. The Aragonese seemed to be on
                    the point of being driven out of the island when Eleonora died of<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0329-0310"/> the plague (1403), and soon after the whole
                    island became an Aragonese (after the union of the crowns of Aragon and Castile
                    a Spanish) province. It remained Spanish till the treaty of Utrecht in 1713,
                    when it was ceded to the house of Austria, by which in 1720 it was handed over
                    to Victor Amadeus II., duke of Savoy, in exchange for the island of Sicily.
                    Shortly before the date of this acquisition the duke of Savoy (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Savoy)</hi> had had the title of king conferred upon him, and
                    when the cession of Sardinia took place the title was changed to that of king of
                    Sardinia. With this kingdom the island ultimately became merged in the kingdom
                    of Italy.</p>
