                    and the Modalists —the former holdin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> Christ to be the
                    man chosen of God, on whom the Holy Spirit rested in a quite unique sense, and
                    who after toil and suffering, throu <hi rend="italic">g</hi> h His oneness of
                    will with God, became divine, the latter maintainin <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    Christ to be a manifestation of God Himself. Both <hi rend="italic">g</hi> roups
                    had their scientific theologians who sought to vindicate their characteristic
                    doctrines, the Adoptianist divines holding by the Aristotelian philosophy, and
                    the Modalists by that of the Stoics; while the Trinitarians (Tertullian,
                    Hippolytus, Origen, Novatian), on the other hand, appealed to Plato.</p>
                <p>In Rome Modalism was the doctrine which prevailed from Victor to Calixtus <hi
                    rend="italic">(c.</hi> 190-220). The bishops just named protected within the
                    city the schools of Epigonus and Cleomenes, where it was tau <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> ht that the Son is identical with the Father. But the presbyter
                    Hippolytus was successful in convincing the leaders of that church that the
                    Modalistic doctrine taken in its strictness was contrary to Scripture. Bishop
                    Calixtus saw himself under the necessity of abandoning his friends and setting
                    up a <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ediatin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> formula designed
                    to harmonize the Trinitarian and the Modalistic positions. But, while
                    excommunicating the strict Unitarians (Monarchians), he also too <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> the same course with Hippolytus and his followers, declarin
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi> their teachin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> to be ditheism.
                    The <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ediation formula, however, proposed by Calixtus
                    became the bridge by which, in the course of the decades immediately followin
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi>, the doctrine of the Trinity made its way into the
                    Roman Church. In the year 250, when the Roman presbyter Novatian wrote his book
                    <hi rend="italic">De Trinitate,</hi> the doctrine of Hippolytus, once
                    discredited as ditheism, had already become official there. At the same time
                    Rome and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ost of the other churches of the West still
                    retained a certain leaning towards Modalistic monarchianism <hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi> This appears, on the one hand, in the use of expressions having a
                    Modalistic ring about them—see especially the poe <hi rend="italic">m</hi> s of
                    Commodian, written about the time of Valerian—and, on the other hand, in the
                    rejection of the doctrine that the Son is subordinate to the Father and is a
                    creature (witness the controversy between Dionysius of Alexandria and Dionysius
                    of Ro <hi rend="italic">m</hi> e), as well as in the readiness of the West to
                    accept the for <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ula of Athanasius, that the Father and
                    the Son are one and the same in substance (<hi rend="italic"
                    >ὁμοούσιοιo</hi>).</p>
                <p>The strict Modalists, whom Calixtus had excommunicated alon <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> with their most zealous opponent Hippolytus, were led by Sabellius, who
                    was perhaps a Libyan by birth. His party continued to subsist in Rome for a
                    considerable time afterwards,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the 18th century there was discovered in one of the
                    catacombs of Rome an inscription containing the words “quiet Filius diceris et
                    Pater inveniris.” This can only have come from a Sabellian.</p></note> and
                    withstood Calixtus as an unscrupulous apostate. In the West, however, the
                    influence of Sabellius seems never to have been important; in the East, on the
                    other hand, after the middle of the 3d century his doctrine found <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> uch acceptance, first in the Pentapolis and afterwards in
                    other provinces.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Whether
                    Sabellius himself ever visited the East is unknown.</p></note> It was violently
                    controverted by the bishops, notably by Dionysius of Alexandria, and the
                    development in the East of the philosophical doctrine of the Trinity after
                    Origen (from 260 to 320) was very powerfully influenced by the opposition to
                    Sabellianism. Thus, for example, at the <hi rend="italic">g</hi> reat synod held
                    in Antioch in 268 the "word <hi rend="italic">ὁμοούσιος</hi> was rejected, as
                    seemin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> to favour Unitarianism. The Sabellian doctrine
                    itself, however, durin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> the decades above mentioned
                    underwent many chan <hi rend="italic">g</hi> es in the East and received a
                    philosophical dress. In the 4th century this and the allied doctrine of
                    Marcellus of Ancyra were frequently confounded, so that it is exceedin <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> ly difficult to arrive at a clear account of it in its <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> enuine form <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Sabellianism, in fact,
                    became a collective name for all those Unitarian doctrines in which the divine
                    nature of Christ was acknowledged. The teachin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> of
                    Sabellius himself was indubitably very closely allied to the older Modalis <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> (“Patripassianism”) of Noetus and Praxeas, but was
                    distinguished from it by its more careful theological elaboration and by the
                    account it took of the Holy Spirit. His central proposition was to the effect
                    that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the same person, three names thus bein <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> attached to one and the same bein <hi rend="italic">g.</hi>
                    What weighed most with Sabellius was the monotheistic interest. The One Bein <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> was also named by him <hi rend="italic">υἱoπάτωρ</hi>,—an
                    expression purposely chosen to obviate ambiguity. To explain how one and the
                    same being could have various forms of manifestation, he pointed to the
                    tripartite nature of man (body, soul, spirit), and to the sun, which manifests
                    itself as a heavenly body, as a source of li <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ht, and
                    also as a source of warmth. He further maintained that God is not at one and the
                    same time Father, Son, and Spirit, but, on the contrary, has been active in
                    three consecutive energies,—first in the prosopon of the Father as Creator, then
                    in the prosopon of the Son as Redeemer, and lastly in the prosopon of the Spirit
                    as the Giver of Life. It is by this doctrine of the succession of the prosopa
                    that Sabellius is essentially distinguished from the older Modalists. In
                    particular it is si <hi rend="italic">g</hi> nificant, in conjunction with the
                    reference to the Holy Spirit, that Sabellius re <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ards
                    the Father also as merely a form of manifestation of the one God,—in other
                    words, has formally put Him in a position of complete equality with the other
                    Persons. This view prepares the way for Au <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ustine’s
                    doctrine of the Trinity. Sabellius himself appears to have made use of Stoical
                    formulas (<hi rend="italic">πλατύvεσθαι, σvστέλλεσθaι</hi>), but he chiefly
                    relied upon Scripture, especially such passages as Deut. vi. 4, Exod. xx. 3,
                    Isa. xliv. 6, John x. 38. Of his later history nothin <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    is known; his followers died out in the course of the 4th century.</p>
                <p>The sources of our knowledge of Sabellianism are Hippolytus <hi rend="italic"
