                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the citizens of Selinus were at war with the
                    adjoining people of Segesta, a non-Hellenic race who occupied the province north
                    of Selinus; the success of the Segestans on this occasion was mainly owing to
                    aid given them by colonists from Rhodes and Cnidus. Little is known about the
                    early history of Selinus; but the city evidently grew rapidly in wealth and
                    importance, and soon extended its borders 15 miles westwards to the river
                    Mazarus and eastwards as far as the Halycus (Diod., xiii. 54; Herod., v. 46).
                    Thucydides (vi. 20) mentions its power and wealth and especially the rich
                    treasures in its temples. From its early oligarchical form of government Selinus
                    passed to a short-lived despotism under the tyrant Pithagoras, who was deposed
                    soon after 510 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In 480 B.C., when the Carthaginian
                    Hamilcar invaded Sicily, the city took his side against their fellow Hellenes.
                    In 416 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> a new dispute between Selinus and Segesta
                    was eventually the cause of the fatal Athenian expedition against Sicily, the
                    Athenians acting as allies of Segesta and the Syracusans as allies of Selinus.
                    The conclusion of this expedition (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Syracuse)</hi> left
                    Segesta at the mercy of the Selinuntines, whose rapacity and cruelty soon
                    brought about their own destruction, through the aid which the Segestans
                    obtained from Carthage. In 409 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Hannibal, with an
                    overwhelming force, took and destroyed the city, the walls of which were razed
                    to the ground. He killed about 16,000 of the inhabitants, took 5000 prisoners,
                    and only a remnant of 2600 escaped to Agrigentum (Diod., xiii. 54-59). The
                    survivors were afterwards allowed to return and to rebuild Selinus as a city
                    subject to the Carthaginians, under whose yoke, in spite of their attempts to
                    regain freedom, the Selinuntines remained till <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 250,

                    xxiv.). It was never rebuilt, and is mentioned by Strabo (vi. p. 272) as being
                    one of the extinct cities of Sicily.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The ancient city occupied two elevated plateaus at the edge of the sea and also
                    part of the surrounding plain. The western of these elevations formed the
                    acropolis; on the other was the agora. The walls of the acropolis can still be
                    traced round the whole circuit; the only entrance was on the north-east. Remains
                    also exist of long walls connecting the city and its port. The chief glory of
                    Selinus was its double group of great temples,—three on the acropolis and three
                    in the agora, one of which was the largest peripteral temple in the world. All
                    are completely ruined, but the materials of each still remain almost perfect,
                    though scattered in confused heaps of stone; the extraordinary completeness of
                    these fragments is owing to the fact that the site has never been occupied since

                    settlement. The sculptured metopes from three of the temples are among the most
                    important examples of early Hellenic art (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Archaeology,</hi> vol. ii. p. 349, and Benndorf, <hi rend="italic">Lie Metopen
                    von Selinunt).</hi> The buildings themselves are of the highest interest, being
                    the earliest known examples of the Doric style, and differing in many important
                    details from all other examples, even such early ones as the temples at Corinth
                    and Syracuse.</p>
                <p>The three temples on the acropolis (A, C, D in fig.) stand side by side, with
                    their axes north-west to south-east; all are hexastyle and peripteral, with
                    either thirteen or fourteen columns on the sides. Their stylobates have four
                    high steps along the sides, with an easier approach of more steps at the
                    northwest fronts. To the middle one of the three belong the very archaic metopes
                    described in vol. ii. p. 349. All have a rather narrow cella with pronaos and
                    opisthodomus. Their archaic peculiarities are the rapid diminution of the
                    columns, the absence of entasis, the narrow mutules over the metopes, and
                    especially a curious cavetto or necking under the usual hypotrachelia. No other
                    example of this feature was known till 1884, when Dr Schliemann and Dr Dörpfeld
                    discovered a similar Doric capital among the ruins of the citadel of Tiryns. The
                    Tiryns capital dates probably from a little before 600 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> and appears to be nearly contemporary with that at Selinus. Between
                    temples A and C are remains of a small prostyle tetrastyle aedicula (B) of the
                    Doric order.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Strange to
                    say, Hittorff and Zanth (<hi rend="italic">Architecture Antique de Sicile,</hi>
                    Paris, 1870), in their elaborate work on this subject, restore this aedicula
                    with a Doric entablature on Ionic columns; a good many other similar absurdities
                    occur in this richly illustrated work. More judgment is shown in Serradifalco’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Antica Selinunto</hi> (Palermo, 1831-42), though it is not
                    always accurate in measurements.</p></note> The second group of three Doric
                    temples (E, F, G) belongs to a rather later date,—probably 500 to 440 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The first two (E and F) have very narrow cellae, so
                    that they are pseudodipteral. They also are hexastyle, with fourteen columns on
                    the sides. Though still early in detail, they are without the curious necking of
                    the acropolis temples. The sculptured metopes of temple E are of extraordinary
                    beauty and interest, and appear to date from the finest period of Greek art—the
                    age of Phidias or perhaps that of Myron. The chief subjects are Zeus and Hera on
                    Mount Olympus, Artemis and Actaeon, and Heracles defeating an Amazon. They are
                    of the noblest style, simple and highly sculpturesque in treatment, and full of
                    grace and expression. One remarkable peculiarity in their technique is that the
                    nude parts of the female figures (heads, feet, and hands) are executed in white
                    marble, while the rest of the reliefs are in the native grey tufa, which
                    originally was covered with marble-dust stucco and then painted. The whole of
                    the stonework of all the temples was treated in a similar way, and gives most
                    valuable examples of early Greek coloured decoration. Recent excavations at
                    Selinus have shown that in many cases the cornices and other architectural
                    features were covered with moulded slabs of terra cotta, all richly coloured<pb

                    peripteral temple of the whole Hellenic world, being almost exactly the same
                    size as the enormous pseudo - peripteral Olympeaeum at the neighbouring
                    Agrigentum. It was octastyle, pseudodipteral, with seventeen columns on the
                    sides, and measures 360 by 162 feet; the columns are 10 feet 7⅛ inches at the
                    base and were 48 feet 7 inches high. This gigantic building was never quite
                    completed, though the whole of the main structure was built. Most of the columns
                    still remain unfluted. In spite of the proportional narrowness of its cella, it
                    had an internal range of columns, probably two orders high, like those within
                    the cella at Paestum. The axes of these last three temples have exactly the same
                    inclination as those on the acropolis. The great temple of Zeus possesses some
                    of the curious archaisms of the acropolis temples, and, though never completed,
                    it was probably designed and begun at an earlier date than the two adjacent
                    buildings. These peculiarities are the ungracefully rapid diminution of the
                    shaft and the cavetto under the necking of the capitals. The whole of these six
                    massive buildings now lie in a complete state of ruin, a work of evidently
                    wilful destruction on the part of the Carthaginians, as the temple at Segesta,
                    not many miles distant, has still every column and its whole entablature quite
                    perfect; so it is impossible to suppose that an earthquake was the cause of the
                    utter ruin at Selinus. Few or no marks of fire are visible on the stone blocks.
