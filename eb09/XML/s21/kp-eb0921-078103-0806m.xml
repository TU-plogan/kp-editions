                    by Sir T. Browne, who sent a picture of it with an account that is given more
                    fully in Ray’s translation of that work (p. 334), stating that it is “a

                    1830, fol. 5. 22 and 31), written in or about 1662. Edwards (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Gleanings,</hi> iii. p. 315) speaks of comparing his own drawing “with Brown’s
                    old draught of it, still preserved in the British Museum,” and thus identifies
                    the latter’s “Shearwater” with the “Puffin of the Isle of Man.”</p></note>

                    are also used in Scotland. These are from the Scandinavian <hi rend="italic"

                    between the words <hi rend="italic">shear</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scrape</hi>
                    it may be that Browne’s hesitation as to the derivation of “Shearwater" had more
                    ground than at first appears.</p></note> Ray’s mistaking young birds of this

                    called <hi rend="smallcaps">Puffin,</hi> has already been mentioned under that
                    heading (vol. xx. p. 102); and not only has his name <hi rend="italic">Puffinus
                    anglorum</hi> hence become attached to this species, commonly described in
                    English books as the Manx Puffin or Manx Shearwater, but the barbarous and
                    misapplied word <hi rend="italic">Puffinus</hi> has come into regular use as the
                    generic term for all birds thereto allied, forming a well-marked group of the
                    Family <hi rend="italic">Procellariidae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Petrel,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 711), distinguished chiefly by their elongated
                    bill, and numbering some twenty species, if not more—the discrimination of
                    which, owing partly to the general similarity of some of them, and partly to the
                    change of plumage which others through age are believed to undergo, has taxed in
                    no common degree the ingenuity of those ornithologists who have ventured on the
                    difficult task of determining their characters. Shearwaters are found in nearly
                    all the seas and oceans of the world,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    distance from the land, though rarely resorting thereto, except in the
                    breedingseason. But they also penetrate to waters which may be termed inland, as
                    the Bosphorus, where they have long attracted attention by their daily passage
                    up and down the strait, in numerous flocks, hardly ever alighting on the
                    surface, and from this restless habit they are known to the French-speaking part
                    of the population as <hi rend="italic">âmes damnées,</hi> it being held by the
                    Turks that they are animated by condemned human souls. Four species of <hi

                    Kingdom; but the Manx Shearwater aforesaid is the only one that at all commonly
                    occurs or breeds in the British Islands. It is a very plain-looking bird, black
                    above and white beneath, and about the size of a Pigeon. Some other species
                    are<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n807/mode/1up"

                    of the former several are almost whole-coloured, being of a sooty or dark
                    cinereous hue both above and below. All over the world Shearwaters seem to have
                    precisely the same habits, laying their single purely white egg in a hole under
                    ground. The young are thickly clothed with long down, and are extremely fat. In
                    this condition they are thought to be good eating, and enormous numbers are
                    caught for this purpose in some localities, especially of a species, the <hi
