                    more than three inches long, it bears on its crown, the two sharp spurs with
                    which each wing is armed, and its elongated toes. Its plumage is plain in
                    colour, being of an almost uniform greyish black above, the space round the eyes
                    and a ring round the neck being variegated with white, and a patch of pale
                    rufous appearing above the carpal joint, while the lower parts of the body are
                    white. Closely related to this bird is another first described by Linnaeus as a
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Parra</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Jacana,</hi> vol.
                    xiii. p. 531), to which group it certainly does not belong, but separated
                    therefrom by Illiger to form the genus <hi rend="italic">Chauna,</hi> and now
                    known as <hi rend="italic">C. chavaria,</hi> very generally in English as the
                    “Crested Screamer,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Under this name its curious habits have been well described by Mr W. H.
                    Hudson (<hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine,</hi> Sept. 1885, pp.
                    280-287).</p></note> a name which was first bestowed on the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Seriema</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> This bird inhabits the lagoons and
                    swamps of Paraguay and Southern Brazil, where it is called “Chajá” or “Chaka,”
                    and is smaller than the preceding, wanting its “horn,” but having its head
                    furnished with a dependent crest of feathers. Its face and throat are white, to
                    which succeeds a blackish ring, and the rest of the lower parts are white, more
                    or less clouded with cinereous. According to Mr Gibson <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Ibis,</hi> 1880, pp. 165, 166), its nest is a light construction of dry
                    rushes, having its foundation in the water, and contains as many as six eggs,
                    which are white tinged with buff. The young are covered with down of a yellowish
                    brown colour. A most singular habit possessed by this bird is that of rising in
                    the air and soaring there in circles at an immense altitude, uttering at
                    intervals the very loud cry of which its local name is an imitation. From a
                    dozen to a score may be seen at once so occupying themselves. The young are
                    often taken from the nest and reared by the people to attend upon and defend
                    their poultry, a duty which is faithfully<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hence Latham’s name for this species is “Faithful
                    Jacana,”—he supposing it to belong to the genus in which Linnaeus placed
                    it.</p></note> and, owing to the spurs with which the Chaka’s wings are armed,
                    successfully discharged. Another very curious property of this bird, which was
                    observed by Jacquin, who brought it to the notice of Linnaeus,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Tacta manu cutis, sub pennis
                    etiam lanosa, crepat ubique fortiter” <hi rend="italic">(Syst. Nat.,</hi> ed.
                    12, i. p. 260).</p></note> is its emphysematous condition,—there being a layer
                    of air-cells between the skin and the muscles, so that on any part of the body
                    being pressed a crackling sound is heard. In Central America occurs another
                    species, <hi rend="italic">C. derbiana,</hi> chiefly distinguished by the darker
                    colour of its plumage. For this a distinct genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ischyrornis,</hi> was proposed, but apparently without necessity, by
                    Reichenbach <hi rend="italic">(Syst. Avium,</hi> p. xxi.).</p>
                <p>The taxonomic position of the <hi rend="italic">Palamedeidae,</hi> for all will
                    allow to the Screamers the rank of a Family at least, has been much debated, and
                    cannot be regarded as fixed. Their Anserine relations were pointed out by Prof.
                    Parker in the Zoological <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for 1863 (pp.
                    511-518), and in the same work for 1867 Prof. Huxley placed the Family among his
                    <hi rend="italic">Chenomorphae</hi>; but this view was contravened in 1876 by
                    Garrod, who said, “The Screamers must have sprung from the primary avian stock
                    as an independent offshoot at much the same time as did most of the other
                    important families.” Accordingly in 1880 Mr Sclater regarded them as forming a
                    distinct “Order,” <hi rend="italic">Palamedeae,</hi> which he, however, placed
                    next to the true <hi rend="italic">Anseres,</hi> from the neighbourhood of
                    which, as has been already stated <hi rend="smallcaps">(Ornithology,</hi> vol.
                    xviii. p. 47), the present writer thinks the <hi rend="italic">Palamedeidae</hi>
                    can hardly be removed. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
