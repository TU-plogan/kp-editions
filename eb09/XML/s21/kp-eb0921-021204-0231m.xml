                    some indefinite period the internal affairs of the several Teutonic tribes whose
                    names they bear.</p>
                <p>(1) The <hi rend="italic">Salic Law</hi> originated with the Salian Franks, often
                    simply called Salians, the chief tribe of that conglomeration of Teutonic
                    peoples known as <hi rend="smallcaps">Franks</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi>
                    The latter first appear in history about 240 (Vopisc., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic">Aurel.,</hi> c. 7), after which date we find them
                    carrying on an almost uninterrupted struggle with the Roman empire, till 486,
                    when they finally established a kingdom of their own in provinces which had
                    previously been considered Roman. The Salian Franks first appear under their
                    specific name in 358, when they had penetrated westwards as far as Toxandria
                    (Texandria, now Tessenderloo, in Limburg, the region to the south and west of
                    the lower Meuse), where they were subdued by the emperor Julian (Ammian., xvii.
                    8). As regards their previous history nothing is known with certainty, though it
                    seems probable that the Franks who occupied the Batavian island <hi
                    rend="italic">c.</hi> 290, and were there conquered in 292 by Constantius
                    Chlorus <hi rend="italic">(Paneg. incerti auth.,</hi> c. 4), and thence
                    transplanted into Gaul, were the Salian Franks. We find, moreover, such un<pb

                    1, the Franks at one time inhabited the town of Sicambria. The earliest Frankish
                    kings, who were undoubtedly kings of the Salian Franks, are often called
                    Sigambri, and always with the object of honouring them. St Remigius, when he
                    baptized Clovis, exhorted him, “Mitis depone colla Sicamber” (Greg. Tur., ii.
                    31). Venantius Fortunatus (vi. 4) says to King Charibert, “Cum sis progenitus
                    clara de gente Sygamber.” For further evidence, comp. Waitz, <hi rend="italic"

                    by some regarded as the descendants of the Sigambri whom Tiberius removed in 8
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> from their home on the right bank of the Rhine;
                    and it is argued that he did not transform them into the Gugerni, nor place them
                    on the Merwede, a stream and locality near Dordrecht and Zwijndrecht, but
                    transplanted them into the region now called the Veluwe, between the Utrecht
                    Vecht and the Eastern Yssel, where the Romans probably made of them what the
                    Batavi had been for years past—their allies—perhaps on the same condition as the
                    latter, who merely furnished the Romans with men and arms. This accounts for the
                    Sigambrian cohort in the Thracian War in 26 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Some
                    think, however, that the Salians were a separate tribe of the Franks who merely
                    coalesced with the Sigambri (comp. Watterich, <hi rend="italic">Die Gerinanen
                    des Rheins;</hi> Waitz, <hi rend="italic">Verfass.,</hi> ii. 24). In 431 the
                    Frankish (Salic) king Chlodio (Chlojo, Chlogio), said to have been a son (or the
                    father) of Merovech, the founder of the Merovingian dynasty (Greg. Tur., ii. 9),
                    took Cambrai and advanced his dominion as far as the Somme (Greg., <hi
                    rend="italic">ib.;</hi> Sid. Apoll., v. 211 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> though
                    still acknowledging Roman supremacy. Childerich reigned from 457 to 481, and
                    resided at Tournai, where his grave was discovered in 1653. His son Clovis
                    (Chlovis, Chlodovech) in 486 extended his empire to the Seine (Greg. Tur., ii.
                    43, 27). For an account of him, see vol. ix. pp. 528, 529.</p>

                    how long it remained in force. Our knowledge of the code is derived—(i.) from
                    ten texts, preserved in a comparatively large number of manuscripts, chiefly
                    written in the 8th and 9th centuries; (ii.) from allusions to a Salic Law in
                    various charters and other documents. But the Latin texts do not contain the
                    original Salic Law. This is clear (a) from the allusions we find in them to a
                    “Lex Salica” and “Antiqua Lex,” which can hardly be anything but references to
                    another and earlier Lex Salica <hi rend="italic">; (b)</hi> from a certain
                    peculiarity and awkwardness in the construction of the Latin, which, though it
                    is so-called Merovingian, and therefore very corrupt, would have been different
                    if the texts were original compilations <hi rend="italic">; (c)</hi> from a
                    number of words, found in nearly every paragraph of certain groups of the MSS.,
                    and now known as “Malberg glosses,” which are evidently the remains of a
                    vernacular Salic Law, and appear to have been retained in the Latin versions, in
                    some cases because the translators seemed doubtful as to whether their Latin
                    terms correctly rendered the meaning of the original, in other cases because
                    these words had become legal terms, and indicated a certain fine. We do not know
                    'whether the original Frankish law-book was ever reduced to writing, or merely
                    retained in, and handed down to posterity from, the memory of some persons
                    charged with the preservation of the law. All that we know of such an original
                    is contained in a couple of prologues (apparently later than the texts
                    themselves) found in certain MSS. of the existing</p>
                <p>Latin versions. One of them states that four men “in villis quae ultra Renum sunt
                    per tres mallos (judicial assemblies) convenientes, omnes causarum origines
                    sollicite discutiendo tractantes, judicium decreverunt,” which must refer to a
                    period before 358, as in that year the Salian Franks had already crossed the
                    Rhine and occupied the Batavian island and Toxandria. Another prologue says that
                    the Salic Law was compiled <hi rend="italic">(dictare)</hi> while the Franks
                    were still heathens (therefore before 496), and afterwards emended by Clovis,
                    Childebert, and Chlotar. Nor can it be stated with certainty when the Latin
                    translations which we now possess were made, but it must have been after Clovis
                    had extended his power as far as the Loire (486-507), as in chapter 47 the
                    boundaries of the Frankish empire are stated to be the Carbonaria Silva (in
                    southern Belgium between Tournai and Liége) and the Loire.<note anchored="true"

                <p>There exist five Latin recensions, more or less different. (i.) The earliest of
                    the code (handed down in four MSS. with little difference, and very likely
                    compiled shortly after Clovis extended his empire to the Loire) consists of
                    sixty-five chapters (with the Malberg glosses). In the course of the 6th century
                    a considerable number of chapters appear to have been added (under the title of
                    “edicts” or “decrees ”), some of which are ascribed to Clovis, and the remainder
                    to his successors before the end of the century. One of them (chap. 78) may with
                    some certainty be ascribed to Hilperic (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 574). Some
                    others seem to have originated with Childebert I. and Chlotar I. (whose joint
                    reign lasted from 511 to 558), and are known collectively as “Pactus Childeberti
                    et Chlotharii.” From internal evidence we may infer that this first version
                    dates from a time when Christianity had not yet become general among the Franks.
                    (ii.) Two MSS. contain a second recension, having the same sixty-five chapters
                    (with the Malberg glosses) as the first, but with numerous interpolations and
                    additions, which point to a later period. Especially may this be said of the
                    paragraph (in chap. 13) which pronounces fines on marriages between near
                    relatives, and which is presumed to have been embodied in the Lex Salica from an
                    edict of Childebert II. issued in 596. In chapter 55 paragraphs six and seven
                    speak of a “basilica,” of a “basilica sancti-ficata,” and of a “basilica ubi
                    requiescunt reliquiae,” but it is more than doubtful whether we have here any
                    evidences of Christianity, though a later recension (the fourth) altered
                    “basilica” into “ecclesia,” the “reliquiae” into “reliquiae sanctorum,” and
                    thereby gave a decidedly Christian aspect to the clause. (iii.) A third
                    recension is contained in a group of nine MSS. (divided into two classes), three
                    of which have the same text (with the Malberg glosses) as the MSS. of the first
                    and second recensions, divided, however, systematically into ninety-nine
                    chapters, while the other six MSS. have the same ninety-nine chapters, with very
                    little difference, but without the Malberg glosses. This text seems to have been
                    arranged in Pippin’s or Charlemagne’s reign (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 765-779).
                    The clause on marriages between near relatives mentioned above is not found in
                    this recension. On the other hand, we find in chapter 55 ( = 77) fines
                    pronounced on the murder of a presbyter and deacon (no bishop yet mentioned),
                    while the six MSS. of the second class do not contain chapter 99 (“De
                    Chrenecruda”), but merely say that the symbolism described in that chapter had
                    been observed in heathen times, and was to be no longer in force, (iv.) The
                    fourth version (handed down in a great number of MSS., and embodying in seventy
                    chapters substantially the whole of the previous versions) is usually called <hi
                    rend="italic">Lex Salica Emendata,</hi> as the text bears traces of having been
                    emended (by Charlemagne), which operation seems to have consisted in<pb

                    correcting the Latin, omitting a certain number of paragraphs, and inserting
                    some new ones. In chapter 55 the bishop is mentioned with the presbyter and the
                    deacon, (v.) Finally, we have a fifth text, which seems an amalgamation of the
                    previous recensions, more especially of the second, third, and fourth, but here
                    and there with considerable differences. It was published in 1557, at Basel, by
                    Bas. Joh. Herold <hi rend="italic">(Originum ac Germanicarum Antiquitatum
                    Libri)</hi>; but no trace of the Fulda and other MSS. which the editor says that
                    he used has hitherto been found.</p>
                <p>The Salic code consists of enactments regarding procedure in lawsuits (chaps. 1,
                    18, 26, 37, 46-53, 56, 57, 60), judicial fines and penalties for various kinds
                    of theft and kidnapping (2-8, 10-12, 21- 23, 27, 28, 33-35, 38-40, 55, 61), for
                    offences, injuries, &amp;c., to persons, animals, and property (9, 15-17, 19,
                    20, 24, 25, 29-32, 36, 41-43, 64, 65); it regulates the “wergeld” (a word found
                    only in the text published by Herold; all the other texts have <hi rend="italic"
                    >leodis, leudis</hi> = people, associate of the people) of all classes of
                    persons living under the Salic Law (41-43, 54, 63), the share of the kindred in
                    the composition for homicide (58-62), the devolution of property and inheritance

                    aristocracy is not mentioned. The people lived together in villages (chap. 45);
                    they exercised agriculture and reared cattle (2-5, 27, &amp;c.); they hunted and
                    fished (6, 33); vineyards and gardens were known to them (27, 6, &amp;c.); and
                    gold work and iron work are mentioned (10). The chief of the state was a king;

                <p>The famous clause in the Salic Law by which, it is commonly said, women are
                    precluded from succession to the throne, and which alone has become known in
                    course of time as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Salic Law, is the fifth paragraph
                    of chapter 59 (with the rubric “De Alodis ”), in which the succession to private
                    property is regulated. The chapter opens with four (five) paragraphs in which it
                    is enacted that—(1) if a man died without male issue, his mother (so in first
                    recension; the second to fifth have “pater aut mater ”) would succeed to the
                    inheritance (in hereditatem succedat); (2) failing her (the father and mother),
                    his brother (brothers) or sister (sisters); (3) failing these, the sister of the
                    mother; (1) when there was no sister of the mother, the sisters (sister) of the
                    father; and (5), failing these, the nearest relative. After this the fifth
                    paragraph reads as follows :—</p>

                <p>It seems clear that the first four paragraphs of the chapter, which admit women
                    to a share in the inheritance, refer to <hi rend="italic">private, movable</hi>
                    property, and that, by the fifth paragraph, the inheritance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >land</hi> was exclusively confined to males. We know that this exclusion of
                    women from landed property was hardly a rule anywhere in the Frankish empire,
                    and certainly not in the 6th century, but it obtained more or less afterwards,
                    especially during the feudal period, when all the owners of landed property <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the tenants of fiefs) were liable to military service.
                    We do not know when this exclusion of women from landed property began first to
                    be applied and extended to an exclusion from the succession of thrones, as we do
                    not read of such a notion until the middle of the 14th century during the
                    controversy between Edward III. and Philip of Valois, when it was alleged to be
                    derived from the Salic Law. It will be observed that the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salica</hi> is not found in the oldest existing recension, but appears first in
                    the second text, which some would ascribe to the end of the 6th century. Nor is
                    the word found in the corresponding paragraph (56,4) of the Lex Ripuaria, which
                    was based on the Salic Law. This addition (retained in all the other recensions,
                    also in the so-called Lex Emendata) was no doubt made for some purpose, but we
                    do not know whether it was made by a scribe, nor what particular notion it was
                    intended to convey, nor whether it was this special word which gave rise to the
                    idea of women being precluded from the succession of thrones.</p>
                <p>The various texts of the Lex Salica, arranged in parallel columns, with a
                    commentary on the Malberg glosses, were published in 1880, under the title <hi

                <p>Having treated of the Salic Law somewhat minutely, we need only say a few words
                    about each of the other <hi rend="italic">leges barbarorum,</hi> as they all
                    present somewhat similar features, and hardly differ except in the time of their
                    compilation, the amount of fines, the number and nature of the crimes, the
                    number, rank, duties, and titles of the officers, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>(2) The <hi rend="italic">Ripuarian Law,</hi> or Law of the Ripuarian Franks (<hi
                    rend="italic">Lex Ripuaria</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Riboaria, L.
                    Ripuariorum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ribuariomm, L. Ripuariensis</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Ribuariensis), or</hi> inhabitants of the river-banks, was in
                    force among the East or Rhenish Franks in the Provincia Ribuaria, also called
                    Ducatus or Pagus Ribuarius (see vol. ix. p. 723), of which Cologne was the chief
                    town. It has much in common with the Salic Law; in fact, chapters 32-64 are,
                    with the exception of some necessary modifications and additions, merely a
                    repetition of the corresponding chapters of the Salic Law, and even follow the
                    same arrangement, so that this part of the code is hardly anything but the Salic
                    Law revised by order of the kings of Austrasia. Professor Sohm (whose edition,
                    published in 1883 in <hi rend="italic">Mon. Germ. Hist.,</hi> Legg., vol. v.
                    part 2, is based on nearly forty MSS., written between the 8th and the 11th
                    century) divides the eighty-nine chapters of this code into four distinct
                    portions, ascribing the first portion (chaps. 1-31), which contains enactments
                    not met with in the Salic Law, to the first part of the 6th century, the second
                    (chaps. 32-64) to the second part of the same century (c. 575), the third
                    (chaps. 65-79) to the 7th century, and the fourth (chaps. 80-89) to the
                    beginning of the 8th century. This result practically agrees with the statements
                    found in a prologue in certain MSS. (which contain some of the barbarian codes),
                    where it is said that the “Leges Francorum ( = Lex Ripuariorum), Alamannorum, et
                    Bajuvariorum” were compiled at Châlons-sur-Marne at the dictation of Thierry I.
                    (511-534), by wise men learned in the law of his kingdom, and that the codes
                    were afterwards revised and amended by Childebert I., Chlotar I., and Dagobert.
                    Charlemagne promulgated some additional chapters to the Ripuarian Law in 803 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mon. Germ. Hist.,</hi> Legg., i. 117). We may here observe that
                    the Salic and Ripuarian Laws were to some extent introduced into England by the
                    Norman Conquest, as appears from the Laws of Henry I., where we find enactments
                    “secundum Legem Salicam” and “secundum Legem Ripnariam”; comp. Leg. Hen. I.,
                    capp. 87, §§ 9, 10, 11 (word for word = L. Sal., tit. 43), 89, 90 § 4 ( = L
                    Rip., 70), and 83 § 5 ( = L. Sal., tit. 55 § 4).<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n234/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0234-0215"/> (3) With the Ripuarian Law the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lex Francorum Chamavorum</hi> is intimately connected. The two MSS. in which it
                    is preserved call it “Notitia vel commemoratio de illa ewa (law) quae se ad
                    Amorem habet.” Amor is the district called Hamarlant, Hamalant, Hammelant,
                    Hamuland, in the 9th century. This name was derived from the Chamavi, a German
                    state mentioned by Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Ann.,</hi> xiii. 55; <hi
                    rend="italic">Gcrm.,c.</hi> 33, 34), which afterwards constituted a part of the
                    Frankish empire. In the 9th century Hamalant was a part of the Pagus
                    Ribuarioruin. The whole code consists of only fortyeight short paragraphs, which
                    are apparently nothing but statements made in answer to the “missi dominici”
                    whom Charlemagne despatched to the various nations of his empire to inquire into
                    their condition and to codify their respective laws. It may therefore be
                    ascribed to the beginning of the 9th century (802 or 803). Professor Sohm has
                    published it as an appendix to the Lex Ripuaria (<hi rend="italic">Mon</hi>. <hi
                    rend="italic">Germ. Hist.,</hi> Legg., vol. v. part 2, p. 269).</p>
                <p>(4) The <hi rend="italic">Lex Alamannorum</hi> was (according to the prologue
                    mentioned above) first compiled by the East-Frankish king Thierry (511-534), and
                    afterwards improved and renewed by Childebert I. (511-558), Chlotar I. (558),
                    and Dagobert I. (622-638). Although not much reliance can be placed on this
                    statement, the researches of Professor Merkel, who edited the code from
                    forty-eight MSS. <hi rend="italic">{Mon. Germ. Hist.,</hi> Legg., vol. iii.),
                    show that some kind of code called Pactus (of which he published three
                    fragments) was cornpiled for the Alamanni in the reign of Chlotar I. (537-561).
                    Under Chlotar II. (613-622) a more complete code, consisting of seventy-five
                    chapters, was compiled, which was revised under Dagobert (628) and augmented
                    with chapters 76-97; it was again altered and augmented under the Alamannic duke
                    Landfrid (d. 730), whose work Merkel calls <hi rend="italic">Lex Alamannorum
                    Lantfridana,</hi> and finally augmented in the Carolingian period (hence called
                    <hi rend="italic">Lex Alamannorum Karolina sive reformata),</hi> perhaps early
                    in the 9th century. The code consists of 97 (in some MSS. 98, 99, 105, and 107)
                    chapters.</p>
                <p>(5) The <hi rend="italic">Lex Bajuvariorum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pactus
                    Bawarorum,</hi> had the same origin as the Lex Alamannorum, if we accept the
                    somewhat unreliable statement of the prologue spoken of above. It seems probable
                    that some kind of code was compiled for the Bavarians during the reigns of
                    Clovis’s sons. Those paragraphs which treat of ecclesiastical affairs and the
                    position of the Bavarian dukes towards the Frankish kings (tit. ii. chap. xx. §
                    3) have clearly been inserted in Dagobert’s time, if not later. There is a great
                    similarity between certain provisions of the Bavarian and the Alamannic codes,
                    and also some paragraphs of the former have been derived from the earliest
                    recension of the Lex Wisigothorum. Some additions were made by Duke Thassilo II.
                    (763-775), some by Charlemagne (803), some by King Louis (<hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi>. 906), and, finally, some by Duke Henry II. (end of 10th century). The
                    emperor Henry III. is alleged to have granted the law of the Bavarians to the
                    Hungarians in 1044. It consists of twenty-one chapters, each containing several
                    paragraphs. Professor Merkel distinguishes three different recensions of the
                    code and various additions, which he edited in 1863 from thirty-five MSS. for
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mon. Germ. Hist.,</hi> Legg., iii. p. 183 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi></p>
                <p>(6) For the <hi rend="italic">Lex Frisionum,</hi> see vol. ix. p. 789.</p>
                <p>(7) <hi rend="italic">The Lex Angliorum et Werinorum, hoc est, Thuringorum,</hi>
                    consists of seventeen chapters. Early editions of this code contained some legal
                    decisions identical with those of Judge Wlemarus in the appendix to the Lex
                    Frisionum (L. Angl. Jud. Wlem., 1, 2, 6, 7 <hi rend="italic">— L.</hi> Fris.,
                    22, §§ 54, 55, 86; Addit., i. 18), from which circumstance it was inferred that
                    the compilation, or at least the revision, of both codes took place at one and
                    the same time (802-803). But Richthofen, who edited the work in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mon. Germ. Hist.</hi> (Legg., v. p. 103), and who rejects these
                    legal decisions of Wlemarus as not belonging to this code at all, is of opinion
                    (p. 115) that the code was not written even at the end of the 9th century.
                    Opinions have differed also as to the region where the law originated. Some
                    ascribe it to the Angli and Werini, who inhabited the Holstein and Schleswig
                    regions; others attribute it to Thuringia proper; and in more recent times it
                    has been ascribed to Thuringia on the left bank of the Rhine ( = South Holland,
                    Brabant, &amp;c.). It was also argued that the code must have originated in a
                    region where Frisian and Frankish elements had become mixed, both in language
                    and in law, and where the Frankish preponderated. That the code originated in
                    South Holland was inferred from its agreement in some respects with the Lex
                    Chamavorum, which originated in the region of the lower Rhine and the Yssel. And
                    the law may have come to be in force among the allied tribes on the Elbe in
                    northern Thuringia, even though it originated in South Holland. If it originated
                    in Thuringia, it must have been transplanted to the Holstein and Schleswig
                    regions; and it was used by the Danes, as is clear from Canute bringing it over
                    to England when he conquered the country in 1013.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comp. <hi rend="italic">Canuti Constit. de

                    Legem Werinorum, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., Thuringorum [= L. Angl. and
                    Werin., i. 2] est 200 solidorum.”</p></note> But in England the code was simply
                    called “Lex Werinorum, h.e., Thuringorum,” but no longer “Anglorum,” as the
                    Danes called the whole Anglo-Saxon population which they had conquered “Angli,”
                    and the law which they found in force “Lex Anglorum” (Legg. Edw. Conf., c. 30).
                    Hence it has been concluded that what was called in England Lex Danorum is
                    nothing but the Lex Werinorum. When the Normans conquered England in 1066 they
                    soon recognized that this Lex Danorum and the Law of the Norwegians (Lex
                    Noricorum or Norwegeusium), who had migrated to England in earlier times, were
                    practically one and the same. Hence William I., declaring that the population
                    which he had brought over with him from Normandy were also originally
                    Norwegians, resolved to abrogate the Anglo-Saxon laws and to leave only that of
                    the Danes in force (Legg. Edw. Conf., c. 30),—a plan which only the most
                    persevering entreaties of the Anglo-Saxon barons could induce him to abandon.
                    The latest edition of this code (1875) is by K. F. von Richthofen, who is
                    decidedly against the South Holland origin of the law.</p>
                <p>(8) The <hi rend="italic">Lex Saxonum</hi> consists of nineteen chapters or
                    sixty-six articles or paragraphs, and appears to be composed of three essential
                    parts, the oldest of which (arts. 1-23) seems to have existed before the later
                    additions known as the Capitulare Paderbornense (de partibus Saxoniae) of 785
                    (or 777) and the Capitulare Saxonicum of 797 (in which a “Lex Saxonum” and “Ewa
                    Saxonum” are referred to; comp, chaps. 33 and 7, 8, 10); the second part (arts.
                    24-60) must have been compiled after that date; and the third (arts. 61-66) was
                    probably added in 798, when Charlemagne had removed a part of the Saxon nobility
                    as hostages from their own country; while the whole was united into one code at
                    the diet of Aix-la-Chapelle in 802-803 (Merkel, <hi rend="italic">Lex
                    Saxonum,</hi> Berlin, 1853). The enactments of this code are far more severe
                    than those of any other of the barbarian laws, and it often inflicts capital
                    punishment for crimes which the other laws punish with mere pecuniary fines, as,
                    for instance, theft and incendiarism. This rigour Charlemagne softened by
                    reserving to himself the right of asylum and pardon, but it was expressly
                    retained and granted anew by Conrad II. (1024-1039). The code was edited in 1875
                    by Von Richthofen in <hi rend="italic">Mon. Germ. Hist.,</hi> Legg., v. p. 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi></p>
                <p>(9) The <hi rend="italic">Leges Anglo-Saxonum</hi> are for a great part written
                    in Anglo-Saxon, and as such may be reckoned among the most ancient monuments of
                    the Teutonic language. They appeared mostly in the form of constitutions
                    promulgated by the various kings (somewhat like the Frankish capitularies), with
                    the co-operation of an assembly of leading men (“sapientes,” Beda, <hi
                    rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> ii. 5), and frequently also of the clergy (<hi
                    rend="italic">concilium, synodus).</hi> They may be divided into two
                    classes,—secular and ecclesiastical laws. Sometimes they are mere judicial
                    sentences <hi rend="italic">(dôm)</hi> or treaties of peace (<hi rend="italic"
                    >frio).</hi> The earliest laws we have are those of AEthelbert, king of Kent
                    (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 561); then follow those of Hlodhaer (<hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi>. 678) and Eâdrîc (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 685), Wihtraed
                    (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 691), Ine (after 688), AElfred (after 871), Eadward
                    (after 901), AEthelstan (after 924), Eadmund (after 941), Edgar (after 959),
                    AEthelred II. (after 978), the Danish Canute (after 1017), William the Conqueror
                    (after 1066). Then follow two collections of laws, the so-called “Leges Edwardi
                    Confessoris” and “Leges Henrici I.,” which, drawing from the Anglo-Saxon Law,
                    represent the modifications which had been made in the earliest laws during the
                    Norman period, and the introduction of new elements derived from the Salic and
                    Ripuarian Laws. Besides these there are a good many canons and other
                    ecclesiastical ordinances enacted under the archbishops Theodore and Ecgbert and
                    King Edgar, &amp;c.; comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">England,</hi> vol. viii. pp.
                    285, 303. There is an edition of these laws by B. Thorpe (fol., London, 1840),
                    another by Dr Reinh. Schmid (<hi rend="italic">Die Gcsetze der
                    Angel-Sachsen,</hi> 2d ed., 8vo, Leipsic, 1858).</p>
                <p>(10) The compilation of the <hi rend="italic">Lex Burgundionum</hi> is usually
                    ascribed to Gundobald (d. 516), whence it is also called <hi rend="italic">Lex
                    Gundobada</hi> (corrupted <hi rend="italic">Gombata,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Loi Gombette).</hi> It consists, according to its first prologue, of a
                    collection of constitutions enacted partly by the earlier kings of Burgundy,
                    partly by Gundobald, and revised by a general Burgundian diet. This agrees with
                    the statements contained in its second prologue, which itself may be regarded as
                    an independent constitution or edict to the counts and judges regarding the
                    introduction of the law. In the rubric which it bears in the MSS. it is said
                    that it was promulgated at Lyons on 29th March in the second year of Gundobald
                    (some MSS. read Sigismund). As the year of Gundobald’s accession is supposed to
                    be 465, the promulgation must have taken place in 467, or, if we assume that the
                    year is meant in which Gundobald became sole king of Burgundy (478), the date of
                    the law would be 480, while it would be 517 if we adopt the reading “Sigismund”
                    of some of the MSS. But as the law in its present state contains decrees both of
                    Gundobald and of Sigismund we can only regard the whole as a compilation
                    effected by the latter. In early editions the law was divided into eighty-nine
                    chapters, with two additamenta, the first of which (consisting of twenty
                    chapters) was ascribed to Sigismund, the second (of thirteen chapters) to his
                    brother and successor, the last king of the Burgundians, Godomar. But Professor
                    Bluhme (who published the law in 1863, in <hi rend="italic">Mon. Germ.
                    Hist.,</hi> Legg., iii. 497) places chap. i. (De causis itineribus et aliis
                    servitutibus) and chap. xix. (De liberali causa) of the first additamentum as
                    chaps.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n235/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0235-0216"/> xvii. and xliv. in “Papianus”; chap. xx. as chap.
                    cvi. (extravagant) and its remaining chapters as chapters lxxxix. to cv. The
                    second additamentum is placed as chap, cvii., the old chap, lxxxix. as chap,
                    cviii., and a new chapter cix. (a decree of Sigismund “De collectis” of 516)
                    added. It was Gundobald’s intention that his law should decide all cases between
                    Burgundians and between them and Romans; in all other cases the latter would
                    only use Roman law (comp, second preface), of which the Lex Burgundionum
                    contains many traces, and even the Burgundians were allowed to use Roman law
                    (comp. L. Burg., titt. 43, 60, 55 § 2). The Latinity of the Burgundian Law is
                    purer than that of all the preceding barbarian codes, and we find in it a
                    distinct tendency to treat Romans with greater leniency and to make them equal
                    to the Burgundians in the eye of the law. Through Gundobald’s political
                    relations with Alaric II., the Lex Burgundionum influenced the West-Gothic
                    legislation, of which traces are found in the Lex Wisigothorum and the
                    interpretatio to Alaric’s Breviarium. Charlemagne promulgated in 813 a
                    Capitulare Aquisgranum (<hi rend="italic">Mom</hi>., Legg., i. 817) regarding
                    the Lex Burgundionum, though the text was not altered. Agobart, bishop of Lyons,
                    complained to Louis the Pious respecting certain abuses caused by the Burgundian
                    Law (Bouquet, vi. 356), but no remedy was effected. On the other hand, towards
                    the end of the 9th century the law had gradually fallen into disuse like all the
                    other barbarian laws, though it is said that the emperor Conrad II. revived and
                    confirmed it. See, besides Professor Bluhme’s edition, Hube, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist. de la formation de la loi Bourguignonne,</hi> Paris, 1867.</p>
                <p>(10a) In the second preface to the Lex Burgundionum (published in 502) the Roman
                    subjects of the Burgundian king were promised a codification of their own laws.
                    This work appears to have been promptly executed and was published under the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Lex Romana Burgundionum,</hi> perhaps before the
                    compilation of the Breviarium Alarici (506). This collection is also known as
                    <hi rend="italic">Papianus,</hi> of which name (found already in MSS. of the 9th
                    century) no satisfactory explanation has hitherto been offered, some, perhaps
                    wrongly, supposing that it is a corruption of the name of Papinianus, the Roman
                    jurist. It was published by Professor Bluhme as an appendix to the Lex
                    Burgundionum (<hi rend="italic">Mon</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Germ. Hist.,</hi>
                    Legg., iii. p. 579).</p>
                <p>(11) As regards the <hi rend="italic">Lex Wisigothorum</hi> (also called <hi
                    rend="italic">Forum Judicum, Judicum Liber, Forum Judiciale,</hi> &amp;c.), we
                    know with certainty from Isidore of Seville <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Goth.
                    Hisp.,</hi> 504) that Euric (466-483) was the first Gothic king who gave written
                    laws to the West Goths. It would therefore be erroneous to ascribe (with
                    Mariana, <hi rend="italic">Hist. de España,</hi> v. 6) their first written laws
                    to Euric’s son, Alaric II., though it seems probable that the latter, by adding
                    his own laws to those of his father, was really the first author of a
                    West-Gothic codification. Isidore refers to the collection of laws (as it had
                    been preserved up to the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 6th century) as
                    the Laws of Euric, though we must assume that the statutes of the kings who
                    succeeded Euric had already been added to his collection. Isidore also tells us
                    <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Goth. Hisp.,</hi> 606-624) that Leovigild (d. 586)
                    revised Euric’s Laws. As Isidore was bishop of Seville from 599 to 636, and may
                    therefore be said to have been a contemporary of Leovigild, his testimony may be
                    accepted as conclusive, though a much later but untrustworthy tradition would
                    have it that the revision was executed by Leovigild’s son, Reccared I. (the
                    first Catholic king of the Goths), who died in 601, whereby the whole population
                    of Spain was equalized in point of law. According to Spanish traditions of the
                    12th century, the West-Gothic collection of laws was again revised, under
                    Sisenand, by the fourth council of Toledo (633), a revision on which Isidore
                    seems to have exercised some influence. It is uncertain, however, whether the
                    code was then systematically arranged and divided into twelve books, as we now
                    have it, or whether this was done under Chindaswinth (d. 652) or under his son
                    Receswinth (d. 672). The several books of the code are divided (in imitation of
                    the codes of Theodosius and Justinianus) into tituli, and those again into
                    chapters or constitutions. From Leovigild down to Egica (d. 701) and his son and
                    coregent Witiza (d. c. 701, the last king of the Goths before the invasion of
                    the Moors) every constitution bears the name of the king who promulgated it,
                    while those dating from before Leovigild have the word “antiqua” prefixed to
                    them instead of the name of a king. This designation is said to have been
                    commenced by Erwig (680-687), who thereby wished to prevent the clergy from
                    claiming the code as their work. Of the texts which existed before the fourth
                    council of Toledo only one small fragment has come down to us, in a palimpsest
                    preserved in the Paris National Library (No. 1278). Some regard this as the
                    remainder of the supposed recension of Reccared I.; others regard it as a
                    fragment of the Laws of Euric, though it could in no case be the Laws of Euric
                    themselves, but at most their codification by Alaric II. The fragment was known
                    to the Benedictines <hi rend="italic">(Nouv. Traité de Diplom.,</hi> i. 483,
                    iii. 52, 152, note 1), and was published in 1847 by Professor Bluhme <hi
                    rend="italic">(Die Westgoth. Antiqua oder das Gesctzbuch Reccared's I.,</hi>
                    Halle). The text is undoubtedly older than those enactments which we find
                    designated as “antiqua,” so that it could hardly be placed later than the
                    commencement of the</p>
                <p>6th century, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> shortly after the compilation of the
                    Breviarium Alarici (506). Hence the text called “antiqua” may be regarded as a
                    modification of that of the Paris palimpsest, and was probably not made before
                    the end of the 6th or the beginning of the 7th century. Roman law, which is so
                    conspicuous in the later text, may already be traced in that of the palimpsest
                    (taken from the Breviarium Alarici), and also in the “antiqua” constitutions, in
                    which we find even traces of Justinian’s law. The Lex Wisigothorum (the first
                    code in which Roman law and Teutonic law were systematically combined) was no
                    doubt regarded, after Leovigild and Reccared I., as a code for the Goths as well
                    as for the Romans, without abolishing the Breviarium among the Romans. But King
                    Chindaswinth ordained that the Lex Wisigothorum should be the sole code for both
                    nations, prohibiting at the same time the use of the Roman law, thereby
                    materially promoting the amalgamation of the two nations. It remained in force
                    in Spain throughout the Middle Ages, and was translated into Spanish (Castilian)
                    under Ferdinand III. (1229-1234, or 1241) under the title <hi rend="italic"

                <p>(11a) Here also we may mention a <hi rend="italic">Lex Romana</hi> compiled for
                    the Roman population, just as in Burgundy. It is also known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liber Lcgum, Liber Legum Romanorum,</hi> and as <hi rend="italic">Lex
                    Theodosii</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Corpus Theodosianum.</hi> It received the
                    latter name because the <hi rend="italic">Codex Theodosianus</hi> served as its
                    basis. It includes also excerpts from <hi rend="italic">novelise</hi> of
                    Theodosius, Valentiuian, Marcian, Majorian, Severus, and from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutiones</hi> of Gaius, the <hi rend="italic">Sentential</hi>
                    of Paulus, the <hi rend="italic">Codices Gregorianus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermogenianus,</hi> &amp;c. In a MS. of the 10th century it is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Breviarium,</hi> and the title <hi rend="italic">Breviarium
                    Alarici</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Alaricianum</hi> has become general since the
                    16th century. The compilers of the Breviarium are not known, but it was
                    published in the twenty-second year of Alaric II., <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    on 5th February 506, at Aire (Atures) in Gascony. It was also used in other
                    western provinces of the Roman empire, and was imitated, excerpted, and altered
                    in other places. One recension, probably dating from the 9th century, is known
                    (from the place where the MS. was found) as the <hi rend="italic">Lex Romana
                    Utinensis.</hi> The best edition is that of G. Haenel, <hi rend="italic">Lex
                    Romana Wisigothorum,</hi> Berlin, 1847.</p>
                <p>(11b) We have also a code for the Eastern Goths compiled by command of Theodoric
                    after 506, but before 526, and known as <hi rend="italic">Edictum
                    Theodorici.</hi> It consists of 155 chapters (with a few additions), which are
                    in reality an epitome of Roman law. It was published in 1875, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mon. Germ. Hist.,</hi> Legg., v. p. 145 <hi rend="italic"

                <p>(12) <hi rend="italic">Leges Langobardorum.—</hi> The first trace of Lombardic
                    law is an edict of Rothar, consisting of 388 chapters, and promulgated at a diet
                    held at Pavia on 22d November 643. This was followed by laws of Grimoald (668),
                    nine chapters; Liutprand (713-735), six books; Ratchis (746), nine chapters;
                    Aistulphus <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 755), fourteen chapters. Additions were
                    also made by Charlemagne and his successors down to Lothair II. In the
                    manuscripts the texts are arranged, some in a chronological, some in a
                    systematical order. The latter arrangement is already found in a MS. of the 9th
                    century. The systematic collection, which was used chiefly in Bologna at
                    lectures and for quotations and was known as <hi rend="italic">Lombarda (Liber
                    Langobardae s. Lombardae),</hi> appears to have been made in the 11th century.
                    The text as it exists at present is very corrupt, as a number of glosses (some
                    of great antiquity) and formulae, added in the first instance by those who had
                    to use the code to explain certain enactments of the law, afterwards found their
                    way into the text. Towards the end of the 12th and down to the beginning of the
                    16th century various glosses and commentaries on the Lombardae made their
                    appearance. The first commentaries were those of Aripraud and of Albertus
                    (second half of 12th century). The later commentators (Carolus de Tocco, <hi
                    rend="italic">c.</hi> 1200; Andreas of Barulo, c. 1230; Blasius de Morcone of
                    Naples, before 1338; Boherius and Johannes Nenna of Bari, c. 1540) refer
                    frequently to Roman law. Of the Edictum Rotharis a Greek translation was made,
                    of which only fragments have been preserved (comp. C. E. Zachariä, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fragmenta versionis Graecae Lcgum Rotharis, Langob. regis,</hi>

                    family of codes; but it is not out of place to mention them here. There is,
                    comparatively speaking, no great distance of time between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >leges barbarorum</hi> and the Laws of Wales, while the contents of the latter
                    show a similar, nay almost the same, idea of law' as the former; and, apart from
                    the fact that Wales became permanently connected at the end of the 13th century
                    with a Teutonic people, the Anglo-Saxons, it has been noticed that in Wales
                    Roman and Germanic, but no traces of a specific Welsh, law are found. King Howel
                    Dda <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the Good), who died in 948, is the originator

                    early as 400 years before Christ. Au English translation by the side of the
                    Welsh text of the so-called triads of Dyvnwal Moel Mud is given by Owen, <hi

                    In the preface it is stated that Howel, “seeing the laws and customs of the
                    country violated with impunity, summoned the archbishop Menevia, other bishops
                    and the chief of the clergy, the nobles of Wales, and six persons (four laymen
                    and two clerks) from each comot, to meet at a place called Y Ty Gwyn ar Dav, or
                    the white house on the river Tav, repaired thither in person, selected from the
                    whole assembly twelve of the most experienced persons, added to their number a
                    clerk or doctor of laws, named Bllgywryd, and to these thirteen confided the
                    task of examining, retaining, expounding, and abrogating. Their compilation was,
                    when completed, read to the assembly, and, after having been confirmed,
                    proclaimed. Howel caused three copies of them to be written, one of which was to
                    accompany the court for daily use, another was deposited in the court at
                    Aberfraw, and a third at Dinevwr. The bishops denounced sentence of
                    excommunication against all transgressors, and soon after Howel himself went to
                    Rome attended by the archbishop of St David’s, the bishops of Bangor and St
                    Asaph, and thirteen other personages. The laws were recited before the pope and
                    confirmed by his authority, upon which Howel and his companions returned home.”
                    All this could not have been effected before Howel had subjected Wales to his
                    own rule, therefore not before 943. We have three different recensions of the
                    code, one for Venedotia or North Wales, another for Dimetia or South Wales, a
                    third for Gwent or North-East Wales. We do not know how far these recensions
                    were uniform in the beginning; but a variance must have occurred shortly after,
                    for the manuscripts in which the codes are preserved differ greatly from each
                    other. The code was originally compiled in Welsh, but we have no older MSS. than
                    the 12th century, and even the earliest ones (especially those of the Venedotia
                    recension) contain many interpolations. The Latin translations of the code would
                    seem to be very old, though even here we have no earlier MSS. (belonging to the
                    Dimetia recension) than the 13th century. The Latin text is much shorter than
                    the Welsh, but we do not know whether this abridgment was made on purpose, or
                    whether the translation is an imitation of an earlier text. The texts present
                    only a few traces of Roman law, which, however, are evidently additions of a
                    later period. The whole body of Welsh laws was published in one volume by An.
                    Owen under the direction of the commissioners on the public records (fol.,
                    London, 1841).</p>
