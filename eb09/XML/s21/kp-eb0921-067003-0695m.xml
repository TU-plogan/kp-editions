                    brief sketch of the leading features of the controversy can be given here.</p>
                <p>The only information on the subject to be gained from the New Testament is that
                    the tomb was in a garden “in the place where Christ was crucified” (John xix.
                    41), which again was “near the city” (John xix. 20) and “without the gate” (Heb.
                    xiii. 12), and that the watch, proceeding from the sepulchre to the chief
                    priest’s, “came <hi rend="italic">into</hi> the city” (Matt, xxviii. 11). The
                    first requisite, therefore, of any locality professing to be that of the
                    Sepulchre is that it should, at the date of the crucifixion, have been <hi

                    that date the writers on both sides have been numerous; among them may be
                    specially noted, as impugning the accuracy of tradition, Fergusson, Tobler, the

                <p>The main question on which the dispute has turned is the circuit of the walls at
                    the time of Christ. The city at that date was surrounded by two walls. The first
                    or oldest began, according to Josephus, “in the north, at the tower called
                    Hippicus, and extended to what was termed the Xystus; it then formed a junction
                    with the council house, and terminated at the western colonnade of the
                    temple.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    either side this northern portion of the first wall is traced along the southern
                    side of the depression, which extends from the central valley eastwards to the
                    Jaffa gate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Fergusson
                    and Sandie place Hippicus at the north-western angle of the modern wall, and
                    thus include the existing church of the sepulchre within the first wall itself,
                    but they have overlooked the assertion of the Jewish historian, that from the
                    ravines which surrounded the latter it was almost impregnable. Bonar, while
                    placing Hippicus somewhere near the same spot, does not define the locality, and
                    Schwartz seeks to identify it with “a high rocky hill north of the so-called
                    Grotto of Jeremiah” and far beyond the northern limits of the modern
                    city.</p></note> From some point in that northern line of wall the second wall
                    took its departure, and of it all we are told by Josephus is that “it had its
                    beginning at the gate called Gennath, belonging to the first wall, and reached
                    to the Antonia, encircling only the western quarter of the city.” If this
                    Gennath gate was near Hippicus, the line of the second wall, in order to exclude
                    the present site, must be drawn along a route curiously unsuited, from the slope
                    of the hill, for defensive purposes; and that it was near Hippicus seems<pb

                    the apparent necessity of including within its circuit the pool Amygdalon, now

                    buildings found in the districts traversed by the second wall according to their
                    respective theories. It seemed doubtful, till quite recently, if any sound
                    argument could be based on these, the ruins being too fragmentary and occurring
                    in too many different quarters to warrant any positive identification with a

                <p>Considerable stress has been laid by some writers on the existence of ancient
                    Jewish sepulchres, of a date apparently anterior to the Christian era, in the
                    rock on which the present church is built, as proving that that rock could not
                    have been within the circuit of the walls, inasmuch as it is alleged “the Jews
                    never buried within their towns.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of the kings of Judah <hi rend="italic">“in</hi> the city of David,” the phrase
                    can hardly be held to prove that such burial-place was <hi rend="italic"
                    >without</hi> the walls; while 2 Chron. xxviii. 27 and xxxiii. 20 seem to point
                    very strongly in the opposite direction. Joab also, we are told, was buried “in
                    his own house in the wilderness,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Kings ii. 34.</p></note> and Samuel “in his house at

                    the city are found the jealously guarded walls which enclose the cave of
                    Machpelah. If, then, these tombs are older than the time of Christ, there seems
                    little difficulty in crediting that they might have been included within the
                    second wall. We know for a certainty that they were within the third. The
                    curious point rather is that their existence in the rock may be used as a strong
                    argument against the site, for, speaking of the disinterment of the rock of the
                    sepulchre from the accumulated soil heaped over it by the Romans, Eusebius<note

                    that there was “only one cave within it, lest, had there been many, the miracle
                    of Him who overthrew death should have been obscured.”</p>
                <p>One argument remained which, at least up to 1847, it seemed difficult for the
                    impugners of the orthodox site to meet, namely,—Was it at all probable that
                    Constantine should have been deceived, either by erroneous inference or by
                    wilful misrepresentation, when in 325 he erected a monumental church over what
                    was then believed to be the holy tomb? Apart from the consideration that of all
                    localities this seemed to be the least likely to pass from the memory of the

                    On the eastern hill of the city, in the sacred Mohammedan enclosure of the
                    Harám-es-Sheríf, and on a spot generally considered to have formed part of the
                    temple area, stands the magnificent octagonal building called the Dome of the
                    Rock, usually but erroneously believed to have been erected by the caliph Omar,
                    and so popularly known as the mosque of Omar. The jealousy of the Moslems had,
                    with rare exceptions, prevented up to quite recent times the intrusion of
                    Christians within its sacred precincts, but it was known to have been erected
                    over a large mass of native rock rising above the surface of the ground and
                    having a cave within it. A section of the building, very roughly executed, was
                    given in the <hi rend="italic">Travels of Ali Bey,</hi> published in 1816 (vol.
                    ii. p. 74); but in 1833 Mr. Cother-wood, under the pretext of being a civil
                    engineer in the employment of Mehemet Ali, and of examining into the structural
                    condition of the building with a view to its repair, spent three weeks in
                    examining it and its surroundings, of which he made elaborate drawings and
                    sections. A general account of his investigations and their results, published
                    in W. H. Bartlett’s <hi rend="italic">Walks about the City and Environs of
                    Jerusalem</hi> (p. 148), led to Fergusson’s getting access to those drawings,
                    which confirmed him in the belief he had already begun to entertain from other
                    sources, that the Dome of the Rock was originally a Christian edifice; and in
                    the essay referred to he argued at great length and with much vigour on both
                    architectural and historical grounds that it and the Golden Gateway— a walled-up
                    entrance to the Harám from the east—were built in the time of Constantine; that
                    the former was the church of the Anastasis, erected by that emperor over the
                    tomb of our Lord, and the latter the entrance to the atrium of the great
                    basilica described by Eusebius<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of the site from the eastern to the western hill took place somewhere about the
                    commencement of the 11th century, when, in consequence of the invasion of the
                    Turks, the Christians were driven from the former hill for a time. This work was

                <p>The architectural arguments in favour of Fergusson’s theory have forced Lewin,
                    one of his most strenuous opponents, to argue that the Dome of the Rock may have
                    been a temple to Jupiter erected by Hadrian, which he imagines may have been
                    restored or rebuilt by Maximin Daza, the successor of Diocletian.<note

                    But they must be studied in Fergusson’s own works or in that of Unger above
                    referred to. The topographical objections are mainly founded on the necessity of
                    restricting the Jewish temple to the south-eastern corner of the Haram, the
                    site, however, assigned to it by Lewin himself and Thrupp,<note anchored="true"

                    interment so near the sacred building. But Josephus, at the time of the siege,
                    speaks of “the monuments of King Alexander,” whatever that may mean, existing
                    just over against or in front of the north colonnade of the temple.<note

                    to have run up from the valley of Jehoshaphat westwards at this point, and so to
                    have divided the temple from the tomb, seems inadmissible. Modern investigation
                    shows that such a valley, or rather depression, did exist, but north, not south,
                    of the Dome of the Rock.</p></note></p>
                <p>As regards the historical argument, it would certainly appear that up to the
                    close of the 6th century the balance of evidence is in favour of the eastern
                    site. The narrative of the Pilgrim of Bordeaux<note anchored="true"

                    believed that the same hill witnessed in succession the offering of Isaac, the
                    vision of the angel at Araunah’s threshing-floor, the building of the temple,
                    and the death and resurrection of our Lord. Many more passages might be quoted
                    from writers of this period testifying to the belief that the hill that
                    witnessed the offering of Isaac witnessed also the resurrection of Christ, and
                    many others identifying the scene of the offering of Isaac with the hill on
                    which the temple was built. Perhaps the strongest point in this connexion
                    against Fergusson is that so striking a fact as the identity of the hill of the
                    Passion with that on part of which the temple stood should only be directly
                    spoken to by a single writer. After the 9th century the historical evidence
                    becomes more difficult to interpret. Fergusson would date the transference of
                    the site about 1000; but it seems clear from Istakhri (9 7 8)<note

                    the Dome of the Rock was a Mohammedan place of worship, and the latter expressly

                    about 614, when the city was captured by the Persians, and, to quote the
                    carefully guarded narrative of Gibbon, “the sepulchre of Christ and the stately
                    churches of Helena and Constantine were consumed, or at least damaged, by the
                    flames.” The buildings were repaired or rebuilt by Modestus a few years later,
                    and their praises are sung by Sophronius, his successor in the patriarchate, but
                    in terms which give little topographical information. Sophronius lived to see
                    the capture of the city by Omar in 636, the earliest records of whose doings as
                    yet available are the brief one of Theophanes (818) and the more lengthened one
                    of Eutychius (937). From both of these it seems clear that the caliph confirmed
                    the Christians in the possession of the sites (whatever these might be) which he
                    found in their hands. In or about 670 the French bishop Arculph visited
                    Jerusalem, and under the hand of Adamnanus we have a detailed account taken down
                    from his lips,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    which strikingly corresponds to the Dome of the Rock,—as, however, it
                    necessarily would correspond with any church which had been erected in close
                    imitation of that building.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The view that at the time when Arculph wrote the Dome of the Rock was in the
                    hands of the Mohammedans seems strengthened by the well-known Cufic inscription
                    which still runs round the colonnade of that building, and a complete
                    translation of which by the late Professor Palmer will be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Quarterly Report</hi> of the Palestine Exploration Fund (1871, p.
                    164) and Fergusson’s <hi rend="italic">Temples of the Jews</hi> (p. 269). In it
                    the construction of the dome of the building is dated 72 A.H. (691), but the
                    name of the builder, which clearly was Abd-el-Melek in the original, has been
                    erased and that of Abdallah el-Mamun (198 A.H.; 813) fraudulently substituted,
                    “the short-sighted forger,” as Palmer calls him, having omitted to change the
                    date as well as the name. In this inscription there is very special mention made
                    of our Saviour, and in a way which seems inexplicable unless the building on
                    which it was inscribed had been, in the mind of the writer, associated in some
                    important respects with the history of Jesus. And the tradition that it was so
                    continued long after; for we find Theoderic so late as 1176 writing of it, “Hoc
                    templum, quod nunc videtur, ad honorem Domini nostri Jesu Christi ejusque piae
                    genetricis ab Helena regina et ejus filio, imperatore Constantino, constructum
                    est” (ed. Tobler, St Gall, 1865, p. 46). Fergusson believes this inscription to
                    have been written in the 12th century, but is obliged to admit that the alphabet
                    employed is identical with that found on the coins of Abd-el-Melek <hi
                    rend="italic">( Temples of the Jews,</hi> p. 24). A facsimile of the sentence
                    containing the date and the forgery will be found in the Rev. Isaac Taylor’s <hi

                    passages, however, in Arculph descriptive of the city very difficult to

                    hitherto (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Jerusalem)</hi> been identified with the
                    eastern hill, had already in his time taken place. The next pilgrim who has left

                    about 870, applies better to the eastern than to the western. If the
                    transference can be supposed to have taken place at the time of the Persian
                    invasion, one of the main difficulties in the adoption of Fergusson’s theory
                    will be greatly lessened, for the intervening period of more than 450 years
                    would go far to explain how the crusaders, on gaining possession of the city in
                    1099, failed to make it their first business to revert to the original site. On
                    the whole, the question is one which can hardly be satisfactorily determined
                    until the Arabic authorities on the subject have been duly scrutinized, and as

                <p>Within the last few years a third locality has been suggested. In 1878 Captain
                    Conder, in his <hi rend="italic">Tent Work in Palestine</hi> (i. pp. 372-376),
                    expressed a strong conviction that the real site was to be found on a rocky
                    knoll outside the northern wall, and close to the cave known as “Jeremiah’s
                    Grotto.” He argued that not only did this locality meet the requirements of the
                    Gospel narratives, being outside the city and near one of the great roads
                    leading from the country, but that in this direction lay “the great cemetery of
                    Jewish times” as testified by “the sepulchre of Simon the Just preserved by
                    Jewish tradition,” and the monument of Helena “fitted with a rolling stone such
                    as closed the mouth of the Holy Sepulchre.” Here also by early Christian
                    tradition had been the scene of the martyrdom of Stephen, which doubtless
                    occurred at the place of public execution, and to this day, according to Dr
                    Chaplin, the Jews designate the knoll “by the name Beth has-Sekilah, ‘the place
                    of stoning’ (domus lapidationis), and state it to be the ancient place of public
                    execution mentioned in the Mishnah.” The hill itself appears to present a
                    striking resemblance to a human skull, and so to associate itself with the word
                    “Golgotha.” The adoption of this site by Dr Chaplin, the Rev. S. Merrill,
                    Schick, and perhaps especially the late General Gordon,<note anchored="true"

                    is, however, a purely conjectural location, and involves the assumption that all
                    the Christian writers from the 4th century downwards, as well as the mother of
                    Constantine, were in error as to the real site. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. b.
