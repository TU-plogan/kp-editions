                    on a fixed, the other on a movable radius, which the observer pointed to the two
                    objects of which the angular distance was to be measured.</p>

                    which were in use before the invention of the reflecting sextant. Their
                    imperfections were so evident that the idea of employing reflexion to remove
                    them occurred independently to several minds. Hooke contrived two reflecting
                    instruments. The first is described in his <hi rend="italic">Pοst-humοus
                    Works</hi> (p. 503); it had only one mirror, which reflected the light from one
                    object into a telescope which is pointed directly at the other. Hooke’s second
                    plan employed two single reflexions, whereby an eye placed at the side of a
                    quadrant could at the same time see the images formed in two telescopes, the
                    axes of which were radii of the quadrant and which were pointed at the two
                    objects to be measured. This plan is described in Hooke’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Animadversions to the Machina Coelestis of Hevelius,</hi> published in 1674,
                    while the first one seems to have been communicated to the Royal Society in
                    1666. Newton had also his attention turned to this subject, but nothing was
                    known about his ideas till 1742, when a description in his own handwriting of an
                    instrument devised by him was found among Halley’s papers and printed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> (No. 465). It consists of a sector
                    of brass, the arc of which, though only equal to one-eighth part of a circle, is
                    divided into 90°. A telescope is fixed along a radius of the sector, the object
                    glass being close to the centre and having outside it a plane mirror inclined
                    45° to the axis of the telescope, and intercepting half the light which would
                    otherwise fall on the object glass. One object is seen through the telescope,
                    while a movable radius, carrying a second mirror close to the first, is turned
                    round the centre until the second object by double reflexion is seen in the
                    telescope to coincide with the first.</p>
                <p>But long before this plan of Newton’s saw the light the sextant in its present
                    form had been invented and had come into practical use. On May 13, 1731, John
                    Hadley gave an account of an “octant,” employing double reflexion, and a
                    fortnight later he exhibited the instrument.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hadley described two different constructions: in one the
                    telescope was fixed along a radius as in Newton’s form, in the other it was
                    placed in the way afterwards universally adopted; an octant of the first
                    construction was made as early as the summer of 1730, according to a statement
                    made to the Royal Society by Hadley’s brother George on Feb. 7,
                    1734.</p></note><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0750-0725"/> On the 20th May Halley stated to the society that
                    Newton had invented an instrument founded on the same principle, and had
                    communicated an account of it to the society in 1699, but on search being made
                    in the minutes it was only found that Newton had showed a new instrument “for
                    observing the moon and stars for the longitude at sea, being the old instrument
                    mended of some faults,” but nothing whatever was found in the minutes concerning
                    the principle of the construction. Halley had evidently only a very dim
                    recollection of Newton’s plan, and at a meeting of the Royal Society on December
                    16, 1731, he declared himself satisfied that Hadley’s idea was quite different
                    from Newton’s. The new instrument was already in August 1732 tried on board the
                    “Chatham” yacht by order of the Admiralty, and was found satisfactory, but
                    otherwise it does not seem to have superseded the older instruments for at least
                    twenty years. As constructed by Hadley the instrument could only measure angles
                    up to 90°; but in 1757 Captain Campbell of the navy, one of the first to use it
                    assiduously, proposed to enlarge it so as to measure angles up to 120°, in which
                    form it is now generally employed.</p>
                <p>Quite independently of Hadley and Newton the sextant was invented by Thomas
                    Godfrey, a poor glazier in Philadelphia. In May 1732 Mr James Logan of that city
                    wrote to Halley that Godfrey had about eighteen months previously showed him a
                    common sea quadrant “to which he had fitted two pieces of looking-glass in such
                    a manner as brought two stars at almost any distance to coincide.” The letter
                    gave a full description of the instrument; the principle was the same as that of
                    Hadley’s first octant which had the telescope along a radius. At the meeting of
                    the Royal Society on January 31, 1734, two affidavits sworn before the mayor of
                    Philadelphia were read, proving that Godfrey’s quadrant was made about November
                    1730, that on the 28th November it was brought by G. Stewart, mate, on board a
                    sloop, the “Truman,” John Cox, master, bound for Jamaica, and that in August
                    1731 it was used by the same persons on a voyage to Newfoundland. There can thus
                    be no doubt that Godfrey invented the instrument independently; but the
                    statement of several modern writers that a brother of Godfrey, a captain in the
                    West India trade, sold the quadrant at Jamaica to a Captain or Lieutenant Hadley
                    of the British navy, who brought it to London to his brother, an instrument
                    maker in the Strand, has been proved to be devoid of all foundation. Not only is
                    this totally at variance with all the particulars given in the affidavits, but
                    between 1719 and 1743 there was no officer in the British navy of the name of
                    Hadley, and John Hadley cannot possibly have been in the West Indies at that
                    time, as he was present at many meetings of the Royal Society between November
                    1730 and May 1731; besides, neither Hadley nor his brothers were professional
                    instrument makers. A detailed discussion of this question by Prof. Rigaud is
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Magazine,</hi> vol. ii. No. 21.<note

                    gentleman of independent means, and the fact that he was the first to bring the

                    astronomical books believe that he was a professional instrument maker. His
                    brother George, who assisted him in his pursuits, was a

                <p>The annexed figure gives an idea of the construction of the sextant. ABC is a
                    light framework of brass in the shape of a sector of 60°, the limb AB having a
                    graduated arc of silver (sometimes of gold) inlaid in the brass. It is held in
                    the hand by a small handle at the back, either vertically to measure the
                    altitude of an object, or in the plane passing through two objects the angular
                    distance of which is to be found. CD is a radius movable round C, where a small
                    plane mirror of silvered plate-glass is fixed perpendicular to the plane of the
                    sextant and in the line CD. At D is a vernier read through a small lens, also a
                    clamp and a tangent screw which enable the observer to give the arm CD a very
                    slow motion within certain limits. At E is another mirror “the horizon glass,”
                    also perpendicular to the plane of the sextant and parallel to CB. F is a small
                    telescope fixed across CB, parallel to the plane CAB and pointed to the mirror
                    E. Dark glasses can be placed outside E and between E and C when ob serving the
                    sun. As only the lower half of E issilvered, the observer can see the hori zon
                    in the telescope through the unsilvered half, while the light from the sun or a
                    star S may be reflected from the “index glass” C to the silvered half of E and
                    thence through F to the observer’s eye. If CD has been moved so as to make the
                    image of a star or of the limb of the sun coincide with that of the horizon, it
                    is easy to see that the angle SCH (the altitude of the star or solar limb) is
                    equal to twice the angle</p>
                <p>BCD. The limb AB is al ways graduated so as to avoid the necessity of doubling
                    the measured angle, a space marked as a degree on the limb being in reality only
                    30'. The vernier should point to 0° 0' 0" when the two mirrors are parallel, or
                    in other words, when the direct and reflected images of a very distant object
                    are seen to coincide. For the methods of adjusting the mirrors and finding the
                    index error see <hi rend="smallcaps">Navigation</hi> (vol. xvii. p. 268).</p>
                <p>If the sextant is employed on land, an artificial horizon has to be used. This is
                    generally a basin of mercury protected from the wind by a roof of plate-glass
                    with perfectly parallel faces; sometimes a glass plate is used (with the lower
                    surface blackened), which can be levelled on three screws by a circular level.
                    The telescope is directed to the image of the celestial object reflected from
                    the artificial horizon, and this image is made to coincide with that reflected
                    from the index-glass. In this case the angle BCD will be double the altitude of
                    the star. Towards the end of last and the beginning of this century the sextant
                    was much used on land for determining latitudes, but, though in the hands of a
                    skilful observer it can give results far superior to what one might expect from
                    a small instrument held in the hand (or attached to a small stand), it has on
                    shore been quite superseded by the portable altazimuth or theodolite, while at
                    sea it continues to be indispensable.</p>
                <p>The principle of the sextant has been applied to the construction of reflecting
                    circles, on which the index arm is a diameter with a vernier at each end to
                    eliminate the error of eccentricity. The circles constructed by Pistor and
                    Martins of Berlin have a glass prism instead of the horizon glass and are
                    extremely convenient. (J. L. E. D.)</p>
