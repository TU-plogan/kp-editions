                    bounded on the N. and N.W. by Pilibhit, on the E. by Hardoi and Kheri, on the S.
                    by the Ganges, separating it from Farukhabad, and on the W. by Budaun and
                    Bareilly. The district consists of a long and narrow tract running up from the
                    Ganges towards the Himalayas, and is for the most part level and without any
                    hills or considerable undulations. The principal rivers are the Gumti, Khanaut,
                    Garái, and Rámganga. The last-named is the main waterway of the district, and is
                    navigable as far as Kola Ghat near Jalálábád, whence grain is shipped for the
                    Ganges ports. To the north-east beyond Gumti the country resembles the <hi
                    rend="italic">tarai</hi> in the preponderance of waste and forest over
                    cultivated land, in the sparseness of population, and in general unhealthiness.
                    Between the Gumti and the Khanaut the country varies from a rather wild and
                    unhealthy northern region to a densely inhabited tract in the south, with a
                    productive soil well cultivated with sugar-cane and other remunerative crops.
                    The section between the Deoha and Garái comprises much marshy land; but south of
                    the Garái, and between it and the Rámganga, the soil is mostly of a sandy
                    nature. From Rámganga to the Ganges in the south is a continuous low country of
                    marshy patches alternating with a hard clayey soil requiring much irrigation in
                    parts. Sháh-jahânpur contains a number of jhils or lakes, which afford
                    irrigation for the spring crops in their neighbourhood. The Oudh and Rohilkhand
                    Railway traverses the district a distance of 39 miles. The climate of the
                    district is very similar to that of most parts of Oudh and Rohilkhand, but
                    moister than that of the Doab. Except in May and June, the country has a fresh
                    and green appearance. Its average annual rainfall is about 38 inches.</p>
                <p>In 1881 the population of Sháhjahánpur numbered 856,946 (males 460,064, females
                    396,882), of whom 735,244 were Hindus and 120,214 were Mohammedans. The district
                    contains only two towns with a population exceeding 10,000, viz., <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sháhjahánpur</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v</hi>.) and Tilhar
                    (15,351). Of the total area of 1746 square miles 1090 were under cultivation in
                    1883-84, and 464 were returned as cultivable. The chief agricultural products
                    are wheat and gram in spring, and in the autumn sugar-cane, rice, joar, and
                    bajra, and several kinds of pulses. Exports are chiefly sugar, grain of all
                    kinds, pulses, indigo, cotton, and timber, and the imports are mainly European
                    goods, metals, and salt. The gross revenue raised in the district in 1883-84
                    amounted to £186,162, of which the land contributed £118,638. The only
                    manufactures of any importance under European supervision are those of sugar and
                    rum and of indigo. Sháhjahánpur was ceded to the English by treaty in 1801.
                    During the mutiny of 1857 it became the scene of open rebellion. The Europeans
                    were attacked when in church; three were shot down, but the remainder, aided by
                    a hundred faithful sepoys, escaped. The force under Lord Clyde put a stop to the
                    anarchy in April 1858, and shortly afterwards peace and authority were
                    restored.</p>
