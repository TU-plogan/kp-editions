                    large amount of legislation dealing with the interests of seamen with unusual
                    fulness of detail, proving the care bestowed by a maritime power upon those to
                    whom its commercial success is so largely due. How far this legislation has had
                    the efficiency which was expected may be doubtful. The loss of life among
                    sailors was one in eighty in 1871, one in seventy-five in 1882. There has been
                    besides a steady diminution in the number of British seamen employed on British
                    ships, nearly one-eighth being foreigners at the present time.</p>
                <p>For legislative purposes seamen may be divided into three classes, seamen in the
                    royal navy, merchant seamen, and fishermen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Seamen in the Royal Navy.—</hi> It is still lawful to impress
                    men for the naval service, subject to certain exemptions (13 Geo. II. c. 17).
                    Among the persons exempt are seamen in the merchant service. In cases of
                    emergency officers and men of the coastguard and revenue cruisers, seamen
                    riggers, and pensioners may be required to serve in the navy (16 and 17 Vict. c.
                    73). There appears to be no other instance (now that balloting for the militia
                    is suspended) where a subject may be forced into the service of the crown
                    against his will. The navy is, however, at the present day wholly recruited by
                    voluntary enlistment. The navy estimates of 1885 provided for 59,000 men (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Navy).</hi> Special advantages are afforded by the Merchant
                    Shipping Act, 1854, to merchant seamen enlisting in the navy. They are enabled
                    to leave their ship without punishment or forfeiture in order to join the naval
                    service. The discipline of the navy is, unlike that of the army, for which an
                    annual Army Act is necessary, regulated by a permanent Act of Parliament, that
                    now in force being the Naval Discipline Act, 1866. In addition to numerous
                    hospitals and infirmaries in the United Kingdom and abroad, the great charity of
                    Greenwich Hospital is a mode of provision for old and disabled seamen in the
                    navy (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Greenwich).</hi> At present such seamen are
                    out-pensioners only; the hospital has been for some years used as the Royal
                    Naval College for officer students. The enactments of the Merchant Shipping Act,
                    1854, as to savings banks were extended to seamen in the navy by 18 and 19 Vict.
                    c. 91, s. 17. Enlistment without the licence of the crown in the naval service
                    of a foreign state at war with another foreign state that is at peace with the
                    United Kingdom is an offence punishable under the Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870.
                    Any person buying from a seaman or enticing a seaman to sell Government property
                    is liable to penalties under the Seamen’s Clothing Act, 1869.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Merchant Seamen.—</hi> Most of the Acts dealing with this
                    subject, commencing with 8 Eliz. c. 13, were repealed by 17 and 18 Vict. c. 120,
                    after having been consolidated and extended by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854
                    (17 and 18 Vict. c. 104). The main part of the legislation affecting seamen in
                    the merchant service occurs in the third part of this Act. Since 1854 numerous
                    amending</p>
                <p>Acts have been passed, amounting to no less than eleven in number. They are cited
                    collectively as “The Merchant Shipping Acts, 1854 to 1883.” The enactment of a
                    new consolidation Act is urgently required, and can be only a question of time.
                    The Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, defines a seaman to be “every person (except
                    masters, pilots, and apprentices duly indentured and registered) employed or
                    engaged in any capacity on board any ship” (s. 2). It should be noticed that
                    most of the enactments relating to merchant seamen do not affect seamen employed
                    on foreign vessels, on fishing boats on the coasts of the United Kingdom, on
                    vessels belonging to the Trinity House, the Commissioners of Northern
                    Lighthouses, and the port of Dublin corporation, and on pleasure yachts. The
                    principal provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts dealing with seamen are as
                    follows. Where no other reference is given, the Act of 1854 is intended. An
                    elective local marine board under the general supervision of the Board of Trade
                    is appointed in the principal ports of the United Kingdom. One of the duties of
                    the board is the establishment of mercantile marine offices under
                    superintendents or deputy superintendents.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>These offices and officers were called shipping offices and
                    shipping masters in the Act of 1854. The names were changed to the longer and
                    less convenient ones in the text by the Act of 1862 (25 and 26 Vict. c. 63, s.
                    15).</p></note> It is the general business of such officers to afford facilities
                    for engaging seamen by keeping registries of their names and characters, to
                    superintend and facilitate their engagement and discharge, to provide means for
                    securing the presence on board at the proper times of men who are so engaged,
                    and to facilitate the making of apprenticeships to the sea service (s. 124). A
                    seaman must be hired before a superintendent or deputy superintendent, an
                    officer of customs, or a consular officer on a form sanctioned by the Board of
                    Trade (usually called the shipping articles) containing the following
                    particulars :—(1) the nature and, as far as practicable, the duration of the
                    intended voyage or engagement, or the maximum period of the voyage or
                    engagement, and the places or parts of the world (if any) to which the voyage or
                    engagement is not to extend; (2) the number and description of the crew,
                    specifying how many are employed as sailors; (3) the time at which each seaman
                    is to be on board or to begin work; (4) the capacity in which each seaman is to
                    serve; (5) the amount of wages which each seaman is to receive; (6) a scale of
                    the provisions which are to be furnished to each seaman; (7) any regulations as
                    to conduct on board and as to fines, short allowance of provisions, or other
                    lawful punishments for misconduct, which have been sanctioned by the Board of
                    Trade as regulations proper to be adopted, and which the parties agree to adopt.
                    Every agreement is to be framed so as to admit of stipulations as to allotment
                    of wages, and may contain any other stipulations not contrary to law (s. 149, as
                    amended by the Act of 1873 and the Merchant Seamen Act, 1880). Among illegal
                    stipulations would fall any agreement by a seaman to give up his right to
                    salvage, to forfeit his lien on the ship, or to be deprived of any remedy for
                    the recovery of wages to which he would otherwise have been entitled (s. 182).
                    In the case of foreign-going ships the following rules in addition must be
                    observed :—(1) every agreement made in the United Kingdom (except agreements
                    with substitutes) is to be signed by each seaman in the presence of the
                    superintendent of a mercantile marine office; (2) the superintendent is to cause
                    the agreement to be read over and explained to<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n631/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0631-0606"/> each seaman, or otherwise to ascertain that each
                    seaman understands the same before he signs it, and is to attest each signature;
                    (3) the agreement is to be in duplicate, one part to be retained by the
                    superintendent, the other by the master; (4) in the case of substitutes, they
                    are where possible to be engaged before a superintendent, in other cases the
                    agreement is to be read over and explained to the seaman by the master and
                    signed by the seaman in the presence of a witness (s. 150). The only cases where
                    no agreement in writing is necessary is where the hiring is for a coaster of
                    less than eighty tons register or for a foreign vessel. In the case of union
                    apprentices the indentures must be executed in the presence of and attested by
                    two justices. No stamp duty is chargeable on indentures for the sea service. In
                    the case of foreign-going ships making voyages averaging less than six months in
                    duration, running agreements with the crew may be made (s. 151). No person
                    unlicensed by the Board of Trade, other than a master or mate or agent of the
                    owner, may engage or supply seamen. The discharge of a seaman, like his
                    engagement, must take place before a superintendent or an officer of equivalent
                    authority. The seaman is entitled to receive a certificate of service and
                    discharge. His wages must be paid within a limited time from his discharge,
                    varying according to circumstances, and are not now dependent, as they were at
                    common law, upon the earning of freight. If he is discharged before a month’s
                    wages are earned, he is entitled to a month’s wages. As far as possible, payment
                    is to be made in money and not by bill. In the absence of special stipulations,
                    wages are not generally due until the contract of service is complete. By 8 Geo.
                    I. c. 24, s. 7, a master may not advance a seaman more than half his wages while
                    abroad. Sums recoverable as wages are, in addition to wages properly so called,
                    the expenses of subsistence and of the voyage home when a ship is sold or
                    transferred abroad, and the master does not deposit with a consular officer a
                    sufficient sum for the seaman’s expenses pursuant to s. 205; the expenses of a
                    seaman left behind or discharged from a British ship, or a British subject from
                    a foreign ship, out of the United Kingdom; allowance for short or bad
                    provisions; the moneys and effects of a deceased seaman who has been employed on
                    a British ship; expenses caused by illness from want of proper food and
                    accommodation and medicines; and double pay for every day, not exceeding ten,
                    during which payment of wages is delayed without proper cause. Wages cannot be
                    attached. They may be forfeited or reduced by desertion, wilful disobedience,
                    smuggling, want of exertion in case of wreck, illness caused by neglect or
                    default of the seaman, and misconduct of other kinds. Advance notes—that is,
                    documents promising the future payment of money on account of a seaman’s wages
                    conditionally on his going to sea and made before the wages have been earned—are
                    void, and no money paid in respect of an advance note can be deducted from the
                    wages earned, Merchant Seamen (Payment of Wages and Rating) Act, 1880 (43 and 44
                    Vict c. 16, s. 2). Allotment notes may be made in the form sanctioned by the
                    Board of Trade, and may stipulate for the allotment of not more than half the
                    seaman’s wages in favour of a wife, parent, grandparent, child, grandchild,
                    brother or sister (s. 169), or of a savings bank (43 and 44 Vict, c. 16, s. 3).
                    Seamen’s savings banks have been established and are administered by the Board
                    of Trade, chiefly under the powers given by the Seamen’s Savings Banks Act,
                    1856. If during the absence of a seaman on a voyage his wife and family become
                    chargeable to the parish, two-thirds of his wages at the most are all that can
                    be recovered by the parish. Careful provision is made for the custody of a
                    deceased seaman’s effects and wages, and their delivery to his representatives.
                    The possibility of a seaman’s being left destitute abroad is provided against by
                    ss. 206, 207. Consular officers abroad are bound to send home any distressed or
                    shipwrecked seaman, the expenses being chargeable upon the mercantile marine
                    fund. Compensation is to be made for insufficiency or bad quality of provisions
                    or water on board. If a complaint of the quality or sufficiency be frivolous,
                    the persons complaining are liable to forfeit a week’s wages. All foreign-going
                    ships are to carry proper medicines and medical stores. Lime and lemon juice and
                    other antiscorbutics are to be provided on ships bound to foreign ports other
                    than ports in Europe and the north of North America. An ounce a day of lime or
                    lemon juice is to be served to each member of the crew after the ship has been
                    at sea for ten days (Act of 1867, 30 and 31 Vict. c. 124, s. 4). A foreign-going
                    ship having one hundred persons or upwards on board must carry a qualified
                    medical man (s. 130). Each seaman or apprentice is entitled to a space of not
                    less than 72 cubic feet, the place to be securely constructed, properly lighted
                    and ventilated, and properly protected from weather and sea, and as far as
                    possible from effluvium caused by cargo or bilge-water. The place is to be
                    inspected and certified by a surveyor of the Board of Trade, and to be kept free
                    from goods and stores. The local marine board (or the Board of Trade where there
                    is no local marine board) may appoint a medical inspector of seamen, who may on
                    application by the master or owner report to the superintendent of the
                    mercantile marine office as to whether any seaman is fit for duty (30 and 31
                    Vict. c. 124, ss. 9, 10).</p>
                <p>Bye-laws and regulations relating to seamen’s lodging-houses may be made by the
                    sanitary authority of any seaport town with the sanction of the president of the
                    Board of Trade. Such bye-laws and regulations are to provide for the licensing
                    of seamen’s lodginghouses, the inspection of the same, the sanitary conditions
                    of the same, the publication of the fact of a house being licensed, the due
                    execution of the bye-laws and regulations and the non-obstruction of persons
                    engaged in securing such execution, the preventing of persons not duly licensed
                    holding themselves out as keeping or purporting to keep licensed houses, and the
                    exclusion from licensed houses of persons of improper character (46 and 47 Vict.
                    c. 41, s. 48). Provision is made tor the protection of seamen from imposition by
                    crimps and lodging-house keepers. This protection may in certain cases be
                    extended by order in council to foreign ships (s. 237, and 43 and 44 Vict. c.
                    16, ss. 5, 6). At the time of discharge of the crew in the United Kingdom a list
                    in the form sanctioned by the Board of Trade is to be made out and delivered to
                    a superintendent of a mercantile marine office containing, <hi rend="italic"
                    >inter alia,</hi> the following particulars :—(1) the number and date of the
                    ship’s register and her registered tonnage; (2) the length and general nature of
                    the voyage or employment; (3) the Christian names, surnames, ages, and places of
                    birth of all the crew, including the master and apprentices, their qualities on
                    board, their last ships or other employments, and the dates and places of their
                    joining the ship; (4) the names of any members of the crew who have been maimed
                    or hurt, with the times, places, causes, and circumstances thereof; (5) the
                    wages due at the time of their respective deaths to any of the crew who have
                    died; (6) the clothes and other effects belonging to any of the crew who have
                    died, with a statement of the manner in which they have been dealt with, and the
                    money for which any of them have been sold (s. 273). Every birth or death
                    occurring at sea is to be recorded in the log-book and reported on arrival at
                    any port in the United Kingdom to the registrar-general of shipping and seamen,
                    who forwards a certified copy to the registrar-general of births and deaths (37
                    and 38 Vict. c. 88, s. 37). An official log-book in a form sanctioned by the
                    Board of Trade is to be kept by the master of every ship except a coaster. It
                    must contain, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> (1) every legal conviction of
                    any member of his crew and the punishment inflicted; (2) every offence committed
                    by any member of his crew for which it is intended to prosecute, or to enforce a
                    forfeiture, or to exact a fine, together with a statement concerning the reading
                    over of such entry and concerning the reply (if any) made to the charge; (3)
                    every offence for which punishment is inflicted on board, and the punishment
                    inflicted; (4) a statement of the conduct, character, and qualifications of each
                    of his crew, or a statement that he declines to give an opinion on such
                    particulars; (5) every case of illness or injury happening to any member of the
                    crew, with the nature thereof and the medical treatment adopted (if any); (6)
                    the name of every seaman or apprentice who ceases to be a member of the crew,
                    otherwise than by death, with the time, place, manner, and cause thereof; (7)
                    the amount of wages due to any seaman who enters Her Majesty’s service during
                    the voyage; (8) the wages due to any seaman or apprentice who dies during the
                    voyage, and the gross amount of all deductions to be made therefrom; (9) the
                    sale of the effects of any seaman or apprentice who dies during the voyage,
                    including a statement of each article sold and of the sum received for it (s.
                    282). At common law there was no obligation of the owner to provide a seaworthy
                    ship, but by the Act of 1876 every person who sends or attempts to send, or is
                    party to sending or attempting to send, a British ship to sea in such
                    unseaworthy state that the life of any person is likely to be thereby endangered
                    is guilty of a misdemeanour, unless he proves that he used all reasonable means
                    to insure her being sent to sea in a seaworthy state, or that her going to sea
                    in such unseaworthy state was under the circumstances reasonable and
                    justifiable. A master knowingly taking a British ship to sea in such unseaworthy
                    state that the life of any person is likely to be thereby endangered is guilty
                    of a misdemeanour. In every contract of service between the owner and the master
                    or any seaman and in every indenture of sea apprenticeship, an obligation is
                    implied that the owner, master, and agent shall use all reasonable means to
                    insure the seaworthiness of the ship (39 and 40 Vict. c. 80, ss. 4, 5). A return
                    of certain particulars, such as lists of crews and of distressed seamen sent
                    home from abroad, reports on discharge, births and deaths at sea, must be made
                    to the registrar-general of shipping and seamen, an officer of the Board of
                    Trade. The seaman is privileged in the matter of wills (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Will),</hi> and is exempt from serving in the militia (42 Geo. III. c. 90, s.
                    43). Assaults upon seamen with intent to prevent them working at their
                    occupation are punishable summarily by 24 and 25 Vict. c. 100, s. 40. There are
                    special enactments in favour of Lascars and foreign seamen on British ships (see
                    4 Geo. IV. c. 80; 17 and 18 Vict. c. 104, s. 544; 17 and 18 Vict. c. 120, s. 16;
                    18 and 19 Vict. c. 91, s. 16). In addition to this legislation directly in his
                    interest, the seaman is indirectly protected by the provisions of the Merchant
                    Shipping Acts requiring the possession of certificates of competence by ships’
                    officere, the periodical survey of ships by the Board of Trade, and the
                    enactments against deck cargoes and overloading, as well as by<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0632-0607"/> other Acts, such as the Chain Cables and Anchors
                    Acts, enforcing a minimum strength of cables and anchors, and the Passenger
                    Acts, under which a proper supply of life-boats and life-buoys must be provided.
                    The duties of the seamen appear to be to obey the master in all lawful matters
                    relating to the navigation of the ship and to resist enemies, to encourage him
                    in which he may become entitled to prize money under 22 and 23 Car. II. c. 11
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Prize).</hi> Any services beyond these would fall
                    under the head of salvage service and be recompensed accordingly. There are
                    certain offences for which the seaman is liable to be summarily punished under
                    the Act of 1854. They comprise desertion, neglect or refusal to join his ship or
                    absence without leave, quitting the ship without leave before she is placed in
                    security, wilful disobedience to a lawful command, either on one occasion or
                    continued, assault upon a master or mate, combining to disobey lawful commands
                    or to neglect duty or to impede the navigation of the ship or the progress of
                    the voyage, wilful damage to the ship, or embezzlement of or wilful damage to
                    her stores or cargo, and smuggling. The punishment varies from forfeiture of all
                    or part of his wages to twelve weeks’ imprisonment (s. 243, as amended by the
                    Merchant Seamen Act, 1880). A master, seaman, or apprentice who by wilful breach
                    of duty, or by neglect of duty, or by reason of drunkenness, does any act
                    tending to the immediate loss, destruction, or serious damage of the ship or to
                    immediately endanger the life or limb of any person belonging to or on board of
                    the ship, or who by wilful breach of duty, or by neglect of duty, or by reason
                    of drunkenness refuses or omits to do any lawful act proper and requisite to be
                    done by him for preserving the ship from immediate loss, destruction, or serious
                    damage, or for preserving any person belonging to or on board of the ship from
                    immediate danger to life or limb, is guilty of a misdemeanour (s. 239). A seaman
                    is also punishable at common law for piracy and by statute for piracy and
                    offences against the Slave Trade Acts. A riotous assembly of seamen to prevent
                    the loading or unloading of any ship or to prevent others from working is an
                    offence under 33 Geo. III. c. 67 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Riot).</hi> Deserters
                    from Portuguese ships are punishable by 12 and 13 Vict. c. 25, and from any
                    foreign ship by 15 and 16 Vict. c. 26, of course by virtue of conventions with
                    Portugal and other foreign powers. The rating of seamen is now regulated by the
                    Merchant Seamen Act, 1880. By that Act a seaman is not entitled to the rating of
                    “A.B.” unless he has served four years before the mast, or three years or more
                    in a registered decked fishing vessel and one year at sea in a trading vessel
                    (43 and 44 Vict. c. 16, s. 7). The Act of 1854 enabled contributions to seamen’s
                    refuges and hospitals to be charged upon the mercantile marine fund. As a matter
                    of fact, however, there appears to be no grant in support of seamen’s hospitals
                    out of any public funds. The principal seamen’s hospital is that at Greenwich,
                    established in 1821 and incorporated by 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 9 under the name of
                    “The Seaman’s Hospital Society.” Up to 1870 this hospital occupied the old
                    “Dreadnought” at Greenwich, but in that year it obtained the old infirmary of
                    Greenwich Hospital from the admiralty at a nominal rent, in return for which a
                    certain number of beds are to be at the disposal of the admiralty. The hospital
                    is supported by voluntary contributions, including those of many foreign
                    Governments, and has between its foundation and the end of 1884 relieved no less
                    than 253,629 seamen of all nations. There is also a dispensary for seamen at the
                    London Docks, and a floating hospital at Cardiff, equally supported by voluntary
                    contributions. At one time there was an enforced contribution of sixpence a
                    mouth from the pay of masters and seamen towards the funds of Greenwich
                    Hospital, levied under the powers of some of the Greenwich Hospital Acts. The
                    payment of these contributions enabled them to receive annuities from the funds
                    of the hospital. These “Greenwich Hospital sixpences,” however, became the
                    source of very considerable irritation and have now been discontinued. In their
                    place a purely voluntary seamen’s provident fund has been established, its
                    object being to persuade seamen to subscribe sixpence a month towards the
                    seamen’s hospital.</p>
                <p>The remedies of the seaman for wages are an ordinary action in the Queen’s Bench
                    Division or plaint in a county court, an action <hi rend="italic">in rem</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">in personam</hi> in the Admiralty Division of the High Court
                    (in Scotland in the Court of Session), a Vice-Admiralty Court, or a county court
                    having admiralty jurisdiction, or summary proceedings before justices, naval
                    courts, or superintendents of mercantile marine offices. The master has now the
                    same remedies as the seaman for his wages, under which are included all
                    disbursements made on account of the ship. At common law he had only a personal
                    action against the owner. He has the additional advantage of being able to
                    insure his wages, which a seaman cannot do. A common law action for wages is
                    seldom brought, the statutory remedies being more convenient. By the Admiralty
                    Court Act, 1861, the High Court of Justice (Admiralty Division) has jurisdiction
                    over any claim by a seaman of any ship for wages earned by him on board the
                    ship, whether the same be due under a special contract or otherwise (24 Vict. c.
                    10, s. 10). This section has been liberally construed and held to apply to such
                    persons as a surgeon, purser, pilot, carpenter, and steward. The court can
                    entertain claims by foreign seamen against a foreign ship, on notice being given
                    to the consul of the foreign country. If he protest, the court has a discretion
                    to determine whether the action shall proceed or not. A claim for wages in the
                    High Court must be brought within six years (4 and 5 Anne, c. 3, s. 17). The
                    Vice-Admiralty Court Act, 1863, gives jurisdiction in claims for wages
                    irrespective of amount to vice-admiralty courts. A county court having admiralty
                    jurisdiction may entertain claims for wages where the amount claimed does not
                    exceed £150 (31 and 32 Vict. c. 71, s. 3). The jurisdiction of the inferior
                    court is protected by the proviso that, if the action be brought in the High
                    Court for a claim not exceeding £150, the plaintiff may be condemned in costs,
                    and will not be entitled to costs if he recover less than this sum, unless the
                    judge certifies that it was a proper case to be heard in the High Court (s. 9).
                    In actions in all courts of admiralty jurisdiction the seaman has a maritime
                    lien on the ship and freight, ranking next after claims for salvage and damage.
                    The amount recoverable summarily before justices is limited to £50. Orders may
                    be enforced by distress of the ship and her tackle. Proceedings must be taken
                    within six months. A naval court on a foreign station may determine questions as
                    to wages without limit of amount. As a rule a seaman cannot sue abroad for wages
                    due for a voyage to terminate in the United Kingdom. The superintendent of a
                    mercantile marine office has power to decide any question whatever between a
                    master or owner and any of his crew which both parties in writing agree to
                    submit to him. These summary remedies are all given by the Act of 1854. The
                    Merchant Seamen Act, 1880, further provides that, where a question as to wages
                    is raised before a superintendent, if the amount in question does not exceed £5,
                    the superintendent may adjudicate finally, unless he is of opinion that a court
                    of law ought to decide it. The same Act extends the provisions of the Employers
                    and Workmen Act, 1875, to seamen. The Act of 1875 itself specially excluded
                    them. A county court or court of summary jurisdiction (the latter limited to
                    claims not exceeding £10) may under the Act of 1875 determine all disputes
                    between an employer and workman arising out of their relation as such. The
                    jurisdiction of courts of summary jurisdiction is protected by the enactment of
                    the Act of 1854 that no proceeding for the recovery of wages under £50 is to be
                    instituted in a superior court unless either the owner of the ship is bankrupt,
                    or the ship is under arrest or sold by the authority of such court, or the
                    justices refer the case to such court, or neither owner nor master is or resides
                    within 20 miles of the place where the seaman is put ashore (s. 189). It should
                    be noticed that claims upon allotment notes may be brought in all county courts
                    and before justices without any limit as to amount (s. 169). In Scotland the
                    sheriff court has concurrent jurisdiction with justices in claims for wages and
                    upon allotment notes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    fishermen are contained chiefly in the Sea Fisheries Acts, 1868 and 1883, and in
                    the Merchant Shipping (Fishing-Boats) Act, 1883. The Sea Fisheries Act of 1868
                    constituted a registry of fishing-boats, and that of 1883 gave powers of
                    enforcing the provisions of the Acts to sea-fishery officers. The Merchant
                    Shipping (Fishing-Boats) Act was passed in consequence of the occurrence of some
                    cases of barbarous treatment of boys by the skippers of North Sea trawlers. The
                    Act provides, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> that indentures of
                    apprenticeship are to be in a certain form and entered into before a
                    superintendent of a mercantile marine office, that no boy under thirteen is to
                    be employed in sea-fishery, that agreements with seamen on a fishing-boat are to
                    contain the same particulars as those with merchant seamen, that running
                    agreements may be made in the case of short voyages, that reports of the names
                    of the crew are to be sent to a superintendent of a mercantile marine office,
                    and that accounts of wages and certificates of discharge are to be given to
                    seamen. No fishing-boat . is to go to sea without a duly certified skipper.
                    Provision is also made for special reports of cases of death, injury,
                    ill-treatment, or punishment of any of the crew, and for inquiry into the cause
                    of such death, &amp;c. Disputes between skippers or owners and seamen are to be
                    determined at request of any of the parties concerned by a superintendent. For
                    special privileges of fishermen in the use of the seashore, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Riparian Laws.</hi> They are also exempt from Trinity House
                    dues. There are numerous police provisions contained in various Acts of
                    Parliament dealing with the breach of fishery regulations. These provisions act
                    as an indirect protection to honest fishermen in their employment. The rights of
                    British fishermen in foreign waters and foreign fishermen in British waters are
                    in many cases regulated by treaty, generally confirmed in the United Kingdom by
                    Act of Parliament. A royal fund for widows and orphans of fishermen has recently
                    been formed, the nucleus of the fund being part of the profits of the Fisheries
                    Exhibition held in London in 1883.</p>

                    seamen in the navy will he found in the articles for the government of the navy
                    <hi rend="italic">(Revised Statutes,</hi> s. 1624). Legislation in the interests
                    of merchant seamen dates from 1790. A list of the crew must be delivered to a
                    collector of customs. The shipping articles are the same as those in use in the
                    United Kingdom. For vessels in the coasting trade they are, with certain
                    exceptions, to be in writing or in print. They must in the case of foreign-bound
                    ships be signed before a shipping commissioner appointed by the circuit court or
                    a collector of customs, or (if entered into abroad) a consular officer, where
                    practicable, and must be acknowledged by his signature in a prescribed form.
                    One-third of a seaman’s wages earned up to that time is due at every port where
                    the ship unlades and delivers her cargo before the voyage is ended. They must be
                    fully paid in gold or its equivalent within twenty days of the discharge of the
                    cargo. Advance notes can be made only in favour of the seaman himself or his
                    wife or mother. There is a summary remedy for wages before a district court, a
                    justice of the peace, or a commissioner of a district court. A shipping
                    commissioner may act as arbitrator by written consent of the parties.
                    Seaworthiness is an implied condition of the hiring. There may be an examination
                    of the ship on the complaint of the mate and a majority of the crew. The
                    expenses of an unnecessary investigation are a charge upon the wages of those
                    who complain. A seaman may not leave his ship without the consent of the master.
                    For foreign - bound voyages a medicine-chest and antiscorbutics must be carried,
                    also 60 gallons of water, 100 lb of salted meat, and 100 lb of wholesome bread
                    for every person on board, and for every seaman at least one suit of woollen
                    clothing, and fuel for the fire of the seaman’s room. An assessment of forty
                    cents per month per seaman is levied on every vessel arriving from a foreign
