                    the first author that Scotland produced. In addition to his biography of St
                    Columba, a long extract from a work of his on the “Holy Places” is incorporated
                    by Bede in his <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History.</hi> The greater part
                    of Scotland was at that time inhabited by a Celtic population and the period
                    from the 7th to the 13th century has left but few literary remains (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Celtic Literature,</hi> vol. v. p. 313). In the latter part of
                    the 13th century what may be called the ancient literary language of Scotland
                    was used in the district between the Humber and the Forth and coastwise as far
                    north as Aberdeen. Its earliest writer is Thomas of Ercildoune, or Thomas the
                    Rhymer, who reached the height of his fame in 1280. The fairy tale or romance
                    that bears his name may be regarded as the earliest example of romance poetry in
                    Britain. Nearly contemporary with the Rhymer were two other distinguished Scots,
                    Michael <hi rend="smallcaps">Scot</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) and John of
                    Duns, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Duns</hi> Scotus (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) <hi

                    romances taken from Anglo-Norman sources relating to Sir Gawain, one of the most
                    celebrated knights of the Round Table, seem to have been composed about the end
                    of the 13th century. These were— <hi rend="italic">Syr Gawayn and the Grene
                    Knycht,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Knightly Tale of Golagros and Gawayne,</hi>

                    Gawain’s exploits were so popular in the south of Scotland that he was claimed
                    by the people as one of their own chieftains and called the lord of Galloway.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Awntyrs of Arthur,</hi> or the adventures of King Arthur
                    at the Tern-wadling, a small lake near Carlisle, and the <hi rend="italic"

                    supposed to have been the productions of Sir Hew of Eglintoun about that period.

                    the emperor Charlemagne in the house of a charcoal-burner named Ralph in the

                    of <hi rend="italic">Orfeo and Heurodis</hi> were written in the early part of
                    the 14th century and were very popular in Scotland in former times.</p>
                <p>The War of Independence gave a new impetus to Scottish nationality and produced a
                    corresponding effect on the literature of the country. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brus,</hi> or metrical account of the deeds of Robert Bruce, was written by
                    John <hi rend="smallcaps">Barbour</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> archdeacon
                    of Aberdeen, in the latter part of the 14th century. To him we owe a translation
                    of a mediaeval romance on the <hi rend="italic">Trojan War,</hi> nearly 3000
                    lines in length, and a large collection of metrical lives of saints, which,
                    after being long preserved in manuscript, have recently been printed by Dr
                    Horstmann. About this time was compiled the first formal history of Scotland by
                    John of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fordun</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> which was
                    written in Latin and brought down to the death of David I. He, however, left
                    materials for the completion of the work, the last date of which is 1385. In
                    1441 a continuation of it was made by Walter Bower or Bowmaker. The whole work
                    was then styled the <hi rend="italic">Scotichronicon,</hi> and brings the
                    history of Scotland down to 1437. A metrical history was written between 1420
                    and 1424 by Andrew of Wyntoun, a canon regular of St Andrews and prior of St
                    Serf’s Inch in Loch Leven. This work, known as the <hi rend="italic">Orygynale
                    Cronykil of Scotland,</hi> is prefaced by an account of the human race from the
                    creation, and, although for the most part its verse is homely and dull, its
                    author occasionally describes stirring incidents with considerable power. The
                    beautiful poem of James I. called <hi rend="italic">The Kingis Quhair,</hi>
                    written about this period, was far in advance of the contemporary metrical
                    chronicles. It possesses a melody of verse unknown before and gives the king a
                    conspicuous place in early Scottish literature. He is supposed to have also
                    written <hi rend="italic">A Ballad of Good Counsel</hi> and a song <hi

                    have been his composition, have been recently shown by the Rev. W. W. Skeat to
                    be by some other early poet. An allegorical poem called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Buke of the Howlat</hi> was written about 1450 by Sir Richard Holland, an
                    adherent of the noble family of Douglas. It is a warning against pride,
                    exemplified by the owl, decked out in the splendour of borrowed feathers,
                    compelled on account of his insolence to resume his original form. The poem
                    displays some inventive and descriptive power, though marred by its
                    alliteration. The exploits of Sir William Wallace found<pb break="no"

                    Minstrel, or Blind Harry, who, born with such a serious defect, must be regarded
                    as one of the most extraordinary individuals recorded in the annals of
                    literature. His well-known poem, which bears the name of his hero, is in
                    versification, expression, and poetic imagery a remarkable production for that
                    period. The grave and thoughtful poetry of Robert <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Henryson</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> notary public and preceptor in the
                    Benedictine convent at Dunfermline, who flourished about 1470, contrasts
                    favourably with that of his English contemporaries. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Testament of Cresseid</hi> was often incorporated in the old editions of the
                    works of Chaucer, to whose poetry it is not inferior. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Robene and Makyne</hi> is the earliest specimen of pastoral poetry in the
                    Scottish language. These, with his <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> and other
                    works, entitle him to a high place amongst the early Scottish poets. Nearly
                    coeval with Henryson was Sir Gilbert Hay, chamberlain to Charles VI. of France,
                    who made several translations from the works of French authors. One of these,
                    taken from a popular French romance of Alexander the Great, extends to upwards
                    of 20,000 lines. A long anonymous poem called <hi rend="italic">Clariodus</hi>
                    belongs to this period. It is a romance founded on a French original, the more
                    material incidents of which are supposed to have happened at the English court.
                    It abounds with illustrations of the manners and customs peculiar to the age of
                    chivalry. Being nearly 3000 lines in length, it is, like the last-mentioned, an
                    extensive specimen of the language and versification of the time. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Thrie Tales of the Thrie Preistis of Peblis</hi> (1490), the
                    authorship of which is unknown, are moral tales possessing considerable
                    freshness. As a fragment of an old version of them occurs in the Asloan MS.,
                    written in 1490, they must have existed long before the edition printed by Henry
                    Charteris in 1603, in which form only they are now accessible. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Ledger</hi> of Andrew Halyburton, conservator of the privileges of
                    the Scottish nation in the Netherlands, 1492-1503, is a valuable source of
                    information regarding the early trade of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The close of the 15th century exhibited a considerable growth of literary ability
                    in the writings of William <hi rend="smallcaps">Dunbar</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >q.v</hi>.) and his contemporaries. His works were so highly esteemed at the
                    time he wrote that he was raised to the dignity of “the makar” or poet-laureate
                    of Scotland. Such of Dunbar’s writings as have come down to the present time are
                    of a miscellaneous character, in which there is much power of description and
                    command of verse. The <hi rend="italic">Thistle and the Rose</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Golden Targe</hi> are excellent specimens of his poetic power. His
                    satirical poems, such as the <hi rend="italic">Twa Mariit Wemen and the
                    Wedo</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Flyting with Kennedie,</hi> contain much
                    coarse humour. Seven of his poems were the first specimens of Scottish
                    typography, having been printed by Chepman and Myllar at Edinburgh in 1508,
                    followed in 1509 by the well-known <hi rend="italic">Breviary</hi> for the
                    church of Aberdeen. A humorous poem called the <hi rend="italic">Freiris of
                    Berwik</hi> has been attributed to Dunbar and is usually printed with his works.
                    Contemporary with Dunbar were a number of minor Scottish poets, of whose works
                    only a few specimens have come down to the present time. These were Walter
                    Kennedie, with whom he had his “flyting” or poetical contest, Sir John Rowll,
                    Quintyne Shaw, Patrick Johnestoun, Merseir, James Afflek, and others.<note

                    Hart,</hi> two allegorical poems, are able productions, the latter of which is
                    full of dramatic vigour. Contemporary with Douglas was Sir David <hi

                    in the reign of James V., who may be regarded as the most popular of the early
                    Scottish poets. His <hi rend="italic">Monarchie, or ane Dialog betuix Experience
                    and ane Courteour of the Miserabyl Estait of the Warld</hi> gives a short survey
                    of sacred and classical history which rendered it very popular in its time. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Satire of the Thrie Estaitis</hi> is a skilfully written
                    attempt to reform the abuses of the period, especially those of the church.
                    While some of its characters recite long and erudite political speeches, he
                    introduces interludes of a farcical kind suited to the tastes of the times. This
                    work may be considered the first dramatic effort of any British author. In his
                    <hi rend="italic">Testament of Squire Meldrum</hi> he relates the adventures of
                    his hero with much poetic fire. Lyndsay’s other poems consist of appeals to the
                    king for advancement and some <hi rend="italic">jeux d’esprit</hi> of no great
                    length. One of the best scholars and teachers of this period was John Major or
                    Mair, a native of Haddington, who was principal of St Salvator’s College, St
                    Andrews. Besides being the author of learned commentaries on Aristotle, he wrote
                    a well-known work, <hi rend="italic">De historia gentis Scotorum libri sex,</hi>
                    printed in 1521. Another Scottish author that wrote in Latin with considerable
                    elegance was Hector <hi rend="smallcaps">Boece</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.),</hi> principal of King’s College, Aberdeen. His great work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia gentis Scotorum a prima gentis origine,</hi> was
                    published in Paris in 1526. It was translated into Scottish by John Bellenden,
                    archdeacon of Moray, under the title of the <hi rend="italic">Hystory and
                    Croniklis of Scotland,</hi> printed at Edinburgh in 1536. Bellenden also
                    translated the first five books of Livy into Scottish. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle</hi> of Boece was versified in Scottish in 1531-35 by William
                    Stewart, a descendant of the first earl of Buchan. It was written by command of
                    Margaret, sister of Henry VIII. of England, for the instruction of her son, the
                    youthful James V. A Latin poem of much merit, entitled <hi rend="italic">De
                    animi tranquillitate,</hi> was published in 1543 by Florence Wilson, master of
                    Carpentras School. It is in the form of a dialogue and displays much variety of
                    knowledge, while its Latinity has long been celebrated. In an anonymous work,
                    written in 1548 or 1549, and called the <hi rend="italic">Complaynt of
                    Scotland,</hi> the author deplores the calamities to which Scotland was then
                    subject. These are stated to be the wrongs done to the Scottish labourers at the
                    hands of the landholders and the clergy, the difficulties with England, and the
                    treachery of the Scottish nobility. The work is valuable as affording a glimpse
                    of the literature then popular in Scotland, some pieces of which are no longer
                    to be found,—such as <hi rend="italic">The Tayle of the Reyde Eyttyn</hi> [red

                <p>In 1552 there was printed at St Andrews a <hi rend="italic">Catechism, that is to

                    St Andrews, the last primate of the Roman Catholic faith in Scotland. The poems
                    of Sir Richard Maitland, which are of a somewhat satirical kind, are valuable,
                    as they, like those of Lyndsay, contain much information about the abuses of the
                    time (1560), such as the oppressive conduct of the landholders, vexatious
                    lawsuits, and the depredations of the Border thieves. Sir Richard deserves the
                    thanks of posterity for the large manuscript collection of poems by Scottish
                    authors which he and his daughter formed, and which is now preserved in the

                    history of Scottish poetry, as in 1568 he too formed an extensive collection of
                    Scottish poetry which is certainly the most valuable now extant. It was written
                    by him at Edinburgh in the time of the plague, when the dread of infection
                    confined him closely at home. The <hi rend="italic">Bannatyne MS.</hi> now
                    preserved in the Advocates’ Library extends to 800 pages folio, and includes
                    several of Bannatyne’s own poems, of which the two most considerable are of an
                    amatory character. The works of Alexander Scott, consisting principally of love
                    poems, embrace also a spirited account of a <hi rend="italic">Jousting betwix
                    Adamson and Sym</hi> at the Drum, a place a little to the south of Edinburgh.
                    The author, who was one of the most elegant poets of this period, has sometimes
                    been called the “Scottish Anacreon.” Two poems of some merit—the <hi

                    Aberdeen, about 1570. A poem of considerable length, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sege of the Castell of Edinburgh,</hi> published in 1573, was by
                    Robert Semple, who also wrote an attack on Archbishop Adamson, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Legend of the Bishop of Sanct Androis Lyfe.</hi> To this period
                    belong two poems of considerable length— the <hi rend="italic">Court of Venus
                    (1575),</hi> an imitation of the <hi rend="italic">Palice of Honour</hi> of
                    Gawyn Douglas, and the romance of the <hi rend="italic">Seaven Seages</hi>
                    (1578), a Scottish version of one of the most remarkable mediaeval collections
                    of stories belonging to the same class as the <hi rend="italic">Arabian
                    Nights,</hi> in which one single story is employed as a means of stringing
                    together a multitude of subsidiary tales. These poems were written by John
                    Rolland, notary in Dalkeith. One of the best Latin scholars that modern Europe
                    has produced was George <hi rend="smallcaps">Buchanan</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.),</hi> who flourished in the middle of the 16th century. He wrote several
                    Latin tragedies and an unrivalled translation of the Psalms. His <hi
                    rend="italic">De jure regni apud Scotos</hi> was composed to instruct James VI.,
                    to whom he had been tutor, in the duties belonging to his kingly office. His
                    last and most important labour was his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Scotland,</hi> originally printed in 1582, of which seventeen editions have
                    appeared. An excellent specimen of the ancient vernacular language is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle of Scotland</hi> by Robert Lyndsay of Pitscottie. It
                    includes the period from 1436 to the marriage of Mary to Darnley in 1565.
                    Although its author was a simple-minded and credulous man, he describes events
                    of which he was an eye-witness with circumstantiality and great prolixity of
                    detail. Another historical work of greater importance was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De origine, morilrus, et rebus gestis Scotorum</hi> (1578) by John Lesley,
                    bishop of Ross. A translation of this work made by Father James Dalrymple, a
                    religious in the Scottish cloister of Ratisbon, 1596, is in course of
                    publication by the Rev. Father E. B. Cody for the Scottish Text Society. Lesley
                    also wrote in Scottish a <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi> from the
                    death of James I. in 1436 to the year 1561. This work, intended for the perusal
                    of Mary while in captivity in England, is written in an elegant style. The
                    bishop was the champion of that unfortunate queen, and in 1569 wrote a <hi
                    rend="italic">Defence of the Honour of Marie Queue of Scotland and Dowager of
                    France,</hi> with a declaration of her right, title, and interest to the
                    succession of the crown of England.</p>
                <p>The Reformation exerted a considerable influence on Scottish literature. Amongst
                    the earliest Protestant writers of the country may be mentioned Alexander Ales
                    or Alesius, a native of Edinburgh, who published several controversial works and
                    commentaries on various parts of the Bible. But the most eminent promoter of the
                    reform was John <hi rend="smallcaps">Knox (</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    q.v.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">),</hi> who wrote several controversial pamphlets
                    and some religious treatises; his great work was the <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the Reformation of Religion in Scotland,</hi> first printed in 1586. One of
                    the principal opponents of Knox was Ninian</p>
                <p>Winzet, a priest of considerable ability and one familiar with the scholastic
                    learning of the age. He began life as master of Linlithgow school and
                    subsequently became abbot of St James’s at Ratisbon. He wrote several tracts in
                    which he strenuously recommended the observance of certain popish festivals. In
                    1562 he published his <hi rend="italic">Buke of Four Scoir Thrie Questions
                    tucking Doctrine, Ordour, and Maneris proponit to the Prechouris of the
                    Protestantis in Scotland and deliverit to Jhone Knox the 20th day of February
                    1562.</hi> The writings of James VI., who was a man of scholarly attainments,
                    embrace several works both in poetry and prose. His earliest production,
                    published in 1584, when he was only eighteen, was the <hi rend="italic">Essayes
                    of a Prentice in the Divine Art of Poesie.</hi> This was followed by his
                    poetical <hi rend="italic">Exercises at Vacant Houres</hi> (1591). He also wrote
                    a great many sonnets and a translation of the Psalms. His prose works are <hi
                    rend="italic">Daemonologie</hi> (1597), Βασιλικόν Δώρον (1599), <hi
                    rend="italic">Counterblast to Tobacco, Paraphrase on Revelation, Law of Free
                    Monarchies,</hi> &amp;c. Among the Scottish poets who frequented his court were
                    William Fowler, the elegant translator of the <hi rend="italic">Triumphs</hi> of
                    Petrarch, and Stewart of Baldinnies (Perth), a translator of Ariosto. Both these
                    poets wrote other works which exist in MS., but are still unpublished. The zeal
                    of Sir David Lyndsay and others for the reformation of the church initiated a
                    religious revival, and in 1597 was published the collection-known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Ane Compendious Booke of Godly and Spiritual Sangs for avoiding of
                    Sinne and Harlotrie.</hi> This very curious work is attributed to John and
                    Robert Wedderburn, the latter of whom was vicar of Dundee. A number of religious
                    poems were written about the end of the 16th century by James Melville, minister
                    of Anstruther, afterwards of Kilrenny, both in Fife. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morning Vision,</hi> printed in 1598, consists of paraphrases of the Lord’s
                    Prayer, the Shorter Catechism, and the Ten Commandments. He also wrote the <hi
                    rend="italic">Black Bastel,</hi> a lamentation over the Church of Scotland,
                    which is dated 1611. Another religious poet was James Cockburn, a native of
                    Lanarkshire, who wrote <hi rend="italic">Gabriel's Salutation to Marie</hi>
                    (1605), and some other poems not destitute of merit. An eminent theological
                    writer of this era, Robert Rollock, first principal of the university of
                    Edinburgh, wrote many commentaries on the Scriptures which show extensive
                    learning. Most are in Latin; but one or two are in the Scottish language. A very
                    popular poem, the <hi rend="italic">Cherrie and the Slae,</hi> first printed by
                    Waldegrave at Edinburgh in 1597, afterwards went through many editions. Its
                    author was Alexander Montgomerie, who also wrote some translations of the Psalms
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Flyting betwixt Montgomerie and Polwarth,</hi> in
                    imitation of Dunbar’s <hi rend="italic">Flyting with Kennedie.</hi> In 1599 was
                    published an interesting volume of poems written by Alexander Hume, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Hymnes or Sacred Songs, wherein the Right Use of Poesie may be
                    espied.</hi> One is on the defeat of the Spanish Armada. To the beginning of the
                    17th century belongs a comedy in rhyming stanza, the authorship of which is
                    unknown,— <hi rend="italic">Ane verie Excellent and Delectabili Treatise
                    intitulit Philotus, quhairin we may perceive the Greit Inconveniences that
                    fallis out in the Marriage betuix Aige and Youth</hi> (1603). Its versification
                    is easy and pleasant, and its plan a nearer approximation to the modern drama
                    than the satire of Lyndsay. In the same year appeared the poems of Sir William
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> earl of
                    Stirling. One, called <hi rend="italic">Doomsday, or the Great Day of the Lord's
                    Judgment,</hi> consists of 11,000 verses. His <hi rend="italic">Monarchicke
                    Tragedies,</hi> four in number, were not intended for representation on the
                    stage. His exhortation or <hi rend="italic">Paraenesis to Prince Henry</hi>
                    (1604) is his best poem. He also wrote <hi rend="italic">Recreations with the
                    Muses</hi> (1637), which is of a somewhat philosophical character. One of the
                    most distinguished writers of this era was William <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Drummond</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> of Hawthornden, who<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n568/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0568-0543"/> published <hi rend="italic">Poem</hi> s, <hi
                    rend="italic">amorous, funerali, divine, pastorall</hi> (1616), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Flowers of Zion, or Spiritual Poems</hi> (1623). He also wrote a
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland during the Reigns of the Five Jameses</hi>
                    (1655), some political tracts, and the <hi rend="italic">Cypress Grove,</hi> a
                    moral treatise in prose. As a writer of sonnets he has always been highly
                    esteemed. Nearly contemporary with Drummond was Patrick Hannay, a native of
                    Galloway, who seems to have followed James to England. He published his poems in
                    1622, the principal of which are <hi rend="italic">Philomela the
                    Nightingale</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sheretrine and Mariana.</hi> He occupies
                    a favourable position amongst the minor Scottish poets. After the removal of the
                    Scottish court to London and the union of the crowns in 1603, the old language
                    began to be considered as a provincial dialect; and the writers subsequent to
                    Drummond, who was the first Scottish poet that wrote well in English, take their
                    places amongst British authors.</p>
                <p>To the short sketch above given may be added a notice of the early Scottish
                    writers on mathematics, philosophy, jurisprudence, and medicine. In mathematical
                    science the name of Joannes Sacro Bosco (John Holywood or Holybush) may be
                    mentioned, as he is believed to have been a native of Nithsdale and a canon of
                    the monastery of Holywood, from which he took his name. He flourished about the
                    beginning of the 13th century, and his treatise <hi rend="italic">Dc Sphera
                    Mundi</hi> was very generally taught in colleges and schools. The system of
                    astronomy and the other mathematical treatises of James Bassantie, who taught at
                    Paris about 1560 with much success, were celebrated in their time. The greatest
                    of the Scottish mathematicians, however, was John <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Napier</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.</hi>) of Merchiston, who wrote on various
                    kindred subjects, and in 1614 astonished the world by his discovery of
                    logarithms. In philosophy, besides the voluminous works of Duns Scotus and John
                    Major already mentioned, various learned commentaries on Aristotle, of which
                    Scottish philosophy then almost entirely consisted, were published by Robert
                    Balfour, principal of the college of Guienne; by John Rutherford, professor of
                    philosophy at St Andrews (under whom Admirable Crichton was a pupil); and by
                    James Cheyne, professor of philosophy at Douai. In jurisprudence a celebrated
                    treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Feudal Law</hi> was written by Sir Thomas
                    Craig about 1603. It was not, however, published till about half a century after
                    his death, as the printing of any treatise on the law of Scotland while he lived
                    seems to have been considered as out of the question. Commentaries on some of
                    the titles of the <hi rend="italic">Pandects</hi> of Justinian, and a treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De Potestate Papae</hi> (1609), in opposition to the
                    usurpation of temporal power by the pope, were written by William Barclay,
                    professor of law in the university of Angers. Another early legal work was a
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Connexion between Government and
                    Religion,</hi> by Adam Blackwood, judge of the parlement of Poitiers, who was
                    the antagonist of Buchanan and a strenuous defender of Mary queen of Scots. In
                    medicine the principal early Scottish works were written by Duncan Liddell, a
                    native of Aberdeen, who in 1605 published at Helmstädt his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Disputationes medicinales,</hi> containing the theses or disputations
                    maintained by himself and his pupils from 1592 to 1606. He also published other
                    works, which contain an able digest of the medical learning of his age. Henry
                    Blackwood, dean of faculty to the college of physicians at Paris, wrote various
                    treatises on medicine, of which a list will be found in Mackenzie’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lives of the Scottish Writers,</hi> but which are now only
                    historically interesting. (J. SM.)</p>
