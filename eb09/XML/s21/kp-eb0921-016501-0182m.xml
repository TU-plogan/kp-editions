                    substance interesting not only in itself but as the first obtained of an
                    important group, the so-called “anhydrides” of the monobasic acids. In 1855 he
                    succeeded in obtaining aluminium in mass. This metal, of which clay is the
                    hydrated silicate, is of course one of the most abundant of metals, but was not
                    obtained in the metallic state until Wohler in 1827 decomposed its chloride by
                    means of potassium. The aluminium thus prepared was in the form of a fine
                    powder, and, although the isolation of the metal was of great theoretical
                    importance, there did not seem much prospect of a practical application of the
                    discovery. In 1845 Wohler returned to the subject and by using large quantities
                    of material obtained small globules of an obviously metallic character. Deville,
                    who knew only Wohler’s paper of 1827, set to work to prepare aluminium, not for
                    the sake of the metal itself, but with the view of procuring by the action of
                    aluminium on chloride of aluminium a lower chloride from which a series of new
                    compounds corresponding to the ferrous salts might be obtained. He did not
                    succeed in this, but he did succeed in producing globules of aluminium of
                    considerable size. This led him to perfect the process, and ultimately he
                    devised a method by which aluminium could be prepared on a large scale. The
                    first use to which he put the metal was to make a medal with the name of Wohler
                    and the date 1827. In connexion with the preparation of aluminium may be
                    mentioned Deville’s investigations, partly with Wohler, into the allotropic
                    forms of silicon and boron.</p>
                <p>Along with Debray, Deville studied the platinum metals; their object was on the
                    one hand to prepare the six metals in a state of purity and on the other to
                    obtain a suitable metal for the standard metre. In the course of these
                    investigations large quantities of platinum and of the alloys of platinum and
                    iridium were fused and cast,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    experimental work on “Dissociation” and his theoretical discussion of the facts
                    in papers published in the <hi rend="italic">Comptes Rendus.</hi> He gave a very
                    complete and clear account of the whole subject in a lecture delivered before
                    the Chemical Society of Paris in 1866.</p><p>As illustrations we shall take a
                    few cases as different from one another as possible.</p><p>It has long been
                    known that carbonate of lime—limestone— when heated is decomposed into quicklime
                    and carbonic acid gas, and that this decomposition takes place the more quickly
                    the more thoroughly the carbonic acid produced is removed. Sir James Hall showed
                    that, if the carbonate of lime is heated in a closed vessel strong enough to
                    resist the pressure of the carbonic acid gas, it can be fused, only a small part
                    undergoing decomposition. Deville examined this relation quantitatively and
                    showed that, if in a closed vessel we have quicklime, carbonate of lime, and
                    carbonic acid gas, the pressure of the <hi rend="italic">carbonic acid gas</hi>
                    depends on the temperature only, and is quite independent of the quantity of the
                    quicklime or of the carbonate of lime, as long as there is some, however little,
                    of both, and is also quite uninfluenced by the presence of other gases. It will
                    be seen that this case exactly resembles that of the evaporation of water. In a
                    closed vessel containing liquid water and water-vapour the pressure of the <hi
                    rend="italic">water-vapour</hi> depends on the temperature only and is
                    independent of the quantity of liquid water, as long as there is any, and is not
                    influenced by the presence of other gases. In both cases, if we disturb the
                    equilibrium and then leave tilings to themselves the equilibrium is restored. If
                    in the first case we diminish the pressure of the carbonic acid gas, some
                    carbonate of lime decomposes, yielding carbonic acid gas until the pressure is
                    raised to what it was; if we increase the pressure, some of the carbonic acid
                    combines with quicklime until the pressure is reduced to what it was before. In
                    the second case, if we diminish the pressure, some of the liquid water
                    evaporates; if we increase it, some of the water-vapour condenses, and so the
                    pressure is restored. Rise of temperature causes in the one case evaporation of
                    water, in the other decomposition of carbonate of lime,—in both increase of
                    pressure. Lowering of temperature causes in the one case condensation of
                    water-vapour, in the other combination of quicklime and carbonic acid gas,—in
                    both diminution of pressure.</p><p>As a second instance we may take the
                    dissociation of water. Just as water-vapour condenses into liquid water under
                    certain conditions, but always with the evolution of heat (latent heat of
                    vapour), so the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen in the proper proportion to form
                    water combines, under certain conditions, to form water-vapour, but always with
                    the evolution of heat (heat of combination). In both cases we have change of
                    state but no change of composition, and in both we have evolution of heat. In
                    the first case we can reverse the process: heat the liquid water, heat becomes
                    latent, liquid water changes into water-vapour. There is a certain definite
                    pressure of water-vapour corresponding to the temperature: raise the
                    temperature, more water evaporates, the pressure of watervapour increases. It
                    occurred to Deville, to whom both changes were equally physical, that in the
                    second case the process should be reversible also,—that on heating the
                    water-vapour it ought to decompose into oxygen and hydrogen, heat disappearing
                    here also, and that, as there is a definite pressure of water-vapour
                    corresponding to the temperature (often called the tension of water-vapour), so
                    there should be a definite ratio of the pressure of hydrogen and oxygen to that
                    of water-vapour (the tension of dissociation). Deville showed in the most
                    conclusive manner that this is the case and devised ingenious arrangements for
                    proving the actual occurrence of dissociation.</p><p>Another case very fully
                    investigated by Deville is that already mentioned,—viz., the action of
                    water-vapour on iron, and of hydrogen on oxide of iron. He showed that, for a
                    fixed temperature, water-vapour and hydrogen are in equilibrium in presence of
                    iron and oxide of iron when the pressures of the two gases, hydrogen and
                    water-vapour, are in a certain ratio quite independent of the quantity of the
                    iron or of the oxide of iron, as long as there is some of each. If the ratio is
                    changed, say by increasing the pressure of the water-vapour, chemical action
                    takes place: water is decomposed, oxide of iron is formed, and hydrogen set
                    free. Again, if the pressure of the water-vapour is diminished, part of the
                    hydrogen acts on oxide of iron, reducing it and forming water. In both cases the
                    ratio of pressures is restored. This gives an easy explanation of the apparently
                    anomalous results mentioned above. When a current of hydrogen is passed over
                    oxide of iron the water-vapour produced is swept away as fast as it is formed;
                    the ratio of the pressure of hydrogen to that of water-vapour is therefore
                    always greater than that required for equilibrium and reduction of iron, and
                    formation of water goes on continuously until all the oxide of iron is reduced.
                    In the same way, a current of water-vapour carries away the hydrogen as fast as
                    it is produced; the ratio of the pressure of hydrogen to that of water-vapour is
                    always less than that required for equilibrium, and the oxidation of iron and
                    production of hydrogen goes on until no metallic iron remains. Exactly the same
                    explanation applies to the action of carbonic acid gas on solution of
                    sulph-</p></note> and the methods used for obtaining the necessary high
                    temperatures were applied to the fusion of other refractory metals, such as
                    cobalt, nickel, chromium, and manganese.</p>
                <p>Along with Troost, Deville devised a method for determining the density of
                    vapours at very high temperatures and applied it to the cases of sulphur,
                    selenium, tellurium, zinc, cadmium, and many other substances boiling at
                    temperatures up to 1400° C. The interesting and important results have been
                    already described (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Molecule).</hi> Deville made a large number of ingenious
                    experiments on the artificial production of minerals. Among these may be
                    specially mentioned the formation of apatite and isoinorphous minerals and of
                    crystallized oxides. Deville and Caron found that when the vapour of a metallic
                    fluoride acts on fused boracic acid the fluorine and the oxygen change places, a
                    metallic oxide remains in crystals, while the gaseous fluoride of boron escapes.
                    In this way they prepared corundum (crystallized oxide of aluminium) and
                    sapphire, ruby and emerald; coloured forms of corundum were obtained by mixing
                    small quantities of fluoride of chromium with the fluoride of aluminium. Another
                    method discovered by Deville for the preparation of crystallized oxides is of
                    great interest. When an amorphous oxide—such as amorphous ferric oxide—is heated
                    to redness and exposed to a slow current of hydrochloric acid gas, it gradually
                    changes into a crystalline oxide of the same composition. In this way Deville
                    obtained haematite, tinstone, periclase, and other crystalline oxides. This
                    conversion of an amorphous into a crystalline substance without change of
                    composition, by the action of a gas (in this case hydrochloric acid) which
                    itself undergoes no change, is one of those mysterious processes which used to
                    be referred to a “catalytic force” or called “actions by contact”; like many
                    such actions, this has been shown by Deville to belong to the same class of
                    phenomena as dissociation.</p>
                <p>This leads us to Deville’s greatest contribution to general chemistry. Many
                    chemical actions have been long known which take place either in the one or the
                    other sense according to certain conditions. For instance, if a tube containing
                    metallic iron is heated to redness and steam passed through it, water is
                    decomposed, black oxide of iron is formed, and hydrogen escapes. If, on the
                    other hand, the tube is filled with black oxide of iron and hydrogen passed
                    through, the oxide is reduced and water is formed. Both of these opposite
                    changes occur at the very same temperature. Again, a solution of sulph-hydrate
                    of potassium is completely decomposed by passing a current of carbonic acid gas
                    through it for a sufficient time, sulphuretted hydrogen being given off and
                    bicarbonate remaining in solution. But exactly the opposite happens if we begin
                    with bicarbonate and pass sulphuretted hydrogen gas through it: carbonic acid
                    gas escapes and the solution ultimately contains nothing but sulph-hydrate. An
                    imperfect, unsatisfactory explanation of some of the phenomena of which these
                    are examples was given by Berthollet; it remained for Deville to give a general
                    theory and show their relation to such physical phenomena as<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n184/mode/1up"

                    hydrogen on solution of bicarbonate of potassium. Equilibrium results when the
                    pressures of the gases are in a certain ratio; if the equilibrium is disturbed
                    chemical action takes place in the direction which tends to restore the
                    equilibrium by reproducing the ratio of pressures.</p>
                <p>The apparatus devised by Deville for detecting and measuring dissociation
                    illustrates his remarkable ingenuity. We shall instance only one example in
                    addition to those already mentioned.</p>
                <p>One of the great difficulties in observing dissociation depends on its reversible
                    character. A compound may indeed decompose when raised to a high temperature;
                    but, if, as we cool it again, reunion occurs, it is not easy to prove that any
                    chemical change took place, One of the ways in which Deville got over this
                    difficulty was by the use of his “hot and cold tube.” Inside a porcelain tube he
                    placed a metal tube of smaller diameter, so that their axes coincided, leaving
                    an annular space between them. This annular space was closed at both ends, but,
                    by means of side tubes near the ends, could be filled with any gas, or a current
                    of gas could be passed through it. The porcelain tube was raised to a high
                    temperature by being placed in a furnace, while the internal metal tube was kept
                    cold by running water through it. By this means he proved the dissociation of
                    carbonic acid gas, carbonic oxide, and sulphurous acid gas,—the carbon or
                    sulphur being deposited on the outer wall of the cold internal tube, and thus
                    kept at a temperature below that at which recombination could take place.</p>
                <p>Deville’s observations on dissociation and his generalizations from them have a
                    very direct bearing on the kinetic theory of gases, and it is a fact of interest
                    in the history of science that Deville did not recognize the validity of that
                    theory, Our estimate of the ingenuity, skill, and patience shown in his
                    experimental work, and of the genius and sound judgment which directed his
                    theoretical conclusions, is perhaps raised when we recollect that he was neither
                    led in the first nor biassed in the second by ideas derived from the kinetic
                    theory, and his hostile or at least neutral attitude towards it gives perhaps
                    greater value to the evidence that his work has contributed to its
                    soundness.</p>
