                    (1819-1857), historical, philosophical, and theological writer, one of the first
                    and most distinguished of the pupils of F. C. Baur and of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dei minores</hi> of the Tübingen school. He was born at Michel-</p>
                <p>bach in Würtemberg on 10th February 1819, the son of a country clergyman, and
                    entered the university of Tübingen· in 1836 as a student of theology, though
                    with a predominant liking for classical philology. Under Baur’s influence he
                    devoted himself to the study of ecclesiastical history, and his first work was
                    <hi rend="italic">Der Montanismus u. die christliche Kirche des 2ten
                    Jahrhunderts</hi> (1841), in which he was the first to point out that Montanism
                    was much more than an isolated outbreak of eccentric fanaticism in the early
                    church, though he introduced fresh misconceptions by connecting it with
                    Ebionitism as he conceived the latter. This work, with other essays, brought
                    Schwegler into conflict with the authorities of the church, in consequence of
                    which he gave up theology as his professional study and chose that of
                    philosophy. In 1843 he commenced in the Tübingen university the career of a
                    teacher <hi rend="italic">(privat-docent)</hi> of philosophy and classical
                    philology, and in 1848 was made extraordinary professor of the latter subject
                    and soon after ordinary professor of history. His death took place on 5th
                    January 1857.</p>
                <p>His principal theological work was <hi rend="italic">Das nachapostolische
                    Zeitalter</hi> (2 vols., 1846). It was this hook which first put before the
                    world, with Schwegler’s characteristic boldness and clearness, the results of
                    the critical labours of the earlier Tübingen school in relation to the first
                    development of Christianity. Carl Schwarz says of it, “This work—full though it
                    was of youthful exaggerations and provocations, partisan as it was in its line
                    of argument, untrue and abstract as its contrast of Paulinism and Petrinism was,
                    and arbitrary as was its use of those party names—produced nevertheless by its
                    masterly literary form (which reminds us of Strauss), and by its easy handling
                    and presentation of all the important data, a powerful impression, and, although
                    in many points of detail it is out of date, it may still be regarded as one of
                    the ‘ standard works ’ of the school.” Schwegler published also an edition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Clementine Homilies</hi> (1847), and of Eusebius’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> (1852). In the department of
                    philosophy we have an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics</hi> of
                    Aristotle, with a translation and commentary (4 vols., 1847-48), the well-known
                    sketch of the <hi rend="italic">History of Philosophy</hi> (1848), and a
                    posthumous <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Gricch. Philosophie</hi> (1859). In
                    history he commenced a <hi rend="italic">Römische Geschichte</hi> (vols.
                    i.-iii., 1853- 58, 2d ed., 1869), which he brought down only to the laws of
                    Licinius.</p>
