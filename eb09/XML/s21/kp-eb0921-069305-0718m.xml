                    (1648-1723), a minor poet and playwright of the Restoration period, immortalized
                    by the ridicule of Dryden and Pope, was born at Dunstable in 1648. He is the
                    “Doeg” of the second part of <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Achitophel,</hi> and
                    is treated by the satirist with somewhat more good-humoured contempt than his
                    companion in the pillory—Shadwell.</p>
                <p>Doeg, though without knowing how or why,</p>
                <p>Made still a blundering kind of melody;</p>
                <p>Spurr’d boldly on, and dash’d through thick and thin, Through sense and nonsense,
                    never out nor in.</p>
                <p>Dryden treats him as a sort of harmless fool, who “rhymed and rattled” along in
                    perfect satisfaction with himself. For some time also he was taken by the public
                    at his own valuation. At college he seems to have been regarded as a prodigy,
                    and his juvenile verse was preferred to Dryden’s. Coming to London, he began to
                    produce tragedies. His <hi rend="italic">Empress of Morocco</hi> (acted in 1673,
                    when the author was twenty-five) was a signal success on the stage, and is said
                    by Dennis to have been “the first play that was ever sold in England for two
                    shillings, and the first that was ever printed with cuts.” Puffed up by this
                    success, Settle made haughty allusions in his preface, which excited the ire of
                    his contemporaries; and Dryden co-operated with Crowne and Shadwell in writing
                    sarcastic notes on <hi rend="italic">The Empress.</hi> Settle’s next collision
                    with Dryden was also provoked by himself. He attempted a counterblast to
                    Dryden’s great satire in <hi rend="italic">Absalom Senior,</hi> and was
                    contemptuously demolished in return. Settle was then comparatively a young man,
                    his age being thirty-five, but he had touched the height of his fame, and the
                    remaining forty years of his life were not so successful. Dryden mockingly said
                    of him that his ambition was to be “the master of a puppet-show,” alluding to
                    his duties in the office of city poet, in which he was one of the successors of
                    Lodge, Middleton, Jonson, and Quarles; and to this he was literally reduced in
                    his old age, keeping a booth at Bartholomew Fair, where he is said to have
                    played the part of the dragon in green leather. He died in the Charterhouse in
                    1723.</p>
