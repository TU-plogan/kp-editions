                    terrestrial and marine, dates from very early times. Pliny (<hi rend="italic"
                    >H.N</hi>., viii. 14), following Livy <hi rend="italic">(Epic,</hi> xviii.),
                    tells us of a land-serpent 120 feet long, which Regulus and his army besieged
                    with balistae, as though it had been a city, and this story is repeated by
                    several other writers (Florus, ii. 2; Val. Max., i. 8; Gellius, vi. 3). The most
                    prolific in accounts of the sea-serpent, however, are the early Norse writers,
                    to whom the “Sö-Orm” was a subject both for prose and verse. Olaus Magnus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hist. Gent. Sept.,</hi> xxi. 24) describes it as 200 feet long
                    and 20 feet round, and states that it not only ate calves, sheep, and swine, but
                    also “disturbs ships, rising up like a mast, and sometimes snaps some of the men
                    from the deck,” illustrating his account with a vivid representation of the
                    animal in the very act. Pontoppidan, in his <hi rend="italic">Natural
                    History</hi> (Eng. tr., 1755, p. 195 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> says that its
                    existence was generally believed in by the sailors and fishermen of his time,
                    and recounts the means they adopted to escape it, as well as many details
                    regarding the habits of the creature. The more circumstantial records of
                    comparatively modern times may be most conveniently grouped according to the
                    causes which presumably gave rise to the phenomena described. (1) A number of
                    porpoises swimming one behind another may, by their characteristic mode of half
                    emerging from and then re-entering the water during respiration, produce the
                    appearance of a single animal showing a succession of snake-like undulations.
                    The figure given by Pontoppidan was very likely suggested by such an appearance,
                    and a sketch of an animal seen off Llandudno by several observers<note

                    similar origin, notwithstanding that this hypothesis was rejected by them. (2) A

                    the water. (3) A large mass of seaweed has on more than one occasion been
                    cautiously approached and even harpooned under the impression that it was such a
                    monster.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>F. Smith, <hi
