                    His mother was Lady Dorothy Manners, daughter of John, earl of Rutland.
                    According to a curious story, told by the third earl himself, the marriage
                    between his father and mother was negotiated by John Locke, who was a trusted
                    friend of the first earl. The second Lord Shaftesbury appears to have been a
                    poor creature, both physically and mentally,—“born a shapeless lump, like
                    anarchy,” according to what is doubtless the exaggerated metaphor of Dryden. At
                    the early age of three his son was made over to the formal guardianship of his
                    grandfather. Locke, who in his capacity of medical attendant to the Ashley
                    household had already assisted in bringing the boy into the world, though not
                    his instructor, was entrusted with the superintendence of his education. This
                    was conducted according to the principles enunciated in Locke’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Thoughts concerning Education,</hi> and the method of teaching
                    Latin and Greek conversationally was pursued with such success by his
                    instructress, Mrs Elizabeth Birch, that at the age of eleven, it is said, young
                    Ashley could read both languages with ease. In November 1683, some months after
                    the death of the first earl, his father entered him at Winchester as a warden’s
                    boarder. Being a shy, retiring boy, and being moreover constantly taunted with
                    the opinions and fate of his grandfather, he appears to have been rendered
                    miserable by the rough manners of his schoolfellows, and to have left Winchester
                    in 1686 for a course of foreign travel. By this change he was brought into
                    direct contact with those artistic and classical associations which afterwards
                    exercised so marked an influence on his character and opinions. On his travels
                    he did not, we are told by the fourth earl, “greatly seek the conversation of
                    other English young gentlemen on their travels,” but rather that of their
                    tutors, with whom he could converse on congenial topics.</p>
                <p>In 1689, the year after the Revolution, Lord Ashley returned to England, and for
                    nearly five years from this time he appears to have led a quiet, uneventful, and
                    studious life. There can be no doubt that the greater part of his attention was
                    directed to the perusal of those classical authors, and to the attempt to
                    realize the true spirit of that classical antiquity, for which he had conceived
                    so ardent a passion. He had no intention, however, of becoming a recluse, or of
                    permanently holding himself aloof from public life. Accordingly, he became a
                    candidate for the borough of Poole, and was returned May 21, 1695. He soon
                    distinguished himself by a speech, which excited great attention at the time, in
                    support of the Bill for Regulating Trials in Cases of Treason, one provision of
                    which was what seems to us the obviously reasonable one that a person indicted
                    for treason or misprision of treason should be allowed the assistance of
                    counsel. In connexion with this speech a story is told of Shaftesbury which is
                    also told, though with less verisimilitude, of Halifax, that, being overcome by
                    shyness, and unable to continue his speech, he simply said, before sitting down:
                    “If I, sir, who rise only to speak my opinion on the bill now depending, am so
                    confounded that I am unable to express the least of what I proposed to say, what
                    must the condition of that man be who is pleading for his life without any
                    assistance and under apprehensions of being deprived of it?” “The sudden turn of
                    thought,” says his son, the fourth earl, “pleased the House extremely, and, it
                    is generally believed, carried a greater weight than any of the arguments which
                    were offered in favour of the bill.” But, though a Whig, alike by descent, by
                    education, and by conviction, Ashley could by no means be depended on to give a
                    party vote; he was always ready to support any propositions, from whatever
                    quarter they came, that appeared to him to promote the liberty of the subject
                    and the independence of parliament. Unfortunately, his health was so treacherous
                    that, on the dissolution of July 1698, he was obliged to retire from
                    parliamentary life. He suffered much from asthma, a complaint which was
                    aggravated by the London smoke.</p>
                <p>Lord Ashley now retired into Holland, where he became acquainted with Le Clerc,
                    Bayle, Benjamin Furly, the English Quaker merchant, at whose house Locke had
                    resided during his stay at Rotterdam, and probably Limborch and the rest of the
                    literary circle of which Locke had been a cherished and honoured member nine or
                    ten years before. To Lord Ashley this society was probably far more congenial
                    than his surroundings in England. Unrestrained conversation on the topics which
                    most interested him—philosophy, politics, morals, religion —was at this time to
                    be had in Holland with less danger and in greater abundance than in any other
                    country in the world. To the period of this sojourn in Holland must probably be
                    referred the surreptitious impression or publication of an imperfect edition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Inquiry concerning Virtue,</hi> from a rough draught,
                    sketched when he was only twenty years of age. This liberty was taken, during
                    his absence, by Toland.</p>
                <p>After an absence of over a twelvemonth, Ashley returned to England, and soon
                    succeeded his father as earl of Shaftesbury. He took an active part, on the Whig
                    side, in the general election of 1700-1, and again, with more success, in that
                    of the autumn of 1701. It is said that William III. showed his appreciation of
                    Shaftesbury’s services on this latter occasion by offering him a secretaryship
                    of state, which, however, his declining health compelled him to decline. Had the
                    king’s life continued, Shaftesbury’s influence at court would probably have been
                    considerable. After the first few weeks of Anne’s reign, Shaftesbury, who had
                    been deprived of the viceadmiralty of Dorset, returned to his retired mode of
                    life, but his letters to Furly show that he still retained a keen interest in
                    politics. In August 1703 he again settled in Holland, in the air of which he
                    seems, like Locke, to have had great faith. At Rotterdam he lived, he says in a
                    letter to his steward Wheelock, at the rate of less than £200 a<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n757/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0757-0732"/> year, and yet had much “to dispose of and spend
                    beyond convenient living.” He returned to England, much improved in health, in
                    August 1704. But, though he had received immediate benefit from his stay abroad,
                    symptoms of consumption were constantly alarming him, and he gradually became a
                    confirmed invalid. His occupations were now almost exclusively literary, and
                    from this time forward he was probably engaged in writing, completing, or
                    revising the treatises which were afterwards included in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characteristics.</hi> He still continued, however, to take a warm interest in
                    politics, both home and foreign, and especially in the war against France, of
                    which he was an enthusiastic supporter.</p>
                <p>Shaftesbury was nearly forty before he married, and even then he appears to have
                    taken this step at the urgent instigation of his friends, mainly to supply a
                    successor to the title. The object of his choice (or rather of his second
                    choice, for an earlier project of marriage had shortly before fallen through)
                    was a Miss Jane Ewer, the daughter of a gentleman in Hertfordshire. The marriage
                    took place in the autumn of 1709, and on February 9, 1710, was born at his house
                    at Reigate, in Surrey, his only child and heir, the fourth earl, to whose
                    manuscript accounts we are in great part indebted for the details of his
                    father’s life. The match appears to have been a happy one, though Shaftesbury
                    neither had nor pretended to have much sentiment on the subject of married
                    life.</p>
                <p>With the exception of a <hi rend="italic">Preface to the Sermons of Dr
                    Whichcote,</hi> one of the Cambridge Platonists or latitudinarians, published in
                    1G98, Shaftesbury appears to have printed nothing himself till the year 1708.
                    About this time the French prophets, as they were called, attracted much
                    attention by the extravagances and follies of which they were guilty. Various
                    remedies of the repressive kind were proposed, but Shaftesbury maintained that
                    their fanaticism was best encountered by “raillery” and “good-humour.” In
                    support of this view he wrote a letter to Lord Somers, dated September 1707
                    which was published anonymously in the following year, and provoked several
                    replies. In May 1709 he returned to the subject, and printed another letter,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Sensus Communis, an Essay on the Freedom of Wit and
                    Humour.</hi> In the same year he also published <hi rend="italic">The Moralists,
                    a Philosophical Rhapsody,</hi> and in the following year <hi rend="italic"
                    >Soliloquy, or Advice to an Author.</hi> None of these pieces seem to have been
                    printed either with his name or his initials. In 1711 appeared the <hi
                    rend="italic">Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times,</hi> in three
                    volumes, also without any name or initials on the title-page, and without even
                    the name of a printer. These three handsome volumes contain in addition to the
                    four treatises already mentioned, <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous
                    Reflections,</hi> now first printed, and the <hi rend="italic">Inquiry
                    concerning Virtue or Merit,</hi> described as “formerly printed from an
                    imperfect copy, now corrected and published intire,” and as “printed first in
                    the year 1699.”</p>
                <p>The declining state of Shaftesbury’s health rendered it necessary for him to seek
                    a warmer climate, and in July 1711 he set out for Italy. He settled at Naples in
                    November, and lived there considerably over a year. His principal occupation at
                    this time must have consisted in preparing for the press a second edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Characteristics,</hi> which appeared in 1713, soon after his
                    death. The copy, most carefully corrected in his own handwriting, is still
                    preserved in the British Museum. He was also engaged, during his stay at Naples,
                    in writing the little treatise (afterwards included in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characteristics)</hi> entitled <hi rend="italic">A Notion of the Historical'
                    Draught or Tablature of the Judgment of Hercules,</hi> and the letter concerning
                    <hi rend="italic">Design.</hi> A little before his death he had also formed a
                    scheme of writing a Discourse on the Arts of Painting,</p>
                <p>Sculpture, Etching, &amp;c., but when he died he had made but little progress
                    with it, “Medals, and pictures, and antiquities,” he writes to Furly, “are our
                    chief entertainments here.” His conversation was with men of art and science,
                    “the virtuosi of this place.”</p>
                <p>The events preceding the peace of Utrecht, which he regarded as preparing the way
                    for a base desertion of our allies, greatly troubled the last months of
                    Shaftesbury’s life. He did not, however, live to see the actual conclusion of
                    the treaty (March 31, 1713), as he died the month before, February 4, 1712, O.S.
                    At the time of his death he had not yet completed his forty-second year. His
                    body was brought back by sea to England and buried at St Giles’s, the family
                    seat in Dorsetshire. Though he died so long ago, and was one of the earliest of
                    the English moralists, his descendant, the celebrated philanthropist, who died
                    so recently as 1885, was only his great-grandson.</p>
                <p>Shaftesbury’s amiability of character seems to have been one of his principal
                    characteristics. All accounts concur in representing him as full of sweetness
                    and kindliness towards others, though he may sometimes himself have been the
                    victim of melancholy and despondency. Like Locke he had a peculiar pleasure in
                    bringing forward young men. Amongst these may be especially mentioned Michael
                    Ainsworth, a native of Wimborne St Giles, the young man who was the recipient of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> addressed to a student at the university, and
                    who was maintained by him at University College, Oxford. The keen interest which
                    Shaftesbury took in his studies, and the desire that he should be specially
                    fitted for the profession which he had selected, that of a clergyman of the
                    Church of England, are marked features of the letters. Other protegés were
                    Crell, a young Pole, the two young Furlys, and Harry Wilkinson, a boy who was
                    sent into Furly’s office at Rotterdam, and to whom several of the letters still
                    extant in the Record Office are addressed.</p>
                <p>In the popular mind, Shaftesbury is generally regarded as a writer hostile to
                    religion. But, however short his orthodoxy might fall if tried by the standards
                    of any particular church, his temperament was pre-eminently a religious one.
                    This fact is shown conspicuously in his letters, where he had no reason for
                    making any secret of his opinions. The belief in a God, all-wise, all-just, and
                    all-merciful, governing the world providentially for the best, pervades all his
                    works, his correspondence, and his life. Nor had he any wish to undermine
                    established beliefs, except where he conceived that they conflicted with a truer
                    religion and a purer morality.</p>
                <p>To the public ordinances of the church he scrupulously conformed. But,
                    unfortunately, there were many things both in the teaching and the practice of
                    the ecclesiastics of that day which were calculated to repel men of sober
                    judgment and high principle. These evil tendencies in the popular presentation
                    of Christianity undoubtedly begot in Shaftesbury’s mind a certain amount of
                    repugnance and contempt to some of the doctrines of Christianity itself; and,
                    cultivating, almost of set purpose, his sense of the ridiculous, he was too apt
                    to assume towards such doctrines and their teachers a tone of raillery and
                    banter, which sometimes even approaches grimace.</p>
                <p>But, whatever might be Shaftesbury’s speculative opinions or his mode of
                    expressing them, all witnesses concur in bearing testimony to the elevation and
                    purity of his life and aims. Molesworth, who had no special reason for
                    flattering him, speaks of him as “possessing right reason in a more eminent
                    degree than the rest of mankind,” and of his character as “the highest that the
                    perfection of human nature is capable of.” Even Warburton, in his dedication of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Divine Legation</hi> to the freethinkers, is compelled to
                    “own that this lord had many<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n758/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0758-0733"/> excellent qualities, both as a man and a writer.
                    He was temperate, chaste, honest, and a lover of his country.”</p>
                <p>As an earnest student, an ardent lover of liberty, an enthusiast in the cause of
                    virtue, and a man of unblemished life and untiring beneficence, Shaftesbury
                    probably had no superior in his generation. His character and pursuits are the
                    more remarkable, considering the rank of life in which he was born and the
                    circumstances under which he was brought up. In many respects he reminds us of
                    the imperial philosopher Marcus Aurelius, whose works we know him to have
                    studied with avidity, and whose influence is unmistakably stamped upon his own
                    productions.</p>
                <p>Most of Shaftesbury’s writings have been already mentioned. In addition to these
                    there have been published fourteen letters from Shaftesbury to Molesworth,
                    edited by Toland in 1721; some letters to Benjamin Furly, his sons, and his
                    clerk Harry Wilkinson, included in a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Original
                    Letters of Locke, Sidney, and Shaftesbury,</hi> which was published by Mr T.
                    Forster in 1830, and again in an enlarged form in 1847; three letters, written
                    respectively to Stringer, Lord Oxford, and Lord Godolphin, which appeared, for
                    the first time, in the <hi rend="italic">General Dictionary</hi>; and lastly a
                    letter to Le Clerc, in his recollections of Locke, first published in <hi
                    rend="italic">Notes and Queries,</hi> Feb. 8, 1851. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letters to a Young Man at the University</hi> [Michael Ainsworth], already
                    mentioned, were first published in 1716, it being uncertain by whom. The Letter
                    on Design was first published in the edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characteristics</hi> issued in 1732. Besides the published writings, there are
                    still to be found several memoranda, letters, rough drafts, &amp;c., in the
                    Shaftesbury papers in the Record Office.</p>
                <p>Shaftesbury, it is plain, took great pains in the elaboration of his style, and
                    he succeeded so far as to make his meaning transparent. The thought is always
                    clear. But, on the other hand, he did not equally succeed in attaining elegance,
                    an object at which he seems equally to have aimed. There is a curious
                    affectation about his style,—a falsetto note,—which, notwithstanding all his
                    efforts to please, is often irritating to the reader. Its main characteristic is
                    perhaps best hit off by Charles Lamb when he calls it “genteel.” He poses too
                    much as a fine gentleman, and is so anxious not to be taken for a pedant of the
                    vulgar scholastic kind that he falls into the hardly more attractive pedantry of
                    the aesthete and <hi rend="italic">virtuoso.</hi> But, notwithstanding these
                    defects, he possesses the great merits of being easily read and easily
                    understood. Hence, probably, the wide popularity which his works enjoyed in the
                    last century; and hence, undoubtedly, the agreeable feeling with which,
                    notwithstanding all their false taste and their tiresome digressions, they still
                    impress the modern reader.</p>
                <p>It is mainly as a moralist that Shaftesbury has a claim to a place in the history
                    of literature and philosophy. Like most of the ethical writers of his time his
                    first impulse to speculation, or at least to publication, seems to have been
                    derived from a desire to combat the still fashionable paradoxes of Hobbes, and
                    to arrest the progress of doctrines at which society still continued to be
                    seriously alarmed. Hence it became his main concern to assert the reality and
                    independence of our benevolent affections, and to show that these and the acts
                    which result from them are what mainly elicit the feeling of moral approbation.
                    This work he appears to have conceived it his special mission to undertake, not
                    as a “pedant” or a “Schoolman,” but as a “man of taste.” It was probably in
                    accordance with this conception that he refrained from using the language about
                    the “laws of nature” which had hitherto been current in ethical treatises, and
                    that he preferred to represent morality as a matter of “taste,” “sentiment,” or
                    “affection,” rather than as dictated simply by reason.</p>
                <p>The leading ideas in Shaftesbury’s ethical theory are those of a system, or the
                    relation of parts to a whole, benevolence, moral beauty, and a moral sense.</p>
                <p>The individual man himself is a system consisting of various appetites, passions,
                    and affections, all united under the supreme control of reason. Of this system
                    the parts are so nicely adjusted to each other that any disarrangement or
                    disproportion, however slight, may mar and disfigure the whole. “Whoever is in
                    the least versed in this moral kind of architecture will find the inward fabric
                    so adjusted, and the whole so nicely built, that the barely extending of a
                    single passion a little too far, or the continuance of it too long, is able to
                    bring irrecoverable ruin and misery.”</p>
                <p>But morality and human nature cannot be adequately studied in the system of the
                    individual man. There are parts in that system, both mental and bodily, which
                    have an evident respect to something outside it. Neither man nor any other
                    animal, though ever so complete a system of parts as to all within, can be
                    allowed in the same manner complete as to all without; he must be considered as
                    having a further relation abroad to the system of his kind. So even this system
                    of his kind to the animal system; this to the world (our earth); and this again
                    to the bigger world and to the universe. No being can properly be called good or
                    ill except in reference to the systems of which he is a part, “When, in general,
                    all the affections or passions are suited to the public good or end of the
                    species, then is the natural temper entirely good. If, on the contrary, any
                    requisite passion be wanting, or if there be any one supernumerary or weak, or
                    anywise disserviceable or contrary to that main end, then is the natural temper,
                    and consequently the creature himself, in some measure corrupt and ill.” Hence
                    it follows that benevolence, if not the sole, is at least the principal moral
                    virtue.</p>
                <p>The idea of a moral and social system, the parts of which are in a constant
                    proportion to each other, and so nicely adjusted that the slightest
                    disarrangement would mar the unity of design, almost necessarily suggests an
                    analogy between morality and art. As the beauty of an external object consists
                    in a certain proportion between its parts, or in a certain harmony of colouring,
                    so the beauty of a virtuous character consists in a certain proportion between
                    the various affections, or in a certain harmonious blending of the various
                    springs of action as they contribute to promote the great ends of our being. And
                    similarly, we may suppose, the beauty of a virtuous action would be explained as
                    consisting in its relation to the virtuous character in which it has its source,
                    or to the other acts of a virtuous life, or to the general condition of a
                    virtuous state of society. This analogy between art and morality, or, as it may
                    otherwise be expressed, between the beauty of external objects and the beauty of
                    actions or characters, is never long absent from Shaftesbury’s mind. Closely
                    connected with it is the idea that morals, no less than art, is a matter of
                    taste or relish.</p>
                <p>This idea leads us to the last of the distinctive features in Shaftesbury’s
                    ethical philosophy. The faculty which approves of right and disapproves of wrong
                    actions is with him a sense, and more than once he anticipates Hutcheson by
                    calling it a “moral sense,” an expression, indeed, which he may be said to have
                    contributed to the English language. This “sense of right and wrong” is “as
                    natural to us as natural affection itself,” and “a first principle in our
                    constitution and make.” At the same time it includes a certain amount of
                    judgment or reflexion, that is to say, a rational element. Shaftesbury’s
                    doctrine on this head may, perhaps, briefly be summed up as follows. Each man
                    has from the first a natural sense of right and wrong, a “moral sense” or
                    “conscience” (all which expressions he employs as synonymous). This sense is, in
                    its natural condition, wholly or mainly emotional, but, as it admits of constant
                    education and improvement, the rational or reflective element in it gradually
                    becomes more prominent. Its decisions are generally described as if they were
                    immediate, and, beyond the occasional recognition of a rational as well as an
                    emotional element, little or no attempt is made to analyse it. It was reserved
                    for Hume properly to discriminate between these two elements, and to point out
                    that, while the feeling of moral approbation or disapprobation is instantaneous,
                    the moral judgment which precedes it is often the result of an intellectual
                    process of considerable length and perplexity.</p>
                <p>It may be sufficient to supplement this brief survey of Shaftesbury’s system by a
                    still briefer summary of the answers, so far as they can be collected from his
                    works, which he would have given to the principal questions of ethics as they
                    are now usually propounded. His answers to these questions are, as it appears to
                    the present writer, that our moral ideas—the distinctions of virtue and vice,
                    right and wrong—are to be found in the very make and constitution of our nature;
                    that morality is independent of theology, actions being denominated good or
                    just, not by the arbitrary will of God (as had recently been maintained by
                    Locke), but in virtue of some quality existing in themselves; that the ultimate
                    test of a right action is its tendency to promote the general welfare; that we
                    have a peculiar organ, the moral sense, analogous to taste in art, by which we
                    discriminate between characters and actions as good or bad; that the higher
                    natures among mankind are impelled to right action, and deterred from wrong
                    action, partly by the moral sense, partly by the love and reverence of a just
                    and good God, while the lower natures are mainly influenced by the opinions of
                    others, or by the hope of reward and the fear of punishment; that appetite and
                    reason both concur in the determination of action; lastly, that the question
                    whether the will does or does not possess any freedom of choice, irrespectively
                    of character and motives, is one (at least so we may gather from Shaftesbury’s
                    reticence) which it does not concern the moralist to solve.</p>
                <p>The close resemblance of Hutcheson’s speculations to those of Shaftesbury,
                    amounting sometimes to identity, will be apparent on reference to the account of
                    that philosopher (vol. xii. pp. 409-11). Next to Hobbes, the moralist with whose
                    views Shaftesbury’s stand in most direct antagonism is Locke, who not only
                    maintained that moral distinctions depend solely on the arbitrary will of God,
                    but that the sanctions by which they are mainly enforced are the hope of future
                    reward and the fear of future punishment. “By the fault is the rod, and with the
                    transgression a fire ready to<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n759/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0759-0734"/> punish it.” Shaftesbury’s was in reality, though
                    perhaps not in appearance, a more truly religious philosophy. For with him the
                    incentives to well-doing anti the deterrents from evil-doing are to be sought
                    not solely, or even mainly, in the opinion of mankind, or in the rewards and
                    punishments of the magistrate, or in the hopes and terrors of a future world,
                    but in the answer of a good conscience approving virtue and disapproving vice,
                    and in the love of a God, who, by His infinite wisdom and His allembracing
                    beneficence, is worthy of the love and admiration of His creatures.</p>
                <p>The main object of the <hi rend="italic">Moralists</hi> is to propound a system
                    of natural theology, and to vindicate, so far as natural religion is concerned,
                    the ways of God to man. The articles of Shaftesbury’s religious creed were few
                    and simple, but these he entertained with a conviction amounting to enthusiasm.
                    They may briefly be summed up as a belief in one God whose most characteristic
                    attribute is universal benevolence in the moral government of the universe, and
                    in a future state of man making up for the imperfections and repairing the
                    inequalities of the present life. Shaftesbury is emphatically an optimist, but
                    there is a passage in the <hi rend="italic">Moralists</hi> (pt. ii. sect. 4)
                    which would lead us to suppose that he regarded matter as an indifferent
                    principle, co-existent and co-eternal with God, limiting His operations, and the
                    cause of the evil and imperfection which, notwithstanding the benevolence of the
                    Creator, is still to be found in His work. If this view of his optimism be
                    correct, Shaftesbury, as Mill says of Leibnitz, must be regarded as maintaining,
                    not that this is the best of all imaginable but only of all possible worlds.
                    This brief notice of Shaftesbury’s scheme of natural religion would be
                    conspicuously imperfect unless it were added that it is popularized in Pope’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man,</hi> several linee of which, especially of the
                    first epistle, are simply statements from the <hi rend="italic">Moralists</hi>
                    done into verse. Whether, however, these were taken immediately by Pope from
                    Shaftesbury, or whether they came to him through the papers which Bolingbroke
                    had prepared for his use, we have no means of determining.</p>
                <p>Shaftesbury’s philosophical activity was confined to ethics, aesthetics, and
                    religion. For metaphysics, properly so called, and even psychology, except so
                    far as it afforded a basis for ethics, he evidently had no taste. Logic he
                    probably despised as merely an instrument of pedants,—a judgment for which, in
                    his day, and especially at the universities, there was only too much ground.</p>
                <p>The influence of Shaftesbury’s writings was very considerable both at home and
                    abroad. His ethical system was reproduced, though in a more precise and
                    philosophical form, by Hutcheson, and from him descended, with certain
                    variations, to Hume and Adam Smith. Nor was it without its effect even on the
                    speculations of Butler. Of the so-called deists Shaftesbury was probably the
                    most important, as he was certainly the most plausible and the most respectable.
                    No sooner had the <hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi> appeared than they were
                    welcomed, in terms of warm commendation, by Le Clerc and Leibnitz. In 1745
                    Diderot adapted or reproduced the <hi rend="italic">Inquiry concerning
                    Virtue</hi> in what was afterwards known as his <hi rend="italic">Essai sur le
                    Mérite et la Vertu.</hi> In 1769 a French translation of the whole of
                    Shaftesbury’s works, including the <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> was published
                    at Geneva. Translations of separate treatises into German began to be made in
                    1738, and in 1776-1779 there appeared a complete German translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Characteristics.</hi> Hermann Hettner says that not only Leibnitz,
                    Voltaire, and Diderot, but Lessing, Mendelssohn, Wieland, and Herder, drew the
                    most stimulating nutriment from Shaftesbury. “His charms,” he adds, “are ever
                    fresh. A new-born Hellenism, or divine cultus of beauty presented itself before
                    his inspired soul.” Herder is especially eulogistic. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adrastea</hi> he pronounces the <hi rend="italic">Moralists</hi> to be a
                    composition in form well-nigh worthy of Grecian antiquity, and in its contents
                    almost superior to it. The interest felt by German literary men in Shaftesbury
                    has been recently revived by the publication of two excellent monographs, one
                    dealing with him mainly from the theological side by Dr Gideon Spicker (Freiburg
                    in Baden, 1872), the other dealing with him mainly from the philosophical side
                    by Dr Georg von Gizycki (Leipsic, 1876).</p>
                <p>In the foregoing article the writer has made free use of his monograph on
                    Shaftesbury and Hutcheson in the series of “English philosophers” (1882),
                    published by Sampson Low &amp; Co. In that work he was able largely to
                    supplement the printed materials for the Life by extracts from the Shaftesbury
                    papers now deposited in the Record Office. These include, besides many letters
                    and memoranda, two lives of him, composed by his son, the fourth earl, one of
                    which is evidently the original, though it is by no means nlways closely
                    followed, of the Life contributed by Dr Birch to the <hi rend="italic">General
                    Dictionary.</hi> For a description and criticism of Shaftesbury's philosophy
                    reference may also be made to Mackintosh’s <hi rend="italic">Progress of Ethical
