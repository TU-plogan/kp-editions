                    the twenty-first emperor of Rome, reigned from 193 to 211 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> He was born in 146 at Leptis Magna, an African coast town in the
                    district of Syrtes, whose ancient prosperity is still attested by its extensive
                    ruins. In this region of Africa, despite its long possession by the Romans, the
                    Punic tongue was still spoken by the people in general. Severus had to acquire
                    Latin as a foreign language, and is said to have spoken it to the end of his
                    days with a strong African accent. After he had arrived at the throne he
                    dismissed abruptly from Rome a sister who had come to visit him, because he felt
                    shame at her abominable Latin. Yet Severus and his dynasty were almost the only
                    emperors of provincial descent who frankly cherished the province of their
                    origin, while the province showed true loyalty to the only Roman emperor ever
                    born on African soil, and to the successors who derived their title from
                    him.</p>
                <p>Of the origin of the Severi nothing is known: it is a natural but very doubtful
                    conjecture that the L. Septimius Severus, a native of Africa, addressed by the
                    poet Statius, was an ancestor of the emperor who bore the same name. The father
                    of Severus was a Roman citizen of equestrian rank, and it may safely be affirmed
                    that the family held a poor position when he was born, but had risen in
                    importance by the time he reached manhood. Two of his uncles attained to
                    consular rank. Fulvius Pius, the maternal grandfather of Severus, is often
                    identified with the man of that name who was governor of Africa, and, after
                    being condemned for corruption by Pertinax, was highly honoured by Didius
                    Julianus; but dates are strongly against the identification. Of the future
                    emperor’s education we learn nothing but its results. Spartianus declares him to
                    have been “very learned in Latin and Greek literature,” to have had a genuine
                    zeal for study, and to have been fond of philosophy and rhetoric. But the
                    learning of rulers is often seen through a magnifying medium, and we may better
                    accept the statement of Dio Cassius that in the pursuit of education his
                    eagerness was greater than his success, and that he was rather shrewd than
                    facile. No doubt in his early years he acquired that love for jurisprudence
                    which distinguished him as emperor. Of his youth we know only that it was
                    entirely spent at Leptis. Beyond that there is merely one anecdotal fabrication
                    giving an account of youthful wildness.</p>
                <p>The removal of Severus from Leptis to Rome is attributed by his biographer to the
                    desire for higher education, but was also no doubt due in some degree to
                    ambition. From the emperor Marcus Aurelius he early obtained, by intercession of
                    a consular uncle, the distinction of the broad purple stripe. At twenty-six,
                    that is, almost at the earliest age allowed by law, Severus attained the
                    quaestorship and a seat in the senate, and proceeded as <hi rend="italic"
                    >quaesiοr militaris</hi> to the senatorial province of Baetica, in the
                    Peninsula. "While Severus was temporarily absent in Africa in consequence of the
                    death of his father, the province of Baetica, disordered by invasion and
                    internal commotion, was taken over by the emperor, who gave the senate Sardinia
                    in exchange. On this Severus became<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0724-0699"/> military quaestor of Sardinia. His next office,
                    probably in 174, was that of legate to the proconsul of Africa, and in the
                    following year he was tribune of the plebs. This magistracy, though far
                    different from what it had been in the days of the republic, was still one of
                    dignity, and brought with it promotion to a higher grade in the senate. During
                    the tribunate he married his first wife Marcia, whose name he passed over in his
                    autobiography, though he erected statues of her after he became emperor. In 178
                    Severus became praetor, not by favour of the emperor, but by competition for the
                    suffrages of the senators. Then, probably in the same year, he went to Spain as
                    legate; after that (179) he commanded a legion in Syria. The death of Marcus
                    Aurelius seems in some way to have interrupted his career; he was unemployed for
                    several years, and devoted great part of his leisure to the study of literature,
                    religion, and antiquities (so says Spartianus) at Athens. The year of Severus’s
                    first consulship cannot be determined with precision, but it falls within the
                    space between 185 and 190. In this time also falls the marriage with Julia,
                    afterwards famous as Julia Domna, whose acquaintance he had no doubt made when
                    an officer in Syria. Her two sons Bassianus (known as Caracalla) and Geta were
                    probably born in 188 and 189. Severus was governor in succession of Gallia
                    Lugdunensis, Sicily, and Pannonia Superior. He was in command of three legions
                    at Carnuntum, the capital of the province last named, when news reached him that
                    Commodus had been murdered by his favourite concubine and his most trusted
                    servants.</p>
                <p>Up to this moment the career of Severus had been ordinary in its character. He
                    had not raised himself above the usual official level. He had achieved no
                    military distinction,—had indeed seen no warfare beyond the petty border frays
                    of a frontier province. But the storm that now tried all official spirits found
                    his alone powerful enough to brave it. Three imperial dynasties had now been
                    ended by assassination. The Flavian line had enjoyed much shorter duration and
                    much less prestige than the other two, and the circumstances of its fall had
                    been peculiar in that it was probably planned in the interest of the senate and
                    the senate certainly reaped the immediate fruits. But the crisis which arose on
                    the death of Nero and the crisis which arose on the death of Commodus were
                    strikingly alike. In both cases it was left to the army to determine by a
                    struggle which of the divisional commanders should succeed to the
                    command-in-chief, that is, to the imperial throne. In each case the contest
                    began with an impulsion given to the commanders by the legionaries themselves.
                    The soldiers of the great commands competed keenly for the honour and the
                    material advantages to be won by placing their general in the seat of empire.
                    The officer who refused to lead would have been deemed a traitor to his troops,
                    and would have suffered the punishment of his treason.</p>
                <p>There is a widespread impression that the Praetorian guards at all times held the
                    Roman empire in their hands, but its erroneousness is demonstrated by the events
                    of the year 193. For the first time in the course of imperial history the
                    Praetorians presumed to nominate as emperor a man who had no legions at his
                    back. This was Pertinax, who has been well styled the Galba of his time—upright
                    and honourable to severity, and zealous for good government, but blindly
                    optimist about the possibilities of reform in a feeble and corrupt age. After a
                    three months’ rule he was destroyed by the power that lifted him up. According
                    to the well-known story, true rather in its outline than in its details, the
                    Praetorians sold the throne to Didius Julianus. But at the end of two months
                    both the Praetorians and their nominee were swept away by the real disposers of
                    Roman rule, the provincial legions. Four groups of legions at the time were
                    strong enough to aspire to determine the destiny of the empire,—those quartered
                    in Britain, in Germany, in Pannonia, in Syria. Three of the groups actually took
                    the decisive step, and Severus in Pannonia, Pescennius Niger in Syria, Clodius
                    Albinus in Britain, received from their troops the title of Augustus. Severus
                    far outdid his rivals in promptness and decision. By what means we do not know,
                    he secured the aid of the legions in Germany and of those in Illyria. These,
                    with the forces in Pannonia, made a combination sufficiently formidable to
                    overawe Albinus for the moment. He probably deemed that his best chance lay in
                    the exhaustion of his competitors by an internecine struggle. At all events he
                    received with submission an offer made by Severus, no doubt well understood by
                    both to be politic, insincere, and temporary. Severus sent a trusted officer,
                    who confirmed Albinus in his power and bestowed upon him the title of Caesar,
                    making him the nominal heir-apparent to the throne.</p>
                <p>Before the action of Severus was known in Rome, the senate and people had shown
                    signs of turning to Pescennius Niger, that he might deliver them from the poor
                    puppet Didius Julianus and avenge on the Praetorians the murder of Pertinax.
                    Having secured the co-operation or neutrality of all the forces in the western
                    part of the empire, Severus hastened to Rome. To win the sympathy of the capital
                    he posed as the avenger and successor of Pertinax, whose name he even added to
                    his own, and used to the end of his reign. The feeble defences of Julianus were
                    broken down and the Praetorians disarmed and disbanded, without a blow being
                    struck. A new body of household troops was enrolled and organized on quite
                    different principles from the old. In face of the senate, as Dio tells us,
                    Severus acted for the moment like “one of the good emperors in the olden days.”
                    After a magnificent entry into the city he joined the senate in execrating the
                    memory of Commodus, and in punishing the murderers of Pertinax, whom he honoured
                    with the most splendid funeral rites. He also encouraged the senate to pass a
                    decree directing that any emperor or subordinate of an emperor who should put a
                    senator to death should be treated as a public enemy. But he ominously refrained
                    from asking the senate to sanction his accession to the throne.</p>
                <p>The rest of Severus’s reign, as it is read in the ancient histories, is in the
                    main occupied with wars, over which we shall rapidly pass. The power wielded by
                    Pescennius Niger, who called himself emperor, and was supposed to control one
                    half of the Roman world, proved to be more imposing than substantial. The
                    magnificent promises of Oriental princes were falsified as usual in the hour of
                    need. Niger himself, as described by Dio, was the very type of mediocrity,
                    conspicuous for no faculties, good or bad. This very character had no doubt
                    commended him to Commodus as suited for the important command in Syria, which
                    might have proved a source of danger in abler hands. The contest between Severus
                    and Niger was practically decided after two or three engagements, fought by
                    Severus’s officers. The last battle, which took place at Issus, ended in the
                    defeat and death of Niger (194). After this the emperor spent two years in
                    successful attacks upon the peoples bordering on Syria, particularly in Adiabene
                    and Osrhoene. Byzantium, the first of Niger’s possessions to be attacked, was
                    the last to fall, after a glorious defence.</p>
                <p>Late in 196 Severus turned westward, to reckon with Albinus, who was well aware
                    that the reckoning was inevitable. He was better born and better educated than
                    Severus, but in capacity far inferior. As Severus was nearing Italy he received
                    the news that Albinus had been declared emperor by his soldiers. The first
                    counter-stroke<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n725/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0725-0700"/> of Severus was to affiliate himself and his elder
                    son to the Antonines by a sort of spurious and posthumous adoption. The prestige
                    of the old name, even when gained in this illegitimate way, was probably worth a
                    good deal. Bassianus, the elder son of Severus, thereafter known as Aurelius
                    Antoninus, was named Caesar in place of Albinus, and was thus marked out as
                    successor to his father. "Without interrupting the march of his forces, Severus
                    contrived to make an excursion to Rome. Here he availed himself with much
                    subtlety of the sympathy many senators were known to have felt for Niger. Though
                    lie was so far faithful to the decree passed by his own advice that he put no
                    senator to death, yet he banished and impoverished many whose presence or
                    influence seemed dangerous or inconvenient to his prospects. Of the sufferers
                    probably few had ever seen or communicated with Niger.</p>
                <p>The collision between the forces of Severus and Albinus was the most violent that
                    had taken place between Roman troops since the mighty contest at Philippi. The
                    decisive engagement was fought in February of the year 197 on the plain between
                    the Rhone and the Saône, to the north of Lyons. Dio tells us that 150,000 men
                    fought on each side. The fortunes of Severus were, to all appearance, at one
                    stage of the battle as hopeless as those of Julius Caesar were for some hours
                    during the battle of Munda. The tide was turned by the same means in both
                    cases—by the personal conduct and bravery of the commander.</p>
                <p>By this crowning victory Severus was released from all need for disguise, and
                    “poured forth on the civil population all the wrath which he had been storing up
                    for a long time” (Dio). He particularly frightened the senate by calling himself
                    the son of Marcus and brother of Commodus, whom he had before insulted. And he
                    read a speech in which he declared that the severity and cruelty of Sulla,
                    Marius, and Augustus had proved to be safer policy than the clemency of Pompey
                    and Julius Caesar, which had wrought their ruin. He ended with an apology for
                    Cornmodus and bitter reproaches against the senate for their sympathy with his
                    assassins. Over sixty senators were arrested, on a charge of having adhered to
                    Albinus, and half of them were put to death. In most instances the charge was
                    merely a pretence to enable the emperor to crush out the forward and dangerous
                    spirits in the senate. The murderers of Commodus were punished; Commodus himself
                    was deified; and on the monuments from this time onward Severus figures as the
                    brother of that reproduction of all the vice and cruelty of Nero with the
                    refinement left out.</p>
                <p>The next years (197-202) were devoted by Severus to one of the dominant ideas of
                    the empire from its earliest days—war against the Parthians. The results to
                    which Trajan and Verus had aspired were now fully attained, and Mesopotamia was
                    definitely established as a Roman province. Part of the time was spent in the
                    exploration of Egypt, in respect of which Dio takes opportunity to say that
                    Severus was not the man to leave anything human or divine uninvestigated. The
                    emperor returned to enjoy a well-earned triumph, commemorated to this day by the
                    arch in Rome which bears his name. During the six years which followed (202-208)
                    Severus resided at Rome and gave his attention to the organization of the
                    empire. No doubt his vigorous influence was felt to its remotest corners, but
                    our historians desert us at this point and leave us for the most part to the
                    important but dim and defective conclusions to be drawn from the abundant
                    monumental records of the reign. Only two or three events in the civil history
                    of this period are fully narrated by the ancient writers. The first of these is
                    the festival of the Decennalia, or rejoicings in the tenth year of the emperor’s
                    reign. Contemporaneous with this festival was the marriage of Aurelius
                    Antoninus</p>
                <p>(Caracalla) with Plautilla, the daughter of Plautianus, commander of the
                    reorganized Praetorian guards. This officer holds a conspicuous position in the
                    ancient accounts of the reign, yet it is all but impossible to believe a good
                    deal that we are told concerning him. Nevertheless, without a clear view of the
                    career of Plautianus, it is difficult to grasp definitely some important
                    features in the character of Severus, or to appreciate exactly the nature of his
                    government. According to Dio and Herodian, Plautianus was allowed for years to
                    exercise and abuse the whole power of the emperor, so far as it did not relate
                    to the actual conduct of war. He was cruel, arrogant, and corrupt; and the whole
                    empire groaned under his exactions. Geta, the brother of Severus, tried to open
                    the emperor’s eyes, but the licence of Plautianus was merely restricted for a
                    moment, to be bestowed again in full. Finally, in 203 this second Sejanus fell a
                    victim to an intrigue set on foot by his own son-in-law Antoninus (Caracalla),
                    the details of which were not clearly known even to contemporary writers. It is
                    hard to see in what way we are to reconcile this history with the known facts of
                    Severus’s character and career, unless we assume that Plautianus was really the
                    instrument of his master for the execution of his new policy towards the senate
                    and the senatorial provinces. That Plautianus abused his authority and brought
                    about his own fall is probable enough,—also that Severus had destined him at one
                    time for the guardianship of his sons. Plautianus was succeeded in his office by
                    two men, one of whom was the celebrated jurist Papinian.</p>
                <p>Severus spent the last three years of his life (208-211) in Britain, amidst
                    constant and not very successful warfare, which he is said to have provoked
                    partly to strengthen the discipline and powers of the legions, partly to wean
                    his sons from their evil courses by hard military service. He died at York in
                    February of the year 211. There are vague traditions that his death was in some
                    way hastened by Caracalla. This prince had been, since about 197, nominally
                    joint emperor with his father, so that no ceremony was needed for his
                    recognition as monarch.</p>
                <p>The natural gifts of Severus were of no high or unusual order. He had a clear
                    head, promptitude, resolution, tenacity, and great organizing power, hut no
                    touch of genius. That he was cruel cannot be questioned, but his cruelty was of
                    the calculating kind, and always clearly directed to some end. He threw the head
                    of Niger over the ramparts of Byzantium, but merely as the best means of
                    procuring a surrender of the stubbornly defended fortress. The head of Albinus
                    he exhibited at Rome, but only as a warning to the capital to tamper no more
                    with pretenders. The children of Niger were held as hostages and kindly treated
                    so long as they might possibly afford a useful basis for negotiation with their
                    father; when ho was defeated they were killed, lest from among them should arise
                    a claimant for the imperial power. Stern and barbarous punishment was always
                    meted out by Severus to the conquered foe, but terror was deemed the best
                    guarantee for peace. He felt no scruples of conscience or honour if he thought
                    his interest at stake, but he was not wont to take an excited or exaggerated
                    view of what his interest required. He used or destroyed men and institutions
                    alike with cool judgment and a single eye to the main purpose of his life, the
                    secure establishment of his dynasty. The few traces of aimless savagery which we
                    find in the ancient narratives are probably the result of fear working on the
                    imagination of the time.</p>
                <p>As a soldier Severus was personally brave, but he can hardly be called a general,
                    in spite of his successful campaigns. He was rather the organizer of victory
                    than the actual author of it. The operations against Niger were carried out
                    entirely by his officers. Dio even declares that the final battle with Albinus
                    was the first at which Severus had ever been actually present. When a war was
                    going on he was constantly travelling over the scene of it, planning it and
                    instilling into the army his own pertinacious spirit, but the actual fighting
                    was usually left to others. His treatment of the army is the most characteristic
                    feature of his reign. He frankly broke with the decent conventions of the
                    Augustan constitution, ignored the senate, and candidly based his rule upon
                    force. The only title he ever laid to the throne was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pronunciamiento</hi> of the legions, whose adherence to his cause he
                    commemorated<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n726/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0726-0701"/> even on the coinage of the realm. The legions
                    voted him the adopted son of Marcus Aurelius; the legions associated with him
                    Caracalla in the government of the empire. Severus strove earnestly to wed the
                    army as a whole to the support of his dynasty. He increased enormously the
                    material gains and the honorary distinctions of the service, so that he was
                    charged with corrupting the troops. Yet it cannot be denied that, all things
                    considered, he left the army of the empire more efficient than he found it. He
                    increased the strength of it by three legions, and turned the Praetorians,
                    heretofore a flabby body without military experience or instinct, into a chosen
                    corps of veterans. Their ranks were filled by promotion from all the legions on
                    service, whereas previously there had been special enlistment from Italy and one
                    or two of the neighbouring provinces. It was hoped that these picked men would
                    form a force on which an emperor could rely in an emergency. But to meet the
                    possibility of a legionary revolt in the provinces, one of the fundamental
                    principles of the Augustan empire was abrogated: Italy became a province, and
                    troops of the regular army were quartered in it under the direct command of the
                    emperor. Further to obviate the risk of revolution, the great commands in the
                    provinces were broken up, so that, excepting on the turbulent eastern frontier,
                    it was not possible for a commander to dispose of troops numerous enough to
                    render him dangerous to the government.</p>
                <p>But, while the policy of Severus was primarily a family policy, he was by no
                    means careless of the general security and welfare of the empire. Only in one
                    instance, the destruction of Byzantium, did he weaken its defences for his own
                    private ends—an error for which his successors paid dearly, when the Goths came
                    to dominate the Euxine. The constantly troublesome Danubian regions received the
                    special attention of the emperor, but all over the realm the status and
                    privileges of communities and districts were recast in the way that seemed
                    likely to conduce to their prosperity. The administration acquired more and more
                    of a military character, in Italy as well as in the provinces. Retired military
                    officers now filled many of the posts formerly reserved for civilians of
                    equestrian rank. The praefect of the Praetorians received large civil and
                    judicial powers, so that the investment of Papinian with the office was less
                    unnatural than it at first sight seems. The alliance between Severus and the
                    jurisconsults had important consequences. While he gave them new importance in
                    the body politic, and co-operated with them in the work of legal reform, they
                    did him material service by working an absolutist view of the government into
                    the texture of Roman law. Of the legal changes of the reign, important as they
                    were, we can only mention a few details. The emperor himself was a devoted and
                    upright judge, but he struck a great blow at the purity of the law by
                    transferring the exercise of imperial jurisdiction from the forum to the palace.
                    He sharpened in many respects the law of treason, put an end to the
                    time-honoured <hi rend="italic">quaestiones perpetuae,</hi> altered largely that
                    important section of the law which defined the rights of the fiscus, and
                    developed further the social policy which Augustus had embodied in the <hi
                    rend="italic">lex Julia de adulteriis</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">lex Papia
                    Poppaea.</hi></p>
                <p>Severus boldly adopted as an official designation the autocratic title of <hi
                    rend="italic">dominus,</hi> which the better of his predecessors had renounced,
                    and with which the worse had only toyed, as Domitian, whom Martial did not
                    hesitate to call “his lord and his god.” During Severus’s reign the senate was
                    absolutely powerless; he took all initiative into his hands. He broke down the
                    distinction between the servants of the senate and the servants of the emperor.
                    All nominations to office or function passed under his scrutiny. The estimation
                    of the old consular and other republican titles was diminished. The growth of
                    capacity in the senate was effectually checked by cutting off the tallest of the
                    poppy-heads early in the reign. The senate became a mere registration office for
                    the imperial determinations, and its members, as has been well said, a choir for
                    drawling conventional hymns of praise in honour of the monarch. Even the nominal
                    restoration of the senate’s power at the time of Alexander Severus, and the
                    accession of so-called “senatorial emperors” later on, did not efface the work
                    of Septimius Severus, which was resumed and carried to its fulfilment by
                    Diocletian.</p>
                <p>It only remains to say a few words of the emperor’s attitude towards literature,
                    art, and religion. No period in the history of Latin literature is so barren as
                    the reign of Severus. Many later periods—the age of Stilicho, for example—shine
                    brilliantly by comparison. The only great Latin writers are the Christians
                    Tertullian and Cyprian. The Greek literature of the period is richer, but not
                    owing to any patronage of the emperor, except perhaps in the case of Dio
                    Cassius, who, though no admirer of Severus, attributes to encouragement received
                    from him the execution of the great historical work which has come down to our
                    time. The numerous restorations of ancient buildings and the many new
                    constructions carried out by Severus show that he was not insensible to the
                    artistic glories of the past; and he is known to have paid much attention to
                    works of art in foreign countries where his duties took him. But he was in no
                    sense a patron or connoisseur of art. As to religion, if we may trust Dio, one
                    of the most superstitious of historians, Severus was one of the most
                    superstitious of monarchs. But apart from that it is difficult to say what was
                    his influence on the religious currents of the time. He probably did a good deal
                    to strengthen and extend the official cult of the imperial family, which had
                    been greatly developed during the prosperous times of the Antonines. But what he
                    thought of Christianity, Judaism, or the Oriental mysticism to which his wife
                    Julia Domna gave such an impulse in the succeeding reign, it is impossible to
                    say. We may best conclude that his religious sympathies were wide, since
                    tradition has not painted him as the partisan of any one form of worship.</p>
                <p>The energy and dominance of Severus’s character and his capacity for rule may be
                    deemed, without fancifulness, to be traceable in the numerous representations of
                    his features which have survived to our days.</p>
                <p>The authorities for this emperor’s reign are fairly full and satisfactory,
                    considering the general scantiness of the imperial records. Severus himself
                    wrote an autobiography which was regarded as candid and trustworthy on the
                    whole. The events of the reign were recorded by several contemporaries. The
                    first place among these must be given to Dio Cassius, who stands to the empire
                    in much the same relation as Livy to the republic. He became a senator in the
                    year when Marcus Aurelius died (180) and retained that dignity for more than
                    fifty years. He was well acquainted with Severus, and was near enough the centre
                    of affairs to know the real nature of events, without being great enough to have
                    personal motives for warping the record. Though this portion of Dio’s history no
                    longer exists in its original form, we have copious extracts from it, made by
                    Xiphilinus, an ecclesiastic of the 11th century. The faults which have impaired
                    the credit of Dio’s great work in its earlier portions,—his lack of the critical
                    faculty, his inexact knowledge of the earlier Roman institutions, his passion
                    for signs from heaven,—could do little injury to the narrative of an
                    eye-witness; and he must here make upon the attentive reader the impression of
                    unusual freedom from the commonest vices of history,—passion, prejudice, and
                    insincerity. His Greek, too, stands in agreeable contrast to the debased Latin
                    of the “scriptores historiae Augustae.” The Greek writer Herodian was also a
                    contemporary of Severus, but the mere fact that we know nothing of his life is
                    in itself enough to show that his opportunities were not so great as those of
                    Dio. The reputation of Herodian, who was used as the main authority for the
                    times of Severus by Tillemont and Gibbon, has not been proof against the
                    criticism of recent scholars. His faults are those of rhetoric and exaggeration.
                    His narrative is probably in many places not independent of Dio. The writers
                    known as the “scriptores historiae Augustae” are also of considerable
                    importance,—particularly in the lives of Didius Julianus, Severus, Pescennius
                    Niger, and Caracalla, attributed to Aelius Spartianus; those of Clodius Albinus
                    and Opilius Macrinus to Julius Capitolinus; those of Antoninus Diadumenus,
                    Antoninus Heliogabalus, and Alexander-Severus to Lampridius. The personal
                    history of Severus and his family is known to us mainly through these writers.
                    Their principal authority was most probably L. Marius Maximus, a younger
                    contemporary of Septimius Severus, who wrote, in continuation of the work of
                    Suetonius, the lives of eleven emperors from Trajan to Heliogabalus inclusive.
                    If we may believe a few words about him dropped by Ammianus Marcellinus, he was
                    a kind of prose Juvenal, whose uniformly dark pigments can hardly have sufficed
                    to paint a true picture even of his own times. The very numerous inscriptions
                    belonging to the age of Septimius Severus enable us to control at many points
                    and largely to supplement the literary records of his reign, particularly as
                    regards the details of his administration. The juridical works of Justinian’s
                    epoch embody much that throws light on the government of Severus.</p>
                <p>The principal modem works relating to this emperor, after Tillemont and Gibbon,
                    are—J. J. Schulte, <hi rend="italic">De Imperatore L. Septimio Severo,</hi>
