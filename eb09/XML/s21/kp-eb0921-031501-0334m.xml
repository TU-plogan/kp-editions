                    <hi rend="italic">(sarto):</hi> hence the nickname by which the son is

                    marriage. In 1494 Andrea was put to work under a goldsmith. This occupation he
                    disliked. He took to drawing from his master’s models, and was soon transferred
                    to a skilful woodcarver and inferior painter named Gian Barile, with whom he
                    remained until 1498. Barile, though a coarsegrained man enough, would not stand
                    in the way of the advancement of his promising pupil, so he recommended him to
                    Piero di Cosimo as draughtsman and colourist. Piero retained Andrea for some
                    years, allowing him to study from the famous cartoons of Leonardo da Vinci and
                    Michelangelo. Finally Andrea agreed with his friend Francia Bigio, who was
                    somewhat his senior, that they would open a joint shop; at a date not precisely
                    defined they took a lodging together in the Piazza del Grano. Their first work
                    in partnership may probably have been the Baptism of Christ, done for the
                    Florentine Compagnia dello Scalzo, a performance of no great merit, the
                    beginning of a series, all the extant items of which are in monochrome
                    chiaroscuro. Soon afterwards the partnership was dissolved. From 1509 to 1514
                    the brotherhood of the Servi employed Andrea, as well as Francia Bigio and
                    Andrea Feltrini, the first-named undertaking in the portico of the Annunziata
                    three frescos illustrating the life of the founder of the order, S. Filippo
                    Benizzi. He executed them in a few months, being endowed by nature with
                    remarkable readiness and certainty of hand, and unhesitating firmness in his
                    work, although in the general mould of his mind he was timid and diffident. The
                    subjects are the Saint Sharing his Cloak with a Leper, Cursing some Gamblers,
                    and Restoring a Girl possessed with a Devil. The second and third works excel
                    the first, and are impulsive and able performances. These paintings met with
                    merited applause, and gained for their author the pre-eminent title “Andrea
                    senza errori” (Andrew the unerring),—the correctness of the contours being
                    particularly admired. After these subjects the painter proceeded with two
                    others—the Death of St Philip, and the</p>
                <p>Children Cured by Touching his Garment,—all the five works being completed before
                    the close of 1510. The youth of twenty-three was already in technique about the
                    best fresco-painter of central Italy, barely rivalled by Raphael, who was the
                    elder by four years. Michelangelo’s Sixtine frescos were then only in a
                    preliminary stage. Andrea always worked in the simplest, most typical, and most
                    trying method of fresco—that of painting the thing once and for all, without any
                    subsequent dry-touching. He now received many commissions. The brotherhood of
                    the Servi engaged him to do two more frescos in the Annunziata at a higher
                    price; he also painted, towards 1512, an Annunciation in the monastery of S.
                    Gallo.</p>
                <p>The “Tailor’s Andrew” appears to have been an easygoing plebeian, to whom a
                    modest position in life and scanty gains were no grievances. As an artist he
                    must have known his own value; but he probably rested content in the sense of
                    his superlative powers as an executant, and did not aspire to the rank of a
                    great inventor or leader, for which, indeed, he had no vocation. He led a social
                    sort of life among his compeers of the art, was intimate with the sculptor
                    Rustici, and joined a jolly dining-club at his house named the Company of the
                    Kettle, also a second club named the Trowel. At one time, Francia Bigio being
                    then the chairman of the Kettle-men, Andrea recited, and is by some regarded as
                    having composed, a comic epic, “The Battle of the Mice and Frogs”—a rechauffé,
                    as one may surmise, of the Greek <hi rend="italic">Batrachomyomachia,</hi>
                    popularly ascribed to Homer. He fell in love with Lucrezia (del Fede), wife of a
                    hatter named Carlo Recanati; the hatter dying opportunely, the tailor’s son
                    married her on 26th December 1512. She was a very handsome woman, and has come
                    down to us treated with great suavity in many a picture of her lover-husband,
                    who constantly painted her as a Madonna and otherwise; and even in painting
                    other women he made them resemble Lucrezia in general type. She has been much
                    less gently handled by Vasari and other biographers. Vasari, who was at one time
                    a pupil of Andrea, describes her as faithless, jealous, overbearing, and
                    vixenish with the apprentices. She lived to a great age, surviving her second
                    husband 40 years.</p>
                <p>By 1514 Andrea had finished his last two frescos in the court of the Servi, than
                    which none of his works was more admired—the Nativity of the Virgin, which shows
                    the influence of Leonardo, Domenico Ghirlandajo, and Fra Bartolommeo, in
                    effective fusion, and the Procession of the Magi, intended as an amplification
                    of a work by Baldovinetti; in this fresco is a portrait of Andrea himself. He
                    also executed at some date a much-praised Head of Christ over the high altar. By
                    November 1515 he had finished at the Scalzo the allegory of Justice, and the
                    Baptist Preaching in the Desert,—followed in 1517 by John Baptizing, and other
                    subjects. Before the end of 1516 a Pietà of his composition, and afterwards a
                    Madonna, were sent to the French Court. These were received with applause; and
                    the art-loving monarch Francis I. suggested in 1518 that Andrea should come to
                    Paris. He journeyed thither towards June of that year, along with his pupil
                    Andrea Sguazzella, leaving his wife in Florence, and was very cordially
                    received, and for the first and only time in his life was handsomely
                    remunerated. Lucrezia, however, wrote urging his return to Italy. The king
                    assented, but only on the understanding that his absence from France was to be
                    short; and he entrusted Andrea with a sum of money to be expended in purchasing
                    works of art for his royal patron. The temptation of having a goodly amount of
                    pelf in hand proved too much for Andrea’s virtue. He spent the king’s money and
                    some of his own in building a house for himself in Flor<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n335/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0335-0316"/> ence. This necessarily brought him into bad odour
                    with Francis, who refused to be appeased by some endeavours which the painter
                    afterwards made to reingratiate himself. No serious punishment, however, and
                    apparently no grave loss of professional reputation befell the defaulter.</p>
                <p>In 1520 he resumed work in Florence, and executed the Faith and Charity in the
                    cloister of Lo Scalzo. These were succeeded by the Dance of the Daughter of
                    Herodias, the Beheading of the Baptist, the Presentation of his Head to Herod,
                    an allegory of Hope, the Apparition of the Angel to Zacharias (1523), and the
                    monochrome of the Visitation. This last was painted in the autumn of 1524, after
                    Andrea had returned from Luco in Mugello,—to which place an outbreak of plague
                    in Florence had driven him, his wife, his step-daughter, and other relatives. In
                    1525 he painted the very famous fresco named the Madonna del Sacco, a lunette in
                    the cloisters of the Servi; this picture (named after a sack against which
                    Joseph is represented propped) is generally accounted his masterpiece. His final
                    work at Lo Scalzo, 1526, was the Birth of the Baptist, executed with some
                    enhanced elevation of style after Andrea had been diligently studying
                    Michelangelo’s figures in the sacristy of S. Lorenzo. In the following year he
                    completed at S. Salvi, near Florence, a celebrated Last Supper, in which all the
                    personages seem to be portraits. This also is a very fine example of his style,
                    though the conception of the subject is not exalted. It is the last monumental
                    work of importance which Andrea del Sarto lived to execute. He dwelt in Florence
                    throughout the memorable siege, which was soon followed by an infectious
                    pestilence. He caught the malady, struggled against it with little or no tending
                    from his wife, who held aloof, and died, no one knowing much about it at the
                    moment, on 22d January 1531, at the comparatively early age of forty-three. He
                    was buried unceremoniously in the church of the Servi.</p>
                <p>Various portraits painted by Andrea are regarded as likenesses of himself, but
                    this is not free from some doubt. One is in the London National Gallery, an
                    admirable half-figure, purchased in 1862. Another is at Alnwick Castle, a young
                    man about twenty years of age, with his elbow on a table. Another at Panslianger
                    may perhaps represent in reality his pupil Domenico Conti. Another youthful
                    portrait is in the Uffizi Gallery, and the Pitti Gallery contains more than one.
                    Among his more renowned works not already specified are the following. The
                    Virgin and Child, with St Francis and St John the Evangelist and two Angels, now
                    in the Uffizi, painted for the church of S. Francesco in Florence; this is
                    termed the Madonna di S. Francesco, or Madonna delle Arpie, from certain figures
                    of harpies which are decoratively introduced, and is rated as Andrea’s
                    masterpiece in oil-painting. The altarpiece in the Uffizi, painted for the
                    monastery of S. Gallo, the Fathers Disputing on the Doctrine of the Trinity—Sts
                    Augustine, Dominic, Francis, Lawrence, Sebastian, and Mary Magdalene— a very
                    energetic work. Both these pictures are comparatively early—towards 1517. The
                    Charity now in the Louvre (perhaps the only painting which Andrea executed while
                    in France). The Pietà, in the Belvedere of Vienna; this work, as well as the
                    Charity, shows a strong Michelangelesque influence. At Poggio a Caiano a
                    celebrated fresco (1521) representing Julius Caesar receiving tribute, various
                    figures bringing animals from foreign lands—a striking perspective arrangement;
                    it was left unfinished by Andrea, and was completed by Alessandro Allori. Two
                    very remarkable paintings (1523) containing various incidents of the life of the
                    patriarch Joseph, executed for the Borgherini family. In the Pitti Gallery two
                    separate compositions of the Assumption of the Virgin, also a fine Pietà In the
                    Madrid Museum the Virgin and Child, with Joseph, Elizabeth, the infant Baptist,
                    and an Archangel. In the Louvre the Holy Family, the Baptist pointing upwards.
                    In the Berlin Gallery a portrait of his wife. In Panslianger a fine portrait
                    named Laura. The second picture in the National Gallery ascribed to Andrea, a
                    Holy Family, is by some critics regarded as the work rather of one of his
                    scholars— we hardly know why. A very noticeable incident in the life of Andrea
                    del Sarto relates to the copy, which he produced in 1523, of the portrait group
                    of Leo X. by Raphael; it is now in the Naples Museum, the original being in the
                    Pitti Gallery, Ottaviano de’ Medici, the owner of the original, was solicited by
                    Duke Frederick II. of Mantua to present it to him. Unwilling to part with so
                    great a pictorial prize, and unwilling also to disoblige the duke, ottaviano got
                    Andrea to make the copy, which was consigned to the duke as being the original.
                    So deceptive was tho imitation that even Giulio Romano, who had himself
                    manipulated the original to some extent, was completely taken in; and, on
                    showing the supposed Raphael years afterwards to Vasari, who knew the facts, he
                    could only be undeceived when a private mark on the canvas was named to him by
                    Vasari, and brought under his eye. It was Michelangelo who had introduced Vasari
                    in 1524 to Andrea’s studio. He is said to have thought very highly of Andrea’s
                    powers, saying on one occasion to Raphael, “There is a little fellow in Florence
                    who will bring sweat to your brow if ever he is engaged in great works.”</p>
                <p>Andrea had true pictorial style, a very high standard of correctness, and an
                    enviable balance of executive endowments. The point of technique in which he
                    excelled least was perhaps that of discriminating the varying textures of
                    different objects and surfaces. There is not much elevation or ideality in his
                    works—much moro of reality. His chiaroscuro is not carried out according to
                    strict rule, but is adjusted to his liking for harmony of colour and fused tone
                    and transparence; in fresco more especially his predilection for varied tints
                    appears excessive. It may be broadly said that his taste in colouring was
                    derived mainly from Fra Bartolommeo, and in form from Michelangelo; and his
                    style partakes of the Venetian and Lombard, as well as the Florentine and
                    Roman—some of his figures are even adapted from Albert Dürer. In one way or
                    other he continued improving to the last. In drawing from nature, his habit was
                    to sketch very slightly, making only such a memorandum as sufficed to work from.
                    The scholars of Andrea were very numerous; but, according to Vasari, they were
                    not wont to stay long, being domineered over by his wife; Pontormo and Domenico
                    Puligo may be mentioned.</p>
                <p>In our account of Andrea del Sarto we have followed the main lines of the
                    narrative of Crowe and Cavalcaselle, supplemented by Vasari, Lanzi, and others.
                    There are biographies by Biadi (1829) and by Von Reumont. (W. M. R.)</p>
