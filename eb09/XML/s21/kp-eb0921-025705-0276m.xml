                    The fishes known under these names form a small isolated group <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ammodytina),</hi> distantly related to the cod-fishes. Their body is of an
                    elongate-cylindrical shape, with the head terminating in a long conical snout,
                    the projecting lower jaw forming the pointed end. A low long dorsal fin, in
                    which no distinction between spines and rays can be observed, occupies nearly
                    the whole length of the back, and a long anal, composed of similar short and
                    delicate rays, commences immediately behind the vent, which is placed about
                    midway between the head and caudal fin. The caudal is forked and the pectorals
                    are short. The total absence of ventral fins indicates the burrowing habits of
                    these fishes. The scales, when present, are very small; but generally the
                    development of scales has only proceeded to the formation of oblique folds of
                    the integuments.<pb break="no"

                <p>Sand-eels are small littoral marine fishes, only one species attaining a length
                    of 18 inches <hi rend="italic">(Ammodytes lanceolate).</hi> They live in shoals
                    at various depths on a sandy bottom, and bury themselves in the sand on the
                    slightest alarm. They are able to do this with the greatest ease and rapidity
                    whilst the bottom is covered with water. Many of those which live close inshore
                    are left by the receding tide buried in the sand, and are then frequently dug
                    out from a depth of one or two feet. Other shoals live in deeper water; when
                    they are surprised by fish of prey or porpoises, they are frequently driven to
                    the surface in such dense masses that numbers of them can be scooped out of the
                    water with a bucket or hand-net. In fact, this used to be, in the Channel
                    Islands, the common practice of the fishermen to provide themselves with bait.
                    Some species descend to a depth of 100 fathoms and more; and the greater
                    sand-eel is not rarely taken on the mackerel line far out at sea near the
                    surface. Sand-eels are very rapacious, destroying a great quantity of fry and
                    other small creatures, such as the lancelet (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Branchiostoma),</hi> which lives in similar localities. They are excellent
                    eating, and are much sought after for bait.</p>
                <p>Sand-eels are common in all suitable localities of the North Atlantic; a species
                    scarcely distinct from the European common sand-launce occurs on the Pacific
                    side of North America, another on the east coast of South Africa. On the British
                    coasts three species are found :—the Greater Sand-Eel (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Ammodytes lanceolate),</hi> distinguished by a tooth-like bicuspid prominence
                    on the vomer; the Common Sand-Launce <hi rend="italic">(A. tobiamis),</hi> from
                    five to seven inches long, with unarmed vomer, even dorsal fin, and with the
                    integuments folded; and the Southern Sand-Launce <hi rend="italic">(A.
                    siculus),</hi> with unarmed vomer, smooth skin, and with the margins of the
                    dorsal and anal fins undulated. The last species is common in the Mediterranean,
                    but local farther northwards. It has been found near the Shetlands at depths
                    from 80 to 100 fathoms, and is generally distinguished from the common species
                    by the fishermen of the Channel Islands, who have a tradition that it appeared
                    suddenly on their coasts some fifty years ago.</p>
