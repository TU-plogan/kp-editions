                    central and southern regions of the peninsula derived their origin. Of their own
                    origin and affinities we know very little. Strabo calls them a very ancient race
                    and “autochthonous,” which may be taken as signifying that there was no
                    authentic tradition of their immigration, or of the quarter from whence they
                    came. The story of their Laconian descent may be safely rejected as one of those
                    fictions by which a certain class of the later Greek writers sought to derive
                    every people in Italy from a Greek origin. But the evidence concerning their
                    language, scanty as it is, is sufficient to prove that they were a cognate race
                    with the neighbouring Umbrians and Oscans, as well as, more remotely, with the
                    Latins. Cato, the best authority among the Roman writers with respect to the
                    different races of Italy, affirmed that the Sabines originally occupied the
                    country about Amiternum, in the upper valley of the Aternus, at the foot of the
                    loftiest group of the Apennines. From thence they gradually extended themselves
                    into the fertile valleys about Reate, where we find them established in
                    historical times, and occupied the tract from thence to the Tiber and the Anio.
                    But even in its widest extension the region held by the Sabines was of small
                    dimensions, and for the most part of a rugged and mountainous character. Hence
                    it was natural that they should seek a place for their superfluous population by
                    repeated emigrations into the neighbouring districts, and the general tradition
                    among Roman writers ascribed the origin of several of the more powerful and
                    populous nations of the peninsula to such emigrations. This result was
                    especially promoted by a custom which, though not unknown to the other nations
                    of Italy, appears to have been peculiarly characteristic of the Sabines—that of
                    a Ver Sacrum, or “sacred spring,” when everything born in that year was
                    consecrated to some local divinity, most frequently to Mamers or Mars. All the
                    cattle were duly sacrificed, while the young men were allowed to grow up to
                    manhood, and then sent forth in a body to seek for themselves new abodes beyond
                    the limits of their native land. To such colonies is ascribed the foundation of
                    the Picentes or people of Picenum, the Samnites, and the Hirpini. Of these the
                    last-mentioned derived their name from <hi rend="italic">hirpus,</hi> the Sabine
                    name for a wolf, an animal of that description being supposed to have been
                    divinely sent as the leader of the colony, as a woodpecker <hi rend="italic"
                    >(picus),</hi> also sacred to Mars, became that of the Piceni. The Peligni also,
                    as we learn from Ovid, himself a native of the district, claimed a Sabine
                    origin, and the same was probably the case with the smaller kindred tribes of
                    the Marsi, Marrucini, and Vestini. The Samnites, again, in their turn sent forth
                    the Frentani and the Lucanians, who extended their dominion throughout the
                    mountainous regions of<pb break="no"

                    Adriatic to the Sicilian Straits.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Sabines themselves were confined within comparatively narrow
                    limits, and their extension towards the south was checked by the growing power
                    of the Latins. Here their power appears to have attained its highest point about
                    the time of the foundation of Rome, and the legendary history, familiar to every
                    schoolboy, of the contests between Romulus and Tatius, the divided sovereignty
                    at one time established between them, and the peaceful reign and legislation of
                    the Sabine king Numa may be taken as representing the historical fact that the
                    population of Rome really contained an important Sabine element, and that Sabine
                    influences were largely intermixed with those of Latin origin, both in the civil
                    institutions and still more in the religious rites and ceremonies of the rising
                    republic. Beyond this it is impossible to pronounce with certainty as to the
                    real value and significance of the traditions preserved to us in the poetical
                    legends transmitted in the garb of history; and it is impossible in an article
                    like the present to give even an outline of the various theories that have been
                    devised by modern writers to put an historical interpretation upon the records
                    thus preserved to us. It is clear, however, that the power of the Sabines was by
                    no means broken, even by the establishment of the more powerful monarchy at Rome
                    under the Tarquins, and for a period of more than fifty years after the fall of
                    the monarchy we find the Romans engaged in almost perpetual hostilities against
                    the Sabines on the one side and the AEquians and Volscians on the other. At
                    length in the year 449 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Sabines were defeated
                    by the consul M. Horatius, in an action which appears to have been of so
                    decisive a character that we do not find them again appearing in arms against
                    the Romans for a period of more than 160 years. Their quiescence is the more
                    singular as during this interval the republic was engaged in the long series of
                    the Samnite Wars, in which their adversaries were the direct descendants of the
                    Sabines, and had therefore every claim on their support. Still more
                    unaccountable is it that, after looking on with apparent neutrality for so long,
                    we find the Sabines in the year 290 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> once more in
                    arms against Rome, and that at a period when the Third Samnite War had for a
                    time crushed all the hopes of their natural allies. The result was, as might
                    have been expected, that they found themselves wholly unequal to contend
                    single-handed against the power of Rome, and the consul M’. Curius Dentatus
                    reduced them to submission in a single campaign. They were severely punished for
                    this defection; and henceforth their national existence was at an end. Those who
                    survived the slaughter of the war were admitted to the position of Roman
                    citizens, though at first without the right of suffrage, but twenty years after
                    this also was granted them, and they were to all intents and purposes
                    incorporated in the Roman state. Thus separated from all the tribes of kindred
                    origin, they never again appear in history, and, like the Campanians and Latins,
                    were content to swell the ranks of the Roman legions even in the fierce struggle
                    of the Social War (91- 88 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> Under the
                    arrangements of the Roman empire their very name was lost as a territorial
                    designation, but it always continued in popular use, and was revived in the
                    Middle Ages as that of an ecclesiastical province. Even at the present day every
                    peasant in the neighbourhood of Rome will point to La Sabina as the familiar
                    appellation of the lofty mountain tract to the north of the city.</p>
                <p>The limits of the territory occupied by the Sabines do not appear to have varied
                    much from a very early period till the days of Strabo. That geographer describes
                    them as extending as far south as Eretum near the Tiber, on the road to Rome,
                    and a few miles only from Cures, the reputed birthplace of Tatius and Numa, but
                    which in his time had become a mere village. The principal town of the Sabines
                    was Reate (still called Rieti), in the midst of the beautiful and fertile valley
                    of the Velino, and from thence they occupied the upper valley of that river to
                    its sources in the Monte della Sibilla and the rugged mountain valleys which
                    connected it with that of the Aternus. Here was found Amiternum, the original
                    capital of the tribe, near the modern Aquila, and between that and Reate lay
                    Interocrea (Antrodoco), in a pass that has always formed one of the leading
                    lines of communication through the central Apennines. In the extreme north was
                    Nursia (Norcia), noted for the coldness of its climate, and celebrated in
                    ecclesiastical history as the birthplace of St Benedict. These were the only
                    towns of any importance in the territory of the Sabines; but they lived for the
                    most part scattered in villages about the mountains, a circumstance absurdly
                    alleged by some Roman writers as a proof of their Laconian origin. It was
                    doubtless owing to this habit, as well as to the rugged mountainous character of
                    the country in which they dwelt, that the Sabines owed the primitive simplicity
                    of their manners and the frugal and severe character which distinguished them
                    even in the days of Augustus. All readers of Horace must be familiar with his
                    frequent allusions to the moral purity and frugal manners of the people that
                    surrounded his Sabine villa, which was situated on the reverse of Mount
                    Lucretilis, only about 15 miles from the rich and luxurious Tibur (Tivoli). The
                    small town of Varia (Vicovaro), in its immediate neighbourhood, seems to have
                    marked the frontier on this side.</p>
                <p>No remains of the Sabine language are extant in the form of inscriptions, but
                    coins struck during the Social War with the inscription “Safinim” show that the
                    native appellation was the same as that in use among the Latins. The form
                    “Sabellus” is frequently found in Latin writers as an ethnic adjective
                    equivalent to Sabine; but the practice adopted by modern writers, of employing
                    the term “Sabellian” to designate all the tribes of Sabine origin, including
                    Samnites, Lucanians, &amp;c., was first introduced by Niebuhr, and is not
                    supported by any ancient authority, <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. h. b.)</hi></p>
