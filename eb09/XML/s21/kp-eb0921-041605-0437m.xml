                    draughtsman, engraver, and painter. At seventeen he entered the Academy of
                    Vienna, from which Overbeck and others of the new school who rebelled against
                    the old conventional style had been expelled about a year before. In 1818 he
                    followed the founders of the new school of German pre-Raphaelites in the general
                    pilgrimage to Rome. This school of religious and romantic art abjured modern
                    styles with three centuries of decadence, and reverted to and revived the
                    principles and practice of earlier periods. At the outset an effort was made to
                    recover fresco painting and “monumental art,” and Schnorr soon found opportunity
                    of proving his powers, when commissioned to decorate with frescos, illustrative
                    of Ariosto, the entrance hall of the Villa Massimo, near the Lateran. His
                    fellowlabourers were Cornelius, Overbeck, and Veit. His second period dates from
                    1825, when he left Rome, settled in Munich, entered the service of King Louis,
                    and transplanted to Germany the art of wall-painting learnt in Italy. He showed
                    himself qualified as a sort of poet-painter to the Bavarian court; he organized
                    a staff of trained executants, and set about clothing five halls in the new
                    palace with frescos illustrative of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied.</hi>
                    Other apartments his prolific pencil decorated with scenes from the histories of
                    Charlemagne, Frederick Barbarossa, and Rudolph of Hapsburg. These vast and
                    interminable compositions display the master’s merits and defects: they are
                    creative, learned in composition, masterly in drawing, but exaggerated in
                    thought and extravagant in style. Schnorr’s third period is marked by his “Bible
                    Pictures” or Scripture History in 180 designs. The artist was a Lutheran, and
                    took a broad and unsectarian view which won for his Pictorial Bible ready
                    currency throughout Christendom. The merits are unequal: frequently the
                    compositions are crowded and confused, wanting in harmony of line and symmetry
                    in the masses; thus they suffer under comparison with Raphael’s Bible.
                    Chronologically speaking, the style is severed from the simplicity and severity
                    of early times, and surrendered to the florid redundance of the later
                    Renaissance. Yet throughout are displayed fertility of invention, academic
                    knowledge with facile execution; and modern art has produced nothing better than
                    Joseph Interpreting Pharaoh’s Dream, the Meeting of Rebecca and Isaac, and the
                    Return of the Prodigal Son. The completion of the arduous work was celebrated in
                    1862 by the artists of Saxony with a festival, and other German states offered
                    congratulations and presented gifts.</p>
                <p>Biblical drawings and cartoons for frescos formed a natural prelude to designs
                    for church windows. The painter’s renown in Germany secured commissions in Great
                    Britain. Schnorr made designs, carried out in the royal factory, Munich, for
                    windows in Glasgow cathedral and in St Paul’s cathedral, London. This Munich
                    glass provoked controversy: mediaevalists objected to its want<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0438-0417"/> of lustre, and stigmatized the windows as
                    coloured blinds and picture transparencies. But the opposing party claimed for
                    these modern revivals “the union of the severe and excellent drawing of early
                    Florentine oil-paintings with the colouring and arrangement of the
                    glass-paintings of the latter half of the 16th century.” Schnorr’s busy life
                    closed at Munich in 1872.</p>
