                <p><label type="entry">SADDLERY</label> embraces the industries connected with the
                    harnessing and controlling of all beasts of draught and burden. The materials
                    used in harnessing the various creatures so employed and the modifications of
                    harness necessary to suit their structure, temperament, and duties are, of
                    course, exceedingly varied. In a restricted sense saddlery is principally a
                    leather trade, and has to do with the harnessing of the horse. The craft has
                    been recognized and established in England as a separate trade since the 13th
                    century, when the London Saddlers’ Company received its charter of incorporation
                    from Edward I. There is evidence also of its early prosperity at Birmingham,
                    where it grew to an importance which it still retains, the principal seat of the
                    saddlery trade being now at Walsall near Birmingham, which is practically a
                    saddlers’ town. The trade divides itself into two branches, brown saddlery and
                    black saddlery. The former is concerned with saddle-making and the cutting and
                    sewing of bridles, reins, and all other uncoloured leather-work. The saddle is
                    the most important article on the brown saddler’s list. It consists of the tree
                    or skeleton, on which the leather is stretched, the seat, the skirts, and the
                    flaps. The tree is commonly made of beech strengthened with iron plates. The
                    whole leather-work ought to be of pig-skin, but often the seat alone is of that
                    material, the other parts being imitation, cleverly grained by means of
                    electro-deposit copper casts from the surface of real pig-skin. There are many
                    varieties of saddles, such as racing, military, hunting, and ladies’ saddles,
                    &amp;c. A racing saddle may weigh not more than two or three pounds, while a
                    cavalry saddle will be four times heavier. The saddle-maker has to consider the
                    ease and comfort of both horse and rider. The saddle must fit closely and evenly
                    to the curvature of the horse’s back without tendency to shift, and it ought to
                    offer as far as possible a soft and elastic seat for the rider. The black
                    saddler is concerned with the harness of carriage, cart, and draught horses
                    generally. The skill of the tradesman in this department is displayed in
                    designing and arranging harness most favourable for the proper distribution of
                    the load, and for bringing into use the muscles of the animal without chafing or
                    fraying the skin. Much of the usefulness and comfort of a horse depends on the
                    accurate and proper fit of its harness. The collar and traces and the saddle are
                    the important features of draught harness, the former being the pieces through
                    which the draught is effected, while dead weight is borne through the saddle.
                    The portions of saddlery by which the horseman controls and guides the horse are
                    the bridle and bit and the reins. Into the many devices connected with these and
                    other parts of harness for curbing horses, for breaking them of evil habits, and
                    for adding to the security of the equestrian and carriage traveller, we cannot
                    here enter (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Horsemanship,</hi> vol. xii. p. 198).
                    Saddler’s ironmongery forms an important feature of the trade. It embraces the
                    making of buckles, chains, cart-gearing, stirrups, spurs, bits, hames, &amp;c.
                    The ornamental metal-work of carriage-harness is either electro-plated in silver
                    or of solid polished brass.</p>
