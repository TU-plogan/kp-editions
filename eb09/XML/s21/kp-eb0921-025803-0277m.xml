                    which are commonly known the members of a small but remarkable group of birds
                    frequenting sandy tracts, and having their feet more or less clothed with
                    feathers after the fashion of <hi rend="smallcaps">Grouse</hi> (vol. xi. p.
                    221), to which they were originally thought to be closely allied, and the
                    species first described were by the earlier systematists invariably referred to
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Tetrao.</hi> Their separation therefrom is due to
                    Temminck, who made for them a distinct genus which he called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pterocles,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He
                    states that he published this name in 1809; but hitherto research has failed to
                    find it used until 1815.</p></note> and his view, as Lesson tells us (<hi
                    rend="italic">Traité,</hi> p. 515), was subsequently corroborated by De
                    Blainville; while in 1831 Bonaparte <hi rend="italic">(Saggio,</hi> p. 54)
                    recognized the group as a good Family, <hi rend="italic">Pediophili</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Pterocliae.</hi> Further investigation of the osteology and
                    pterylosis of the Sand-Grouse revealed still greater divergence from the normal
                    <hi rend="italic">Gallinae</hi> (to which the true Grouse belong), as well as
                    several curious resemblances to the Pigeons; and in the Zoological Society’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for 1868 (p. 303) Prof. Huxley proposed to regard
                    them, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Pteroclomorphae,</hi> as forming a
                    group equivalent to the <hi rend="italic">Alectoromorphae.</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Peristeromorphae,</hi> for reasons already briefly stated <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Ornithology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 46).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some more recent writers, recognizing the
                    group as a distinct Order, have applied to it the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >“Pterocletes,"</hi> while another calls it <hi rend="italic">Heteroditae.</hi>
                    The former of these words is based on a grammatical misconception, while the use
                    of the latter has long since been otherwise preoccupied in zoology. If there be
                    need to set aside Prof. Huxley’s term, Bonaparte’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pediophili</hi> (as above mentioned) may be accepted, and indeed has priority
                    of all others.</p></note> The <hi rend="italic">Pteroclidae</hi> consist of two
                    genera— <hi rend="italic">Pterocles,</hi> with about fifteen species, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Syrrhaptes,</hi> with two. Of the former, two species inhabit
                    Europe, <hi rend="italic">P. arenarius,</hi> the Sand-Grouse proper, and that
                    which is usually called <hi rend="italic">P. alchata,</hi> the Pin-tailed
                    SandGrouse. The European range of the first is practically limited to Portugal,
                    Spain, and the southern parts of Russia, while the second inhabits also the
                    south of France, where it is generally known by its Catalan name of “<hi
                    rend="italic">Ganga,”</hi> or locally as “<hi rend="italic">Grandaulo,”</hi> or,
                    strange to say, <hi rend="italic">“Perdrix d'Angleterre’’</hi> Both species are
                    also abundant in Barbary, and have been believed to extend eastwards through
                    Asia to India, in most parts of which country they seem to be only
                    winter-visitants; but in 1880 Herr Bogdanow pointed out to the Academy of St
                    Petersburg <hi rend="italic">(Bulletin,</hi> xxvii. p. 164) a slight difference
                    of coloration between eastern and western examples of what had hitherto passed
                    as <hi rend="italic">P. alchata</hi>; and the difference, if found to be
                    constant, may require the specific recognition of each, while analogy would
                    suggest that a similar difference might be found in examples of <hi
                    rend="italic">P. arenarius.</hi> India, moreover, possesses five other species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Pterocles,</hi> of which however only one, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. fasciatus,</hi> is peculiar to Asia, while the others inhabit
                    Africa as well, and all the remaining species belong to the Ethiopian
                    region—one, <hi rend="italic">P. personatus,</hi> being peculiar to Madagascar,
                    and four occurring in or on the borders of the Cape Colony.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Syrrhaptes,</hi> though in general appearance
                    resembling <hi rend="italic">Pterocles,</hi> has a conformation of foot quite
                    unique among birds, the three anterior toes being encased in a common
                    “podotheca,” which is clothed to the claws with hairy feathers, so as to look
                    much like a fingerless glove. The hind toe is wanting. The two species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Syrrhaptes</hi> are <hi rend="italic">S. tibetanus—</hi> the
                    largest Sand-Grouse known— inhabiting the country whence its trivial name is
                    derived, and <hi rend="italic">S. paradoxus,</hi> ranging from Northern China

                    has been already briefly described <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii.
                    p. 770).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some slight
                    additions to and corrections of that account may here be given. A sixth example
                    is stated (<hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1871, p. 223) to have been killed in
                    Europe in 1859, namely, at Perpignan in France. One is believed to have been
                    obtained at or near Archangel (<hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1873, p. 66); but
                    the report of one in Sicily proves to have been a mistake, and Rimini, on the
                    Adriatic, remains the most southern Italian locality reached in 1863. Since 1872
                    a male obtained near Modena in May 1876 (<hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1881, p.
                    206), and a pair, one of which was shewn to the writer, in the county of Kildare
                    in Ireland, the following October (<hi rend="italic">Zoologist,</hi> 1877, p.
                    24), are all that are known to have occurred in Western Europe.</p></note>
                    Though its attempts at colonization in the extreme west have failed, it would
                    seem to have established itself of late years in the neighbourhood of Astrakhan
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1882, p. 220). It appears to be the “Barguerlac
                    <hi rend="italic">” of</hi> Marco Polo (ed. Yule, i. p. 239); and the
                    “Loung-Kio” or “Dragon’s Foot,” so unscientifically described by the Abbé Huc
                    <hi rend="italic">(Souvenirs d’un Voyage dans la Tartarie,</hi> i. p. 244), can
                    scarcely be anything else than this bird.</p>
                <p>Externally all Sand-Grouse present an appearance so distinctive that nobody who
                    has seen one of them can be in doubt as to any of the rest. Their plumage
                    assimilates in general colour to that of the ground they frequent, being above
                    of a dull ochreous hue, more or less barred or mottled by darker shades, while
                    beneath it is frequently varied by belts of deep brown intensifying into black.
                    Lighter tints are, however, exhibited by some species,—the drab merging into a
                    pale grey, the buff brightening into a lively orange, and streaks or edgings of
                    an almost pure white relieve the prevailing sandy or fawn-coloured hues that
                    especially characterize the group. The sexes seem always to differ in plumage,
                    that of the male being the brightest and most diversified. The expression is
                    decidedly Dove-like, and so is the form of the body, the long wings contributing
                    also to that effect, so that among Anglo-Indians these birds are commonly known
                    as “Rock-Pigeons.” The long wings, the outermost primary of which in <hi
                    rend="italic">Syrrhaptes</hi> has its shaft produced into an attenuated
                    filament, are in all the species worked by exceedingly powerful muscles, and in
                    several forms the middle rectrices are likewise protracted and pointed, so as to
                    give to their wearers the name of Pin-tailed Sand-Grouse.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These were separated by Bonaparte (<hi
                    rend="italic">Comptes Rendus,</hi> xlii. p. 880) as a distinct genus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pteroclurus,</hi> which later authors have justly seen no reason
                    to adopt.</p></note> The nest is a shallow hole in the sand. Three seems to be
                    the regular complement of eggs laid in each nest, but there are writers who
                    declare (most likely in error) that the full number in some species is four.
                    These eggs are of peculiar shape, being almost cylindrical in the middle and
                    nearly alike at each end, and are of a pale earthy colour, spotted, blotched, or
                    marbled with darker shades, the markings being of two kinds, one superficial and
                    the other more deeply seated in the shell. The young are hatched fully clothed
                    in down (P. <hi rend="italic">Z. S.</hi> 1866, pl. ix. fig. 2), and though not
                    very active would appear to be capable of locomotion soon after birth.
                    Morphologically generalized as the Sand-Grouse undoubtedly are, no one can
                    contest the extreme specialization of many of their features, and thus they form
                    one of the most instructive groups of birds with which ornithologists are
                    acquainted. The remains of an extinct species of <hi rend="italic">Pterocles, P.
                    sepultus,</hi> intermediate apparently between <hi rend="italic">P. alchata</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">P. gutturalis,</hi> have been recognized in the Miocene
                    caves of the Allier by Prof. A. Milne-Edwards (<hi rend="italic">Ois</hi>. <hi
                    rend="italic">foss. de la France,</hi> p. 294, pl. clxi. figs. 1-9); and, in
                    addition to the other authorities on this very interesting group of birds
                    already cited, reference may be made to Mr Elliot’s “Study” of the Family (P.
                    <hi rend="italic">Z. S.,</hi> 1878, pp. 233-264) and Dr Gadow, “On certain
