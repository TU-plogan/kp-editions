                <p><label type="entry">ST CLOUD</label>, a village of France, on the left bank of
                    the Seine, 7 miles west from the centre of Paris and 9 1/2 by the railroad from
                    Paris to Versailles, forming part of the canton of Sèvres and of the
                    arrondissement of Versailles (Seine-et-Oise). Picturesquely built on a
                    hill-slope, it overlooks the river, the Bois de Boulogne, and Paris; and, lying
                    amid the foliage of its magnificent park and numerous villa gardens, it is one
                    of the favourite resorts of the Parisians. The palace of St Cloud, which had
                    been a summer residence for Napoleon I., Louis XVIII., Charles X., Louis
                    Philippe, and Napoleon III., was burned by the Prussians in 1870 along with part
                    of the village. In spite of the damage inflicted on the park at the same period,
                    magnificent avenues still make it one of the finest rural haunts in the
                    neighbourhood of Paris. It occupies a varied tract of 960 acres, and abounds in
                    picturesque views. Every year in September a great fair, lasting three weeks, is
                    held in the park; and within its precincts are situated the new national Sèvres
                    porcelain manufacture and the Breteuil pavilion, the seat of the international
                    metre commission. St Cloud possesses a church, erected about 1865, in the style
                    of the 12th century, with an elegant stone spire; and here too has been
                    established the upper normal school (science and letters) for the training of
                    teachers (male) for the provincial normal schools of primary instruction. The
                    population in 1881 was 4081, and 4126 in the commune.</p>
                <p>Clodoald or Cloud, grandson of Clovis, adopted the monastic life and left his
                    name to the spot where his tomb was discovered after the lapse of 1200 years, in
                    a crypt near the present church. He had granted the domain to the church of
                    Paris, which possessed it as a fief till the 18th century. At St Cloud Henry
                    III. and the king of Navarre (Henry IV.) established their camp during the
                    League for the siege of Paris; and there the former was assassinated by Jacques
                    Clément. The castle was at that time only a plain country house belonging to
                    Pierre de Gondi, archbishop of Paris. Louis XIV. bought it for his brother, the
                    duke of Orleans, who was the originator of the palace which perished in 1870.
                    Peter the Great of Russia was received there in 1717 by the regent, whose
                    grandson sold the palace to Marie Antoinette. It was in the orangery at St Cloud
                    that Bonaparte executed the <hi rend="italic">coup d'état</hi> of 18th Brumaire;
                    and after he became emperor the palace was his favourite residence, and there he
                    celebrated his marriage with Marie Louise. In 1815 it was the scene of the
                    signing of the capitulation of Paris; and in 1830 from St Cloud Charles X.
                    issued the orders which brought about his fall. Napoleon III. was there when he
                    received the senatusconsult which restored the empire in his favour (1st
                    December 1852). Seized by the Prussians at the commencement of the investment of
                    Paris in 1870, St Cloud was sacked during the siege.</p>
