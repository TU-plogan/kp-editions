                    less comprehensive meanings. In its widest sense it includes all the painters of
                    one country, of every date,—as, for example, “the Italian school.” In its
                    narrowest sense it denotes a group of painters who all worked under the
                    influence of one man,—as, for example, “the school of Raphael.” In a third sense
                    it is applied to the painters of one city or province who for successive
                    generations worked under some common local influence, and with some general
                    similarity in design, colour, or technique,—as, for example, “the Florentine
                    school,” “the Umbrian school.” For many reasons the existence of well-defined
                    schools of painting is now almost wholly a thing of the past, and the conditions
                    under which the modern artist gains his education, finds his patrons, and
                    carries out his work have little in common with those which were prevalent
                    throughout the Middle Ages. Painters in the old times were closely bound
                    together as fellow-members of a painters’ guild, with its clearly defined set of
                    rules and traditions; <hi rend="italic">moreover,</hi> the universal system of
                    apprenticeship, which compelled the young painter to work for a term of years in
                    the <hi rend="italic">bottega</hi> or studio of some established freedman of the
                    guild, frequently caused the impress of the genius of one man to be very clearly
                    stamped on a large number of pupils, who thus all picked up and frequently
                    retained for life certain tricks of manner or peculiarities of method which
                    often make it difficult to distinguish the authorship of a special
                    painting.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is
                    especially the case with the numerous pupils of Perugino.</p></note> The strong
                    similarity which often runs through the productions of several artists who had
                    been fellow-pupils under the same master was largely increased by the fact that
                    most popular painters, such as Botticelli or Perugino, turned out from their <hi
                    rend="italic">botteghe</hi> many pictures to which the master himself
                    contributed little beyond the general design,—the actual execution being in part
                    or even wholly the work of pupils or paid assistants. It was not beneath the
                    dignity of a great painter to turn out works at different scales of prices to
                    suit rich or poor, varying from the well-paid-for altarpiece given by some
                    wealthy donor, which the master would paint wholly with his own hand, down to
                    the humble bit of decorative work for the sides of a wedding cassone, which
                    would be left entirely to the ’prentice hand of a pupil. In other cases the
                    heads only in a picture would be by the master himself or possibly the whole of
                    the principal figures, the background and accessories being left to assistants.
                    The buyer sometimes stipulated in a carefully drawn up contract that the cartoon
                    or design should be wholly the work of the master, and that he should himself
                    transfer it on to the wall or panel. It will thus be seen how impossible it is
                    always to decide whether a picture should be classed as a piece of <hi
                    rend="italic">bottega</hi> work or as a genuine production of a noted master;
                    and this will explain the strange inequality of execution which is so striking
                    in many of the works of the old masters, especially the Italians. Among the
                    early Flemish and Dutch painters this method of painting does not appear to have
                    been so largely practised, probably because they considered minute perfection of
                    workmanship to be of paramount importance.</p>

                <p>In Italy, as in other parts of Europe, the Byzantine school of painting was for

                    the 13th century that one man of extraordinary talent—Giotto— broke through the
                    long-established traditions and inaugurated the true Renaissance of this art.
                    According to Vasari, it was Cimabue who first ceased to work in the Byzantine
                    manner; but the truth is that his pictures, though certainly superior to those
                    of his predecessors, are thoroughly characteristic specimens of the Byzantine
                    style. Ghiberti, in his <hi rend="italic">Commentary</hi> (a century earlier
                    than Vasari’s work), with greater accuracy remarks that both Duccio of Siena and
                    Cimabue worked in the Byzantine manner, and that Giotto was the first who learnt
                    to paint with naturalistic truth.</p>
                <p>In the 12th and the early part of the 13th century Pisa and Lucca were the chief
                    seats of what rude painting then existed in Italy. A</p>
                <p>number of works of this date still exist, chiefly painted Crucifixions treated in
                    the most con ventional By zantine manner.</p>
                <p>Giunta Pisano, who was paint ing in the first half of the 13th century, was a
                    little superior to the otherwise dead level of hieratic conven tionalism. He is
                    said to have been Cimabue’s master. In the</p>
                <p>14th century painting in Pisa was either Flor-</p>
                <p>entine or Sien ese in style.</p>
                <p>No city, not even Florence, was so fertile as Siena in native painters during the
                    13th and 14th centuries. The earliest, working before 1300, did not emanci pate
                    themselves from the old</p>
                <p>Byzantine man nerism; Guido da Siena, Duc cio (see fig.</p>
                <p>1 ) and Segna di Buoninsegna possessed many of the peculi arities of the old
                    school,—its rigid attitudes, its thin stiff folds, and its greenish sha dows in
                    the flesh tints. In the first half of the l 4th century a number of very able
                    painters were carrying on at Siena a parallel development to that which Giotto
                    had inaugurated<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0455-0434"/> at Florence; chief among them were Simone di
                    Martino, Lippo Memmi, and especially Ambrogio Lorenzetti, a painter of both
                    panels and large frescos, which show rich and noble imaginative power and much
                    technical skill. It is important to note that Ambrogio and probably other
                    painters of his time were, like the ear lier Pisan Niccola, beginning to study
                    the then rare ex amples of classical sculpture. Ghiberti, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentary,</hi> speaks with enthu-.</p>
                <p>siasm of the beauty of an antique statue which he knew only from a drawing by
                    Ambrogio Lorenzetti. In the second half of the 14th century Siena produced a
                    large number of more mediocre painters; but these were succeeded by an abler
                    generation, among whom the chief were perhaps Sano di Pietro and Matteo di
                    Giovanni, whose grand altarpiece (No. 1155), recently acquired, is one of the
                    glories of the English National Gallery. Many excellent masters were working at
                    Siena throughout the 15th century and even later; the last names of any real
                    note are those of Peruzzi and Beccafumi. Sodoma, though he settled in Siena in
                    1501, does not belong to the school of Siena; his early life was passed at
                    Milan, chiefly under the influence of Da Vinci. His talent was developed at Rome
                    among the followers of Raphael.</p>
                <p>On the whole the Florentine school surpasses in importance all others throughout
                    Italy. Cimabue, though he did not emancipate himself from the Byzantine manner,
                    was a painter of real genius (see fig. 2).</p>
                <p>Giotto is perhaps the most important painter in the history of the development of
                    art, for during the whole of the 14th century the painters of Florence may be
                    said to have been his pupils and imitators (see fig. 3). Orcagna alone developed
                    rather a different line, more richly decorative in style and brighter in
                    colour,— a link between the art of Giotto and that of Siena. In the 15th century
                    Florence reached its period of highest artistic splendour and developed an
                    almost<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n456/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0456-0435"/> naturalistic school, which appears to have been
                    inaugurated by Masolino and Masaccio. Some few painters, such as Fra Angelico
                    (see fig. 4) and his pupil Benozzo Gozzoli, produced more purely sacred and
                    decorative work, following the lead of Orcagna. As Baron Rumohr has pointed out,
                    the main bulk of the Florentine 15th-century painters may be divided into three
                    groups with different characteristics. The first, including Masolino, Masaccio,
                    Lippo Lippi, Botticelli, Filippino Lippi, and their pupils, aimed especially at
                    strong action, dramatic force, and passionate expression (see figs. 5 and 6).
                    The second, including Baldovinetti, Ros-</p>
                <p>selli, Ghirlandaio, and his pupils, are remarkable for realistic truth and
                    vigorous individuality (see fig. 7). To the third belong Ghiberti, who began
                    life as a painter,</p>
                <p>Pollaiuolo,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is
                    interesting to note how Ant. Pollaiuolo’s fine figure of St Sebastian in the

                    cathedral by Matteo Civitale.</p></note> Verrocchio, and his pupils Leonardo da
                    Vinci and Lorenzo di Credi,</p>
                <p>—a group largely influenced by the practice of the arts of the goldsmith and the
                    sculptor. Signorelli, whose chief works are at Orvieto and</p>
                <p>Monte Oliveto near</p>
                <p>Siena, was remarkable for his knowledge and masterly treatment of the nude (see
                    fig. 8), and had much influence on the early development of Michelangelo, whose
                    gigantic genius in later life produced the most original and powerful works that
                    the modern world has seen (see fig. 9). Andrea del Sarto was one of the last
                    artists of the golden age of painting in Florence; the soft beauty of his works
                    is, however, often marred by a monotonous mannerism. To him are wrongly
                    attributed many paintings by Puligo and other scholars, who imitated his style
                    with various degrees of closeness. The 16th century in Florence was a period of
                    the most rapid decline and was for long chiefly remarkable for its feeble
                    caricatures of Michelangelo’s inimitable style.</p>
                <p>Between the end of the 14th and the beginning of the</p>
                <p>16th century the Umbrian school produced many painters of great importance
                    grouped around a number of different centres, such as Gubbio, where Ottaviano
                    Nelli lived; San Severino, with its two Lorenzos; Fabriano, famed for its able
                    masters Allegretto Nuzi and Gentile da Fabriano; Foligno, whence Niccolo took
                    his name; and above all Borgo San Sepolcro, where Piero della Francesca was
                    born.</p>
                <p>Piero was one of the most charming of all painters for his delicate modelling,
                    tender colour, and beauty of expression (see fig.</p>
                <p>10). His masterpiece, a large altar-painting of the Madonna enthroned, with
                    standing saints at the side and in front a kneeling portrait of Duke Federigo da
                    Montefeltro, in the Brera gallery, is, strange to say, attributed to his pupil
                    Fra Carnovale.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    attribution of this magnificent picture to Fra Carnovale rests wholly on a
                    statement, evidently erroneous, of Pungileoni; and hence many other works by
                    Piero, such as the St Michael in the National Gallery, are wrongly given to
                    Carnovale. It is doubtful whether any genuine picture by the latter is now
                    known; if the Brera picture were really by him he would not only be greater than
                    his master Piero, but would be one of the chief painters of the l5th
                    century.</p></note><pb break="no"

                    religious and richly decorative style that characterized Fra Angelico at
                    Perugia. Fiorenzo di Lorenzo (see fig. 11) and Bonfigli prepared the way for
                    Perugino (see fig. 12) and his pupils Pinturicchio. Raphael, Lo Spagna, and
                    others. Timoteo Viti was another Umbrian painter of great ability, whose
                    portrait by Raphael in black and red chalk is one of the most beautiful of the
                    drawings in the Print Room of the British Museum.</p>
                <p>The Paduan school is chiefly remarkable for the great name of Andrea Mantegna,
                    the pupil of Squarcione; his firm and sculpturesque draw ing is combined with
                    great beauty of colour and vigor ous expression (see fig. 13).</p>
                <p>His pupil Montagna also studied under Gian. Bellini at Venice. Andrea Mantegna
                    influenced and was influenced by the Venetian school; to him are attributed many
                    of the early paintings of his brother-in-law Gian. Bellini, such as the Vatican
                    Pietà, and other works more remarkable for vigour than for grace.</p>
                <p>The school of Arezzo was early in its development.</p>
                <p>Margaritone, who is absurdly overpraised by his fellowtownsman Vasari, was an
                    artist of the most feeble abilities. In the 14th century Arezzo produced such
                    able painters as Spinello di Luca, Niccolo di Gerini, and Lorenzo di Bicci. In
                    the 15th century it possessed no native school worth recording.</p>
                <p>Venice did not come into prominence till the 15th century; the Vivarini family of
                    Murano were at work about the middle of it, and were perhaps influ enced by the

                    in his native town, soon attached himself to the Venetian school.</p>
                <p>Ferrara possessed a small native school in the 15th and 16th centuries, Cosimo
                    Tura, Ercole Grandi, Dosso Dossi, and Garofalo being among the chief artists.
                    The paintings of this school are often vigorous in drawing, but rather mannered,
                    and usually somewhat hard in colour. After</p>
                <p>1470 there was an intimate connexion between the schools of Ferrara and
                    Bologna.</p>
                <p>The Bologna school existed, though not in a very characteristic form, in the 14th
                    century.</p>
                <p>Francia and Lorenzo Costa of Ferrara were its chief painters at the end of the
                    15th century (see fig.</p>
                <p>19). It was, however, in the 16th and 17th centuries that Bologna took a leading
                    place as a school of Italian painting, the beginning of which dates from about
                    1480, when several able painters from Ferrara settled in Bologna. The three
                    Caracci, Guido (see fig. 20), Domenichino, and Guercino were the most admired
                    painters of their time, and continued to be esteemed far beyond their real value
                    till about the middle of the 19th century. Since then, however, the strong
                    reaction in favour of earlier art has gone to the other extreme, and the real
                    merits of the Bolognese school, such as their powerful drawing and skilful
                    though visibly scholastic composition, are now usually overlooked.</p>
                <p>Both Modena and Parma possessed mediocre painters in the 14th and 15th centuries.
                    In the 16th Correggio and his pupil Parmigiano attained to a very high degree of
                    popularity. Correggio, who was largely influenced by the Ferrara-Bologna school,
                    is sometimes weak in drawing and affected in composition, but will always be
                    esteemed for the rich softness of his modelling and the delicate pearly tone of
                    his flesh tints. Fig. 21 is an excellent example of his style, though much
                    injured by repainting.</p>
                <p>The small school of Cremona occupies only a subordinate position. Boccaccino was
                    its ablest painter; his rare works are remarkable for conscientious finish,
                    combined with some provincial mannerism.</p>
                <p>In the 15th and early part of the 16th century Milan had one of the most
                    important schools in Italy.</p>
                <p>Its first member of any note was Vincenzo Foppa, who was painting in 1457 and was
                    the founder of the early school. Ambrogio Borgognone (born <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi>. 1455) was an artist of great merit and strong religious sentiment. He
                    followed in the footsteps of Foppa, and his pictures are remarkable for the calm
                    beauty of the faces, and for their delicate colour (see fig.</p>
                <p>22), which recalls the manner of Piero della Francesca. Leonardo da Vinci, though
                    trained in Florence, may be said to have created the later Milanese school.</p>
                <p>Fig. 23 shows one of the very few pictures by his hand which still exist. The
                    marvellous and almost universal genius of Leonardo caused his influence to be
                    powerfully extended, not only among his immediate pupils, but also among almost
                    all the Lombard painters of his own and the succeeding generation.</p>
                <p>His closest followers were Salaino, Luini, Cesare da Sesto,</p>
                <p>Beltraffio, and Marco d’Oggiono, and in a lesser degree Andrea Solario,</p>
                <p>Gaudenzio Ferrari, and Sodoma, who introduced a new style of painting into Siena.
                    Solario also studied in Flanders, and in Venice under Gian. Bellini, so that a
                    curiously composite style is visible in some of his magnificent portraits (see
                    fig. 24). Most of the pictures and many drawings usually attributed to Da Vinci
                    are really the work of his pupils and imitators. Luini, in his magnificent
                    frescos, was one of the last painters who preserved the religious dignity and
                    simplicity of the older mediaeval schools. Fresco painting was practised by the
                    Milanese after it had been generally abandoned elsewhere.<pb break="no"

                    of native talent in any of the fine arts, and nearly all the members of the so -
                    called Roman school came from other cities. This school at first consisted of
                    the personal pupils of Raphael,—</p>
                <p>Fran. Penni, Da Imola, Giulio Romano, and Del Vaga.</p>
                <p>Sassoferrato and Carlo Maratta were feeble but very popular painters in the 17th
                    century.</p>
                <p>The early history of the Neapolitan school is mostly mythical; it had no
                    individual existence till the 16th century, and then chiefly in the person of
                    Caravaggio. During the 15th century many works of the Van Eycks and other
                    Flemish painters were imported into Naples; some of these were afterwards
                    claimed by the vanity of native writers as paintings by early Neapolitan
                    artists, for whom imaginary names and histories were invented.</p>

                <p>It was especially at Cologne in Westphalia and in the Rhine provinces generally
                    that German painting was developed at an early time. William of Cologne, who
                    died about 1378, painted panels with much delicacy and richness of colour (see
                    fig. 25). A number of large and highly finished altarpieces were painted in this
                    part of Germany during the 15th century, but the names of very few of the
                    Painters of that time are known. Artists such as Schongauer,</p>
                <p>Von Meckenen, Cranach, and others were more at home in the engraving of copper
                    and wood than in painting, and to some extent the same might be said of Albert
                    Durer, an artist of the highest and most varied talents, who especially excelled
                    as a portrait painter (sec fig. 26).</p>
                <p>The Hans Holbeins, father and son, especially the latter, attained the highest
                    rank as portrait painters; nothing can exceed the vivid truthfulness and
                    exquisite workmanship of the portraits by the younger Holbein (see fig. 27), who
                    also painted very beautiful religious pictures. Since his time Germany has
                    produced few noteworthy painters. In the 19th century Overbeck was remarkable
                    for an attempt to revive the long dead religious spirit in painting, and he;
                    attained much popularity, which, however, has now almost wholly died away.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Flemish.</hi></p>
                <p>Hubert and Jan van Eyck, who were painting at the beginning of the 15th century,
                    were artists of the very highest rank; with their unrivalled technical skill,
                    their exquisite finish, and the splendour of their colour, they produced works
                    which in some respects even surpassed those of any of the Italian painters.
                    Probably no other artists ever lavished time and patient labour quite to the
                    same extent to which Jan van Eyck did upon some of his works, such as the
                    Arnolfini and other portraits in the</p>

                    painting and from its exquisite miniature landscape and town in the distance,
                    all glowing with the warm light of the setting sun. The elder Van der Werden was
                    a most able pupil of the Van Eycks; he occasionally practised a very different
                    technical method from that usually employed in Flanders,— that is to say, he
                    painted in pure tempera colours on un-primed linen, the flesh tints especially
                    being laid on extremely thin, so that the texture of the linen remains unhidden.
                    Other colours, such as a smalto blue used for draperies, are applied in greater
                    body, and the whole is left uncovered by any varnish. A very perfect example of
                    this exists in the National Gallery (see fig. 29). The special method used with
                    such success by the Van Eycks and their school was to paint the whole pic ture

                    were Memling, Van der Meire, and the younger Van der Weyden, to whom is

                    vigorous works. The weaker Flemish painters of the l6th century, on the

                    feebly pretty type.</p></note></p>
                <p>At the beginning of the 16th century</p>
                <p>Flemish art began to lose rapidly in vigour, a weaker style being substituted

                <p>Mor, usually known as Antonio Moro, was a portrait painter of the very highest
                    rank. A por trait of Queen Mary of England at Madrid, and one of a youth of the
                    Farnese family at Parma, are real masterpieces of portraiture. He spent some
                    time in England. The Breughel family in the 16th and 17th centuries produced
                    feeble works finished with microscopic detail·</p>
                <p>Rubens and his pupil Vandyck in the 17th century were among the greatest portrait
                    pointers the world has ever seen (see figs. 31 and 32), and had many able
                    followers on the Continent and in Eng land.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Dutch</hi></p>
                <p>This school was chiefly remarkable for its jointers of subjects, often treated
                    with a very ignoble realism, especially by the various members of the Teniers
                    family. Rembrandt, the greatest painter of the school, developed a quite
                    original style, remarkable for the force shown in his effective treatment of
                    light and shade.</p>
                <p>The vigorous life and technical skill shown in some of his portraits have never
                    been surpassed (see fig.</p>
                <p>33). As a rule, however, he cared but little for colour, and used the etching
                    needle with special enjoyment and dexterity. Terburg, Gerhard Don ( Douw ), and
                    Wouwerman had more sense of beauty, and worked with the most miniature - like
                    delicacy. Another school excelled in landscape, especially Ruysdael and Hobbema
                    (see figs. 34 and 35). Vandevelde was remarkable for his sea-pieces, and Paul
                    Potter for quiet pastoral scenes with exquisitely painted cattle. Throughout the

                    outnumbered those of any other, and many of them reached a very fair average of

                <p>The early Spanish painters of the 15th and 16th centuries were merely feeble
                    imitators of Italian art. Many of them, such as Juan de</p>
                <p>Juanes, studied in</p>
                <p>Italy. Ribalta and</p>
                <p>Zurbaran were per haps the first able artists who deve loped a national style.
                    The latter is remarkable for his paintings of monks; fig. 36 shows one of the
                    best examples.</p>
                <p>His large altarpieces are less successful.</p>
                <p>Velazquez, one of the greatest masters of skilful execution the world has seen,
                    was alike great in portraiture (see fig. 37) and in large figure subjects. His
                    early religious paintings, executed under the influence of Ribalta, are far
                    inferior to his later works, the best of which are at Madrid. Murillo is usually
                    rather undervalued; he was very unequal in his work, and is well represented
                    nowhere except at Seville.</p>
                <p>No words can describe the exquisite religious beauty and pathos of his great
                    picture of Christ on the Cross bending down to embrace St Francis. Goya, who
                    lived into the</p>
                <p>19th century, was an artist of great power, haunted by a hideous imagination.
                    Fortuny, a very clever young painter, who died in Rome in 1874, was remarkable
                    for his daring use of the most brilliant colour, with which his pictures are
                    studded like a mosaic. His success has caused him to have countless imitators,
                    most of whom reproduce the faults rather than the merits of his work. His
                    influence on modern Continental art has been very great.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">French.</hi></p>
                <p>French art, like that of Spain, was almost wholly under Italian influence during
                    the 15th and 16th centuries. Nicolas Poussin, in the 17th century, was the first
                    to develop a native style, though he was much influenced by Titian. His best
                    works are bacchanalian scenes, of which one of the finest is in the National
                    Gallery (see fig. 38).</p>
                <p>When at his best his flesh painting resembles that of Titian, but it is
                    frequently marred by unpleasant hot colouring. Claude Lorrain is remarkable for
                    his beautiful and imaginative landscapes,—often wanting in a real study of
                    nature (see fig. 39). His finest works are in</p>
                <p>England (see p. 445). Throughout the 18th century the French school was very
                    prolific, but shared the mediocrity of the age, the corruption and artificiality
                    of which impressed themselves strongly on the painting of the time. The most
                    popular artists of that century were Watteau, Boucher, Greuze, Claude Vernet,
                    Fragonard, and David, the reviver of the pseudo-classic style. In the first half
                    of the 19th century Prud’hon, Ingres, Horace Vernet, and Delaroche—artists of
                    only moderate merit—were in great repute, and more deservedly the very brilliant
                    landscape painter Rousseau. Millet, though little valued during his lifetime, is

                    siege of Paris in 1871, belongs to the latest development of French art. At
                    present (1886) Paris possesses by far the most important school of art existing,
                    and French painters on the whole are supreme in power of drawing and in
                    technical skill. Unhappily these great merits are often counterbalanced by false
                    sentimentalism or excessive realism, and especially by gross sensuality. Art in
                    France—that is, in Paris—is now in a state of the most prolific activity, and is
                    branching out into new and startling phases, such as the impressionist style, in
                    which <hi rend="italic">form</hi> is suppressed for the sake of <hi

                    is ugly or even loathsome; to the latter belong some of the technically ablest
                    painters alive.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A few

                    portraits in the 16 th and 17th centuries, among whom the earliest were Nicholas
                    Hilliard and Isaac Oliver, artists of some note in the reign of Elizabeth. Many
                    very beautiful miniatures were produced by them and by the younger Peter Oliver,
                    who rose into celebrity under the Commonwealth.</p>
                <p>Other able portrait painters of the 17th century were the Scotch Jamesone, a
                    pupil of Rubens, William Dobson, a pupil of Vandyck,<note anchored="true"

                    Restoration were the Flemish Sir Peter Lely and Sir Godfrey Kneller, whose
                    influence on art in England was disastrous. The 18th century produced many
                    painters of the highest merit, as Hogarth, who stands unrivalled as a
                    caricaturist and moralist, Reynolds and his rival Gainsborough, notable among
                    the chief portrait painters of the world (see figs. 40 and</p>
                <p>41), and Richard Wilson, the founder of the English school of landscape, the
                    chief artistic speciality of the country. The three brothers Smith of
                    Chichester, Gainsborough, and later in the century John (Old)</p>
                <p>Crome of Norwich and James Ward, were all landscape painters of great ability.
                    England has since the 18th century been specially famed for its school of
                    water-colour painters, of which Paul Sandby was one of the founders; he was
                    followed by Wheatley, Webber, Girtin, and Prout. Sir Henry Raeburn was a
                    Scottish portrait painter of the highest rank (see fig. 42), but was far less
                    admired in England than the very feeble Lawrence. Little can be said in favour
                    of many of the most popular painters of that time, as West, Barry, Fuseli,
                    Northcote, and Shee, who practised what was considered the highest branches of
                    art, such as historical painting.</p>
                <p>William Blake, in spite of his wonderful poetical and imaginative power, lived
                    and died with very inadequate recognition. To the first half of the 19th century
                    belong Turner, the greatest of all landscape painters (see fig. 43), and his
                    very able contemporaries Constable, J. J. Chalon, Copley Fielding, and Stan-<pb

                    painters of this time—Sir William Allan and Sir David Wilkie. Mulready was a
                    fine draughtsman, skilful in composition, but weak in colour. Etty’s scholastic
                    drawing recalls the merits and faults of the Bolognese school, and he is
                    frequently very fine in colour. Eastlake was weak in drawing and feeble in
                    composition. Sir Edwin Landseer excelled in animal painting, especially in his
                    rendering of the texture of hair and fur, but was frequently rather harsh in
                    colour and commonplace in motive. David Roberts is worthy of note for his very
                    clever watercolours of architectural scenes, J. F. Lewis for his ex quisitely
                    finished Oriental subjects, and J. S. Raven for his grand and imaginative
                    landscapes, which, however, are very little known. Dante Gabriel Rossetti (see
                    fig. 44), who died in 1882, was one of the chief painters of the century, both
                    for the richness of his colouring and for his strong poetical imagination; he
                    was one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite “brotherhood ’’ (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rossetti),</hi> whose rise, development, and widespread
                    influence on painting in Britain have been the chief artistic events in this
                    century, and have produced a few painters whose earnestness of purpose and
                    originality of power give them a foremost and absolutely unique position in

                    of every school and including many paintings of very rare masters, it is hardly
                    surpassed by any gallery in the world. Though weak in paintings of Giotto and
                    his school, it possesses many early Sienese pictures of great interest and
                    exceptional importance (see fig. 1), and a collection unrivalled out of Italy of
                    the works of the best Florentine painters of the 15th century, as Paolo Uccello,
                    Lippo Lippi, Pollaiuolo, Signorelli, Botticelli, Lorenzo di Credi, and others
                    (see fig. 6). Of the very few existing easel pictures by Pisanello<note

                    to Pisanello in Rome and elsewhere are of very doubtful genuineness.</p></note>
                    the National Gallery contains one (signed), St George and St Anthony. The
                    portrait by Andrea del Sarto is one of his finest works,—full of life and
                    expression and rich in tone. In addition to a large painting on canvas of the
                    school of Michelangelo—Leda and the Swan<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Not exhibited; it is probably a pupil’s copy of the marble
                    group of the same subject designed by Michelangelo.</p></note> —the National
                    Gallery possesses two unfinished pictures, a Madonna and Angels and an
                    Entombment of Christ, both of which, in spite of many adverse criticisms, appear
                    to be genuine works of Michelangelo, the former in his early, the latter in his
                    later manner—a very remarkable possession for one gallery, seeing that the only
                    other genuine easel painting by him is the circular panel of the Madonna in the
                    tribune of the Uffizi (Florence). No four pictures could better represent
                    Raphael’s highly varied manners than the miniature Knight’s Dream, the Ansidei
                    Madonna, the St Catherine, and the Garvagh Madonna, which in the dates of their
                    execution cover nearly the whole of his short working life. In the Venetian
                    school the National Gallery is almost unrivalled: it contains a large number of
                    fine examples of Crivelli (see fig. 14),—Venice not possessing one; two rare
                    panels by Marziale, both signed and dated (1500 and 1507); the finest specimens
                    of Giovanni Bellini (see fig. 15) and his school which exist out of Venice; one
                    of Titian’s noblest works,—the Ariadne and Bacchus, finished in 1523 for the
                    duke of Ferrara, together with two other fine pictures of earlier date; and the
                    masterpiece of Sebastiano del Piombo, his Raising of Lazarus, partly designed by
                    Michelangelo. The smaller schools of Ferrara and Cremona are well represented by
                    examples of nearly all their chief painters. Of the Umbrian school the gallery
                    possesses two or rather three important, though much injured, panels by Piero
                    della Francesca (see fig. 10), a fine picture by Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, as well as
                    one of Perugino’s best works, the triptych from the Certosa near Pavia (see fig.
                    12), and other paintings by him. Correggio is represented by three fine
                    pictures, classical and religious, specimens of unusual excellence (see fig.
                    21). Of the Bolognese school there are three works by Francia, one signed (see
                    fig. 19), and specimens of the painters of the later school,— Annibale Caracci,
                    Guido (see fig. 20), and others. Paul Veronese’s Dream of St Helena and the
                    group of portraits of the Pisani family, arranged as the scene of the family of
                    Darius before Alexander, are among his finest works. The three pictures by Lotto
                    are excellent examples of his supreme talents in portraiture; and no collection
                    outside Brescia and Bergamo is so rich in the noble portrait pictures of Moretto
                    and his pupil Moroni. Leonardo da Vinci (the rarest of the great masters) is
                    represented by a very beautiful picture<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In addition to the strong internal evidence in favour of
                    this picture being at least in part a genuine work of Da Vinci, it is expressly
                    mentioned as being by him in the <hi rend="italic">Trattatο della Pittura</hi>
                    (ii. 17 and iv. 1), written by the Milanese Lomazzo before 1584. The painting
                    was then in the church of 8. Francesco at Milan, where it remained till
                    1796.</p></note> which appears to have been partly finished by<pb break="no"

                    in design as the Vierge aux Rochers in the Louvre (see fig. 23). Leonardo’s use
                    of almost monochromatic colouring differs strongly from the style of his pupils
                    and imitators Luini, Andrea da Solario (see fig. 24), and Beltraffio, all of
                    whom are represented by excellent and characteristic examples. Of the earlier
                    Milanese school the gallery contains two magnificent examples by Ambrogio
                    Borgognone, —the Marriage of St Catherine especially being a work of the highest
                    importance and beauty (see fig. 22). The gallery possesses rare examples of the
                    early German masters (see fig. 25, by William of Cologne), though it is weak in
                    the works of the later Germans, as Albert Durer, who is represented only by one
                    portrait, which is signed (see fig. 26), and Hans Holbein the younger, who is
                    totally absent except for the noble portrait lent by the duke of Norfolk.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>England generally is,
                    however, very rich in the works of Holbein,—chiefly portraits.</p></note> The
                    collection is, however, unusually rich in fine examples of early Flemish art,—of
                    the Van Eycks and their school (see fig. 28). The portrait of Jean Arnolfini and
                    his wife (signed and dated) is one of Jan van Eyck’s noblest works on a small
                    scale,—only surpassed, perhaps, by the Madonna and Worshipper in the Louvre. The
                    Entombment of Christ by Van der Weyden the elder (see fig. 29), the three or
                    more examples of Memling, the Exhumation of St Hubert by Dierick Bouts, the
                    Reading Magdalene by Van der Weyden the younger (see fig. 30), and the Saints
                    and Donor by Gheerardt David are all unrivalled examples of these great
                    painters. The delicate little panel of the Madonna by Margaret van Eyck is a
                    work of much interest. The later Flemish and Dutch schools are equally well
                    represented, especially by a number of noble portraits by Rembrandt (see fig.
                    33), Rubens, and Vandyck; a portrait of an old woman, the “Chapeau de Poil,” and
                    the portrait of Van der Geest (wrongly called Gevartius) are among the finest
                    works of these three masters (see figs. 31 and 32). Hobbema, Ruysdael, De Hooge,
                    Wouwerman, and others of their school are very richly represented (see figs. 34
                    and 35). Of the Spanish school the National Gallery contains an excellent
                    portrait head of Philip IV. (see fig. 37) by Velazquez, a full-length of the
                    same king, not wholly by his hand, and also two pictures of sacred subjects and
                    a curious boar-hunting scene of much interest, but of inferior beauty. The
                    examples of Murillo, like most out of Seville, are but third-rate specimens of
                    his power. The Kneeling Friar as an example of Zurbaran’s work is unrivalled
                    either in Spain or out of it (see fig. 36). Among the pictures of the French
                    school a number of fine landscapes by Claude Lorrain and a very masterly
                    Bacchanalian Scene by Nicolas Poussin are the most notable (see figs. 38 and
                    39). The English school is hardly represented in a manner worthy of the chief
                    national collection, but it is supplemented by a large number of fine paintings
                    in the South Kensington Museum. The chief treasures in this branch possessed by
                    the National Gallery are Hogarth’s series of “Marriage à la Mode,” some noble
                    portraits by Reynolds and Gainsborough, and an unrivalled collection of Turner’s
                    works of all periods (see figs. 40, 41, and 43).</p>
                <p>The royal gallery at Hampton Court (London), among a large number of inferior
                    paintings, contains some of great value, especially the Baptism of Christ, an
                    early work of Francia, a most magnificent portrait of Andrea Odoni by Lor.
                    Lotto, both signed, and a portrait of a youth attributed to Raphael. The chief
                    treasure of the palace is the grand series of decorative paintings (nine in
                    number) executed in tempera on canvas by Andrea Mantegna in 1485-92 for the duke
                    of Mantua, but much injured by repainting. The equally celebrated cartoons
                    designed by Raphael for tapestry to decorate the Sistine Chapel are now moved to
                    the South Kensington Museum. The gallery also possesses several fine examples of
                    Tintoretto, many good Flemish and Dutch pictures, some small but fine examples
                    of Holbein and his school, and a number of historically interesting works by
                    English painters of the 17th century. The portrait of a Jewish Rabbi by
                    Rembrandt is one of his finest works,—a perfect masterpiece of portraiture.</p>
                <p>The Dulwich gallery is especially rich in works of the Dutch school, and contains
                    some noble portraits by Gainsborough and Reynolds, as well as an interesting
                    early work by Raphael, — the <hi rend="italic">predella</hi> with seven small
                    subjects painted in 1504 as part of the large altarpiece for the monastery of St
                    Anthony in Perugia; the main part of this large retable, which is the property
                    of the heirs of the duke of Ripalda, has been for many years deposited but not
                    exhibited in the National Gallery. The National Portrait Gallery<note

                    Bethnal Green.</p></note> at Kensington contains many paintings of different
                    schools which are valuable both as works of art and from their interest as
                    portraits. The Royal Academy has placed in the attics of Burlington House its
                    valuable collection of diploma pictures, and in an adjoining room a few
                    treasures of earlier art, among them a large cartoon of the Madonna and St Anne
                    by Leonardo da Vinci,—similar in subject to, but different in design from, an
                    unfinished picture by him in the Louvre, and a copy of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cenacolo</hi> at Milan by his pupil Marco d’Oggiono, of priceless value now
                    that the original is an utter wreck. In the same room is a very beautiful but un
                    finished piece of sculpture by Michelangelo, a circular relief of the
                    Madonna.</p>
                <p>England is especially rich in collections of drawings by the old masters. The
                    chief are those in the British Museum, in the Taylor Buildings at Oxford, and in
                    the possession of the Queen and of Mr Malcolm of Poltalloch. Among the
                    collection in Windsor Castle are eighty-seven portraits in red chalk by Holbein,
                    all of wonderful beauty. The celebrated “Liber Veritatis,” a collection of
                    original drawings by Claude Lorrain, is in the possession of the duke of
                    Devonshire at Chatsworth. In Buckingham Palace is a fine collection of paintings
                    of the Flemish and Dutch schools. An almost incredibly large number of fine
                    paintings of all schools are scattered throughout the private galleries of
                    Britain; an account of the chief of these is given by Dr Waagen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Treasures of Art in Britain,</hi> London, 1854. But many of the
                    collections described by Dr Waagen have since been moved or dispersed; the Peel
                    and Wynn Ellis pictures have been purchased by the National Gallery, which has
                    also acquired important pictures from the sales of the Eastlake, Barker, Novar,
                    Hamilton, and Blenheim collections. The largest private galleries which still
                    exist in England are those of the duke of Westminster (Grosvenor House), the
                    duke of Sutherland (Stafford House), the earl of Ellesmere (Bridgewater House),
                    and the marquis of Exeter (Burghley House). The public gallery at Liverpool
                    contains some very important Italian pictures, as does also the growing
                    collection in Dublin. The Edinburgh National Gallery possesses a few specimens
                    of early masters, among them part of the great altarpiece by the unknown “Master
                    of Liesborn,” a picture of St Hubert by the “Master of Lyversberg,” some fine
                    Dutch pictures, and Gainsborough’s masterpiece, the portrait of the Hon. Mrs
                    Graham, together with many examples of the excellent portraits by David Allan
                    and Sir Henry Raeburn. In the palace of Holyrood is preserved a very beautiful
                    altarpiece, with portraits of James III. and his queen and other figures. It is
                    supposed to have been painted about 1480 by Van der Goes of the school of the
                    Van Eycks. England is especially rich in the finest examples of Nicolas Poussin
                    and Claude Lorrain; the paintings by the latter in Grosvenor House, the National
                    Gallery, and elsewhere in the country are unrivalled by those of any foreign
                    gallery.</p>
                <p>The Louvre is rich in works of nearly all schools, and especially in fine
                    examples of Signorelli, Mantegna, Raphael, Titian, Paul Veronese, Correggio, and
                    the later Bolognese painters. Its chief glory is the possession of some of the
                    very rare works of Da Vinci,— La Vierge aux Rochers, the Virgin and St Anne, and
                    the wonderful portraits of Mona Lisa and La belle Ferronnière. It is chiefly
                    weak in examples of the earlier Venetian painters, not possessing a single
                    genuine work by Giovanni Bellini. It contains some very beautiful frescos by
                    Botticelli and by Luini, and the finest work of Murillo which exists out of
                    Seville,—the Virgin in Glory. The later Flemish and Dutch schools are well
                    represented: the small painting of the Virgin with a kneeling Worshipper by Jan
                    van Eyck is one of the loveliest pictures in the world; but the Louvre is
                    otherwise deficient in paintings of his school. The portraits by Holbein,
                    Rubens, and Vandyck are of great importance. In the French school the Louvre is
                    of course unrivalled: the paintings of Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain are
                    the best among them; but the general average of merit is very low. The Louvre
                    also possesses a magnificent collection of drawings by the old masters.</p>
                <p>The Berlin gallery, now rapidly being added to, contains a large number of very
                    important Italian pictures; among them is Signorelli’s finest easel picture (see
                    fig. 8),—a classical scene with Pan and other nude figures playing on pipes, a
                    masterpiece of powerful drawing. The gallery is more especially rich in works of
                    the German, Flemish, and Dutch schools, including six panels from the large
                    altarpiece of the Adoration of the Lamb at Ghent by Hubert and Jan van Eyck. The
                    Dresden gallery is mainly rich in paintings of the Flemish and Dutch schools,
                    but also contains some fine Italian pictures. Raphael’s Madonna di San Sisto is
                    the chief glory of the collection, together with many fine examples of
                    Giorgione, Palma Vecchio, Titian, Paul Veronese, and Correggio, and a number of
                    works of the later Bolognese school. The gallery is especially remarkable for
                    its genuine examples of that very rare master Giorgione. The Pinakothek at
                    Munich possesses some good Italian pictures, among them four by Raphael and a
                    number of fine Titians. It contains a large collection of German, Dutch, and
                    Flemish paintings, with a number of fine portraits by Albert Dürer and Vandyck.
                    It is especially rich in works of Lucas Cranach the elder, of Memling, of Roger
                    van der Weyden, of Wohlgemuth, and of Rembrandt.<note anchored="true"

                    paintings. The small Wallraf-Richartz Museum at Cologne contains a few paintings

                <p>The Belvedere Gallery at Vienna is exceptionally rich in works of the Venetian

                    represented, Vienna also contains some large private galleries, chiefly rich in

                    of drawings by old masters. The Budapest gallery (Eszterhazy collection)
                    contains many fine Venetian and some Florentine pictures, with a large number of
                    Flemish and Dutch works.</p>
                <p>The Gallery of the Hermitage at St Petersburg is one of the largest and most
                    important in Europe; though weak in pictures of the early Italian schools, it
                    contains fine examples of Luini, Raphael, Titian, Paul Veronese, and the
                    Bolognese school, and is extraordinarily rich in paintings by Murillo,
                    Rembrandt, Rubens, Vandyck, and the later Flemish and Dutch schools
                    generally.</p>
                <p>The many galleries of Belgium and Holland are mostly rich in the works of local
                    schools. Antwerp possesses the masterpieces of Rubens and many fine examples of
                    his pupil Vandyck. The church of St Bavon at Ghent contains the masterpiece of
                    the Van Eycks, the main part of a large altarpiece in many panels with the
                    Adoration of the Lamb as the central subject; this is only rivalled in point of
                    size and beauty by the Fountain of Salvation painted by Jan van Eyck about 1432,
                    and now in the museum of the Santissima Trinidad at Madrid. Among the many fine
                    Flemish and Dutch pictures in the museum at The Hague is a half-length of an
                    unknown lady by Holbein, which is one of the most beautiful portraits in the
                    world (see fig. 27).</p>
                <p>The gallery of Madrid is in some respects unrivalled both from its widely
                    representative character—at least as regards the later schools—and from the
                    number of exceptional masterpieces which it contains; it possesses, however,
                    very few specimens of Italian art earlier than 1500. In the works of the later
                    Italian masters it is very rich, possessing four important works by Raphael,—the
                    Madonna called La Perla (once at Hampton Court in the collection of Charles I.
                    ), the Virgin of the Fish, the Virgin of the Rose, and Christ on His way to
                    Calvary <hi rend="italic">(Lo Spasimo).</hi> No other gallery contains so many
                    fine specimens of Titian’s paintings; it includes a scene of Bacchus at Naxos,
                    with a nude sleeping figure of Ariadne in the foreground, the companion to the
                    magnificent Ariadne in the English National Gallery, but surpassing it in beauty
                    and perfection of preservation. The third picture of the trio painted for the
                    duke of Ferrara is also at Madrid; it is known as the Sacrifice to Fecundity,
                    and consists of a large group of nude infants sporting or sleeping, a perfect
                    miracle for its wealth of colour and unrivalled flesh painting. In addition to
                    these wonderful pictures there are some splendid portraits by Titian, and many
                    of his later works, showing a sad decadence in his old age. The gallery also
                    contains many important works of Paul Veronese and others of the Venetian
                    school, and a very fine collection of Flemish and Dutch pictures, including a
                    number of noble portraits by Antonio Moro, Rubens, and Vandyck, together with
                    some of Claude Lorrain’s best landscapes. In the Spanish schools the Madrid
                    gallery is unrivalled; it contains a number of poor but interesting paintings by
                    Juan de Juanes, the best collection of the works of Ribera (Spagnoletto), and
                    the chief masterpieces of Velazquez. It is in Madrid alone that the greatness of
                    Velazquez can be fully realized, just as the marvellous talents of Murillo are
                    apparent only in Seville. Among the many wonderful paintings by Velazquez in
                    this gallery the chief are the Crucifixion, the Tapestry Weavers (<hi
                    rend="italic">Las Hilantleras),</hi> the Surrender of Breda <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Las Lanzas),</hi> the Drinking Peasants <hi rend="italic">(Los
                    Borrachos),</hi> the portrait group known as <hi rend="italic">Las Meniñas,</hi>
                    and many magnificent portraits. The gallery also contains a number of Zurbaran’s
                    works, and many by Murillo, none of which are among his finest paintings. The
                    best picture by Murillo at Madrid is the scene of St Elizabeth of Hungary
                    tending the Lepers, preserved in the Academia de San Fernando. Seville alone
                    contains the real masterpieces of Murillo, a very unequal painter, who produced
                    a large number of third-rate works, such as are to be seen in many of the chief
                    galleries of Europe, but who at his best deserves to rank with the greatest
                    painters of the world. It is impossible to describe the wonderful rich tone, the
                    intense pathos, and the touching religious feeling of such pictures as the
                    Crucified Christ embracing St Francis, or the apparition of the Infant Saviour
                    to St Anthony of Padua, in the Seville gallery, and the larger composition of
                    the latter scene in the cathedral. Other very noble works by Murillo exist in
                    the monastic church of La Caridad. The Seville gallery also contains several of
                    Zurbaran’s chief pictures, and some by other painters of the Spanish school. The
                    other chief gallery of Spain, that at Valencia, contains a number of weak but
                    historically interesting pictures of early Spanish artists,—feeble imitations of
                    the style of Francia and other Italian painters. It possesses also many pictures
                    by Ribalta and other later and unimportant masters of the Valencian school.</p>
                <p>The Vatican Gallery, though not large, contains a very large proportion of
                    important pictures, such as a portrait group in fresco by Melozzo da Forli, the
                    unfinished monochromatic painting of St Jerome by Da Vinci, the finest of
                    Raphael’s early works,—the Coronation of the Virgin, the Madonna di Foligno, and
                    the Transfiguration. The Coronation of the Virgin by Pinturicchio is one of his
                    best panel pictures, and a portrait of a Doge by Titian a masterpiece of
                    portraiture. The Last Communion of St Jerome by Domenichino is his finest work.
                    The chapel of San Lorenzo, painted by Fra Angelico (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fiesole),</hi> the Appartamenti Borgia by Pintu ricchio, the stanze by Raphael,
                    and the Sistine Chapel by Michelangelo are described in the articles on these
                    painters. The Capitol contains but few works of much merit; the chief are a very
                    beautiful series of frescos of Apollo and the Muses in separate panels,
                    lifesize, by some painter of the school of Perugino, probably Lo Spagna; they
                    are remarkable for grace of drawing and extreme delicacy of colour. The Rape of
                    Europa, by Paul Veronese, is a fine replica of that in the doge’s palace at
                    Venice. The gallery also contains some of the chief works of Guercino and Guido
                    and a very noble portrait by Velazquez. The Borghese Gallery is perhaps the most
                    important private collection in the world. It is rich in Florentine pictures of
                    the 15th century, and possesses the celebrated Entombment by Raphael. A small
                    panel of St Stephen by Francia (signed) is of unusual beauty and interest,—very
                    highly finished and magnificent in colour; it seems to show the influence of Jan
                    van Eyck; it is one of Francis’s earliest works, and is very far superior to
                    those of his later style. The great glory of the gallery is the (so-called)
                    Sacred and Profane Love by Titian (see fig. 16), one of the most beautiful
                    pictures in the world both for design and colour, and a marvel for its rich warm
                    rendering of flesh; it appears to be a portrait of the same lady repeated
                    twice,—nude and draped. It belongs to a somewhat earlier period than the
                    bacchanal trio in Madrid and London. This gallery contains also one of Vandyck’s
                    finest portraits, that of Catherine de’ Medici, and other excellent portraits of
                    the Venetian school. The Danae by Correggio is an interesting example, very weak
                    in drawing, but remarkable for the fine pearly tones of the flesh. The Corsini
                    Gallery, now the property of the municipality of Rome, contains some good panels
                    by Fra Angelico, but is mainly strong only in the later Bolognese paintings. It
                    also possesses a rich collection of early Italian engravings. The Doria Gallery
                    is large, but contains only a small proportion of valuable pictures. Some
                    paintings by Niccolo Rondinelli are of much interest; they show him to have been
                    an able pupil and close imitator of Giovanni Bellini, to whom many paintings in
                    various galleries are attributed which are really the work of pupils. A
                    beautiful Madonna in the Doria Palace by Rondinelli has a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cartellino</hi> inscribed with Bellini’s name. The chief treasures of this
                    collection are the portraits of two Venetians attributed to Raphael, and that of
                    Pope Innocent X. by Velazquez,—the latter a marvel of dashing and almost too
                    skilful execution. There is also a fine portrait of Andrea Doria by Sebastiano
                    del Piombo, well modelled, but rather wanting in colour. The Sciarra-Colonna
                    Palace contains a few good pictures, among them a very fine portrait of a
                    violin-player by Raphael, and a graceful painting of Modesty and Vanity by
                    Luini, attributed to Da Vinci, as is often the case with Luini’s pictures. The
                    Colonna, Barberini, and other private galleries of Rome contain but little that
                    is noteworthy. The church of S. Maria sopra Minerva contains some splendid
                    frescos by Lippo Lippi; some of Piutu-ricchio’s chief frescos are in the
                    churches of S. Maria del Popolo and S. Maria in Ara Coeli; and the monastery of
                    S. Onofrio possesses a very lovely fresco of the Madonna and a kneeling Donor,
                    attributed to Da Vinci,—probably a pupil’s work.</p>
                <p>The Florentine Accademia delle Belle Arti contains a most valuable collection of
                    early Florentine and other 15th-century pictures, including the finest panel
                    picture by Gentile da Fabriano,—the Adoration of the Magi,—a rare example of
                    Verrocchio, partly painted by his pupil Da Vinci, some magnificent examples of
                    Botticelli, good specimens of Fra Angelico, Ghirlandaio, Signorelli, Lippo
                    Lippi, Fra Bartolomeo, and a group of saints by Andrea del Sarto, one of his
                    best works. The magnificent galleries in the Uffizi and Pitti Palaces contain an
                    unrivalled collection of the great Florentine painters of all dates. In the
                    Uffizi are several fine paintings by Raphael,—the Madonna del Cardellino, a
                    portrait of Julius II., and an exquisitely finished head of an unknown lady.
                    Among the many fine examples by Titian is his portrait of a nude lady reclining
                    (Danae),—a most wonderful work. In the same room (La Tribuna) is the circular
                    panel of the Madonna and St Joseph, an early work by Michelangelo, showing the
                    influence of Signorelli. Many of Botticelli’s finest works are in this gallery,
                    and the Uffizi also possesses an almost unrivalled collection of drawings by
                    Italian painters of all dates. The Pitti Palace contains some of the chief works
                    of Raphael,—the early Madonna del Gran Duca, and portraits of Angelo Doni and
                    his wife, the portraits of Cardinal Bibicna and Leo X. (in his later manner),
                    the Madonna della Seggiola, and the miniature Vision of Ezekiel. The portrait of
                    a nun, attributed to Da Vinci, but probably the work of a pupil, is a work of
                    extraordinary finish and refinement. The Magdalen and the lady’s portrait (La
                    Bella) by Titian are among his best works. Both these collections contain some
                    good Flemish and Dutch pictures. In the church of Santa Croce are the chief
                    works of Giotto, in S. Maria Novella the best pictures of Orcagna and
                    Ghirlandaio, and in the monastery of S. Marco the principal frescos of Fra
                    Angelico. Some of the chief frescos of Spinello Aretino, much repainted, exist
                    in the sacristy of S. Miniato, and the most important frescos of Andrea del
                    Sarto are in the church of S. Annunziata.</p>
                <p>The small galleries at Perugia and Siena are of great interest for their
                    collections of rare works by painters of the local schools. The<pb break="no"

                    also possesses some curious early panels by local painters; in the church of S.
                    Caterina is a magnificent altarpiece by Fran. Traini, Orcagna’s chief pupil. At
                    Prato are the finest frescos of Lippo Lippi. The gallery at Bologna contains
                    some of Francia's chief works, the St Cecilia of Raphael, and a number of
                    examples of the Caracci and others of the later Bolognese school.</p>
                <p>Parma is specially rich in the works of Correggio and Parmigiano; unhappily the
                    great frescos by the former in the cathedral have almost wholly perished. The
                    small collection at Ferrara possesses interesting examples of paintings of the
                    local school. Brescia and Bergamo are very rich in fine works of Moretto and
                    Moroni, and also possess a number of fine Venetian paintings of various dates.
                    Padua has but a small and unimportant gallery, but the town is rich in frescos
                    by Giotto, Altichiero, and Jacopo Avanzi, and most noble frescos by Andrea
                    Mantegna. Mantua also contains some grand frescos by Mantegna in the Castello di
                    Corti, and a large quantity of showy and cleverly executed wall and ceiling
                    paintings by Giulio Romano in the Palazzo del Tè. The Verona gallery contains
                    some few good examples of the local school. The church of S. Zenone possesses a
                    magnificent altarpiece by Mantegna; and in S. Anastasia is the wreck of a fine
                    fresco of St George and the Dragon by Pisanello. The Vicenza collection contains
                    little of value except some good examples of Bart. Montagna. The Turin gallery
                    possesses a few good pictures, especially some fine panels by Botticelli and
                    splendid portraits by Vandyck. Many of Van dyck’s finest works exist in the
                    various palaces of Genoa. The large gallery at Naples contains an unusual
                    proportion of bad pictures; there are, however, some fine works of Titian and
                    some interesting examples of the early Flemish school which have been in Naples
                    ever since the 15th century. The only painting of much importance in the gallery
                    at Palermo is a very beautiful triptych of the school of Van Eyck.</p>
                <p>Venice is extraordinarily rich in the works of its own school, with the exception
                    of those of Crivelli, who is completely absent. The works in Venice of the
                    Bellini family, of Carpaccio and others of Gian. Bellini’s pupils, of Titian,
                    Tintoretto, and Paul Veronese, are among the chief glories of the world. The
                    Grimani breviary, in the doge’s library, contains a very beautiful series of
                    miniature pictures of the school of Mending.</p>
                <p>The Brera Gallery at Milan contains a large number of masterpieces, especially of
                    the Lombard and Venetian schools, among them the chief work of Gentile Bellini,
                    St Mark at Alexandria, some unrivalled portraits by Lorenzo Lotto, and very
                    important examples of Moretto’s religious paintings. One of its greatest
                    treasures is the altarpiece painted for the duke of Montefeltro by Piero della
                    Francesca, and wrongly attributed to his pupil Fra Carnovale. The celebrated
                    Sposalizio is the most important work of Raphael, executed wholly under the
                    influence of Perugino. The gallery is especially rich in works of the pupils and
                    imitators of Leonardo and other Milanese painters. The Biblioteca Ambrogiana
                    contains some priceless drawings by Leonardo da Vinci and a large number of his
                    autograph MSS., selections from which have been published by Dr Richter, London,
                    1883. Another important MS. of Da Vinci from the same library, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Codice Atlantico,</hi> is now (1886) in course of publication in
                    Rome in its entirety.</p>
                <p>This very scanty sketch of the contents of the chief galleries of Europe will
                    give some notion of the places where the works of special schools and masters
                    can best be studied. In some cases there is but little choice: the greatness of
                    Giotto can only be fully realized in Florence and Padua, of Carpaccio and
                    Tintoretto in Venice, of Signorelli at Orvieto and Monte Oliveto, of Fra
                    Angelico in Florence, of Correggio in Parma, of Velazquez in Madrid, and of
                    Murillo in Seville.</p>

                    “Lermolieff,” has developed a somewhat new system of criticism, based on minute
                    observation of the way in which each painter treated details, such as the hand
                    and ear,—in most cases (according to Morelli) a safer guide than the general
                    impression derived from the whole effect or spirit of a picture, and less
                    misleading than a judgment formed from technical peculiarities; the Comm.
                    Morelli, aided by a good knowledge of the documentary history of art, has thus
                    been enabled to give back to their right authors many paintings which for long
