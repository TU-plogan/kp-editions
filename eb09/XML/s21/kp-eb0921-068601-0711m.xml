                <p><label type="entry">SERVIA</label>, a kingdom belonging to the Balkan peninsula
                    of Europe, lying between Bosnia on the west and Bulgaria and Roumania on the
                    east, and between the Turkish province of Albania on the south and the Austrian
                    Military Frontier on the north. From Bosnia it is separated by the Drina, from
                    Austrian and Roumanian territory by the Danube and the Save, and from Bulgaria
                    partly by the Timok. Some parts of the southern frontier are indicated by
                    mountains, but elsewhere there are no natural boundaries. In shape Servia is an
                    irregular trapezium, situated between about 42° 30' and 45° N. lat. and 19° and
                    22° 30' E. long. The area is about 18,760 square miles, and the population
                    (1,667,159 in 1874) was estimated at the end of 1884 to be 1,902,419, thus
                    giving a density of about</p>
                <p>100 to the square mile. This low density, only about one-third of that of the
                    United Kingdom, is explained by the nature of the surface, the inland position,
                    the defective communications with the exterior, and the absence of manufacturing
                    industries.</p>
                <p>The surface is for the most part mountainous or hilly, though there are no
                    well-defined mountain ranges of any extent. The highest summits lie near the
                    middle of the southern frontier, where Mount Kopaonik attains the height of
                    nearly 7000 feet. Towards the Bosnian frontier the mountains are pretty closely
                    massed together, and some of the summits approach 4000 feet; this height is
                    exceeded on the eastern side of the country, where the mountains, forming a
                    continuation of the Carpathians, are in many places more rugged and precipitous
                    than anywhere else in the kingdom. The Rudnik Mountains, which begin immediately
                    to the north of the Servian Morava, have their highest parts in the south and
                    gradually sink towards the north from nearly 3000 to less than 2000 feet. Still
                    lower are the elevations in the provinces in the extreme south acquired in 1878
                    under the treaty of Berlin. As a general rule the Servian highlands consist of
                    detached groups of mountains and conical hills with gentle slopes rising from
                    verdant valleys, and they are mostly covered to the top with forests, chiefly of
                    oak and beech, the higher summits in the south also with conifers. But the
                    plains, though numerous, are of no great extent, and occur chiefly along the
                    banks of the rivers. Apart from frontier rivers, the most important stream is
                    the Morava, which, rising on the western slopes of the Kara Dagh, a little
                    beyond the Servian frontier, enters the country with a north-easterly course
                    near the extreme south-east, and then turns north-north-west and flows almost in
                    a straight line through the heart of the kingdom to the Danube. In the upper
                    part of its course it is known as the Bulgarian Morava, and only after receiving
                    the Servian Morava on the left is it known as the Morava simply or as the Great
                    Morava. The only other important tributary is the Nishava, which it receives
                    from the right at Nish. The valleys of all these rivers, especially those of the
                    Bulgarian and the Great Morava, and of the Nishava, contain considerable areas
                    of level or low-lying country well suited for the growth of corn, and the low
                    grounds along the Save and the Danube from the Drina to the Morava are also well
                    adapted for agriculture, though for the most part devoted only to pasture.
                    Altogether no more than one-sixth of the surface is estimated to be occupied by
                    cultivated fields and vineyards, while one-fifth is estimated to form pasture
                    land and about an equal area woodland. Nearly one-half of the entire area is
                    believed to be unproductive.</p>
                <p>Besides the frontier streams on the north and west, the only river of any
                    importance for navigation is the Morava, which is navigable for steamers of
                    light draught as high as Tiupriia about 60 miles from its mouth, but its valley
                    is important as the main highway of the country, and all the more since the
                    introduction of railways. Railways both to Constantinople and to Salonica are
                    now (1886) in course of construction under a convention concluded with Austria
                    in 1881. The section common to the two systems, that from Belgrade to Nish, 152
                    miles in length, was opened for traffic in September 1884, and the line (76
                    miles) from Nish to Vranja was completed in March 1886, but the connexion with
                    the Turkish railway from Salonica remains to be completed. At present, in
                    consequence of the unsatisfactory communication with the south, only about 7 or
                    8 per cent. of the Servian imports enter by the southern frontier, 85 per cent.
                    coming through Austria-Hungary. In the beginning of 1886 work had been begun on
                    only one-half of the line from Nish to Pirot, on the other system.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0712-0687"/> The geological structure of Servia is varied. In
                    the south and west the sedimentary rocks most largely developed are of ancient,
                    pre-Carboniferous date, interrupted by considerable patches of granite,
                    serpentine, and other crystalline rocks. Beyond this belt there appear in the
                    north-west Mesozoic limestones, such as occupy so extensive an area in the
                    north-west of the Balkan peninsula generally, and the valleys opening in that
                    quarter to the Drina have the same desolate aspect as belongs to these rocks in
                    the rest of that region. In the extreme north-east the crystalline schists of
                    the Carpathians extend to the south side of the Danube, and stretch parallel to
                    the Morava in a band along its right bank. Elsewhere east of the Morava the
                    prevailing rocks belong to the Cretaceous series, which enters Servia from
                    Bulgaria. The heart of the country—the Shumadia, as it is called—is mainly
                    occupied by rocks of Tertiary age, with intervening patches of older strata; and
                    the Rudnik Mountains are traversed by metalliferous veins of syenite. The
                    mineral wealth of Servia is considerable and varied, though far from being
                    adequately developed. Gold, silver, iron, and lead are said to have been worked
                    in the time of the Romans. Heaps of ancient slag from lead mines still exist in
                    the neighbourhood of Belgrade, and other old lead mines occur in the valley of
                    the Toplitza. Gold dust is washed down by heavy rains in the valley of the
                    Timok, where it is gathered by the peasants. In the syenite veins of the Rudnik
                    Mountains ores of lead, zinc, copper, sulphur, and arsenic are present, but are
                    not worked, and from the mines of Krupani in the north-west argentiferous lead,
                    antimony, and other ores have been obtained. The principal mining centre east of
                    the Morava is Maidanpek in the north, where there is a large iron-smelting
                    establishment in the hands of an English company. Coal or lignite is met with in
                    many places, including a number of points on the Servian railway. The largest
                    deposit lies round Tiupriia, and measures about 19 miles in length by 7 1/2 in
                    breadth. All the minerals belong to the state, but permission to work them can
                    be obtained on payment of a moderate royalty.</p>
                <p>The climate of Servia is on the whole mild, though subject to the extremes
                    characteristic of inland Eastern countries. In summer the temperature may rise
                    as high as 106° Fahr., while in winter it often sinks to 13° or even sometimes
                    20° below zero. The high-lying valleys in the south are colder than the rest of
                    the country, not only on account of their greater elevation but also because of
                    their being exposed to the cold winds from the north and north-east.
                    Accordingly, the chief products of the soil are such as thrive under a warm
                    summer and are unaffected by a cold winter. Both maize and wine are grown, but
                    the olive is excluded by the severity of the cold season.</p>
                <p>Maize is the principal object of agriculture, the average annual crop being
                    estimated at upwards of 5,000,000 bushels, wheat coming next with an average
                    crop of less than 4,000,000 bushels. Besides cereals, flax, hemp, and tobacco
                    are grown, but the attempts made to cultivate cotton have proved unsuccessful.
                    The chief wine-growing locality is in the north-east round Negotin. Inefficient
                    as are the implements and backward the methods of agriculture, grain makes up a
                    considerable portion of the exports, owing to the scantiness of the population
                    and the deficiency of other industries, and it is expected that this export will
                    be greatly increased on the completion of the railway system to the southern
                    seaports. The grain chiefly exported is wheat,—maize supplying, as among all the
                    Slavs of the Balkan peninsula, the chief food of the people. Hitherto live-stock
                    has formed the largest item in the exports, sometimes amounting to over
                    one-half. Among these pigs, which are fed in immense numbers on the mast of the
                    forests, take the first place. Of late years their number has greatly declined,
                    largely in consequence of American competition; but relatively to population
                    Servia still maintains a much greater number than any other country of Europe;
                    and the same is true of sheep, which are here relatively more than twice as
                    numerous as in Spain. Cattle also are numerous, but are reared solely as beasts
                    of draught and for export. Bees are very generally kept,— the honey being
                    consumed in the country, the wax exported. The rearing of silkworms is
                    spreading, especially since cocoons and eggs have begun to be exported to Italy.
                    Orchards are very extensive, and all kinds of fruit belonging to central Europe
                    are grown in abundance,—above all, the plum, from which is distilled the
                    favourite national spirit, <hi rend="italic">slivovitza.</hi> The average annual
                    value of the exports is a little over £1 per head of population. After live
                    animals and grain come hides and prunes. Among the imports the chief items are
                    sugar, salt (wholly absent in Servia), cotton goods, and other textiles. Import
                    duties being high, a considerable amount must always be allowed for smuggled
                    goods. Though the great bulk of the imports enter the country by the Austrian
                    frontier, an increasingly large proportion comes originally from beyond
                    Austria-Hungary. Thus in 1879, of the total quantity of imports across the
                    Austrian frontier, 76 per cent. were of Austrian-Hungarian origin, in 1880 73
                    per cent., in 1881 65 per cent., leaving 24, 27, and 35 per cent. respectively
                    for countries beyond. Among the latter Germany comes next after Austria-Hungary
                    and then England. Colonial wares (sugar, coffee, &amp;c.) are now imported
                    cheaper by way of Hamburg than by way of Trieste.</p>
                <p>The natural increase of population in Servia is pretty rapid, the annual
                    birth-rate being among the highest in Europe, while the death-rate, though high,
                    is exceeded in several other countries. During the years 1879-84 the average
                    annual number of births was 76,962, of deaths 47,181, the excess of births over
                    deaths 29,781, which figures compared with a total population intermediate
                    between that at the end of 1874 and that at the end of 1884 give a birth-rate of
                    upwards of 43 per thousand, a death-rate of less than 27 per thousand, and an
                    annual excess of births over deaths of nearly 17 per thousand. The average
                    proportion of male to female births is 106 :100. The people are mainly Serbs,
                    though the proportions have been modified by the increase of territory under the
                    treaty of Berlin. This territory, at one time occupied by Servians, had been to
                    a large extent deserted by them in consequence of the oppressive Turkish yoke,
                    and their place had been taken by Mohammedan Albanians west of the Morava and by
                    Bulgarians in the valley of the Nishava. Most of the Albanians, however, quitted
                    their homes at the time of annexation, and Servians are now returning to their
                    former seats. Previous to the treaty of Berlin the principal element of the
                    population next after the Servians consisted of Roumanians, of whom there were
                    about 130,000. The Servian Church forms a branch of the Oriental Greek Church
                    with a perfectly independent administration. The highest ecclesiastical
                    authority is exercised by the national synod. Elementary education is in a very
                    backward state, but recently a law has been passed to remedy this defect, by
                    making education obligatory on all children between six and thirteen and laying
                    the duty of providing accommodation, books, and teachers upon school districts.
                    At Belgrade there is a high school or university with faculties of philosophy,
                    law, and technics.</p>
                <p>The agricultural population are scattered among a great number of villages, most
                    of which consist of single isolated homesteads. Each homestead is occupied by a
                    group of families connected by blood and acknowledging one head, the <hi
                    rend="italic">stareshina,</hi> who is usually the patriarch of the community,
                    but is often chosen by the rest of the members on account of his prudence and
                    ability. He regulates the work and distributes the proceeds of the labour of the
                    entire homestead, and his ruling is followed without question. The land
                    cultivated by a family or group of families is always their own property. The
                    buildings belonging to the homesteads are enclosed within an immense palisade,
                    inside which a large expanse of fields is mostly planted with plum, damson, and
                    other fruit-trees, surrounding the houses of the occupiers. In the midst of
                    these is the house of the stareshina, which contains the common kitchen, eating
                    hall, and family hall of the entire homestead. In this last all the members
                    assemble in the evening for conversation and amusement, the women spinning,
                    while the children play. The people take delight in listening to the recitation
                    of the poetical rhapsodies in which the Servian literature is remarkably rich.
                    The houses are mostly very small wooden structures, serving for little else but
                    sleeping places. But that of the stareshina is often of brick, and is invariably
                    of better construction than the rest.</p>
                <p>Since 6th March 1882 the government has been a constitutional monarchy. The
                    legislative body is called the <hi rend="italic">Skupshtina,</hi> and in 1884
                    consisted of 178 members, three-fourths of whom are elected by the people, the
                    remainder being nominated by the king. A new skupshtina is elected every three
                    years. For the settlement of special questions of great moment an extraordinary
                    skupshtina or great national assembly is elected, in which there are four times
                    as many members, all elected, as in the ordinary skupshtina. There is also a
                    permanent council of state of 15 members, who have the task of drawing up
                    proposals for legislation, hearing complaints regarding the decisions of
                    ministers, and performing other functions. For administrative purposes the
                    kingdom is divided into twenty-two circles, besides the city of Belgrade. In the
                    budget for 1883- 84 the revenue and expenditure were each estimated at nearly<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n713/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0713-0688"/> £1,500,000, and for 1884-85 at about £1,840,000.
                    The national debt at the end of 1884 was about £7,000,000. An additional debt of
                    about £1,000,000 was contracted during the Servo-Bulgarian war of 1885-86.</p>
                <p>The Servian army is divided into three classes. The first class, embracing men
                    between 25 and 30 years of age, constitutes the standing army, which numbers
                    18,000 on a peace footing and about 100,000 on a war footing. The first two
                    years are served with the colours and the remainder of the term in the reserve.
                    The second class contains men between 30 and 37 who have served in the standing
                    army. The third class, which is only called out in extraordinary emergencies, is
                    composed of men between 37 and 50. The total military strength of Servia for
                    cases of emergency is estimated to be about 210,000 men.</p>
                <p>The capital of Servia is Belgrade, at the junction of the Danube and the Save. It
                    is the only town with more than 15,000 inhabitants. Next in size is Nish, in the
                    territory added by the treaty of Berlin, where the valley of the Nishava opens
                    into that of the Bulgarian Morava. The other chief towns arc Kragushevatz in the
                    centre of the Shumadia, the former capital of the country, Shabatz on the Save,
                    Semendria on the Danube, Krushevatz, Alexinatz (the centre of the flax and hemp
                    growing district), Ushitze, Posharevatz, Vranja, and Leskovatz.</p>

                <p>The original home of the Croats and Serbs, who are identical in race and
                    language, was the country adjoining the Carpathian range. Their speech shows
                    them to belong to the eastern division of the Slavonic family (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Slavs).</hi> The generally accepted derivation of the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrobat, Croat,</hi> is from the original designation of the
                    Carpathians, <hi rend="italic">Chrbet, "</hi> a ridge,” an opinion supported by
                    Schafarik and Professor Ljubic, author of a Croatian history. This view is
                    rejected by Perwolf<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    apparently on insufficient grounds. The last-named connects the word with the
                    same root as that from which “Slav” is derived <hi rend="italic">(slu-ti, klu,
                    kru)</hi> and makes it signify the “vassals,” those who follow a chief. The
                    derivation suggested by Schafarik for “Serb” is the root <hi rend="italic"
                    >su,</hi> “to produce”; thus the name would come to mean the people, just as <hi
                    rend="italic">deutsch</hi> is from <hi rend="italic">diot,</hi> “people.” He
                    considers it to have been the original appellation of all the Slavs. This must
                    be accepted as the best explanation hitherto given, though not altogether
                    satisfactory. We find the name <hi rend="italic">∑tpβoι</hi> in Ptolemy and <hi
                    rend="italic">Sirbi</hi> in Pliny.</p>
                <p>The Serbs and Croats have no history till the year 638 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi>, at which period they left their original settlements and migrated
                    into the ancient Illyricum and part of Moesia. Whether any of this people had
                    previously taken up their abode in the Balkan peninsula is by no means clear,
                    and very different opinions have been held on the subject. The most probable
                    account is that small Slavonic colonies were settled here and there as early as
                    the 2d and 3d centuries, consisting mainly of prisoners taken in war; and we
                    hear of two tribes, the Karpi and the Kostoboki, who are claimed by Schafarik
                    with good reason as Slavs. Jirecek considers that for two hundred years before
                    the Slavs are heard of in history south of the Danube they were scattered as
                    colonists in Moesia, Thrace, Dardania, and Macedonia. Professor Drinoff finds
                    mention of Slavonic colonies in Thrace in the <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium
                    Hierosolymitanum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Itinerarium Antonini</hi>; and, even
                    if we do not give a complete adhesion to his views, there are many names of
                    towns in Procopius (in the first half of the 6th century) which are undoubtedly
                    Slavonic. The traces of the original inhabitants have disappeared, except in so
                    far as the Albanians represent these peoples. It is generally believed that the
                    word <hi rend="italic">meropeh</hi> or <hi rend="italic">neropeh,</hi>
                    signifying a slave, found in the <hi rend="italic">Zakonik</hi> of Dushan,
                    refers to the Noropians, an old Thracian tribe.</p>
                <p>Our authority for the Servian migration in the middle of the 7th century is the
                    emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus. According to the story, five Croatian
                    princes, the brothers Clucas, Lobelus, Cosentzis, Muchlo, and Chrobatus, and two
                    sisters, Tuga and Buga (i.e., Calamity and Prosperity), came at this period from
                    northern or Belo-Chrobatia, as it was called, the original home of the Croats in
                    the Carpathian Mountains. The descendants of their people who remained in the
                    territory are lost among the surrounding population. The services of these
                    Croats were made use of by the emperor Heraclius, and they became a barrier
                    against the Avars, whom they drove out of the country in which they settled. The
                    territory which they occupied was divided by them into eleven <hi rend="italic"
                    >župas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gauen.</hi> The people who inhabited the
                    western portion kept the name of Croat, those in the eastern were called Serbs.
                    We must now leave the Croats, as in this article we have only to do with the
                    Serbs properly so called. The Croatian branch of the family, after being ruled
                    by petty <hi rend="italic">bans</hi> (a word said to be of Avar origin), was
                    annexed to the kingdom of Hungary, and after the 16th century followed the
                    fortunes of the house of Hapsburg.</p>
                <p>For five centuries after their arrival in their new territories we hear nothing
                    of the Serbs save an occasional very brief mention in the Byzantine chroniclers.
                    The native annalists do not begin earlier than the 12th century. As in Croatia
                    so among the Serbs, the smaller župans<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    head župan of Servia, who resided in Desnica, called by Constantine Destinica,
                    was at first the suzerain of all the other Servian zupans, with the exception of
                    the Pagani, concerning whose Latin name the emperor Constantine makes the very
                    strange remark <hi rend="italic">—κa'ι yap Vayavοl κατά την των Σκλάβων yλωσσav
                    άβάπτιστοι ipμη-veoovτaι.</hi> After the land was harried by the Bulgarians we
                    find the great zuρan of Dioclea (Doclea) supreme; he acquired the title of king,
                    and received his insignia from the pope. Finally, Nemanya, the descendant of a
                    župan family of Dioclea, founded a new dynasty in Rasa (mod. Novibazar), and
                    united Servia and Bosnia into one strong empire. The names of the earlier
                    princes, who are insignificant and do not help us to follow the thread of
                    Servian history, need not be mentioned. We find them sometimes tributary to the
                    Greek emperors and sometimes independent. They appear, moreover, to have been
                    engaged in constant wars with the Bulgarians. About 1015 Vladimir was reigning;
                    but he was assassinated by the Bulgarian czar John, who got possession of
                    Servia, but died two years afterwards on an expedition against the Greeks.
                    Together with Bulgaria, Servia fell under the power of the emperor, and its
                    affairs were managed by a Greek governor. Stephen Voyislalf made an insurrection
                    in 1040, expelled the governor, Theophilus Eroticus, and defeated the Greeks in
                    1043. His son and successor, Michael (1050-80), at first lived in peace with the
                    Byzantines, but afterwards entered into diplomatic relations with the West, took
                    the title of king <hi rend="italic">(rex),</hi> and received his insignia from
                    the pope (1078). He conquered Durazzo (Drać) in 1079, and reigned thirty years.
                    His son, Constantine Bodin, subjugated the župans of Bosnia and Rasa. About 1122
                    Ourosh, surnamed Bela, župan of Rasa, ascended the throne. From this time dates
                    the power of Servia. His wife Anna was a German princess. Omitting three
                    insignificant rulers, we come to the famous Stephen Nemanya (1159- 95), whose
                    life has been written by his son Sava. He reigned thirty-six years, and was many
                    times successful against the Greeks, but was not able to take Ragusa. He
                    abandoned the government to his son Stephen in 1195 and became a monk under the
                    name of Simeon, dying in 1200 in the monastery of Chilander on Mount Athos.
                    Stephen was crowned by his youngest brother Sava, first archbishop of the
                    country, with a crown which had been consecrated by the pope; hence his title
                    <hi rend="italic">Prvovyenehani, “</hi> the first-crowned,”—that is to say of
                    the new dynasty, for the 2upans of Dioclea were already kings. He died in 1224
                    and was followed by his sons Radoslaff and Vladislaff in succession. The latter
                    made an offensive and defensive alliance with Ragusa. He employed Germans to
                    work the Servian mines; and we find them repeatedly mentioned in Servian
                    documents under the name of Saxons, especially in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zakonik</hi> of Stephen Dushan. No traces, however, can be found of them at the
                    present day. Vladislaff's court is said to have been very luxurious. He died
                    childless about 1237 and was succeeded by his brother Stephen Urosh, whose
                    territories were devastated in 1241 by the Mongols. He was afterwards driven
                    from his throne by his son Dragutin and died in 1272. The latter, however, stung
                    by conscience, abandoned the crown to his brother Milutin and contented himself
                    with Syrmia, where he died in 1317. The reign of Milutin was chiefly occupied
                    with struggles against the Greeks; he was generally successful in his campaigns.
                    But his domestic life was unhappy: he divorced three wives and caused his only
                    son Stephen to be blinded from suspicion of his treachery. The operation,
                    however, was imperfectly performed, and the youth recovered his sight. In 1314
                    Milutin fought on the side of the emperor Andronicus against the Turks, and in
                    the same year forced the Ragusans to pay him tribute. After his brother
                    Dragutin’s death he seized his hereditary dominions, and recalling his son
                    Stephen, whom he had banished to Constantinople, gave him Dioclea. In 1319 the
                    Hungarians deprived him of Bosnia; two years later he died. His son Stephen was
                    engaged in perpetual wars. In 1330 he defeated the Bulgarians at the brook
                    Kamencha near Velbuzhd, when the Bulgarian czar Michael was slain. It was on
                    this occasion that his son called Stephen Dushan first distinguished himself. In
                    spite of the king’s successes against the Greeks, he was destined to close his
                    reign in the most lamentable manner: he was imprisoned and strangled by order of
                    his own son at Zvechan in 1336. It is from this crime that Dushan gained his
                    surname <hi rend="italic">(dushiti,</hi> “to suffocate”). Concerning this
                    prince, we are told by the ancient chroniclers that he was gigantic in stature
                    and terrible in appearance. He conducted thirteen campaigns against the Greeks.
                    In 1337 he took Strumitza and subjugated all Macedonia and Albania to
                    Thessalonica, Kostur, and Janina, threatened Byzantium, and concluded a peace
                    with the emperor Andronicus,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n714/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0714-0689"/> who was shut up in Thessalonica. He now divided
                    his kingdom into eight districts and arranged everything on the Byzantine model.
                    He conquered the whole of Macedonia, and caused himself to he crowned emperor of
                    Servia, his son Urosh as king (<hi rend="italic">kral</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >rex),</hi> and the archbishop of the country as patriarch. In 1349, at a diet,
                    he published his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Zakonik</hi> or “Book of Laws”
                    (see below). In 1356 he began a new campaign against the Greeks, his object
                    being to seize Constantinople, to place the Greek crown upon his head, and drive
                    the Turks out of Europe; but in the midst of his schemes he died at Deabolis in
                    Albania on 18th December 1356. His son Urosh was then but nineteen years of age,
                    and, being sickly in body and weak in mind, he was unable to struggle against
                    the revolted governors of his provinces, some of whom wished to make themselves
                    independent. He was killed in a conflict with one of them in 1367, who ascended
                    the throne under the name of Vukashin. This monarch was at first successful
                    against the Turks, now already masters of considerable portions of the Byzantine
                    empire; but he lost the decisive battle of Taenarus, and with it his life, in
                    1371. According to the chroniclers, the Serbs were surprised and many slain
                    while sleeping. Many also were drowned in the waters of the Maritza, “and there
                    their bones lay and were never buried.” The fate of Vukashin and of his brother
                    Goiko was uncertain. The empire of Dushan now began to fall to pieces and Servia
                    was again without a ruler. Marco, the son of Vukashin, declared himself the
                    successor of his father; but the line was unpopular with the Serbs, and at a
                    diet at Pec (Ipek) in 1374 they elected a young noble, Lazar Greblianovich, a
                    connexion of the old princely house. He did not, however, take the title of
                    either emperor or king, but only of <hi rend="italic">knez</hi> or prince.
                    Bosnia was separated from Servia and fell under the rule of a noble named
                    Tvertko. Sultan Murad had already conquered the Bulgarian sovereign Shishman and
                    now marched against Servia. On the 15th of June 1389 the Serbs were completely
                    defeated at the battle of Kosovo, the “field of blackbirds.” No event has been
                    so much celebrated in the national songs as this. Many are the lays which tell
                    of the treachery of Vuk Brankovich and the glorious self-immolation of Milosh
                    Obilich, who stabbed the conqueror on the battlefield. The silken shroud,
                    embroidered with gold, with which his wife Militza covered the body of her
                    husband is still preserved in the monastery of Vrdnik in Syrmia, and a tree
                    which she planted is shown to travellers at Župa. According to one account Lazar
                    was killed in the battle; according to others he was taken prisoner and executed
                    before the eyes of the dying Murad. The bones of Lazar now rest at Ravanitza on
                    the Frushka Gora in Syrmia. We hear no more of independent Serb princes; the
                    country was now tributary to Turkey, and its rulers were styled despots.
                    Stephen, the son of Lazar, was confirmed in this title by Bajazid, the successor
                    of Murad. Militza died in a convent in 1406. Stephen died in 1427 childless, and
                    was succeeded by George Brankovich, a man sixty years of age, whose reign was a
                    troubled one. In 1437 he was compelled to fly to Hungary to avoid the wrath of
                    Murad II., and did not recover his territory till Hunyadi and Scanderbeg drove
                    back the Turks in 1444. George fell, in the ninety-first year of his age, in
                    battle with a Hungarian magnate named Michael Szilagyi on 24th December 1457.
                    His youngest son Lazar succeeded him after committing many crimes, but only
                    survived his father five weeks. His widow, Helena Palse-ologus, gave the country
                    to the pope in order to secure his assistance against the Turks. Upon this the
                    sultan ravaged Servia in the most pitiless manner, burnt the churches and
                    monasteries, and carried off 200,000 persons into captivity. Servia became in
                    all respects a Turkish province, although we occasionally find the empty title
                    of “despot” borne by some of the descendants of its princes. Great numbers of
                    the Serbs subsequently migrated to Hungary. In 1689 some thousands under the
                    command of the despot George Brankovich entered the imperial (German) army. In
                    1691 the Servian patriarch, Arsenius Chernoyevich, led about 36,000 families to
                    settle in various parts of Hungary, chiefly in Syrmia and Slavonia. These <hi
                    rend="italic">zadrugas,</hi> as they are called, are not families in our sense
                    of the word, consisting of parents and children, but communities of families
                    according to the custom still found among the Croats of the Military Frontier.
                    The number of the emigrants at that time would probably amount to 400,000 or
                    500,000 persons. Others followed them in 1738 and 1788. These Serbs have kept
                    their religion and language in spite of the desperate efforts of the Government
                    to Magyarize them. The last despot of Servia was George Brankovich, who died in
                    captivity in Austria in 1711.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the splendid victories of Prince Eugene, Austria acquired the
                    greater part of Servia by the treaty of Posharevatz in 1718, but the Turks
                    regained it by the peace of Belgrade in 1739. For upwards of four centuries the
                    Serbs groaned under the Turkish yoke, until, in 1804, unable to endure the
                    oppression of the Turkish <hi rend="italic">dahis,</hi> they broke out into
                    rebellion under George Petrovich, surnamed <hi rend="italic">Tsrni,</hi> or
                    “Black George” (in Turkish <hi rend="italic">Kara).</hi> Kara George was born at
                    Topola (Tapolja) in 1767; at first he merely aimed at conquering the dahis, but
                    afterwards he attempted to drive the Turks out of Servia. This he succeeded in
                    doing after many failures.</p>
                <p>In 1813, however, they reconquered the country, and George with his adherents was
                    compelled to fly to Austria. He returned in 1817, but was treacherously murdered
                    by order of Milosh Obrenovich, who had now become the Servian leader. We have no
                    space here to sketch the struggles of Milosh to secure the independence of
                    Servia. He was himself of peasant origin and in his youth had been a swineherd.
                    The Turks had contrived to kill or drive out of the country all the Servian
                    aristocracy, leaving only peasants to till the ground, feed swine (one of the
                    great industries of the country), and pay the <hi rend="italic">haraeh.</hi>
                    Milosh was declared prince by the national assembly, and in 1830 secured the
                    consent of the Porte to his enjoyment of the title with the succession reserved
                    to his family. Turkey allowed Servia a quasi-independence, but held and
                    garrisoned several fortresses. Milosh had so little forgotten his Turkish
                    training that he made himself obnoxious to his subjects by his despotic acts. He
                    was a man of simple, even coarse habits, as many of the anecdotes told of him
                    testify. He was compelled to abdicate in 1839 in favour of his son Milan, who,
                    however, was of too feeble a constitution to direct the government, and, dying
                    soon afterwards, was succeeded by his younger brother Michael. He also abdicated
                    in 1842 and the Serbs then elected Alexander, the son of Tsrni George, or, to
                    give him his Servian patronymic, Karageorgevich. His rule lasted seventeen
                    years; he was compelled to resign in 1859, and Milosh, now very old, was invited
                    to come from Bucharest. He lived, however, only one year, dying in 1860, and
                    left the throne to his son Michael, then aged forty, who was thus a second time
                    elected prince of Servia. Michael was a man of refinement and had learned much
                    during his exile. The condition of the country improved during his reign, and in
                    1862 he succeeded in getting the Turkish garrisons removed from Belgrade. The
                    Moslem inhabitants have gradually withdrawn from the country, so that they are
                    now represented by a very few families. Of the two mosques still remaining in
                    Belgrade, one is devoted to their use, the other having been turned into a
                    gas-work. While walking in his park, called Koshutniak or Topshidere, near
                    Belgrade, Michael was assassinated by the emissaries of Alexander Karageorgevich
                    on 10th June 1868. He was succeeded by his second cousin, Milan, grandson of
                    Yephrem, a brother of Milosh. Milan was born in 1854; he became prince of Servia
                    in 1872. In 1875 he married a Russian lady, Natalie de Keczko. In 1878 the Serbs
                    declared war against Turkey, but their arms were unsuccessful, and they were
                    only saved by the intervention of Russia. By the treaty of Berlin, July 1878,
                    the country received a large accession of territory, and the prince caused
                    himself to be proclaimed king. Peace continued till the year 1885, and during
                    this period the Serbs seemed to make considerable progress as a nation, in spite
                    of the bitterness of political faction. In 1885, however, Servia made an
                    ill-judged and selfish attack upon Bulgaria, which was ignominiously beaten off.

                <p>Under Servian literature the Dalmatian and Croatian in the limited sense of the
                    term must be included. The latter, however, is somewhat meagre. This literature
                    is divided into three periods—</p>
                <p>(1) from the earliest times to the fall of Servian independence at the battle of
                    Kosovo, 1389; (2) from the rise of the importance of Ragusa in the 15th century
                    till its decay towards the end of the 17th; (3) from the time of Dositei
                    Obradovich to the present day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First Period.—</hi> The earliest composition which has come
                    down to us in the Servian or Illyrian language, to use a term in which we may
                    include the Dalmatian Slavs, who are essentially the same people, is the
                    production of an unknown priest of Dioclea (Doclea), now Duklya, a heap of
                    ruins, but formerly a city of considerable importance on the river Moratza. His
                    title in Latin is “Anonymus Presbyter Diocleus,” or in Slavonic “Pop Dukljanin.”
                    He must have lived about the middle of the 12th century, as the chronicle
                    compiled by him extends to the year 1161. It is a tedious production, and
                    possesses only antiquarian interest; it is printed by Kukuljevic Sakcinski<note

                    Povestnicu Jugoslavensku</hi> (Agram, 1851). The oldest documents of the Servian
                    language in the narrower sense of the term are a letter of Kulin, the ban of
                    Bosnia in 1189, and the letter of Simeon or Stephen Nemanya to the monastery of
                    Chilander on Mount Athos. These productions are simply Palaeoslavonic with a
                    mixture of Serbisms. The history of early Servian literature has been thoroughly
                    investigated by Schafarik in his <hi rend="italic">Serbische Lesekörner</hi>
                    (Pesth, 1853). We have only space to mention the more important productions. (1)
                    The <hi rend="italic">Life of St Simeon</hi> by his son St Sabbas or Sava, the
                    first archbishop of Servia, was written about 1210. The early manuscripts have
                    been lost and the oldest copy known only dates from the 17th century. Besides
                    this work, Sava also compiled a <hi rend="italic">tipik</hi> or collection of
                    statutes for the monastery of Studenitza, of which he was hegoumen or abbot. He
                    was the founder of the celebrated Chilander monastery.</p>
                <p>(2) The <hi rend="italic">History of St Simeon and St Sabbas</hi> by Dometian was
                    βom-piled in 1264, and is preserved in a manuscript of the 14th century.<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0715-0690"/> There is a good edition by Danichich, to whom we
                    are indebted for a valuable lexicon of Old Servian. (3) The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rodosloff</hi> or Lives of Servian kings and archbishops, compiled by
                    Archbishop Daniel (died 1338), contains the lives of Kings Radoslaff,
                    Vladislatf, Urosh, Dragutin, Queen Helena, Milutin, &amp;c. After his death the
                    work was continued by an anonymous writer. The style of these productions is dry
                    and tasteless. They are written in Palaeoslavonic mixed with Serbisms.
                    Hilferding has commented with great severity on their bombastic and panegyrical
                    style,—the most complimentary epithets being applied to many sovereigns whose
                    careers were stained with crimes. (4) The <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Stephen,</hi> surnamed “Dechanski,” from the monastery Dechani which he founded,
                    written by Gregory Tzamblak, hegoumen of the same monastery. (5) In 1359 we have
                    the Code of Laws <hi rend="italic">(Zakonik)</hi> of Stephen Dushan, which has
                    been previously mentioned; it is the earliest specimen of Servian legislation,
                    and has come down in several manuscripts, being first published by Raich in his
                    <hi rend="italic">History</hi> at the close of the 18th century. Since that time
                    other editions have appeared, the two most important being those of Miklosich
                    and Novakovich.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second Period.—</hi> To this epoch, which may be said to
                    commence with the 15th century, belong some of the Servian chronicles, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lyetopis Koprivnichki</hi> and others,—dry and tedious
                    compilations; the 15th century saw also the outburst of the literature of Ragusa
                    (see below). The Servian ballads have obtained a European celebrity, and must
                    have existed from very early times. Nicephorus Gregoras, who in 1325-26 came to
                    Stephen Urosh IV. as ambassador from the Byzantine emperor Andronicus, noticed
                    that some Serbs attached to his suite sang tragic songs celebrating the great
                    exploits of their national heroes. As Μ. Pipin remarks in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Slavonic Literature,</hi> this shows the existence of a national
                    epic among the Serbs before the battle of Kosovo. In the description of an
                    embassy sent from Vienna to Constantinople in 1551 a certain Kuripeshich, by
                    birth a Slovene, speaks of hearing songs sung in honour of Milosh who slew
                    Sultan Murad. The first attempt at collecting them was made by the Franciscan
                    monk Andrew Kačić-Miošić, a Dalmatian, who died in 1785. His work was published
                    at Venice in 1756 under the title of <hi rend="italic">Razgοvοr Ugodni Naroda
                    Slovinskoga</hi> (Recreations of the Slavonic People). Some of the pieces
                    included in this volume were written by Miošič himself, and he made many
                    alterations in the old ones. This, however, was quite in the spirit of the age
                    in which he lived. We find extracts from Servian ballads in some of the
                    Dalmatian poets of the 16th century. In 1794 they were alluded to in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels</hi> of the abbé Fortis, and were finally collected by Vuk
                    Stephanovich Karajich and published at Leipsic in 1824 under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Narodne Srpske Pyesme</hi> (Popular Servian Songs). Some of them
                    were afterwards translated into German by Theresa von Jacob and into English by
                    Bowring and Lord Lytton. The versions of the last two possess but little merit.
                    It would be impossible in a short notice like the present to discuss the
                    contents of these remarkable ballads. To the majority of readers the cycle which
                    treats of Knez Lazar and his fate at the battle of Kosovo will prove the most
                    interesting. Besides historical persons introduced in the ballads, there is the
                    half-mythical hero Marco Kralevich, who, like the Russian Ilya Murometz, has
                    many of the characteristics of a supernatural being. His victories, chiefly over
                    Turks and Magyars, are narrated in the most bombastic phraseology. At last he
                    dies in battle; but the belief prevails that he remains concealed till he shall
                    appear on some future occasion to rescue his people from their oppressors.
                    Almost as mysterious as the hero himself is his horse Sharatz, who was presented
                    to him by a <hi rend="italic">vila,</hi> or fairy. After the death of Vuk
                    Stephanovich (1864) a supplementary volume was published by his widow, which her
                    husband had left prepared for the press <hi rend="italic">Srpske Narodne Pyesme
                    iz Herzegovine</hi> (Popular Servian Songs from Herzegovina, Vienna, 1866). A
                    good collection of songs of the Montenegrins (Tsmogortzi) was edited at Leipsic
                    in 1857 by Milutinovich. There has also appeared a little volume of Servian
                    national songs from Bosnia, collected by Bogolub Petranovich in 1867. Since then
                    volumes of Servian popular poetry by Rayachevich and Ristich have appeared.</p>
                <p>During this period Slavonic literature reached a high pitch of culture in the
                    little city of Ragusa, called in Slavonic Dubrovnik. During the 15th, 16th, and
                    17th centuries this city, now in a state of decav, was a kind of Slavonic
                    Athens. To the influence of Italian literature was added the culture introduced
                    by the crowds of learned Greeks,—Chalcocondylas, Lascaris, and others,—who found
                    refuge within its walls after the fall of Constantinople. Lyrics and the lyric
                    drama seem to have been the general productions of the more noteworthy authors.
                    The influence of Italian is perceptible throughout. The first writer of eminence
                    was Hannibal Lucić, a very popular poet in his day, author of lovesongs, a drama
                    <hi rend="italic">Robinja</hi> (The Female Slave), and translations published
                    first by his son Anthony at Venice in 1556, and reprinted by Dr Gaj at Agram in
                    1847. A very interesting poem by this author is his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eulogy</hi> of the city of Dubrovnik (Ragusa). Another writer of considerable
                    reputation was Nicholas Vetranić-Čavčić (1482-1576), who afterwards became a
                    monk and lived as a hermit on one of the islands on the Dalmatian coast. He has
                    left several plays and, besides translating the <hi rend="italic">Hecuba</hi> of
                    Euripidea, wrote several mysteries, in the style of the religious plays once so
                    popular throughout Europe; of these the <hi rend="italic">Sacrifice of
                    Abraham</hi> is the best. His poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> is
                    remarkable for the warm affection it expresses for the country of his education.
                    Peter Hektorević (1486- 1572) was a rich proprietor of the island of Zara, and
                    is worth mentioning as having shown a taste for the national poetry of his
                    country. He has introduced some songs in his <hi rend="italic">Ribanje i
                    Ribarsko Prigovoranje</hi> (Fishing and a Dialogue of Fishermen). Very
                    celebrated in its time was the <hi rend="italic">Jegjupka</hi> or Gipsy of
                    Andrew Cubranović (1500-1559), who was originally a silversmith. His poem of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gipsy</hi> is said to have been evoked in the following
                    manner. Cubranović was on one occasion following a young lady and urging his
                    suit when she turned round and said scornfully in Italian to her attendant, in
                    the hearing of the poet, “Che vuole da me questo Zingaro? ’’ (“What does this
                    Gipsy want with me ?’’). The despised lover took up the word of reproach and
                    wrote a poem in which he introduced a Gipsy prophesying to a company of ladies
                    their various fortunes and concluding with an expostulation to the hard-hearted
                    beauty for her obduracy. Schafarik speaks of this piece with great enthusiasm
                    and calls it “a truly splendid flower in the garden of the Illyrian Muses.” The
                    Russian critic Pipin supposes, with great probability, that the poem was written
                    as a sort of masquerade for the carnival. It enjoyed considerable popularity and
                    was frequently imitated. A similar story is said to have suggested the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dervise</hi> (Dervish) of Stjepo Gučetić, in which the author
                    represents himself as a Turkish dervish. These two pieces are elegant
                    productions in the Italian manner.</p>
                <p>Nicholas Nalješković (1510-1587) was a native of Ragusa and author of several
                    pastoral plays in the style then so much in vogue throughout Europe. Of the same
                    description are the productions of Marino Držić (1520-1580), of whom his
                    contemporaries praised “i puro, vago, e dolce canto.’’ Mention may also be made
                    of Dinko Ranjina and Mauro Orbini (d. 1614). Another celebrated poet was Dominco
                    Zlatarić (1556-1607), who, besides translating the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Electra</hi> of Sophocles, produced a version of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aminta</hi> of Tasso and has left several minor pieces. The chief of the
                    Ragusan poets, however, was Ivan Gundulić (sometimes called by his Italian name
                    of Gondola). Very few facts are known of his life; but he died in 1658 aged
                    fifty, having discharged several important public offices. His death, says
                    Schafarik, was not too early for his fame but too early for literature and the
                    glory and prosperity of his country. He himself published but little, and many
                    of his writings perished in the earthquake in 1667, after which Ragusa never
                    regained her former prosperity. The so-called Petrarchan school of Illyrian
                    poetry languished after this and wasted its energy on elegant trifles. Dalmatian
                    poets of the 18th and 19th centuries have not made any considerable figure. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> of Gundulić, on which his fame rests, is an epic in
                    twelve books, and was written to celebrate the victory of the Poles under
                    Chodkiewicz over the Turks and Tatars in 1622 at Chocim (Khotin). Schafarik
                    praises Gundulić for the richness of his imagination, the lofty tone of his
                    verse, and its perfectly constructed rhythm. We are willing to allow that <hi
                    rend="italic">Osman</hi> possesses considerable spirit and that the
                    versification is melodious, but on the whole it seems a tedious poem. The short
                    quatrains in which it is written lack the true epic dignity. Leaving the
                    Dalmatians, the only writer worthy of mention among the Serbs is George
                    Brankovich (1645-1711), the last despot, who compiled a <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Servia till the end of the 17th Century,</hi> which has been edited
                    by Chedomil Miyatovich, ambassador from the court of Servia to St James’s
                    (1886). From this period till the close of the 18th century there is no Servian
                    literature: the spirit of the people seems to have been crushed out of them by
                    Austrian persecutors on the one hand and by Turkish on the other. Till the reign
                    of Milosh Obrenovich in the 19th century hardly a Servian printed book was to be
                    seen. The works of Yuri Krizhanich, who, although a Serb, wrote in Russian, are
                    mentioned under <hi rend="smallcaps">Russia</hi> (p. 105).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Third Period (from 1750).—</hi> The spark of nationality was
                    still burning among the Serbs, in spite of their degradation, and men were found
                    to fan it. Such a man was Raich (1720-1801), a thorough patriot He was born in
                    Slavonia, a province of Austria inhabited by Serbs, the son of poor parents, but
                    he had all the enthusiasm for learning that animated the Russian Lomonosoff,
                    whom ho very much resembled. Thus we find him making his way on foot from his
                    native town to Kieff, where he was received into the ecclesiastical seminary and
                    devoted himself to theology. After spending three years at Kieff, he betook
                    himself to Moscow. Meeting, on his return to his native country, with a cold
                    reception from those whom he had expected to foster his studies, he went back to
                    Russia, and while at Kieff resolved to write the history of the Servian nation.
                    Knowing that the Slavonic monasteries in European Turkey contained many
                    unpublished manuscripts (numbers of which have since perished in the wars which
                    have devastated the country or have been destroyed by the Greeks), he visited
                    Constantinople and many other parts of that empire in order to collect
                    materials. On his return to Austria he took up his abode at Neusatz on the
                    Danube (also long the headquarters of Schafarik),<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n716/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0716-0691"/> and worked at his history, which he finished in
                    1768, but it was not published till upwards of twenty years later. In 1772 he
                    became a monk, and he died in 1801. The work of Raich, though interesting as a
                    monument of learned industry, does not now possess much critical value. The
                    style is harsh and a great deal of the ethnology (a science then in its infancy)
                    unsound. Thus, among other strange statements, he holds the Bulgarians on the
                    Volga to have been Slavs. After Raich we come upon two indefatigable Servian
                    workers, Dositei Obradovich (1739-1811) and Vuk Stephanovich (1787-1864). The
                    life of the former has been written by himself. He was a man of varied learning,
                    and his career was marked by many curious adventures. After having visited
                    nearly every part of Europe (including England, where he was received with great
                    hospitality),<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To show
                    the opinion entertained of him in Britain it is only necessary to cite the
                    inscription in a book presented to him by Dr Fordyce, an eminent London
                    physician of the time: “Dositheo Obradovic, Serbiano, viro linguis variis
                    erudito, sanctissimis moribus morato,” &amp;c.</p></note> Obradovich returned to
                    Servia and became tutor to the children of Tsrni George. He was a man sprung
                    from the people, and an indefatigable and successful labourer for national
                    education. The list of his compilations and translations is considerable. Acting
                    on the wise principle that the language <hi rend="italic">as it is spoken</hi>
                    should be cultivated and not a jargon overloaded with archaic and supposed
                    classical forms, he did good by destroying the influence of the Palaeoslavonic
                    among his countrymen. Before his death his services to his country were
                    recognized by his appointment as member of the senate and superintendent of
                    national education. The man, however, who was destined to bring the Servian
                    language into the greatest prominence was Vuk (Wolf) Stephanovich Karajich,
                    whose collection of songs was mentioned above Vuk was an indefatigable scholar
                    and patriot. Till his time the Servian language had been, so far as all
                    foreigners were concerned, simply <hi rend="italic">rudis indigestaque
                    moles.</hi> He wrote a good grammar, which has formed the basis of all published
                    since, and to this Jacob Grimm furnished a preface. To him also we owe a Servian
                    dictionary and a collection of tales and proverbs. His supposed innovations in
                    the Servian language with regard to the rejection of archaisms and the
                    introduction of a new system of orthography raised up a host of enemies against
                    him, so that not only was he forbidden to enter Servia but his books were
                    excluded from the country. He died at the beginning of 1864, but permission to
                    make use of his innovations was not given till four years afterwards.</p>
                <p>A complete enumeration of the Servian and Croatian authors of the 19th century
                    would far exceed the limits of this article. But Matthias Anthony Relković
                    (1732-1798) deserves mention, because he wrote in a dialect but little
                    cultivated, viz., the Slavonian in the restricted sense, as applied to the
                    Austrian province of that name. He published in 1761 a successful satire
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Satir iliti Divi Csovik</hi> (Satire or the Clever
                    Man), at Dresden. A few names, each of which marks a definite feature of the
                    literature, must suffice. Lucian Mushitzki (1777-1851), an archimandrite,
                    afterwards bishop of Carlowitz, was highly esteemed by his countrymen as a poet.
                    His odes are full of patriotic feeling. Yovan Hadchich (1799-1870) wrote under
                    the <hi rend="italic">nom de plume</hi> of Milosh Svetich. For some time he was
                    an authority in Servian literature, but ultimately his influence waned. Simeon
                    Milutinovich, a noted writer, whose life was full of strange adventures,
                    composed an epic poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Serbianka,</hi> which describes
                    the chief incidents of the Servian war in 1812. It was published at Leipsic in
                    1826. We have previously alluded to his collection of Montenegrin songs. He is
                    also the author of a tragedy on Milosh Obilich, who slew Sultan Murad.
                    Milutinovich, who was a Bosnian, died in poverty in 1847. Yovan Popovich
                    (1806-1856), a native of the Banat, was a writer of much industry and merit, and
                    gained a considerable reputation by his plays, the subjects of which were taken
                    from Servian history and were put upon the stage with considerable effect.
                    Without being a great dramatic writer, he had the art of constructing pieces to
                    which people would listen,—something like Sheridan Knowles. To this circle
                    belongs also Yuri Maletich, author of <hi rend="italic">Spomenik Lukianom
                    Mushitzkοm</hi> (A Memorial to Lucian Mushitzki), and also the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apotheosis of Kara George.</hi> In 1847 the well-known journal <hi
                    rend="italic">Glasnik</hi> (The Messenger) was founded, which has continued to
                    the present time and contains many valuable papers on Servian history and
                    literature. Schafarik had previously founded at Neusatz (Novi Sad) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Matitza Srbska,</hi> an excellent society for printing Servian
                    books.</p>
                <p>The Croats have also been active in modern times. The remarkable poem, <hi
                    rend="italic">Death of the Agha Ismail Čengić,</hi> by Ivan Ma2uranic (born in
                    1813), is said to be so popular among the Serbs, as stimulating their hatred of
                    the Turk, that it has been called “The Epos of Hate.” Ismail was the descendant
                    of an old Bosnian family who had turned Mussulmans to keep their estates when
                    the country was first invaded. These renegades, as might be expected, are more
                    fanatical than the Turks themselves. His exploits were chiefly directed against
                    the Uskoks and the Montenegrins. The poem is composed in the same metre as that
                    of the Servian ballads collected by Vuk. It is spirited, but has a savage air
                    about it, engendered by the scenes described, the fierce border wars of long
                    hereditary hatred. The account of the cruelties committed by the Turks while
                    collecting the <hi rend="italic">harach</hi> and the conclusion, where the body
                    of the slain Agha is brought to the hermit, are dramatically conceived.</p>
                <p>The four most celebrated Servo-Croatian poets are Stanko Vraz, Preradović,
                    Yovanovich, and Radichevich. Stanko Vraz (1810- 1851) was by birth a Slovene; he
                    joined, however, the Illyrian movement under Ljudevit Gaj and used the
                    Servo-Croatian language. The attempt of Gaj to form a common literary language
                    under the name of Illyrian by fusing the Servo-Croat and the Slovenish languages
                    was not successful. Perhaps the only result, if it had been persevered in, woιdd
                    have been that the Slovenes would have become completely Germanized, as a
                    pedantic literary language would not have been understood by the peasants.
                    Besides many graceful lyrics, Vraz also published collections of national songs.
                    Some of his shorter pieces are very elegant and have a rich Oriental colouring.
                    Peter Preradović (1818-1872), a native of the Military Frontier and a general in
                    the Austrian army, is the author of many graceful lyrics, widely known
                    throughout all Servian - speaking regions. A complete edition of his works
                    appeared in 1873. Peter Yovanovich (born in 1801) is the author of many popular
                    poems. But no one of the later generation of Servian authors has gained such a
                    reputation as Branko Radichevich, who was born in the Austrian Banat in 1824,
                    and ended his short life at Vienna in 1853. His popularity rests upon the
                    patriotism shown in his writings and their spirited tone. Nor have the
                    Servo-Croats lacked important workers in the fields of history and philology.
                    Among these must be mentioned Dyuro Danichich (1825-1882), who was educated
                    partly at Pesth and partly at Vienna, at the latter university becoming the
                    pupil of Miklosich. He first made himself conspicuous by espousing the cause of
                    Vuk Stephanovich Karajich in the dispute about Servian orthography. Besides
                    contributing valuable papers to the <hi rend="italic">Glasnik,</hi> he was the
                    author of an Old Servian dictionary of great service to students. He edited, as
                    previously mentioned, the memorials of Old Servian literature. At the time of
                    his death he was engaged upon a great Servo-Croatian dictionary, a work which,
                    it is to be hoped, will be continued by some of his pupils. Ljudevit Gaj
                    (1809-1872), who has already been mentioned, was a Croat and laboured to bring
                    about a national unity. His services were invaluable as an editor of the Old
                    Dalmatian classics. Armin Pavić (still living) has written a good history of the
                    Dalmatian drama <hi rend="italic">(Historija Dubrοvacke Drame,</hi> Agram,
                    1871). Stoyan Novakovich (born 1842), at one time minister of public
                    instruction, besides contributing valuable articles in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glasnik,</hi> has published an historical chrestomathy of the Servian language
                    and an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Zakonik</hi> of Stephen Dushan. Another
                    worker in the same field was Chedomil Miyatovich, previously mentioned. One of
                    the most indefatigable and patriotic of modern Croatian scholars is Ivan
                    Kukuljevic Sak-cinski, who has edited, besides many early Croatian and Servian
                    works, an admirable <hi rend="italic">Arkiv za Povestnicu Jugoslavensku</hi>
                    (Collection of Documents for South Slavonic History), of which several volumes
                    have appeared,—a veritable storehouse of Slavonic history, archaeology, and
                    literature. He has found an excellent coadjutor in Dr Francis Rački (born 1829),
                    among whose works may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">Pismo Slovjensko</hi>
                    (Slavonic Writing, Agram, 1861), <hi rend="italic">Odlomci iz Državnoga prava
                    Horvatskoga</hi> (Fragments of Croatian Law, 1861), and many excellent
                    historical articles in the journals <hi rend="italic">Pozor</hi> (The Observer)
                    and <hi rend="italic">Rad</hi> (Labour).</p>
                <p>After Miklosich, the most indefatigable worker in the field of Slavonic
                    literature now living is the Croat Ignaz Yatroslaff Jagić (born 1835), formerly
                    a professor at Berlin, who now occupies the chair of Slavonic philosophy at St
                    Petersburg, in the place of Sreznevski. He has published many valuable works on
                    Slavonic philology, such as (in 1867) a <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Servo-Croatian Literature,</hi> also a reading-book with specimens of early
                    Glagolitic and Cyrillic works <hi rend="italic">(Priměri Starohcrvatskoga
                    Jezika).</hi> He has also edited two of the oldest Slavonic codices, Marianus
                    and Zographensis. Moreover, in 1875 he founded the well-known <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archiv für slavische Philologie,</hi> which he still edits with the
                    co-operation of many Slavists. Sime Ljubić is another worker in the field of
                    Slavonic history and literature. To the excellent literary journals already
                    mentioned may be added the <hi rend="italic">Starina,</hi> published at Agram.
                    Valuable works have been written by Balthasar Bogišvić on the house-communities
                    of the southern Slavs and south Slavonic law generally. His labours have been
                    made use of by Sir Henry Maine. One of the most celebrated of living Servian
                    poets is Matthias Ban, the author of several poems and plays, which have been
                    very favourably received.</p>
                <p>A few words may be added here on Montenegrin history and literature, the details
                    of which are but scanty. On the death of Stephen Dushan, a certain prince Balsha
                    became independent ruler of Zeta. Many fugitives betook themselves to the little
