                <p><label type="entry">SAND-BLAST</label>. The erosive influence of driven sand is
                    turned to useful account for several industrial purposes by means of an
                    apparatus devised, about 1870, by Mr B. C. Tilghman of Philadelphia. Tilgliman’s
                    sand-blast consists of a contrivance for impelling, with graduated degrees of
                    velocity, a jet or column of sand, by means of compressed air or steam, against
                    the object or surface to be acted on. The apparatus is principally adapted for
                    obscuring, engraving, and ornamenting glass, but according to the velocity with
                    which the sand is impelled it may be used to carve deep patterns in granite,
                    marble, and other hard stones, to bite into steel, &amp;c., and even to cut and
                    perforate holes through these and other most refractory materials. Sheets of
                    glass 4 feet wide are obscured at the rate of 3 feet per minute, with a blast of
                    air having a pressure of 1 lb) per inch. With the aid of tough elastic stencils,
                    patterns and letters are engraved on flashed glass, globes for lamps and

                    by means of the blast on 150,000 tombstones of soldiers killed in the American
                    Civil War. Cast-iron letters were fastened by shellac on the marble, the sand
                    was driven by steam pressure of 90 lb, and the stone was cut, in four minutes,
                    to a depth of a quarter of an inch, leaving the letters in relief.</p></note>
                    Driven with moderate velocity against a metal surface, the sand produces by its
                    impact a fine uniform pitted appearance without removing the metal; and in this
                    way it is used for “frosting” plated goods. A strong blast is largely used for
                    sharpening files, which, as they leave the cutter, have always a slight backward
                    curve or “burr” on their cutting edges which blunts their biting effect. By
                    directing a blast of very fine sand, mixed with water into a thin mud, with
                    steam pressure of 70 ft), at an angle against the back of the teeth, this burr
                    is ground off, the shape of the teeth is improved, and the file is rendered very
                    keen. While the use of steam for impelling the sand-blast is most simple and
                    economical, many practical difficulties have hitherto been found in the way of
                    its employment, and consequently for obtaining high pressure of air costly
                    apparatus was required, thus limiting the applications of the agency. In 1884 Mr
                    Mathewson patented an apparatus in which, by an ingenious exhaust arrangement,
                    the impelling steam is swept away, leaving only cool, dry sand to strike against
                    the object acted on; and the success of this device has already opened up a
                    wider field for the employment of the sand-blast.</p>
