                    forms a part of the Nagar division, and is situated between 13° 30' and 14° 38'
                    N. lat. and between 74° 44' and 76° 5' E. long. It has an area of 3797 square
                    miles, and is bounded on the N. and W. by the Bombay districts of Dhárwár and N.
                    Kánara, and E. and S. by the districts of Chitaldroog and Kadur. Its river
                    system is twofold; in the east the Tungra, Bhadra, and Varada unite to form the
                    Tungabhadra, which ultimately falls into the Kistna and so into the Bay of
                    Bengal, while in the west a few minor streams flow to the Shirávati, which near
                    the north-western frontier bursts through the Western GhAts by the celebrated
                    Falls of Gersoppa, said to be the grandest cataract in India. Flowing over a
                    rocky bed 250 yards wide, the river here throws itself in four distinct falls
                    down a tremendous chasm 960 feet deep.</p>
                <p>The western half of the district is very mountainous and covered with magnificent
                    forest, and is known as the Malnád or hill country, some of the peaks being 4000
                    feet above sea-level. The general elevation of Shimoga is about 2000 feet; and
                    towards the east it opens out into the Maidán or plain country, which forms part
                    of the general plateau of Mysore; The Malnád region is very picturesque, its
                    scenery abounding with every charm of tropical forests and mountain wilds; on
                    the other hand the features of the Maidán country are for the most part
                    comparatively tame. The mineral products of the district include iron-ore aud
                    laterite. On the summits of the Ghats stones possessing magnetic qualities are
                    occasionally found. The soil is loose and sandy in the valleys of the Malnád,
                    and in the north-east the black cotton soil prevails. Bison are common in the
                    <hi rend="italic">talúk</hi> of Sagar, where also wild elephants are
                    occasionally seen; λvhile tigers, leopards, bears, wild hogs, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sámbhar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">chitál</hi> deer, and jungle sheep are
                    numerous in the wooded tracts of the west. Shimoga presents much variety of
                    climate. The south-west monsoon is felt in full force for about 25 miles from
                    the Ghats, bringing an annual rainfall of more than 150 inches, but the rainfall
                    gradually diminishes to 31 inches at Shimoga station and to 25 inches or less at
                    Chennagiri. There is no railroad in the district, but it contains 225 miles of
                    roads.</p>
                <p>The population in 1881 was 499,728 (males 259,296, females 240,432); Hindus
                    numbered 470,678, Mohammedans 27,574, and Christians 1476. The only place with
                    more than 10,000 inhabitants is Shimoga town, the capital and headquarters,
                    which is situated on the Tunga river, with a population of 12,040. Rice<pb

                    in importance is sugar-cane; areca-nuts are also extensively grown; and
                    miscellaneous crops include oil-seeds, vegetables, fruits, pepper, and
                    cardamoms. Of the total area of 3797 square miles only 699 are returned as
                    cultivated and 702 as cultivable. The chief manufactures are coarse cotton
                    cloths, rough country blankets or <hi rend="italic">kamblis,</hi> iron
                    implements, brass and copper wares, pottery, and jaggery. The district is also
                    noted for its beautiful sandal-wood carving.</p>
                <p>During the Mohammedan usurpation of Mysore from 1761 to 1799, unceasing warfare
                    kept the whole country in constant turmoil. After the restoration of the Hindu
                    dynasty Shimoga district repeatedly became the scene of disturbances caused by
                    the maladministration of the Deshasta Bráhmans, who had seized upon every office
                    and made themselves thoroughly obnoxious. These disturbances culminated in the
                    insurrection of 1830, which led to the direct assumption of the entire state by
                    the British.</p>
