                <p><label type="entry">ST PETERSBURG</label>, capital of the Russian empire, is
                    situated in a thinly-peopled region at the head of the Gulf of Finland, at the
                    mouth of the Neva, in 59° 56' N. lat. and 30° 40' E. long., 400 miles from
                    Moscow, 696 from Warsaw, 1138 from Odessa, and 1338 from Astrakhan. The city
                    covers an area of 21,195 acres, of which 12,820</p>
                <p>belong to the delta proper of the Neva; 1330 acres are under water. The Neva,
                    which leaves Lake Ladoga at its south-west angle, flows in a wide and deep
                    stream for 36 miles south-west and north-west, describing a curve to the south.
                    Before entering the Gulf of Finland, it takes for 2½ miles a northerly
                    direction; then it suddenly turns and flows south-west and west, forming a
                    peninsula on which the main part of St Petersburg stands, itself subdividing
                    into several branches. It discharges a body of remarkably pure water at the rate
                    of 1,750,000 cubic feet per second, by a channel from 400 to 650 yards in width,
                    and so deep (maximum depth, 59 feet) that large vessels approach its banks. The
                    chief branch is the Great Neva, which flows south-west with a width of from 400
                    to 700 yards and a maximum depth of 49 feet (discharge, 1,267,000 cubic feet per
                    second). The other branches are the Little Neva, which along with the Great Neva
                    forms Vasilyevskiy</p>
                <p>(Basil’s) Island, and the Great Nevka, which with the Little Neva forms
                    Peterburgskiy Island and sends out three other branches, the Little Nevka, the
                    Middle Nevka, and the narrow’ Karpovka, enclosing the islands Elaghin,
                    Krestovskiy, Kamennyi, and Aptekarskiy (Apothecaries’ Island). Smaller branches
                    of the Great and the Little Nevas form the islands Petrovskiy, Goloday, and
                    numerous smaller ones; while a broader navigable channel forms the Gutueff and
                    several islands of less size in the south-west. Two narrow canalized channels or
                    rivers—the Moika and the Fontanka—as also the Catherine, Ligovskiy, and Obvodnyi
                    Canals (the last with basins for receiving the surplus of water during
                    inundations), intersect the mainland. All the islands of alluvial origin are
                    very low, their highest points rising only 10 or 11 feet above the average level
                    of the water. Their areas are rapidly increasing (572 acres having been added
                    between 1718 and 1864), and the wide banks which continue them towards the sea
                    are gradually disappearing. The mainland is not much higher than the islands. At
                    a height of from 7 to 20 feet (seldom so much as 29) the low marsh land
                    stretches back to the hills of the Forestry Institute (45 to 70 feet) on the
                    right and to the Pulkova and Tsarskoye Selo hills on the left. The river level
                    being subject to wide oscillations and rising several feet during westerly
                    gales, extensive portions of the islands, as also of the mainland, are flooded
                    every winter; water in the streets of Vasilyevskiy Island is a common
                    occurrence. In 1777, when the Neva rose 10·7 feet, and in 1824, when it rose
                    13·8 feet, nearly the whole of the city was inundated. But, owing to the
                    construction of canals to receive a large amount of surplus water, and still
                    more to the secular rising of the sea-coast, no similar occurrence has since
                    been witnessed.</p>
                <p>Broad sandbanks at the mouth of the river, leaving but a narrow channel 7 to 20
                    feet deep, prevent the entrance of larger ships; their cargoes are discharged at
                    Cronstadt<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n210/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0210-0191"/> and brought to St Petersburg in smaller vessels.
                    A ship canal, completed in 1885 at a cost of 10,265,400 roubles
                    (&lt;£1,026,500), is intended to make the capital a seaport. Beginning at
                    Cronstadt, it terminates at Gutueff Island in a harbour capable of accommodating
                    fifty sea-going ships at a time. It is 22 feet deep, 17½ miles in length, and
                    from 70 to 120 yards broad at the bottom, and is protected by huge submarine
                    dams.</p>
                <p>Communication between the banks of the Neva is maintained by only two permanent
                    bridges,—the Nicholas and the Alexander or Liteinyi, the latter 467 yards long;
                    both are fine specimens of architecture. Two other bridges— the Palace and the
                    Troitskiy (720 yards)—across the Great Neva connect the left bank of the
                    mainland with Vasilyevskiy Island and the fortress of St Peter and St Paul; but,
                    being built on boats, they are removed during the autumn and spring, and
                    intercourse with the islands then becomes very difficult. Several wooden or
                    floating bridges connect the islands, while a number of stone bridges span the
                    smaller channels; their aggregate number is ninety. In winter, when the Neva is
                    covered with ice 2 to 3 feet thick, temporary roadways for carriages and
                    pedestrians are made, and artificially lighted. Numerous boats also maintain
                    communication, and small steamers ply in summer between the more distant parts
                    of the capital. A network of tramways (about 80 miles) intersects the city in
                    all directions, reaching also the remoter islands and suburbs, and carrying
                    about 45,000,000 passengers yearly. Omnibuses and public sledges maintain the
                    traffic in winter. In 1882 hackney carriages numbered 7930 in summer and rose to
                    14,780 in winter, when thousands of peasants come in from the neighbouring
                    villages with their small Finnish horses and plain sledges.</p>
                <p>The Neva continues frozen for an average of 147 days in the year (25th November
                    to 21st April). It is unnavigable, however, for some time longer on account of
                    the ice from Lake Ladoga, which is sometimes driven by easterly winds into the
                    Neva during several days at the end of April or in the beginning of May. The
                    climate of St Petersburg is very changeable and unhealthy. Frosts are made much
                    more trying by the wind which accompanies them; and westerly gales in winter
                    bring with them oceanic moisture and warmth, and so melt the snow before and
                    after hard frosts. The summer is hot, but short, lasting hardly more than five
                    or six weeks; a hot day, however, is often followed by cold weather: changes of
                    temperature amounting to 35° Fahr. within twenty-four hours are not uncommon. In
                    autumn a cold dampness continues for several weeks, and in spring cold and wet
                    weather alternates with a few warm days. The following figures will give a more
                    complete idea of the climate :—</p>

                <p>The bulk of St Petersburg is situated on the mainland, on the left bank of the
                    Neva, including the best and busiest streets, the richest shops, the great
                    bazaars and markets, the palaces, cathedrals, and theatres, as well as all the
                    railway stations, except that of the Finland Railway. From the Liteinyi bridge
                    to that of Nicholas I. a granite embankment runs along the left bank of the
                    Neva, bordered by palaces and large private houses. About midway, behind a range
                    of fine houses, stands the admiralty, the very centre of the capital. Formerly a
                    wharf, on which Peter I. caused his first Baltic ship to be built in 1706, it is
                    now the seat of the ministry of marine and of the hydrographical department, the
                    new admiralty standing farther down the Neva on the same bank. A broad square,
                    now partly a garden, surrounds the admiralty on the west, south, and east. To
                    the west, opposite the senate, stands the fine memorial to Peter I., erected in
                    1782, and now backed by the cathedral of St Isaac. A bronze statue, a
                    masterpiece by Falconet, represents the founder of the city on horseback, at
                    full gallop, ascending a rock and pointing to the Neva; the pedestal is a huge
                    granite monolith, 44 feet long, 22 wide, and 27 high, brought from Lakhta, a
                    village on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. To the south of the admiralty are
                    several buildings of the ministry of war and to the east the Winter Palace, the
                    work of Rastrelli (1764), a fine building of mixed style; but its admirable
                    proportions hide its huge dimensions. It communicates by a gallery with the
                    Hermitage Fine Arts Gallery. A broad semicircular square, adorned by the
                    Alexander I. column, separates the palace from the general staff and foreign
                    ministry buildings; the column, the work of Montferrant, is a red granite
                    monolith, 84 feet high, supported by a huge pedestal. Being of Finnish <hi
                    rend="italic">rappa-kivi</hi> (from Piterlaks), it disintegrates rapidly, and
                    has had to be bound with massive iron rings concealed by painting. The range of
                    palaces and private houses facing the embankment above the admiralty is
                    interrupted by the large macadamized “Field of Mars,” formerly a marsh, but
                    transformed at incredible expense into a parade-ground, and the Lyetniy Sad
                    (summer-garden) of Peter I. The Neva embankment is continued to the west to a
                    little below the Nicholas bridge under the name of “English embankment,” and
                    farther down by the new admiralty buildings.</p>
                <p>The topography of St Petersburg is very simple. Three long streets, the main
                    arteries of the capital, radiate from the admiralty, —the Prospekt Nevskiy (Neva
                    Prospect), the Gorokhovaya (Peas’ Street), and the Prospekt Voznesenskiy
                    (Ascension Prospect). Three girdles of canals, roughly speaking concentric,
                    cross these three streets,—the Moika, the Catherine, and the Fontanka; to these
                    a number of streets run parallel,—the Great and the Little Morskaya, the
                    Kazanskaya, the Sadovaya (Garden Street), and the Liteinaya, continued west by
                    Prospekts Zagorodnyi and Rizhskiy (Riga). The Prospekt Nevskiy is a very broad
                    street running straight east-south-east for 3200 yards from the admiralty to the
                    Moscow railway station, and thence 1650 yards farther, bending a little to the
                    south, to the Smolnyi convent, again reaching the Neva at Kalashnikoff harbour.
                    The part first mentioned owes its picturesque aspect to its width, its rich
                    shops, and still more its animation. But the houses which border it
                    architecturally leave very much to be desired. And neither the cathedral of the
                    Virgin of Kazan (an ugly imitation on a small scale of St Peter’s in Rome), nor
                    the still uglier Gostinyi Dvor (a two-storied quadrilateral building filled with
                    second-rate shops), nor the Anitchkoff Palace (which looks like immense
                    barracks), nor even the Catholic and Dutch churches do anything to embellish it.
                    About midway between the public library and the Anitchkoff Palace an elegant
                    square conceals the old-fashioned Alexandra theatre; a profusely adorned
                    memorial to Catherine II. does not beautify it much. The Gorokhovaya is a narrow
                    and badly paved street between gloomy houses occupied mostly by artisans. The
                    Voznesenskiy, on the contrary, though as narrow as the last, has better houses.
                    In its north part it passes into a series of large squares connected with that
                    on which the monument of Peter I. stands, One of them is occupied by the
                    cathedral of St Isaac (of Dalmatia) and another by the memorial to Nicholas I.,
                    the gorgeousness and bad taste of which strangely contrast with the simplicity
                    and significance of that of Peter I. The general aspect of the cathedral is
                    undoubtedly imposing both without and within; its red granite colonnades are not
                    devoid of a certain grandiose character; but on the whole this architectural
                    monument, built between 1818 and 1858 according to a plan of Montferrant, under
                    the personal direction of Nicholas I., does not correspond either with its
                    costliness (23,000,000 roubles) or with the efforts put forth in its decoration
                    by the best Russian artists. The pictures of Brüloff, Bruni, and many others
                    which cover its walls are deteriorating rapidly and their place is being taken
                    by mosaics. The entire building, notwithstanding its vast foundations and
                    pile-work, is subsiding unequally in the marshy ground, and the walls threaten
                    soon to give way.</p>
                <p>The eastern extremity of Vasilyevskiy Island is the centre of commercial
                    activity; the stock exchange is situated there as well as the quays and
                    storehouses. The remainder of the island is occupied chiefly by scientific and
                    educational institutions,—the academy of science, with a small observatory
                    (where some astronomical observations are carried on, notwithstanding the

                    Peterburgskiy Island contains the fortress of St Peter and St Paul, opposite the
                    Winter Palace, separated by a channel from its “kronverk,” the glacis of which
                    is used as a park. The fortress is now merely a state prison. A cathedral which
                    stands within the fortress is the burial-place of the emperors and the imperial
                    family. The mint is also situated within the fortress. The remainder of the
                    island is meanly built, and is the refuge of the poorer officials (<hi
                    rend="italic">tchinovniks)</hi> and of the intellectual proletariat. Its
                    northern part, separated from the main island by a narrow channel, bears the
                    name of Apothecaries’ Island, and is occupied by a botanical garden of great
                    scientific value and several fine private gardens and parks. Krestovskiy,
                    Elaghin, and Kamennyi Islands, as also the opposite right bank of the Great
                    Nevka (Staraya and Novaya Derevnya), are occupied by public gardens and parks
                    and by summer houses <hi rend="italic">(datchis).</hi> Owing to the heat and

                    railway stations of the principal railways, especially that of Finland. The
                    mainland on the right bank of the Neva above its delta is known as Vyborgskaya
                    Storona (Viborg Side), and is connected with the main city by the Liteinyi
                    bridge, closely adjoining which are the buildings of the military academy of
                    medicine and spacious hospitals. The small streets (many of them unpaved), with
                    numerous wooden houses, are inhabited by students and workmen; farther north are
                    great textile and iron factories. Vast orchards and the yards of the artillery
                    laboratory stretch north-eastwards, while the railway and the highroad to
                    Finland, running north, lead to the park of the Forestry Institute. The two
                    villages of Okhta, on the right bank, arc suburbs; higher up, on the left bank,
                    are several factories (Alexandrovsk) which formerly belonged to the crown, where
                    playing-cards, cottons, glass, china, ironware, and so on are made. The true
                    boundary of St Petersburg on the south is the obvodnyi Canal; but wide tracts
                    covered with orchards, cemeteries, and factories, or even unoccupied spaces, are
                    included in the city in that direction, though they are being rapidly covered
                    with buildings.</p>
                <p>Of the 21,195 acres covered by St Petersburg 1160 remain unoccupied. The gardens
                    and parks, public and private, take up 798 acres, to which must be added
                    Aptekarskiv, Petrovskiy, Elaghin, and Krestovskiy Islands, which are almost
                    quite covered with parks. Nearly 30 per cent. of the total area of the most
                    densely populated parts are squares and streets, the aggregate length of the
                    latter being 283 miles. More than half of them are lighted by gas, the remainder
                    with kerosene. Except in a few principal streets, which are paved with wood or
                    asphalt, the pavement is usually of granite boulders, and is bad and very
                    difficult to keep in order. Many streets and embankments in the suburbs are
                    unpaved. Nearly all the more populous parts have water led into the houses (4733
                    houses in 1883), and the same begins to extend also to the right bank of the
                    Neva. In 1883 7,091,500,000 gallons of water, mostly from the Neva, very pure on

                    were supplied by seventeen steam-engines to the left-bank portion of the city
                    (9423 gallons per inhabitant). The number of houses in 1881 was 22,229 inhabited
                    and 16,983 uninhabited. Of the former 18,816 belonged to private persons and
                    3148 to societies or the crown. The houses are mostly very large: of the private
                    houses no fewer than 169 had from 400 to 2000 inhabitants each; the contrary
                    holds good of the out-lying parts, where 2005 houses had fewer than 20
                    inhabitants each.</p>
                <p>On 27th December 1881 the population of St Petersburg was 861,303, exclusive of
                    the suburbs, and 929,100 including them, thus showing an increase of 29 per
                    cent. since 1869. The census of 1881 having been made with great accuracy, the
                    following interesting results may be relied upon.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The mortality at St Petersburg being very high (34·2 in 1883, from 297 to 38·6 in
                    1868-82), and the number of births only 31·1 per 1000, the deaths are in excess
                    of the births by 2500 to 3000 in average years; in 1883 there were 26,320 births
                    (1151 still-born) and 30,150 deaths. It must not be inferred, however, from
                    these figures that the population of St Petersburg would die out if not
                    recruited from without. The larger number of the workmen who come every year to
                    the capital leave their families in the provinces, and the births which occur do
                    not appear among the births of the capital, while the deaths very often do. The
                    chief mortality is due to chest diseases, which prove fatal on the average to
                    9000 persons annually; diseases of the digestive organs also prevail largely;
                    European and perhaps also Asiatic cholera is almost endemic, an average of 3700
                    deaths annually being due to this cause. Infectious diseases such as typhus
                    (from 4280 to 5100 deaths during the last few years), diphtheria, and scarlet
                    fever (3500 deaths) are common. Owing to a notable increase of these three
                    infectious diseases the mortality figures for the last few years are above the
                    average. Of 28,212 deaths nearly two-fifths (12,369) were among children under
                    five. Another critical age seems to be that between 21 and 25. The number of
                    marriages in 1883 was 6183 (only 7·1 per 1000 inhabitants); out of a total of
                    26,320 births 7977 (30 per cent.) were illegitimate; and no fewer than 31 per
                    cent. of all children, both legitimate and illegitimate, born at St Petersburg
                    are nursed in the foundlings’ home, which sends most of them to be brought up in
                    villages. More than 100,000 persons enter the public hospitals annually.<note

                    of the churches, which are far less numerous than in Moscow.</p>
                <p>St Petersburg is well provided with scientific and educational institutions, as
                    also with libraries and museums. The intellectual life of the educated classes
                    is vigorous, and, although 36 per cent. of the population above six years old
                    are unable to read, the workmen must be counted among the most intelligent
                    classes in Russia. Notwithstanding the hardships and prosecutions it is
                    periodically subjected to, the university exercises a pronounced influence on
                    the life of St Petersburg. In 1882 it had eighty professors and 2165 students
                    (968 in physics and mathematics, 776 in law). The medical faculty forms a
                    separate academy, under military jurisdiction, with about 1500 students. There
                    are, moreover, a philological institute, a technological institute, a forestry
                    academy, an engineering academy, two theological academies (Greek and Roman
                    Catholic), an academy of arts, five military academies, a high school of law and
                    a lyceum. Higher instruction for women is represented by a medical academy (now
                    ordered to be closed), by a free university with 914 students in 1882, the
                    standards of instruction and examination in both being equal to those of the
                    other universities, and by higher pedagogical courses. For secondary education
                    there are twelve classical gymnasia for boys and nine for girls, with four
                    private gymnasia and three progymnasia, eight “real schools,” five seminaries
                    for teachers, ten military schools, three German gymnasia, and five other
                    schools. For primary education there are 156 municipality schools (7225 scholars
                    in 1883), 16 schools of the <hi rend="italic">zemstvo,</hi> and about 450 others
                    maintained either by public institutions or by private persons; 19,400 boys and
                    girls received instruction in 431 public schools in 1884, the aggregate cost
                    being £24,765; about 70 institutions for receiving the younger children of the
                    poorer classes and several private “kindergartens” must be added to the above.
                    The scientific institutions are numerous. The academy of sciences, opened in
                    1726, has rendered immense service in the exploration of Russia.<note

                    every year publications of the highest scientific value. The Society of
                    Naturalists and the Physical and Chemical Society, though less than twenty years
                    old, have already issued most valuable publications, which are not so well known
                    abroad as they deserve to be. The still more recently founded geological
                    committee is ably pushing forward the geological survey of the country; the
                    Mineralogical Society was founded in 1817. The Geographical Society, with four
                    sections (923 members) and branch societies for West and East Siberia, Caucasus,
                    Orenburg, the north-western and south-western provinces of European Russia, all
                    liberally aided by the state, is well known for its valuable work, as is also
                    the Entomological Society. There are four medical societies, and an
                    Archaeological Society (since 1846), an Historical Society, an Economical
                    Society (120 years old), Gardening, Forestry, Technical, Navigation Societies,
                    and others, as also several scientific committees appointed at the ministries.
                    The scientific work of the hydrographical department and of the general staff is
                    well known. On the whole, there is access to all these societies, as well as to
                    their museums and libraries. At St Petersburg classical music always finds
                    first-rate performers and attentive hearers. The conservatory of music gives a
                    superior musical instruction. The Musical Society is also worthy of notice. Art,
                    on the other hand, has not freed itself from the old scholastic methods at the
                    academy. Several independent artistic societies seek to remedy this drawback,
                    and are the true cradle of the Russian <hi rend="italic">genre</hi>
                    painters.</p>
                <p>The imperial public library, open free for 347 days in the year, though far
                    behind the British Museum and the Bibliothèque Nationale in the number of
                    volumes, nevertheless contains rich collections of books and MSS. Its first
                    nucleus was the library of the Polish republic seized in 1795 (262,640 volumes
                    and 24,574 prints), collected mostly by Archbishop Zalusski of Kieff. It has
                    been much enriched since then by purchases and donations, and now (1886)
                    contains more than 1,000,000 volumes, a remarkable collection of 50,000
                    “Rossica” (everything published in Russia), and 40,000 MSS., some of which are
                    very valuable and unique. The library of the academy of sciences, also open
                    every day, contains more than 500,000 volumes, 13,000 MSS., rich collections of
                    works on oriental languages, and valuable collections of periodical publications
                    from scientific societies throughout the world. The library of the council of
                    state is also open to the public; while several libraries of scientific
                    societies and departments of the ministries, very rich in their special
                    branches, are easily accessible. Those of the hydrographical department, the
                    academy of art, the musical conservatory, the university (150,000 vols.), are
                    especially valuable to the student. Nearly thirty private circulating libraries,
                    which have to contend with many restrictions, supply the students for a small
                    fee with everything printed in Russia, if not prohibited by Government. The
                    museums of the Russian capital have a marked place among those of Europe. That
                    of the academy of science, with more than 100,000 systematically classified
                    natural history specimens; that of the Mineralogical Society, giving a full
                    picture of the geology of Russia; the Asiatic museum, with its rich collections
                    of Asiatic MSS. and coins; and several others are of great scientific value. The
                    Hermitage Art Gallery contains a first-rate collection of the Flemish school,
                    some pictures of the Russian school (the remainder being at the academy of
                    arts), some good specimens of the<pb break="no"

                    especially invaluable treasures of Greek and Scythian antiquities, as also a
                    good collection of 200,000 engravings. The old Christian and old Russian arts
                    are well represented at the museum of the academy of arts. Besides these there
                    are many other museums—pedagogical, medical, engineering, agricultural,
                    forestry, marine, technical.</p>
                <p>The press is represented by about 120 periodicals, including those of the
                    scientific societies; the right of publishing political papers is a monopoly in
                    the hands of the very few editors who are able to procure the necessary
                    authorization. The publication of literary and scientific works, after having
                    developed rapidly in 1859-69, is now greatly on the decrease owing to the
                    oppressive measures of the censorship. In the development of the Russian drama
                    St Petersburg has played a far less important part than Moscow, and the stage at
                    St Petersburg has never reached the same standard of excellence as that of the
                    older capital. O11 the other hand, St Petersburg is the cradle of Russian opera
                    and Russian music. There are only four theatres of importance at St
                    Petersburg—all imperial —two for the opera and ballet, one for the native drama,
                    and one for the French and German drama.</p>
                <p>St Petersburg is much less of a manufacturing city than Moscow or Berlin. The
                    annual production of all the manufactures in the government of St Petersburg,
                    chiefly concentrated in or around the capital, was in 1879 valued at £16,768,600
                    out of £110,294,900 for the empire, against £19,500,000 in the government of
                    Moscow. The chief manufactured goods are cottons (£3,073,000) and other textile
                    fabrics (altogether £3,762,500), machinery (£2,355,800), rails (£1,342,300),
                    tobacco and spirits (about £1,200,000 each), leather, sugar, stearine candles,
                    copper and gum wares (from £850,000 to £450,000 each), and a variety of smaller
                    articles. The minor trades are greatly developed. No exact statistics of the
                    internal trade can be given, except for the import and export of articles of
                    food. In 1883 31,176,000 cwts. of grain and flour were imported by rail or
                    river, of which 18,680,450 were re-exported and 2,809,900 sent to the interior.
                    The exports in 1882 were valued at £1,864,980 from St Petersburg and at
                    £6,557,017 from Cronstadt, the aggregate thus being £8,421,997, in which
                    articles of food, chiefly corn, represented £4,214,312, raw and half raw produce
                    £4,009,446, and manufactured wares £197,520. The value of the imports was—to St
                    Petersburg £8,616,383 and to Cronstadt £116,316. Among the total imports
                    articles of food were valued at £1,941,393, raw and half raw produce at
                    £4,009,090 (chiefly coal), and manufactured wares at £1,082,698. Cronstadt and
                    St Petersburg were visited in the same year by 2195 ships of 951,000 tons (730
                    ships, 152,730 tons, from Great Britain). The coasting trade was represented by
                    702 vessels (119,300 tons) entered. The commercial fleet numbered only 43
                    steamers (14,000 tons) and 49 sailing vessels (8200 tons).</p>
                <p>Six railways meet at St Petersburg. Two run westwards along both banks of the
                    Gulf of Finland to Hangöudd and to Port Baltic; two short lines connect
                    Oranienbaum, opposite Cronstadt, and Tsarskoye Selo (with Pavlovsk) with the
                    capital; and two great trunk-lines run south-west and south-east to Warsaw (with
                    branches to Riga and Smolensk) and to Moscow (with branches to Novgorod and
                    Rybinsk). All are connected in the capital, except the Finland Railway, which
                    has its station on the right bank of the Neva. Moreover, the Neva is the great
                    channel for the trade of St Petersburg with the rest of Russia, by means of the
                    Volga and its tributaries. The importance of the traffic may best be seen from
                    the following figures, showing in cwts. the amount imported by different
                    channels :—</p>

                    35·8s. at Berlin and 98·2s. at Paris. The indirect taxes yield but 1s. per
                    inhabitant (57s. at Paris). The average expenses for the same years reached
                    £574,479 (£572,162 in 1884), distributed as follows :—20 per cent. of the whole

                    residences of the emperor. Pavlovsk has a fine palace and parks, open to the
                    public, where summer concerts attract thousands of people, Oranienbaum is now a
                    rather neglected place. Pulkova, on a hill 5 miles from St Petersburg, is well
                    known for its observatory; while several villages north of the capital, such as
                    Pargolovo, Murino, &amp;c., are visited in summer by the less wealthy

                <p><hi rend="italic">History. —</hi> The region between Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of
                    Finland was inhabited in the 9th century by Finns and some Slavonians. Novgorod
                    and Pskoff made efforts to retain their dominion over this region, so important
                    for their trade, and in the 13th and 14th centuries they built the forts of
                    Koporye (in the present district of Peterhof), Yam (now Yamburg), and Oryeshek
                    (now Schlusselburg) at the point where the Neva issues from Lake Ladoga. They
                    found, however, powerful opponents in the Swedes, who erected the fort of
                    Landskrona at the junction of the Okhta and the Neva, and in the Livonians, who
                    had their fortress at Narva. Novgorod and Moscow successively were able by
                    continuous fighting to maintain their supremacy over the region south of the
                    Neva throughout the 16th century; but early in the 17th century Moscow was
                    compelled to cede it to Sweden, which erected a fortress (Nyönschanz) on the
                    Neva at the mouth of the okhta. In 1700 Peter I. began his wars with Sweden.
                    Oryeshek was taken in 1702, and next year Nyönschauz. Two months later (29th
                    June 1703) Peter I. laid the foundations of a cathedral to St Peter and St Paul,
                    and of a fort which received his own name (in its Dutch transcription,
                    “Piterburgh ”). Next year the fort of Cronslott was erected on the island of
                    Kotlin, as also the admiralty on the Neva, opposite the fortress. The emperor
                    took most severe and almost barbarous measures for increasing his newborn city.
                    Thousands of people from all parts of Russia were removed thither and died in
                    erecting the fortress and building the houses. Great numbers of artisans and
                    workmen were brought to St Petersburg to form the Myeshchanskaya villages, which
                    raised the population to 100,000 inhabitants. All proprietors of more than “500
                    souls” were ordered to build a house at St Petersburg and to stay there in the
                    winter. The construction of stone-houses throughout the rest of Russia was
                    prohibited, all masons having to be sent to St Petersburg. After Peter I.’s
                    death the population of the capital rapidly decreased; but foreigners continued
                    to settle there. Under Elizabeth a new series of compulsory measures raised the
                    population to 150,000, which figure was nearly doubled during the reign of
                    Catherine II. Since the beginning of the present century the population has
                    steadily increased (364,000 in 1817, 468,600 in 1837, 491,000 in 1856, and
                    667,000 in 1869). The chief embellishments of St Petersburg were effected during
                    the reigns of Alexander I. (1801-25) and Nicholas I. (1825-55).</p>
                <p>When Peter I., desirous of giving a “European” capital to his empire, laid the
                    first foundations of St Petersburg on the marshy islands of the Neva, in land
                    not fully conquered and remote from the centres of Russian life, it is hardly
                    possible that he could have foreseen the rapid development it has since
                    undergone: it has now a population approaching a million and commands more than
                    one-sixth of the foreign trade and manufactures of Russia. In point of fact,
                    there is no capital in Europe so disadvantageously situated with regard to its
                    own country as St Petersburg. Desolate wildernesses begin at its very gates and
                    extend for hundreds of miles to the north and cast. To the south it has the very
                    thinly peopled regions of Pskoff and Novgorod,—the marshy and woody tracts of
                    the Valdai Heights. For 400 miles in each of these three directions there is not
                    a single city of any importance; and towards the west, on both shores of the
                    Gulf of Finland, are foreign peoples who have their own centres of gravitation
                    in cities on or nearer to the Baltic. With the provinces of Russia the capital
                    is connected only by canals and railways, which have to traverse vast tracts of
                    inhospitable country before reaching them. But St Petersburg possesses, on the
                    other hand, one immense advantage in its site, which has proved of great moment,
                    especially in the present century of development of international traffic. Ruled
                    by the idea of creating a new Amsterdam—that is, a meeting-place for traders of
                    all nationalities—and a great export market for Russia, Peter I. could have
                    selected no better place. St Petersburg has been for nearly 150 years the chief
                    place of export for raw produce from the most productive parts of Russia. The
                    great central plateau which forms the upper basins of all the chief Russian
                    rivers had no other outlet to the sea than the estuary of the Neva. The natural
                    outlet might indeed have been the Black Sea; but the rivers to the southward are
                    either interrupted by rapids like the Dnieper, or are shallow like the Don;
                    while their mouths and the entire coast-region remained till the end of the 18th
                    century in the hands of Turkey. As for the Caspian, it faced Asia, and not
                    Europe. The commercial outlet of the central plateau was thus the reverse of the
                    physical. From the earliest years of Russian history trade had taken this
                    northern direction. Novgorod owed its wealth to this fact; and as far back as
                    the 12th century the Russians had their forts on Lake Ladoga and the Neva. . In
                    the 14th and 15th centuries they already exchanged their wares with the Dantzic
                    merchants at Nu or Nü,—<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n214/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0214-0195"/> the then name for what is now Vasilyevskiy
                    Island. By founding St Petersburg Peter I. only restored the trade to its old
                    but discarded channels. The system of canals for connecting the upper Volga and
                    the Dnieper with the great lakes of the north completed the work; the commercial
                    mouth of the Volga was transferred to the Gulf of Finland, and St Petersburg
                    became the export harbour for more than half Russia. Foreigners hastened thither
                    to take possession of the growing export trade, to the exclusion of the
                    Russians; and to this circumstance the Russian capital is indebted for its
                    cosmopolitan character. But its present extensive and west-European aspect has
                    not been achieved, nor is it maintained, without a vast expenditure of the
                    national resources. It cost hundreds of thousands of human lives before the
                    marshy islands at the mouth of the Neva could be rendered fit to receive a
                    million inhabitants and be brought into connexion with the remainder of Russia;
                    and very many more are annually sacrificed for the maintenance of this capital
                    on its unhealthy site, under the 60th parallel, hundreds of miles distant from
                    the centres of Russian life.</p>
                <p>The development of the railway system and the rapid colonization of southern
                    Russia now operate, however, adversely to St Petersburg. Its foreign trade is
                    not actually decreasing, but the very rapid growth in the exports of Russia
                    within the twenty years before 1886 was entirely to the benefit of other ports
                    more highly favoured by nature, such as Riga and especially Libau, while the
                    rapid increase of population in the Black Sea region is tending to shift the
                    Russian centre of gravity: new centres of commercial, industrial, and
                    intellectual life are being developed at Odessa and Rostoff. The revival of
                    Little Russia is another influence operating in the same direction.</p>
                <p>Another important factor in the growth of the influence of St Petersburg on
                    Russian life was the concentration of all political power in the hands of an
                    absolute Government and in the narrow circles surrounding the chief of the
                    state. As Yuriy Dolgorukiy felt the necessity of creating for a new phase of
                    national history— that of a centralized state—a new capital, Moscow, free from
                    the municipal and republican traditions of the old Russian towns, so Peter I.
                    felt the necessity of again creating a fresh capital for a third phase of the
                    country’s progress,—a capital where the rising imperial power would be free from
                    the control of the old boyar families. St Petersburg fully answers to this need.
                    For more than a century and a half it was the real centre of political life and
                    of political thought, impregnated with the conception of a powerful central
                    Government. In so strongly centralized a state as Russia was, and still is, and
                    for the phase of life which the empire has passed through during the last two
                    centuries, it mattered little whether the capital was some hundred miles away
                    from the natural centres of life and without the support of a dense and active
                    surrounding population. Bureaucracy, its leading feature, was simply reinforced
                    by the remoteness of the capital. But these circumstances are at present
                    undergoing a change. Since the abolition of serfdom and in consequence of the
                    impulse given to Russian thought by this reform, the provinces are coming more
                    and more to dispute the right of St Petersburg to guide the political life of
                    the country. It has been often said that St Petersburg is the head of Russia and
                    Moscow its heart. The first part at least of this saying is true. In the
                    development of thought and in naturalizing in Russia the results of west
                    European reflection St Petersburg has played throughout the present century a
                    prominent part. Attracting to itself from the provinces the best intellects of
                    the country, it has powerfully contributed towards familiarizing the reading
                    public with the teachings of west European science and philosophy, and towards
                    giving to Russian literature that liberality of mind and freedom from the
                    trammels of tradition that have so often been noticed by west Europeans. St
                    Petersburg has no traditions, no history beyond that of the palace conspiracies,
                    and nothing in its past can attract the writer or the thinker. But, as new
                    centres of intellectual movement and new currents of thought develop again at
                    Moscow and Kieff or arise anew at odessa and in the eastern provinces, these
                    places claim the right to their own share in the further development of
                    intellectual life in Russia; and it would not be surprising if the
                    administrative and intellectual centre of the empire, after its migrations
                    successively from Kieff, Novgorod, and Pskoff to Moscow, and thence to St
                    Petersburg, were again to follow a new movement towards the south. (P. A.
