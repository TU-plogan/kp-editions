                    Réné</hi></label> (1774-1833), duke of Rovigo, was born at Marcq, in the canton
                    of Grandpré and department of Ardennes, on 26th April 1774. He was educated at
                    the college of St Louis in Metz, where he gained a scholarship. When a youth of
                    sixteen he became a volunteer in a cavalry regiment. His first military
                    experiences were with the army of the Rhine under Custine; he distinguished
                    himself under Moreau and Férino, and by 1797 had reached the rank of major. In
                    the next year, under Desaix, he took part in the Egyptian expedition, and he
                    followed the same general in the second Italian campaign, and at the great
                    battle of Marengo (14th June 1800). He had by this time attracted the favourable
                    notice of Napoleon, who detected not only his soldierly powers but his singular
                    gifts in the region of diplomacy and intrigue. For Savary the plans and will of
                    Napoleon formed a law which obliterated every other, and in presence of which
                    political and moral scruple had no place. So early as 1800, while only
                    twenty-six years of age, he was appointed a colonel and the commander of that
                    legion which was afterwards to form the picked bodyguard of the emperor. In 1803
                    he was general of brigade, and in 1804 he was charged with the execution of the
                    Duc d’Enghien. Savary in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> (published in Paris
                    in 1828, 8 vols. 8vo) avows that all he did was to convey to Vincennes a letter
                    whose contents he did not know, and early next morning, in obedience to the
                    orders of a superior officer, to have the duke shot. The other side of the story
                    is that he knew all about it,—that of set purpose, and in order to prevent an
                    appeal to Napoleon’s clemency, he hastened the execution; and it is certain
                    that, unlike a man merely under orders, he himself went straight to Bonaparte to
                    report the death. Savary was the hand which Napoleon employed in the delicate
                    negotiations with the emperor Alexander about the time of the battle of
                    Austerlitz in 1805. At Jena in 1806 he distinguished himself by his successful
                    pursuit of the retreating Prussians; he rendered signal service by the siege of
                    Hameln, which he forced to capitulate on 20th November; and, finally, the severe
                    defeat which he inflicted upon the Russian forces at Ostrolenka, on 16th
                    February 1807, was his crowning victory. Among other honours and rewards, he
                    received a pension of 20,000 francs. After the peace of Tilsit he was despatched
                    to St Petersburg; but shortly thereafter—the Napoleonic scheme for the crown of
                    Spain being now apparently complete—he was recalled, was created duke of Rovigo,
                    and started for Madrid. His deceitful intrigue was soon successful, and Joseph
                    Bonaparte ascended the Spanish throne. From 1808 to 1810 he was again beside
                    Napoleon in the many and changing scenes of his exploits; but on the 8th of June
                    of the latter year France itself, now fully alive to the vast and mysterious
                    power he had learned to wield, was startled by his appointment as successor to
                    Fouché in the ministry of police. His administration, however, was not a
                    success. After the overthrow of Napoleon, he desired to accompany his master to
                    St Helena, but this was refused, and he was imprisoned at Malta. He escaped
                    thence to Smyrna, thereafter wandered about the east of Europe, and finally
                    embarked for England, which he reached in 1819. Three years before he had been
                    condemned to death by default; and, learning this, he proceeded to Paris to
                    clear himself of the sentence, in which he succeeded, being also reinvested with
                    his rank and dignities. He retired to Rome, where he remained till 1831, when he
                    was appointed commander-in-chief of the African army, and entrusted with the
                    administration of Algeria. His duties were successfully performed, but he
                    returned in March 1833 in weak health to Paris, where he died on the 2d of
                    June.</p>
