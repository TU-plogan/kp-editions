                    Sappho, a courtesan of Eresus, to whom to ascribe the current scandals about the
                    poetess. She was the daughter of Scamandronymus and Cleis, of whom nothing more
                    is known. The epistle of Sappho to Phaon, ascribed to<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0322-0303"/> Ovid, says that her “parent” died when she was
                    six years old; if Frag. 90 refers to Sappho’s own mother, which is very
                    doubtful, this “parent” must be her father. Her date cannot be certainly fixed,
                    but she must have lived about the end of the 7th and beginning of the 6th
                    centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> being contemporary with Alcaeus,
                    Stesichorus, and Pittacus, in fact with the culminating period of AEolic poetry.
                    But of her life very little else is known. One of her brothers, Charaxus, who
                    was engaged in the wine-trade between Lesbos and Naucratis in Egypt, fell in
                    love there with a courtesan named Doricha and surnamed for her beauty Rhodopis,
                    whom he freed from slavery and upon whom he squandered his property. Sappho
                    wrote an ode on this, in which she severely satirized and rebuked him. Another
                    brother, Larichus, was public cup-bearer at Mytilene,—a fact for which it was
                    necessary to be ϵύγϵνής, so that we may suppose Sappho to have been of good
                    family. For the rest it is known that she had a daughter, named after her
                    grandmother Cleis, and that she had some personal acquaintance with Alcaeus. He
                    addressed her in an ode of which a fragrant is preserved: “Violet-weaving, pure,
                    sweet-smiling Sappho, I wish to say somewhat, but shame hinders me;" and she
                    answered in another ode: “Hadst thou had desire of aught good or fair, shame
                    would not have touched thine eyes, but thou wouldst have spoken thereof openly.”
                    Further than this everything is enveloped in doubt and darkness. The well-known
                    story of her love for the disdainful Phaon, and her leap into the sea from the
                    Leucadian promontory, together with that of her flight from Mytilene to Sicily,
                    which has been connected with her love for Phaon, rests upon no evidence that
                    will bear examination. Indeed, we are not even told whether she died of the leap
                    or not. All critics again are agreed that Suidas was simply gulled by the comic
                    poets when he tells us of her imaginary husband, Cercolas of Andros. The name of
                    Sappho was by these poets consistently dragged in the dirt, and both the
                    aspersions they cast on her character and the embellishments with which they
                    garnished her life passed for centuries as undoubted history. Six comedies
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Sappho,</hi> and two <hi rend="italic">Phaon,</hi>
                    were produced by the Middle Comedy; and, when we consider, for example, the way
                    in which Socrates was caricatured by Aristophanes, we are justified in putting
                    no faith whatever in any accounts of Sappho which depend upon such authority, as
                    most of our accounts appear to do.</p>
                <p>Welcker<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sappho von einem, herrschenden Vorwtheil befreyt,</hi> Göttingen,</p></note>
                    was the first to examine carefully the evidence upon which the current opinion
                    of Sappho’s character rested. He found it easy to disprove, in his opinion, all
                    the common accusations against her moral character, but unfortunately, not
                    content with disproving actual statements, went on to uphold Sappho as a model
                    of feminine virtue. Bergk and Mure both combated his views, and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rheinisches Museum</hi> for 1857 may be found the issues between
                    him and the latter clearly stated on both sides, unfortunately with considerable
                    acrimony. It is plain to the impartial reader that both of the controversialists
                    have gone decidedly too far, but it can hardly be denied, however much we should
                    naturally desire to think otherwise, that Mure has very considerably the best of
                    it. We owe thanks to Welcker for clearing the history of Sappho from several
                    fictions, but further than this it is impossible to go; we owe thanks to Mure
                    for preferring truth to sentiment, but we cannot disregard some points of
                    Welcker’s argument so completely as he does. In fact, the truth appears to be
                    that Sappho was not, as the Attic comedy represented her, a woman utterly
                    abandoned to vice, and only distinguished among the corrupt com</p>
                <p>1816.</p>
                <p>munity of Lesbos by exceptional immorality and the gift of song,—that indeed she
                    was not notoriously immoral at all, but no worse and perhaps better than the
                    standard of her age and country required. This seems clearly indicated by the
                    epithet άγνα, with which Alcaeus addressed her. On the other hand, not merely
                    tradition but the character of her extant fragments, with the other evidence
                    adduced by Mure, constrain us to resign the pleasant dream of Welcker, K. O.
                    Müller, and their followers,—an ideal and eminently respectable head of a poetic
                    school, with a matronly regard for her pupils, who meant by her own poems
                    anything but what she said, and was more careful to inculcate virtue than
                    unlimited indulgence in passion.</p>
                <p>To leave this disagreeable question, we will next indicate briefly all that is
                    known of her position in Lesbos. She was there the centre of a brilliant society
                    and head of a great poetic school, for poetry in that age and place was
                    cultivated as assiduously and apparently as successfully by women as by men. Her
                    most famous pupils were Erinna of Telos and Damophyla of Pamphylia. Besides them
                    we know the names of Atthis, Telesippa, Megara, Gongyla, Gyrinna, Dica,
                    Mnasidica Eunica, and Anactoria, to whom the second ode, ϵίς ϵρωμϵναν, is said
                    to have been addressed. The names also of two of her rivals are
                    preserved—Andromeda and Gorgo; but whether they also presided over similar
                    schools or not is very doubtful, as that idea of them depends on the authority
                    of Maximus Tyrius, which is quite worthless on this point.</p>
                <p>In antiquity the fame of Sappho rivalled that of Homer. She was called “the
                    poetess,” as he was called “the poet.” Different writers style her “the tenth
                    Muse,” “the flower of the Graces,” “a miracle,” “the beautiful,” the last
                    epithet referring to her writings, not her person, which is said to have been
                    small and dark. Her poems were arranged in nine books, on what principle is
                    uncertain; she is said to have sung them to the Mixo-Lydian mode, which she
                    herself invented. The few remains which have come down to us amply testify to
                    the justice of the praises lavished upon Sappho by the ancients. The perfection
                    and finish of every line, the correspondence of sense and sound, the
                    incomparable command over all the most delicate resources of verse, and the
                    exquisite symmetry of the complete odes raise her into the very first rank of
                    technical poetry at once, while her direct and fervent painting of passion,
                    which caused Longinus to quote the ode to Anactoria as an example of the
                    sublime, has never been since surpassed, and only approached by Catullus and in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vita Nuova.</hi> Her fragments also bear witness to a
                    profound feeling for the beauty of nature; we know from other sources that she
                    had a peculiar delight in flowers, and especially in the rose. The ancients also
                    attributed to her a considerable power in satire, but in hexameter verse they
                    considered her inferior to her pupil Erinna.</p>
                <p>The fragments of Sappho have been all preserved by other authors incidentally. An
                    independent fragment, ascribed to her by Blass but rejected by Bergk and of very
                    doubtful authenticity, has been discovered on a papyrus in the Egyptian museum
                    at Berlin (see <hi rend="italic">Rhein.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    Mus.</hi> for 1880, p. 287; Bergk, vol. iii. p. 704); but even if really hers it
                    is too fragmentary to be of any value. The best edition of Sappho is to be found
                    in Bergk’s <hi rend="italic">Poetae Lyrid Graeci,</hi> vol. iii., 4th ed.,
                    Leipsic, 1882. The only separate edition and the only complete translation in
                    English is that of Mr Wharton (London, 1885), in which it is unfortunately
                    impossible for the general reader to place much reliance. (J. A. PL.)</p>
