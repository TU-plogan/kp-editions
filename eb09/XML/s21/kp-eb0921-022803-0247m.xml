                <p><label type="entry">SALT</label>. Common salt, or simply salt, is the name given
                    to the native and industrial forms of sodium chloride (NaCl). The consideration
                    of this important substance naturally falls under two heads, relating
                    respectively to sea salt or “bay” salt and “rock” salt or mineral salt. As
                    actually found, however, the one is probably derived from the other, most rock
                    salt deposits bearing evidence of having been formed by the evaporation of lakes
                    or seas at former (often remote) geological periods. This is seen from their
                    stratified nature, with their interposed beds of clay, which could only have
                    been deposited from solution. The crystals of selenite (hydrated calcium
                    sulphate), moreover, which they contain can only have been formed in water and
                    can never since have been subjected to any considerable amount of heat,
                    otherwise their water of crystallization would have been driven off. The beds
                    also of potassium and magnesium salts found at Stassfurt and other places,
                    interposed between or overlying the rock salt deposits, are in just the position
                    in which one would naturally expect to find them if deposited from salt water.
                    Finally, the marine shells often occurring abundantly in the surrounding rocks
                    of contemporary periods also testify to the former existence of large
                    neighbouring masses of salt water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sea Salt.—</hi> Assuming a degree of concentration such that
                    each gallon of sea water contains 0·2547 lb. of salt, and allowing an average
                    density of 2·24 for rock salt, it has been computed that the entire ocean if
                    dried up would yield no less than 4,419,360 cubic miles of rock salt, or about
                    fourteen and a half times the bulk of the entire continent of Europe above
                    high-water mark, mountain masses and all. The proportion of sodium chloride in
                    the water of the ocean, where it is mixed with small quantities of other salts,
                    is on the average about 33·3 per 1000 parts, ranging from 29 per 1000 for the
                    polar seas to 35·5 per 1000 or more at the equator. Enclosed seas, such as the
                    Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Black Sea, the Dead Sea, the Caspian, and
                    others, are dependent of course for the proportion and quality of their saline
                    matter on local circumstances. Forchhammer found the following quantities of
                    solid matter in the water of various seas:—</p>

                <p>At one time almost the whole of the salt in commerce was produced from the
                    evaporation of sea water, and indeed salt so made still forms a staple commodity
                    in many countries possessing a seaboard, especially those where the climate is
                    dry and the summer of long duration. In Portugal a total of over 250,000 tons is
                    annually made in the salt works of St Ubes (Setubal), Alcacer do Sal, Oporto,
                    Aneyro, and Figueras. Spain, with the salt works of the Bay of Cadiz, the
                    Balearic Islands, Ac., makes 300,000 tons. Italy has salt works in Sicily,
                    Naples, Tuscany, and Sardinia, producing 165,000 tons. In France, between the
                    “marais salants du midi” and those on the Atlantic, 250,000 to 300,000 tons are
                    annually produced, besides those of Corsica. The “Salzgiirten” of Austria
                    produce collectively from 70,000 to 100,000 tons annually at various places on
                    the Adriatic (Sabioncello, Trieste, Pirano, Capo d’Istria, &amp;c.). In England
                    and Scotland the industry has of late<pb break="no"

                    the rocksalt works of Cheshire, but some small manufactories still exist, at
                    North Shields and elsewhere, where salt is made by dissolving rock-salt in sea
                    water, and evaporating the solution to crystallization by artificial heat.</p>
                <p>The process of the spontaneous evaporation of sea water has been very carefully
                    studied by Usiglio on Mediterranean water at Cette. The density at first was
                    l·02. Primarily but a slight deposit is formed (none until the concentration
                    arrives at specific gravity 1·0509), this deposit consisting for the most part
                    of calcic carbonate and ferric oxide. This goes on till a density of ·1315 is
                    attained, when hydrated calcium sulphate begins to deposit, and continues till
                    specific gravity 1·2646 is reached. At a density of 1·218 the volume of the sea
                    water has become reduced to <hi rend="superscript"> 95</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1000</hi> ths of what it was at first, and from this moment
                    the deposit becomes augmented by sodium chloride, which goes down mixed with a
                    little magnesium chloride and sulphate. At specific gravity 1 ·2461 a little
                    sodium bromide has begun also to deposit. At specific gravity 1·311 the volume
                    of the water is only <hi rend="superscript"> 16</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>And of this we see that about 95 per cent. is sodium chloride. Up to this point
                    the separation of the salts has taken place in a fairly regular manner, but now
                    the temperature begins to exert an influence, and some of the salts deposited in
                    the cold of the night dissolve again partially in the heat of the day. By night
                    the liquor gives nearly pure magnesium sulphate; in the day the same sulphate
                    mixed with sodium and potassium chlorides is deposited. The mother-liquor now
                    falls a little in density to a specific gravity of 1·3082 to 1·2965, and yields
                    a very mixed deposit of magnesium bromide and chloride, potassium chloride, and
                    magnesium sulphate, with the double magnesium and potassium sulphate,
                    corresponding to the kainite of Stassfurt. There is also deposited a double
                    magnesium and potassium chloride, similar to the carnallite of Stassfurt, and
                    finally the mother-liquor, which has now again risen to specific gravity 1·3374,
                    contains only pure magnesium chloride.</p>
                <p>The application of these results to the production of salt from sea water is
                    obvious. A large piece of land, varying from one or two to several acres, barely
                    above high-water mark, is levelled, and if necessary puddled with clay so as to
                    prevent the water from percolating and sinking away. In tidal seas a “jas” (as
                    the storage reservoir is called) is constructed alongside, similarly rendered
                    impervious, in which the water is stored and allowed to settle and concentrate
                    to a certain extent. In non-tidal seas this storage basin is not required. The
                    prepared land is partitioned off into large basins <hi rend="italic"
                    >(adernes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">muants)</hi> and others (called in France
                    <hi rend="italic">aircs, oeuillets,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tables
                    salantes)</hi> which get smaller and more shallow in proportion as they are
                    intended to receive the water as it becomes . more and more concentrated, just
                    sufficient fall being allowed from one set of basins to the other to cause the
                    water to flow slowly through them. The flow is often assisted by pumping. The
                    sea salt thus made is collected into small heaps on the paths around the basins
                    or the floors of the basins themselves, and here it undergoes a first partial
                    purification, the more deliquescent salts (especially the magnesium chloride)
                    being allowed to drain away. From these heaps it is collected into larger ones,
                    where it drains further, and becomes more purified. Here it is protected by
                    thatch till required for sale.</p>
                <p>The salt is collected from the surface by means of a sort of wooden scoop or
                    scraper which the workman pushes before him, but in spite of every precaution
                    some of the soil on which it is produced is inevitably taken up with it,
                    communicating a red or grey tint. Sea salt is thence known in many of the French
                    markets as <hi rend="italic">sel gris,</hi> and frequently contains as much as
                    15 per cent. of impurity. Yet such is the ignorance and prejudice of many people
                    that they will buy it in preference to the purer article from the evaporation of
                    rock-salt brine, asserting its action to be milder and more even. Even if this
                    were true they forget that mud ought to be cheaper than salt. The salt made on
                    the coast of Brittany possesses the following composition :—</p>

                <p>Generally speaking this salt goes into commerce just as it is, but in some cases
                    it is taken first to the refinery, where it either is simply washed and then
                    stove-dried before being sent out or is dissolved in fresh water and then boiled
                    down and crystallized like white salt from rock-salt brine. The salt of the
                    “salines du midi” of the south-east of France is far purer than the above,

                <p>This is perhaps partly owing to the fact that of late years, by way of obviating
                    the above-mentioned cause of impurity, a species of moss has been introduced
                    there with some success from Portugal and forms a bed on which the salt is
                    deposited. The mother-liquors from the crystallization of the common salt
                    contain still a little sodium chloride and most of the bromine and iodine of the
                    sea water, all the potassium salts, much magnesium sulphate, and a large
                    quantity of magnesium chloride. They are often thrown away as useless, but
                    lately, in the south of France, in the “salines du midi,” they have been used
                    for the production of certain chemicals by a system of ulterior treatment
                    introduced by M. Merle and still continued by his successor M. Pechinet.</p>
                <p>As soon as the water arrives at specific gravity 1·2407 and has deposited most of
                    its salt, it is drawn off and stored in large tanks of 50,000 or 60,000 cubic
                    metres capacity. From these it is withdrawn in successive portions, and
                    artificially cooled to 0·4° Fahr. Under these circumstances, indeed at any
                    temperature below 26° Fahr., a double decomposition takes place between the
                    sodium chloride and the magnesium sulphate—crystallized sodium sulphate being
                    thus separated. After being withdrawn and freed from the mother-liquor by a
                    hydro-extractor, this sulphate, which contains two atoms of water, is then
                    rendered anhydrous by heating in a reverberatory furnace. From the refrigerating
                    vessel the water now passes to an ordinary evaporating pan, where the remaining
                    salt is precipitated by boiling, collected, and purified by the hydro-extractor.
                    Here the water attains a specific gravity 1·2680, and, being spread out in a
                    thin layer on a smooth level bed of cement or concrete, deposits on cooling all
                    its potassium as the double chloride of potassium and magnesium, the same as the
                    carnallite of Stassfurt.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Rock-Salt.—</hi> This appears to occur in almost every
                    formation, except in the Primary rocks, strictly so called. The oldest deposit
                    of which the age may be considered to have been anything like precisely
                    determined may be said to be the great salt range of the Punjab, which is
                    regarded as belonging to the Permian; and that lately discovered at
                    Middlesbrough in Yorkshire, immediately overlying the magnesian limestone, may
                    be probably referred to the same period. In the northern counties of England
                    there are frequent instances of brine springs rising from the Carboniferous and
                    contiguous formations. The Cheshire and Worcestershire salt-beds are by some
                    attributed to the Permian; more generally, however, they are referred to the
                    Trias. Those of West New York and Gooderich (Canada) are said to belong to the
                    Salina period of the Upper Silurian. The deposits of the Vosges, Salzburg, and
                    others of central Germany and Austria are considered to belong to the Trias;
                    that of Bex in Switzerland to the Lias. Those of Wieliczka in Poland, Cardona in
                    Spain, and some Algerian formations are admitted to be Cretaceous. Those of
                    Bayonne, Dax, and Camarade, in the Pyrenees, are probably Tertiary, while the
                    Dead Sea, Lake Elton in Astrakhan, the Bitter Lakes of the Isthmus of Suez, the
                    Kara Boghaz on the shores of the Caspian, the Limans of Bessarabia south of
                    Odessa, the Runn of Cutch, and certain formations of the Sea of Azoff, &amp;c.,
                    are instances of salt formations now in actual progress. The frequent
                    association of bitumen and petroleum with rock-salt and brine is one of the most
                    noticeable features in the geology of those substances, and seems to point to
                    some unknown condition of the formation of the two first named. The Dax salt is
                    close to the bitumen deposits of Bastenès and Gaujac. Borings made at Dax, as
                    well as at Salies about 20 miles distant (where also salt exists), gave vent to
                    an efflux of inflammable gas which continued for several weeks, and the water of
                    several springs in that neighbourhood is tainted with petroleum. Bitumen and
                    petroleum occur near Volterra in Tuscany, where a large deposit of salt is being
                    worked. In Walachia the two occur in the same formation. In the United States of
                    America and in the south of Russia petroleum and brine are found in many places
                    either actually associated or in near proximity; petroleum has recently been
                    discovered not far from the salt deposits of Hanover, and one of the beds of
                    rock-salt at Nancy is strongly coloured by bitumen, while almost all rock-salt
                    has a more or less perceptible bituminous odour when struck or rubbed. In the
                    province of Szechuen, China, are some remarkable salt springs, where the brine
                    is accompanied by such an efflux of inflammable gas that the latter serves as
                    fuel for its evaporation; and other springs accompanied by the same phenomenon
                    exist in the same region. In fact, instances without end might be cited of the
                    two occurring together, and it would appear that petroleum for some mysterious
                    reason can only be formed in presence of salt.</p>
                <p>The chief rock-salt districts of Europe may be classified as follows :—(1) the
                    Carpathians; (2) Austrian and Bavarian Alps; (3) West Germany; (4) Vosges; (5)
                    Jura; (6) Swiss Alps; (7) Pyrenees and the Spanish or Celtiberian Mountains; (8)
                    the British salt deposits; (9) isolated deposits and springs in Russia, Turkey,
                    Italy, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The Carpathian district may be subdivided into the Moldo-Walachian,
                    Transylvanian, Galician, and Hungarian sections. They form probably the richest
                    and most extensive of the European salt fields and by them alone the entire
                    continent might be supplied for ages. The Transylvanian and Walachian mines are
                    specially numerous and rich. Thousands of tons of salt, in the form of brine
                    from the springs which are common throughout tho country, are allowed to run to
                    waste, no important factory existing in the country for its evaporation. The
                    rock is in fact in itself so pure that simply ground it meets all requirements
                    of public consumption. In Galicia the principal mines and those of most
                    historical interest are at Wieliczka and Bochnia. The former, which is justly
                    the most celebrated in the world, is situated 9 miles from Cracow and has been
                    worked continuously for six hundred years. The mass of salt is calculated to be
                    500 miles long, 20 miles broad, and 1200 feet thick. It is on the north-west
                    side of a ridge of hills, an offset of the Carpathians. The salt is stoped out
                    in longitudinal and transverse galleries, and large vaulted chambers, supported
                    by massive pillars. Explosives are not used in this or any of the other mines of
                    the district. The salt is sold just as it comes from the mine, or else finely
                    ground and packed in casks or sacks. The mine is divided into four levels, and
                    is 284 yards deep and 1 mile 1279 yards long by 830 yards wide. All the grinding
                    and packing is done within it.</p>
                <p>It is stated that the collective length of the galleries and chambers is no less
                    than 30 English miles and the total yield 55,067 tons per annum. These mines
                    employ from eight hundred to one thousand persons, many of whom live permanently
                    under ground; the lower levels contain streets and houses and constitute a
                    complete village. Travellers have given glowing descriptions of the crystal
                    vaults, sparkling aisles, and fairy palaces of this mine. The salt is greyish,
                    and somewhat resembles granite in appearance.</p>
                <p>In the well-known district of the Austrian and Bavarian Alps the mine of Salzburg
                    (Salzkammergut) is perhaps the most familiar. The Austrian portion of the
                    district includes the towns of Aussee, Ischl, Hallstadt, and Hallein, and the
                    Bavarian includes Berchtesgaden, Reichenhall, Traunstein, and Rosenheim. In the
                    last-named salt is made from brine conveyed in pipes from Berchtesgaden, passing
                    by Reichenhall, 15 miles in all, with a total fall of 1552 feet. There arc also
                    large salt works at Hall near Innsbruck. Here, as in the Carpathian region, most
                    of the rocksalt is sold merely ground, or in lumps, and the trade is, as in
                    other parts of Austria-Hungary, a strict Government monopoly, , producing an
                    annual revenue of two and a quarter to two and a half millions sterling.</p>
                <p>The German mines are numerous; they extend north and south from Segeberg in
                    Holstein to Sulz on the Neckar, and east and west from Kreuznach to Halle. Brine
                    springs and small workings lie scattered all over the country. But two
                    formations of special importance are Stassfurt in Saxony and the Lüneburg Heath
                    in<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n250/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0250-0231"/> Hanover. Fig. 2 represents a section of the
                    Stassfurt beds, and will give an idea of their formation. It appears less than
                    most others to have been subjected to denudation since being formed, and
                    consequently better than many others illustrates the formation of such deposits.
                    Overlying the salt properly so called (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) is a thin band
                    of anhydrite, and above this <hi rend="italic">b, c, d,</hi> beds of variously -
                    coloured clay, red and grey, containing highly deliquescent salts, forming three
                    distinct layers. The lowest, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>, called “polyhalite,”
                    contains some sodium chloride and with it other deliquescent chlorides. Next to
                    this comes c, the “kieserite” region, about 30½ yards thick—here are chiefly
                    potassium and magnesium sulphates; and lastly we have <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                    the upper layer or “carnallite” region, 23 yards thick, containing almost
                    exclusively the double potassium and magnesium chlorides, together with other
                    deliquescent salts, nodules of boracite, &amp;c. lt has been computed that a sea
                    depth of 12½ miles would be required for the production of such a series as
                    this.</p>
                <p>The Vosges, which is a very important district, supplied a large part of the east
                    of France with salt, till lost by the war of 1870- 1871, since which time Nancy
                    has gained considerably in importance. Geologically speaking, Nancy is included
                    in this basin.</p>
                <p>In Switzerland the chief salt district lies on the right bank of the Rhone, near
                    the Lake of Geneva. The principal centres are Aigle, Roche, and Bex, the last
                    being the most important.</p>
                <p>The Pyrenees are rich on both sides in brine springs and rocksalt formations. In
                    the south-west of France we have the rocksalt of Dax and Villefranche, and the
                    brine springs of Salies and Briscous, as well as that of Camarade. In Spain both
                    rock-salt and brine are plentiful, as is indicated by the frequent recurrence of
                    the syllable “Sal” in the names of towns (Salinas, Salinillas, Poza de la Sal,
                    &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>The Celtiberian or exclusively Spanish district includes various towns scattered
                    over Spain—Salinas de Saelices (Guadalajara), Villafáfila (Zamora), Torreximeno,
                    Cazorla, and Hinojares (Jaen), &amp;c.; but perhaps the most remarkable deposit
                    of salt in Spain is that of Cardona in the province of Barcelona, 45 miles
                    north-west of that city. Here is a veritable mountain composed of a bed of
                    remarkably pure salt 142 to 164 yards thick, and forming two masses, each about
                    a mile in circumference. The salt is as usual stratified, and bears very strong
                    evidence of denudation. It is chiefly pure white, but in parts varies from
                    light-blue to brick-red. It is extracted by an open-air working like stone from
                    a quarry.</p>
                <p>There are some brine and rock-salt deposits which can hardly be classified as
                    belonging to any particular district. Such are—in France, at the foot of the
                    Alps, the brine springs of Moutiers and Castellane; in Italy, Volterra; in
                    Sicily, Nicosia and Mussomeli; in Croatia, Szambor; in Bosnia, Tusia; in Russia,
                    Bachmutz on the Donetz, Balachna on the Volga, Staraya-Russa near Lake Ilmen,
                    Eupatoria and other places in the Crimea; in Prussia, Waltersdorff, Sperenberg,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The chief centres of manufacture in England are at Northwich, Middlewich,
                    Winsford, and Sandbach in Cheshire, Weston-on-Trent in Staffordshire, Stoke
                    Prior and Droitwich in Worcestershire, and Middlesbrough in Yorkshire.<note

                    English place-names often points to ancient salt manufacture,—the word “wich”
                    (creek, bay; Icel. <hi rend="italic">vík</hi>) having acquired a special sense
                    in English usage. In Germany the various forms of the non-Teutonic words Hall,
                    Halle occurring in place-names point in the same way to ancient
                    salt-works.</p></note> Duncrue near Carrickfergus in Ireland also possesses a
                    large deposit of salt. The Cheshire and Worcestershire salt deposits are up to
                    the present time by far the most important, the Duncrue deposit being only
                    partially worked. Although brine springs have been known to exist in both these
                    counties ever since the Roman occupation, and salt had been made there from time
                    immemorial, it was not till 1670 that rock-salt about 30 yards thick was
                    discovered at Marbury near Northwich by some men exploring for coal, at a depth
                    of 34 yards. In 1779 three beds of rock-salt were discovered at Lawton,
                    separated from one another by layers of indurated clay. The Marston mine, the
                    property of Messrs Rigby and Fletcher of Northwich, is the largest and perhaps
                    the oldest (there are twenty-five in England altogether where rock-salt is
                    raised). It was worked for about a hundred years in only its upper bed, but in
                    1781 its owners decided on sinking farther, and, after traversing a layer of
                    indurated clay intersected with small veins of salt 10½ yards thick, they came
                    on another of rock-salt. This—the bed which has continued to be worked ever
                    since—is 33 to 37 yards thick. Beneath it are others, but they are thin and
                    impure. The total depth of the mine to the bottom of the lower level is 120
                    yards. At Winsford, where the same formation seems to recur, it is 159 yards
                    from the surface. The Marston mine covers an area of about 40 acres. The salt is
                    first reached at 35-40 yards in the Northwich district, and the upper layer is
                    25-50 yards in thickness (Marston 23-26 yards); it has above it, apparently
                    lying in the recesses of its surface, a layer of saturated brine. This is the
                    brine which is raised at the various pumping stations in Northwich and elsewhere
                    around, and which serves when evaporated to produce white salt. The beds are
                    reached by sinking through the clays and variegated marls typical of this
                    formation. The salt is blasted out with gunpowder. The Middlesbrough deposit
                    bids fair soon to become of very great importance. It was discovered by Messrs
                    Bolckow and Vaughan in boring for water in 1862 at a depth of 400 yards, but was
                    not utilized, and was again found by Messrs Bell Bros. at Port Clarence at a
                    depth of 376 yards, and is being now worked by them, the heat used for
                    evaporation being the waste gases of their blast furnaces. Encouraged by their
                    success the Newcastle Chemical Company have also bored on the opposite side of
                    the river. They failed at first to find the salt, but ultimately succeeded by a
                    fresh boring. The extent of the bed is not yet ascertained, but evidently by the
                    failure of the Newcastle Chemical Company at first it cannot extend far to the
                    north. Its thickness has been proved in so far as the spot where Messrs Bell
                    Bros, made their boring is concerned. These gentlemen have introduced the method
                    employed at Nancy of raising the salt in the form of brine without the trouble
                    or expense of sinking a shaft. In Cheshire the surface-water trickling through
                    the overlying strata dissolves the salt, which is subsequently pumped as brine,
                    but here the great depth and impermeability of the strata precludes this, so
                    another method has been resorted to. A bore is made into the salt, and lined
                    with tubing in the usual manner, and this tube where it traverses the salt is
                    pierced with holes. Within this is hung loosely a second tube of much smaller
                    dimensions so as to leave an annular space between the two. Through this space
                    the fresh surface water finds its way, and dissolving the salt below rises in
                    the inner tube as brine, but only to such a level that the two columns bear to
                    one another the relation of ten to twelve, this being the inverse ratio of the
                    respective weights of saturated brine and fresh water. For the remaining
                    distance the brine is raised by a pump. At first, while the cavity remains
                    small, there is some difficulty in getting a continuous supply of brine of full
                    strength, but this ceases to be the case as the solution chamber (as it is
                    called) becomes enlarged. The fresh water, however, as it descends rises to the
                    surface of the salt, tending rather to dissolve its upper layers and extend
                    superficially, so that after a time the superincumbent soil, being without
                    support, falls in. These interior landslips, besides choking the pipes and
                    breaking the communication, often produce sinkings at the surface, such as
                    occurred some time ago at Dieuze (Lorraine). The same inconvenience is beginning
                    to make itself felt in the environs of Nancy, and a similar one produces on a
                    larger scale the sinking and subsidences at Winsford and Northwich so much
                    complained of. The deposits of salt in the United States are unimportant. The
                    country possesses no really considerable salt industry, but is supplied so far
                    as interior consumption is concerned to a small extent by brine springs. The
                    principal supplies, however, are derived from England and the shores of Spain
                    and Portugal. The same remark applies to Canada. South America possesses several
                    salt deposits and brine springs, but also takes all its supplies from Europe.
                    Asiatic Russia is very abundantly supplied with salt, as likewise is China; and
                    Persia is perhaps one of the countries most abundantly endowed with this natural
                    and useful product. British India cannot be said to be similarly favoured. In
                    the north, it is true, is the great salt range of the Punjab, as well as the
                    Sambhur Lake, and salt is obtained from sea-water at many places along its
                    extensive seaboard; but India is not well supplied in many parts, and is
                    dependent largely for this article on the Cheshire salt works. In fact this
                    export is one of the most important branches of their trade.</p>

                    Industrial Arts,</hi> &amp;c. The clay and insoluble matters given for the

                <p>Rock-salt is probably the origin of more than half the salt manufactured in the
                    world. It occurs in all degrees of purity, from that of mere salty clay to that
                    of the most transparent crystals. In the former case it is often difficult to
                    obtain the brine at a density even approaching saturation, and, as at Moutiers
                    in Savoy and in several of the German salt works, chambers and galleries are
                    excavated within the saliferous bed to increase the dissolving surface, and
                    water let down fresh is pumped up as brine. Many brine springs also occur in a
                    more or less saturated condition. In such cases the water is sometimes caused to
                    trickle over faggots arranged under large open sheds called “graduation houses
                    <hi rend="italic">” (Gradirhäuser),</hi> whereby a more extensive surface of

                <p>the brine becomes rapidly concentrated. Fig. 3 shows one of these “Gradirhauser.”
                    It consists of a long shed, the floor of which is a shallow cistern kept filled
                    with the brine to be concentrated, the body of the house being occupied by a
                    single or double row of faggots of blackthorn <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and
                    above these a trough or troughs <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> into which the brine
                    is pumped; escaping from these into the channel c, it is allowed to flow or drip
                    slowly over the faggots, and finds its way back to the basin beneath. The shed
                    has its sides open and exposed to the prevailing winds, and, the brine being
                    thus spread over a large surface, there is much scope for evaporation, and it
                    becomes rapidly concentrated. Several such sheds are often built in series, and
                    the brine, being conveyed from one to the other as it becomes denser, attains at
                    last a specific gravity of about 1·18, when it is stored in large cisterns till
                    required for evaporation. This is done in large iron pans by the method to be
                    hereafter described when speaking of rock-salt brine. The use, however, of the
                    “graduation houses” is dying out, except in particular localities where
                    competition from sea salt or purer rock-salt is difficult, as both their
                    construction and their maintenance are expensive. The purer rock-salt is often
                    simply ground for use, as we have seen to be the case at Wieliczka and
                    elsewhere, but it is more frequently pumped as brine, produced either by
                    artificial solution as at Middlesborough and other places, or by natural means
                    as in Cheshire and Worcestershire. One great drawback to the use of even the
                    purest rock-salt simply ground is its tendency to revert to a hard unwieldy
                    mass, when kept any length of time in sacks. This is partly but not wholly
                    obviated by packing in casks, which, however, are dear and not always
                    obtainable. As usually made, white salt from rock-salt may be classified into
                    two groups:—(1) boiled: known as fine, table, lump, stoved lump, superfine,
                    basket, butter, and cheese salt (Fr. <hi rend="italic">scl fin-fin, sel a la
                    minute,</hi> &amp;c.); (2) unboiled: common, chemical, fishery, Scotch fishery,
                    extra fishery, double extra fishery, and bay salt (Fr. <hi rend="italic">scl de
                    12, 24, 48, 60,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">72 heures).</hi> All these names are
                    derived from the size and appearance of the crystals, their uses, and the modes
                    of their production. The boiled salts, the crystals of which are small, are
                    formed in a medium constantly agitated by boiling. The fine or stoved table
                    salts aro those white masses with which we are all familiar. Basket salt takes
                    its name from the conical baskets from which it is allowed to drain when first
                    it is “drawn” from the pan. Butter and cheese salts are not stove-dried, but
                    left in their more or less moist condition, as being thus more easily applied to
                    their respective uses, of the unboiled salts the first two, corresponding to the
                    Fr. <hi rend="italic">sel de 12 heures</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sel de 24
                    heures,</hi> show by their English names the uses to which they are applied, and
                    the others, the applications of which are equally shown by their names, merely
                    depend for their quality on the length of time which elapses between successive
                    “drawings,” and the temperature of the evaporation. The time varies for the
                    unboiled salts from twelve hours to three or four weeks, the larger crystals
                    being allowed a longer time to form, and the smaller ones being formed more
                    quickly. The temperature varies from 55° to 180° Fahr.</p>
                <p>One striking difference between the manufacture of salt from rock-salt brine as
                    carried on in Britain and on the Continent lies in the almost exclusive use in
                    the latter case of closed or covered pans, except in the making of fine salt,
                    whereas in Britain open ones are employed. With open pans the vapour is free to
                    diffuse itself into the surrounding atmosphere, and the evaporation is perhaps
                    more rapid. When covered pans are used, the loss of heat by radiation is less,
                    and the salt made is also cleaner. In works published in France and Germany the
                    statement is frequently made that it would be impossible to sell there a grain
                    of salt manufactured by English methods, but one is fairly justified in doubting
                    this assertion, seeing the ease with which the public are induced to purchase
                    the <hi rend="italic">sel gris</hi> of the marais salants. In fact, it is
                    customary in some places to make a special article, which is sold in competition
                    with sea salt, by mixing with the purer one 10 or 12 per cent. of mud or earth.
                    The most advantageous mode of evaporation would evidently be to cause the heated
                    gases from the furnace to pass over the surface of the liquid itself. No
                    wearing-out of the pans need thus be feared, no lowering of the conductive power
                    by incrustation, but the vapour as fast as formed would diffuse itself into
                    heated air in rapid motion, this air being far from its point of saturation and
                    greedy of moisture. The plan, however, which was tried in Britain by otto Pohl
                    and in Germany by Born has hitherto been a failure, the salt being for one thing
                    very much soiled with the soot and other products of combustion. Again, this
                    mode of evaporation hardly consorts with the slow progress and perfect stillness
                    required for the production of the larger-grained salts, and gives only fine
                    salt.</p>
                <p>Figs. 4 and 5 represent a French pan, while fig. 6 is a British pan, only
                    differing from the Continental ones in not being covered in, and in usually
                    having three or four fires in place of two or three, and a separate chamber
                    beyond the pan in which the salt is stoved, heated by the flues conveying the
                    furnace gases to the chimney after leaving the pan. The first two represent a
                    pan of 64 feet long by 21½ feet wide filled with brine, &amp;c., and with
                    circulating flues beneath for economy of heat. This pan, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> is supported all round its lower edges on a wall and on the pillars <hi
                    rend="italic">b, b,</hi> and heated by two fires c, c. The flame and the heated
                    gases of each fire circulate in the flues <hi rend="italic">p, p, p,</hi> in
                    which are holes at various convenient points for cleaning; thus then these gases
                    are made to traverse the length of the pan three times before arriving at the
                    chimneys <hi rend="italic">n, n</hi> or the drying floors <hi rend="italic">o,
                    o.</hi> The channels <hi rend="italic">e, e</hi> beneath the flues (fig. 5)
                    serve to warm the air which feeds the fires, and, entering at the further end of
                    the pan, traverses them and issues warm into the ash pit <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">q, q, q,</hi> continuations of those below the pan, within
                    which circulate the heated gases on their way to the main chimney, and on this
                    floor is spread the salt to be dried. The floor of a pan is generally at first
                    slightly arched towards the centre, so that when new a pan is rather deeper at
                    the sides than in the middle, but they soon flatten out and warp in all
                    directions on being fired. This warping is a great inconvenience, opening
                    communications between the flues and interfering sadly with the arrangements of
                    these latter just described, so much so that some makers prefer simple iron or
                    brick supports placed here and there, without any definite arrange ment. On
                    the</p>
                <p>Continent the pan is often suspended by iron rods from the beams of the roof. The
                    warping or buckling, the scaling, and the formation of “cats,” as the workmen
                    call the sort of stalactites of salt which form in the flues, arising from leaks
                    in the pan, are perhaps among the worst annoyances of the saltmakers. The pans
                    are of ordinary boiler plates riveted together. The plates vary in size, but
                    usually are 2 feet by 4 feet, and rather smaller over the fire. The grate, which
                    should be such as to produce a moderate and diffused heat, is of the ordinary
                    kind, and the firing is usually done from a pit below the end of the pan. In
                    England they use “slack” sometimes called “burgey”; abroad they use all kinds of
                    fuel—wood, coal, lignite, and turf; and they also in many places are in the
                    habit of protecting the pan from the more intense heat immediately over the fire
                    c by a guard <hi rend="italic">t</hi> at that particular part. As a means of
                    producing a diffused and gentle heat without smoke, water gas will probably come
                    to be used by and by. On the Continent the flues are often 2 or 2 1/4 feet high,
                    and in Britain they are usually half that height. As, however, a slow and
                    regular draught is to be aimed at, on the principle enunciated by Mr Fredk.
                    Siemens, the Continental plan seems the more rational. Space does not here admit
                    of a description of the so-called machine pans—the clay pans of the Cheshire
                    Amalgamated Salt Company or Otto Pohl’s system.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Spoil’s <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedia of
                    the Industrial Arts,</hi> &amp;c.</p></note></p>
                <p>In Britain the brine is so pure that, keeping a small stream of it running into
                    the pan to replace the losses by evaporation and the removal of the salt, it is
                    only necessary occasionally (not often) to reject the mother-liquor when at last
                    it becomes too impure with magnesium chloride; but in some of the works on the
                    Continent, especially those of North Germany, the mother-liquor not only
                    contains more of this impurity but becomes quite brown from organic matter on
                    concentration, and totally unfit for further service after yielding but two or
                    three crops of salt crystals. Sometimes, to get rid of these impurities, the
                    brine is treated in a large tub <hi rend="italic">(bessoir)</hi> with lime; on
                    settling it becomes clear and colourless, but the dissolved lime forms a skin on
                    its surface in the pan, retards the evaporation, and impedes the
                    crystallization. At times sodium sulphate is added to the brine, producing
                    sodium chloride and magnesium sulphate by double decomposition with the
                    magnesium chloride. A slight degree of acidity seems more favourable to the
                    crystallization of salt than alkalinity; thus it is a practice to add a certain
                    amount of alum, 2 to 12 lb. per pan of brine, especially when, as in fishery
                    salt, fine crystals are required. The salt is “drawn” from the pan and placed
                    (in the case of boiled salts) in small conical baskets hung round the pan to
                    drain, and thence moulded in square boxes, and afterwards stove-dried, or (in
                    case of unboiled salts) " drawn” in a heap on to the “hurdles,” on which it
                    drains, and thence is carried to the store.</p>
                <p>In most Continental countries a heavy tax is laid on salt; and the coarser as
                    well as the finer crystals are therefore often dried so as not to pay duty on
                    more water than can be helped.</p>
                <p>The brine used in the salt manufacture in England is very nearly saturated,
                    containing 25 or 26 per cent. of sodium chloride, the utmost water can take up
                    being 27 per cent.; and it ranges from 38 to 42 ounces of salt per gallon. In
                    some other countries, as has been explained, the brine has to be concentrated
                    before use, and every ounce per gallon by which the brine is below saturation
                    indicates a difference of cost in the production from it of salt of about 4
                    1/4d. to 4 1/2d. per ton. Subjoined are four analyses of brine taken from Messrs
                    Richardson and Watts’s <hi rend="italic">Chemistry applied to the Arts and

                <p>The price of salt at the works may be said to range from 4s. 6d. to 6s. per ton,
                    the former being less than the cost price as given before the British
                    parliamentary commission in 1881. It is there stated to be—brine, 6d.; labour,
                    10d.; fuel 3s.; rent, interest, &amp;c., 1s.; total, 5s. 4d. Thus the margin for
                    profit is but small, almost the only gain being said to accrue from the
                    lightering, most of the salt manufacturers doing the carriage in their own “<hi

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0253-0234"/> Saltmaking is by no means an unhealthy trade,
                    some slight soreness of the eyes being the only affection sometimes complained
                    of; indeed, the atmosphere of steam saturated with salt in which the workmen
                    live seems specially preservative against colds, rheumatism, neuralgia, &amp;c.
                    It is said that wages are rather better and employment more regular in
                    Worcestershire than in Cheshire.</p>
                <p>The parliamentary commission above referred to was appointed with a view to the
                    investigation of the causes of the disastrous subsidences which are constantly
                    taking place in all the salt districts, and the provision of a remedy, ft led to
                    no legislative action; but the evil is recognized as a grave one. At Northwich
                    and Winsford scarcely a house or a chimney stack remains straight. Houses are
                    keyed up with “shaps,” “face plates,” and “bolts,” and only kept from falling by
                    leaning on one another. The doors and windows have become lozenge-shaped, the
                    walls bulged, and the floors crooked. Buildings have sunk,—some of them
                    disappearing altogether. Lakes have been formed where there was solid ground
                    before, and incalculable damage done to property in all quarters. At the same
                    time it is difficult to see how this grievance can be remedied without
                    inflicting serious injury, almost ruin, upon the salt trade. The workings in
                    Great Britain represent the abstraction of rather more than a cubic mile of rock
                    every five years, and of this by far the larger part is in Cheshire.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Ancient History and Religious Symbolism.—</hi> Indispensable as
                    the use of salt appears to us, it must have been quite unattainable to primitive
                    man in many parts of the world. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (xi. 122
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> speaks of inlanders (in Epirus ?) who do not know
                    the sea and use no salt with their food. In some parts of America, and even of
                    India (among the Todas), salt was first introduced by Europeans; and there are
                    still parts of central Africa where the use of it is a luxury confined to the
                    rich. Indeed, where men live mainly on milk and flesh, consuming the latter raw
                    or roasted, so that its salts are not lost, it is not necessary to add sodium
                    chloride, and thus we understand how the Numidian nomads in the time of Sallust
                    and the Bedouins of Hadramant at the present day never eat salt with their food.
                    On the other hand, cereal or vegetable diet calls for a supplement of salt, and
                    so does boiled meat. The important part played by the mineral in the history of
                    commerce and religion depends on this fact; at a very early stage of progress
                    salt became a necessary of life to most nations, and in many cases they could
                    procure it only from abroad, from the sea-coast, or from districts like that of
                    Palmyra where salty incrustations are found on the surface of the soil.
                    Sometimes indeed a kind of salt was got from the ashes of saline plants <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> by the Umbrians, Aristotle, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Met.,</hi> ii. p. 459), or by pouring the water of a brackish stream over a
                    fire of (saline) wood and collecting the ashes, as was done in ancient Germany
                    (Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> xiii. 57), in Gaul, and in Spain (Plin., <hi
                    rend="italic">H. N.,</hi> xxxi. 7, 82 <hi rend="italic">sq.);</hi> but these
                    were imperfect surrogates. Among inland peoples a salt spring was regarded as a
                    special gift of the gods. The Chaonians in Epirus had one which flowed into a
                    stream where there were no fish; and the legend was that Heracles had allowed
                    their forefathers to have salt instead of fish (Arist., <hi rend="italic">ut
                    supra).</hi> The Germans waged war for saline streams, and believed that the
                    presence of salt in the soil invested a district with peculiar sanctity and made
                    it a place where prayers were most readily heard (Tac., <hi rend="italic">ut
                    sup.).</hi> That a religious significance was attached to a substance so highly
                    prized and which was often obtained with difficulty is no more than natural. And
                    it must also be remembered that the habitual use of salt is intimately connected
                    with the advance from nomadic to agricultural life, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>.,
                    with precisely that step in civilization which had most influence on the cults
                    of almost all ancient nations. The gods were worshipped as the givers of the
                    kindly fruits of the earth, and, as all over the world “bread and salt” go
                    together in common use and common phrase, salt was habitually associated with
                    offerings, at least with all offerings which consisted in whole or in part of
                    cereal elements. This practice is found alike among the Greeks and Romans and
                    among the Semitic peoples (Lev. ii. 13); Homer calls salt “divine,” and Plato
                    names it “a substance dear to the gods” <hi rend="italic">(Timaeus,</hi> p. 60;
                    comp. Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Sympos.,</hi> v. 10). As covenants were
                    ordinarily made over a sacrificial meal, in which salt was a necessary element,
                    the expression “a covenant of salt” (Numb, xviii. 19) is easily understood; it
                    is probable, however, that the preservative qualities of salt were held to make
                    it a peculiarly fitting symbol of an enduring compact, and influenced the choice
                    of this particular element of the covenant meal as that which was regarded as
                    sealing an obligation to fidelity. Among the ancients, as among orientals down
                    to the present day, every meal that included salt had a certain sacred character
                    and created a bond of piety and guest friendship between the participants. Hence
                    the Greek phrase άλας Καί τράπεδαυ</p>
                <p>παραβαίυειν, the Arab phrase “there is salt between us,” the expression “to eat
                    the salt of the palace” (Ezra iv. 14, Rev. Ver.), the modern Persian phrase <hi
                    rend="italic">namak harâm,</hi> “untrue to salt,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    disloyal or ungrateful, and many others.</p>
                <p>It has been plausibly conjectured that the oldest trade routes were created for
                    traffic in salt; at any rate salt and incense, the chief economic and religious
                    necessaries of the ancient world, play a great part in all that we know of the
                    ancient highways of commerce. Thus one of the oldest roads in Italy is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Via Salaria,</hi> by which the produce of the salt pans of Ostia
                    was carried up into the Sabine country. Herodotus’s account of the caravan route
                    uniting the salt-oases of the Libyan desert (iv. 181 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi>
                    makes it plain that this was mainly a salt-road, and to the present day the
                    caravan trade of the Sahara is largely a trade in salt. The salt of Palmyra was
                    an important element in the vast trade between the Syrian ports and the Persian
                    Gulf (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmyra,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 200), and long after
                    the glory of the great merchant city was past “the salt of Tadinor” retained its
                    reputation (Mas'ûdi, viii. 398). In like manner the ancient trade between the
                    AEgean and the coasts of southern Russia was largely dependent on the salt pans
                    at the mouth of the Dnieper and on the salt fish brought from this district
                    (Herod., iv. 53; Dio Chrys., p. 437). In Phoenician commerce salt and salt
                    fish—the latter a valued delicacy in the ancient world—always formed an
                    important item. The vast salt mines of northern India were worked before the
                    time of Alexander (Strabo, v. 2, 6, xv. 1, 30) and must have been the centre of
                    a widespread trade. The economic importance of salt is further indicated by the
                    almost universal prevalence in ancient and mediaeval times, and indeed in most
                    countries down to the present day, of salt taxes or of Government monopolies,
                    which have not often been directed, as they were in ancient Rome, to enable
                    every one to procure so necessary a condiment at a moderate price. In oriental
                    systems of taxation high imposts on salt are never lacking and are often carried
                    out in a very oppressive way, one result of this being that the article is apt
                    to reach the consumer in a very impure state largely mixed with earth. “The salt
                    which has lost its savour” (Mat. v. 13) is simply the earthy residuum of such an
                    impure salt after the sodium chloride has been washed out.</p>
                <p>Cakes of salt have been used as money in more than one part of the world,—for
                    example, in Abyssinia and elsewhere in Africa, and in Tibet and adjoining parts.
                    See the testimony of Marco Polo (bk. ii. ch. 48) and Col. Yule’s note upon
                    analogous customs elsewhere and on the use of salt as a medium of exchange in
                    the Shan markets down to our own time, in his translation of Polo, ii. 48 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi> In the same work interesting details are given as to the
                    importance of salt in the financial system of the Mongol emperors (ii. 200 <hi
