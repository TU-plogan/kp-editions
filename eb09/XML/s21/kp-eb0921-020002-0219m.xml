                    nearest point of the mainland, the distance is 166 miles, and from the Cameroons
                    297. The extreme length of the island is 32 miles and the breadth from west to
                    east 21; the area is estimated at 355 square miles. From the coast it rises
                    pretty uniformly towards the lofty and verdant mountains, in the midst of which
                    the peak of St Thomas towers to a height of 6000 feet. At least a hundred
                    streams great and small rush down the mountainsides through deep-cut ravines,
                    many of them forming beautiful waterfalls, such as those of Blu-blu, &amp;c., on
                    the Agua Grande. The bi-seasonal climate of the tropics obtains a comparatively
                    normal development on the island, which, however, has a very evil repute of
                    unhealthiness, probably owing to the fact that the chief town occupies a
                    peculiarly malarial site on the coast. The first object of European cultivation
                    in St Thomas was sugar, and to this the colony owed its prosperity in the 16th
                    century; but now it is quite displaced by coffee and cocoa, introduced in the
                    beginning of the 19th century. In 1879-80 the export of coffee was 3,778,580 ft)
                    and of cocoa 1,026,746 ft). Vanilla and cinchona bark both succeed well, the
                    latter between 1800 and 3300 feet of altitude. Though nearly the whole surface
                    of the island is fitted for cultivation, only about a fifth part is really
                    turned to account. Along with Principe, St Thomas forms a Portuguese province,
                    to which are attached the little island of Rolas and the petty fort of Ajuda on
                    the Guinea coast.</p>
                <p>The town of St Thomas, the capital of the province, is situated on the north-east
                    coast of the island, and the neighbouring districts form the only well-peopled
                    region. In 1878 the population in the island was 18,266, of whom 1200 were
                    white. The great bulk consisted of a mixture of Negroes from various parts of
                    the West Coast, mainly introduced as slaves, and now all using a Negro
                    Portuguese—“lingua de S. Thomé.” On the south-west coast are<pb break="no"

                <p>St Thomas was discovered about the close of 1470 by the Portuguese navigators
                    João de Santarem and Pero de Escobar, who in the beginning of the following year
                    discovered Annobom (“Good Year”). They found St Thomas uninhabited. The first
                    attempts at colonization were João de Paiva’s in 1485; but nothing permanent was
                    accomplished till 1493, when a body of criminals and of young Jews torn from
                    their parents to be baptized were sent to the island, and the present capital
                    was founded by Alvaro de Carminha. Considerable progress had been made by the
                    16th century; but in 1567 the settlement was attacked by the French, and in 1574
                    the Angolares began those raids which only ended with their subjugation in 1693.
                    In 1595 there was a slave revolt; and from 1641 to 1844 the Dutch, who had
                    plundered the capital in 1600, held possession of the island. The French did
                    great damage in 1709; and in the course of the century internal anarchy reduced
                    St Thomas to a deplorable state.</p>
