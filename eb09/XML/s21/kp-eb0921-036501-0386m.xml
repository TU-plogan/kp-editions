                    appears to have been known to the Greeks as early as the 3d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and is supposed to have been one of the medicines
                    recommended to Alfred the Great by Helias, patriarch of Jerusalem <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cockayne Leechdoms,</hi> vol. ii. pp. xxiv., 289, 175; 273, 281).
                    The scammony plant is a native of the countries of the eastern part of the
                    Mediterranean basin, growing in bushy waste places, from Syria in the south to
                    the Crimea in the north, its range extending westward to the Greek islands, but
                    not to northern Africa or Italy. It is a twining perennial, bearing flowers like
                    those of <hi rend="italic">Convolvulus arvensis,</hi> and having irregularly
                    arrow-shaped leaves and a thick fleshy root. The drug is collected principally
                    in Asia Minor, and near Aleppo in Syria, although a little is obtained from the
                    neighbourhood of Mount Carmel and the Lake of Tiberias. The principal places of
                    export are Smyrna and Aleppo (Scanderoon), but the drug often bears in commerce
                    the name of the district where it was collected, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    Broussa, Angora, &amp;c. Formerly Aleppo scammony was considered the best and
                    commanded the highest price, but at present the purest article comes from
                    Smyrna. The very variable quality of the drug has led to the use of the resin
                    prepared directly from the root, which affords it to the extent of 5½</p>
                <p>per cent., and an establishment for its manufacture was founded at Broussa in
                    1870. The dried root is also exported to England, and the resin prepared from it
                    there. By purification the resin can be obtained almost white. The crude resin
                    obtained from the root, being free from gum, does not present a milky appearance
                    when rubbed with a wetted finger, and is thus easily distinguished from the
                    natural product.</p>
                <p>Scammony is used in medicine as a safe but energetic purgative, and is frequently
                    prescribed in combination with calomel and colocynth. Its medicinal activity is
                    due to the resin scammonin, which is also called jalapin from its occurrence in
                    the root of the male jalap <hi rend="italic">(Ipomaea orizabensis),</hi> and of
                    Tampico jalap (<hi rend="italic">I</hi>. <hi rend="italic">simulans)</hi> (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Jalap).</hi> The export of scammony from Smyrna in 1881 was
                    only 97 boxes, valued at .£544, the amount having decreased of late years owing
                    to the increased export of the root from Syria. More than half of this quantity
                    was taken by England, about one-fourth by France, and the remainder by Italy,
                    America, and Austria.</p>
                <p>The drug is obtained from the root by slicing off obliquely one or two inches
                    from the crown and allowing the milky juice which exudes to drain into a small
                    shell (generally that of a freshwater mussel), which is inserted in the root
                    just below the base of the incision. To prevent the juice from becoming soiled,
                    the earth is scraped away so as to leave exposed four or five inches of the
                    root. The shells are collected in the evening and their contents emptied into a
                    copper or leathern vessel,—the scrapings from the surface of the root,
                    consisting of partially dried tears, being added. On the average, about one
                    drachm is afforded by each incision; a plant four years old may give two
                    drachms; in rare cases as much as twelve drachms has been obtained from a single
                    large root. The collection usually takes place when the plant is in flower
                    towards the end of summer. The product of different roots naturally varies in
                    quality, and the peasants therefore, on arrival at their homes, render it
                    uniform by mixing it with a knife. It is then spread out in the air to dry.
                    Sometimes the gathering of several days is allowed to accumulate, and then
                    moistened, kneaded, and made up into cakes. During the drying it appears to
                    undergo a kind of fermentation, which gives the drug a slightly porous
                    appearance and dark colour. Frequently it is adulterated by adding 40 per cent.
                    of flour and earthy matter. It then assumes a paler colour and opaque
                    appearance, and loses its brittleness. This adulterated article is known as
                    “skilip,” and the pure article as “virgin” scammony. The latter is met with in
                    the form of flattened pieces half an inch or more in thickness, with a blackish,
                    resinous fracture, thin fragments being translucent. Externally it is often
                    covered with a greyish powder. The odour, when a piece is freshly broken, is
                    cheesy; when chewed, it leaves an acrid sensation in the throat. Scammony of
                    good quality should yield to ether 80 to 90 per cent. of resin; the remainder
                    consists of gum and mineral matter.</p>
