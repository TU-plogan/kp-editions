                    Literature in Scotland, as distinct from England, dates from the time of <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Columba</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> Adamnan, abbot
                    of Iona, who in 690 wrote in Latin the life of his predecessor, may be regarded
                    as the first author that Scotland produced. In addition to his biography of St
                    Columba, a long extract from a work of his on the “Holy Places” is incorporated
                    by Bede in his <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History.</hi> The greater part
                    of Scotland was at that time inhabited by a Celtic population and the period
                    from the 7th to the 13th century has left but few literary remains (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Celtic Literature,</hi> vol. v. p. 313). In the latter part
                    of the 13th century what may be called the ancient literary language of Scotland
                    was used in the district between the Humber and the Forth and coastwise as far
                    north as Aberdeen. Its earliest writer is Thomas of Ercildoune, or Thomas the
                    Rhymer, who reached the height of his fame in 1280. The fairy tale or romance
                    that bears his name may be regarded as the earliest example of romance poetry in
                    Britain. Nearly contemporary with the Rhymer were two other distinguished Scots,
                    Michael <hi rend="smallcaps">Scot</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) and John of
                    Duns, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Duns</hi> Scotus (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">,</hi> both of whom, however, wrote in Latin. Three
                    Arthurian romances taken from Anglo-Norman sources relating to Sir Gawain, one
                    of the most celebrated knights of the Round Table, seem to have been composed
                    about the end of the 13th century. These were— <hi rend="italic">Syr Gawayn and
                        the Grene Knycht,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Knightly Tale of Golagros and
                        Gawayne,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Awntyrs of Arthur at the
                        Ternewathelyne.</hi> Sir Gawain’s exploits were so popular in the south of
                    Scotland that he was claimed by the people as one of their own chieftains and
                    called the lord of Galloway. The <hi rend="italic">Awntyrs of Arthur,</hi> or
                    the adventures of King Arthur at the Tern-wadling, a small lake near Carlisle,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Pystil of Swete Susan,</hi> a version of the
                    apocryphal story of Susanna, are supposed to have been the productions of Sir
                    Hew of Eglintoun about that period. The <hi rend="italic">Taill of Rauf
                        Coilzear,</hi> in which the adventures of the emperor Charlemagne in the
                    house of a charcoal-burner named Ralph in the neighbourhood of Paris are related
                    with much poetic humour, and the fairy tale of <hi rend="italic">Orfeo and
                        Heurodis</hi> were written in the early part of the 14th century and were
                    very popular in Scotland in former times.</p>
                <p>The War of Independence gave a new impetus to Scottish nationality and produced a
                    corresponding effect on the literature of the country. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Brus,</hi> or metrical account of the deeds of Robert Bruce, was written by
                    John <hi rend="smallcaps">Barbour</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> archdeacon
                    of Aberdeen, in the latter part of the 14th century. To him we owe a translation
                    of a mediaeval romance on the <hi rend="italic">Trojan War,</hi> nearly 3000
                    lines in length, and a large collection of metrical lives of saints, which,
                    after being long preserved in manuscript, have recently been printed by Dr
                    Horstmann. About this time was compiled the first formal history of Scotland by
                    John of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fordun</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> which was
                    written in Latin and brought down to the death of David I. He, however, left
                    materials for the completion of the work, the last date of which is 1385. In
                    1441 a continuation of it was made by Walter Bower or Bowmaker. The whole work
                    was then styled the <hi rend="italic">Scotichronicon,</hi> and brings the
                    history of Scotland down to 1437. A metrical history was written between 1420
                    and 1424 by Andrew of Wyntoun, a canon regular of St Andrews and prior of St
                    Serf’s Inch in Loch Leven. This work, known as the <hi rend="italic">Orygynale
                        Cronykil of Scotland,</hi> is prefaced by an account of the human race from
                    the creation, and, although for the most part its verse is homely and dull, its
                    author occasionally describes stirring incidents with considerable power. The
                    beautiful poem of James I. called <hi rend="italic">The Kingis Quhair,</hi>
                    written about this period, was far in advance of the contemporary metrical
                    chronicles. It possesses a melody of verse unknown before and gives the king a
                    conspicuous place in early Scottish literature. He is supposed to have also
                    written <hi rend="italic">A Ballad of Good Counsel</hi> and a song <hi
                        rend="italic">On Absence·,</hi> but two poems, <hi rend="italic">Christis

                    believed to have been his composition, have been recently shown by the Rev. W.
                    W. Skeat to be by some other early poet. An allegorical poem called the <hi
                        rend="italic">Buke of the Howlat</hi> was written about 1450 by Sir Richard
                    Holland, an adherent of the noble family of Douglas. It is a warning against
                    pride, exemplified by the owl, decked out in the splendour of borrowed feathers,
                    compelled on account of his insolence to resume his original form. The poem
                    displays some inventive and descriptive power, though marred by its
                    alliteration. The exploits of Sir William Wallace found<pb break="no"

                    Minstrel, or Blind Harry, who, born with such a serious defect, must be regarded
                    as one of the most extraordinary individuals recorded in the annals of
                    literature. His well-known poem, which bears the name of his hero, is in
                    versification, expression, and poetic imagery a remarkable production for that
                    period. The grave and thoughtful poetry of Robert <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Henryson</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> notary public and preceptor in
                    the Benedictine convent at Dunfermline, who flourished about 1470, contrasts
                    favourably with that of his English contemporaries. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Testament of Cresseid</hi> was often incorporated in the old editions of
                    the works of Chaucer, to whose poetry it is not inferior. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Robene and Makyne</hi> is the earliest specimen of pastoral poetry in the
                    Scottish language. These, with his <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> and other
                    works, entitle him to a high place amongst the early Scottish poets. Nearly
                    coeval with Henryson was Sir Gilbert Hay, chamberlain to Charles VI. of France,
                    who made several translations from the works of French authors. One of these,
                    taken from a popular French romance of Alexander the Great, extends to upwards
                    of 20,000 lines. A long anonymous poem called <hi rend="italic">Clariodus</hi>
                    belongs to this period. It is a romance founded on a French original, the more
                    material incidents of which are supposed to have happened at the English court.
                    It abounds with illustrations of the manners and customs peculiar to the age of
                    chivalry. Being nearly 3000 lines in length, it is, like the last-mentioned, an
                    extensive specimen of the language and versification of the time. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Thrie Tales of the Thrie Preistis of Peblis</hi> (1490), the
                    authorship of which is unknown, are moral tales possessing considerable
                    freshness. As a fragment of an old version of them occurs in the Asloan MS.,
                    written in 1490, they must have existed long before the edition printed by Henry
                    Charteris in 1603, in which form only they are now accessible. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Ledger</hi> of Andrew Halyburton, conservator of the
                    privileges of the Scottish nation in the Netherlands, 1492-1503, is a valuable
                    source of information regarding the early trade of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The close of the 15th century exhibited a considerable growth of literary ability
                    in the writings of William <hi rend="smallcaps">Dunbar</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                        >q.v</hi>.) and his contemporaries. His works were so highly esteemed at the
                    time he wrote that he was raised to the dignity of “the makar” or poet-laureate
                    of Scotland. Such of Dunbar’s writings as have come down to the present time are
                    of a miscellaneous character, in which there is much power of description and
                    command of verse. The <hi rend="italic">Thistle and the Rose</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Golden Targe</hi> are excellent specimens of his poetic power.
                    His satirical poems, such as the <hi rend="italic">Twa Mariit Wemen and the
                        Wedo</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Flyting with Kennedie,</hi> contain much
                    coarse humour. Seven of his poems were the first specimens of Scottish
                    typography, having been printed by Chepman and Myllar at Edinburgh in 1508,
                    followed in 1509 by the well-known <hi rend="italic">Breviary</hi> for the
                    church of Aberdeen. A humorous poem called the <hi rend="italic">Freiris of
                        Berwik</hi> has been attributed to Dunbar and is usually printed with his
                    works. Contemporary with Dunbar were a number of minor Scottish poets, of whose
                    works only a few specimens have come down to the present time. These were Walter
                    Kennedie, with whom he had his “flyting” or poetical contest, Sir John Rowll,
                    Quintyne Shaw, Patrick Johnestoun, Merseir, James Afflek, and others.<note

                    prefixed a prologue:</p>
                <p>the one before the twelfth is an admirable descriptive poem of the beauties of
                    May. His <hi rend="italic">Palice of Honour</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kyng
                        Hart,</hi> two allegorical poems, are able productions, the latter of which
                    is full of dramatic vigour. Contemporary with Douglas was Sir David <hi

                    king-of-arms in the reign of James V., who may be regarded as the most popular
                    of the early Scottish poets. His <hi rend="italic">Monarchie, or ane Dialog
                        betuix Experience and ane Courteour of the Miserabyl Estait of the

                    rendered it very popular in its time. His <hi rend="italic">Satire of the Thrie
                        Estaitis</hi> is a skilfully written attempt to reform the abuses of the
                    period, especially those of the church. While some of its characters recite long
                    and erudite political speeches, he introduces interludes of a farcical kind
                    suited to the tastes of the times. This work may be considered the first
                    dramatic effort of any British author. In his <hi rend="italic">Testament of
                        Squire Meldrum</hi> he relates the adventures of his hero with much poetic
                    fire. Lyndsay’s other poems consist of appeals to the king for advancement and
                    some <hi rend="italic">jeux d’esprit</hi> of no great length. One of the best
                    scholars and teachers of this period was John Major or Mair, a native of
                    Haddington, who was principal of St Salvator’s College, St Andrews. Besides
                    being the author of learned commentaries on Aristotle, he wrote a well-known
                    work, <hi rend="italic">De historia gentis Scotorum libri sex,</hi> printed in
                    1521. Another Scottish author that wrote in Latin with considerable elegance was
                    Hector <hi rend="smallcaps">Boece</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> principal
                    of King’s College, Aberdeen. His great work, <hi rend="italic">Historia gentis
                        Scotorum a prima gentis origine,</hi> was published in Paris in 1526. It was
                    translated into Scottish by John Bellenden, archdeacon of Moray, under the title
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Hystory and Croniklis of Scotland,</hi> printed at
                    Edinburgh in 1536. Bellenden also translated the first five books of Livy into
                    Scottish. The <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of Boece was versified in
                    Scottish in 1531-35 by William Stewart, a descendant of the first earl of
                    Buchan. It was written by command of Margaret, sister of Henry VIII. of England,
                    for the instruction of her son, the youthful James V. A Latin poem of much
                    merit, entitled <hi rend="italic">De animi tranquillitate,</hi> was published in
                    1543 by Florence Wilson, master of Carpentras School. It is in the form of a
                    dialogue and displays much variety of knowledge, while its Latinity has long
                    been celebrated. In an anonymous work, written in 1548 or 1549, and called the
                        <hi rend="italic">Complaynt of Scotland,</hi> the author deplores the
                    calamities to which Scotland was then subject. These are stated to be the wrongs
                    done to the Scottish labourers at the hands of the landholders and the clergy,
                    the difficulties with England, and the treachery of the Scottish nobility. The
                    work is valuable as affording a glimpse of the literature then popular in
                    Scotland, some pieces of which are no longer to be found,—such as <hi

                <p>In 1552 there was printed at St Andrews a <hi rend="italic">Catechism, that is to

                    archbishop of St Andrews, the last primate of the Roman Catholic faith in
                    Scotland. The poems of Sir Richard Maitland, which are of a somewhat satirical
                    kind, are valuable, as they, like those of Lyndsay, contain much information
                    about the abuses of the time (1560), such as the oppressive conduct of the
                    landholders, vexatious lawsuits, and the depredations of the Border thieves. Sir
                    Richard deserves the thanks of posterity for the large manuscript collection of
                    poems by Scottish authors which he and his daughter formed, and which is now
                    preserved in the Pepysian Library, at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The name of

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0567-0542"/> Bannatyne is inseparably connected with the
                    history of Scottish poetry, as in 1568 he too formed an extensive collection of
                    Scottish poetry which is certainly the most valuable now extant. It was written
                    by him at Edinburgh in the time of the plague, when the dread of infection
                    confined him closely at home. The <hi rend="italic">Bannatyne MS.</hi> now
                    preserved in the Advocates’ Library extends to 800 pages folio, and includes
                    several of Bannatyne’s own poems, of which the two most considerable are of an
                    amatory character. The works of Alexander Scott, consisting principally of love
                    poems, embrace also a spirited account of a <hi rend="italic">Jousting betwix
                        Adamson and Sym</hi> at the Drum, a place a little to the south of
                    Edinburgh. The author, who was one of the most elegant poets of this period, has
                    sometimes been called the “Scottish Anacreon.” Two poems of some merit—the <hi

                        Puir Scolar—</hi> were written by Alexander Arbuthnot, principal of King’s
                    College, Aberdeen, about 1570. A poem of considerable length, called the <hi

                    by Robert Semple, who also wrote an attack on Archbishop Adamson, called the <hi

                    period belong two poems of considerable length— the <hi rend="italic">Court of
                        Venus (1575),</hi> an imitation of the <hi rend="italic">Palice of
                        Honour</hi> of Gawyn Douglas, and the romance of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Seaven Seages</hi> (1578), a Scottish version of one of the most remarkable
                    mediaeval collections of stories belonging to the same class as the <hi
                        rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> in which one single story is employed as
                    a means of stringing together a multitude of subsidiary tales. These poems were
                    written by John Rolland, notary in Dalkeith. One of the best Latin scholars that
                    modern Europe has produced was George <hi rend="smallcaps">Buchanan</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> who flourished in the middle of the 16th century.
                    He wrote several Latin tragedies and an unrivalled translation of the Psalms.
                    His <hi rend="italic">De jure regni apud Scotos</hi> was composed to instruct
                    James VI., to whom he had been tutor, in the duties belonging to his kingly
                    office. His last and most important labour was his <hi rend="italic">History of
                        Scotland,</hi> originally printed in 1582, of which seventeen editions have
                    appeared. An excellent specimen of the ancient vernacular language is the <hi
                        rend="italic">Chronicle of Scotland</hi> by Robert Lyndsay of Pitscottie. It
                    includes the period from 1436 to the marriage of Mary to Darnley in 1565.
                    Although its author was a simple-minded and credulous man, he describes events
                    of which he was an eye-witness with circumstantiality and great prolixity of
                    detail. Another historical work of greater importance was the <hi rend="italic"
                        >De origine, morilrus, et rebus gestis Scotorum</hi> (1578) by John Lesley,
                    bishop of Ross. A translation of this work made by Father James Dalrymple, a
                    religious in the Scottish cloister of Ratisbon, 1596, is in course of
                    publication by the Rev. Father E. B. Cody for the Scottish Text Society. Lesley
                    also wrote in Scottish a <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi> from the
                    death of James I. in 1436 to the year 1561. This work, intended for the perusal
                    of Mary while in captivity in England, is written in an elegant style. The
                    bishop was the champion of that unfortunate queen, and in 1569 wrote a <hi
                        rend="italic">Defence of the Honour of Marie Queue of Scotland and Dowager
                        of France,</hi> with a declaration of her right, title, and interest to the
                    succession of the crown of England.</p>
                <p>The Reformation exerted a considerable influence on Scottish literature. Amongst
                    the earliest Protestant writers of the country may be mentioned Alexander Ales
                    or Alesius, a native of Edinburgh, who published several controversial works and
                    commentaries on various parts of the Bible. But the most eminent promoter of the
                    reform was John <hi rend="smallcaps">Knox (</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                        q.v.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">),</hi> who wrote several controversial
                    pamphlets and some religious treatises; his great work was the <hi rend="italic"
                        >History of the Reformation of Religion in Scotland,</hi> first printed in
                    1586. One of the principal opponents of Knox was Ninian</p>
                <p>Winzet, a priest of considerable ability and one familiar with the scholastic
                    learning of the age. He began life as master of Linlithgow school and
                    subsequently became abbot of St James’s at Ratisbon. He wrote several tracts in
                    which he strenuously recommended the observance of certain popish festivals. In
                    1562 he published his <hi rend="italic">Buke of Four Scoir Thrie Questions
                        tucking Doctrine, Ordour, and Maneris proponit to the Prechouris of the
                        Protestantis in Scotland and deliverit to Jhone Knox the 20th day of
                        February 1562.</hi> The writings of James VI., who was a man of scholarly
                    attainments, embrace several works both in poetry and prose. His earliest
                    production, published in 1584, when he was only eighteen, was the <hi
                        rend="italic">Essayes of a Prentice in the Divine Art of Poesie.</hi> This
                    was followed by his poetical <hi rend="italic">Exercises at Vacant Houres</hi>
                    (1591). He also wrote a great many sonnets and a translation of the Psalms. His
                    prose works are <hi rend="italic">Daemonologie</hi> (1597), Βασιλικόν Δώρον
                    (1599), <hi rend="italic">Counterblast to Tobacco, Paraphrase on Revelation, Law
                        of Free Monarchies,</hi> &amp;c. Among the Scottish poets who frequented his
                    court were William Fowler, the elegant translator of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Triumphs</hi> of Petrarch, and Stewart of Baldinnies (Perth), a translator
                    of Ariosto. Both these poets wrote other works which exist in MS., but are still
                    unpublished. The zeal of Sir David Lyndsay and others for the reformation of the
                    church initiated a religious revival, and in 1597 was published the
                    collection-known as <hi rend="italic">Ane Compendious Booke of Godly and
                        Spiritual Sangs for avoiding of Sinne and Harlotrie.</hi> This very curious
                    work is attributed to John and Robert Wedderburn, the latter of whom was vicar
                    of Dundee. A number of religious poems were written about the end of the 16th
                    century by James Melville, minister of Anstruther, afterwards of Kilrenny, both
                    in Fife. His <hi rend="italic">Morning Vision,</hi> printed in 1598, consists of
                    paraphrases of the Lord’s Prayer, the Shorter Catechism, and the Ten
                    Commandments. He also wrote the <hi rend="italic">Black Bastel,</hi> a
                    lamentation over the Church of Scotland, which is dated 1611. Another religious
                    poet was James Cockburn, a native of Lanarkshire, who wrote <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gabriel's Salutation to Marie</hi> (1605), and some other poems not
                    destitute of merit. An eminent theological writer of this era, Robert Rollock,
                    first principal of the university of Edinburgh, wrote many commentaries on the
                    Scriptures which show extensive learning. Most are in Latin; but one or two are
                    in the Scottish language. A very popular poem, the <hi rend="italic">Cherrie and
                        the Slae,</hi> first printed by Waldegrave at Edinburgh in 1597, afterwards
                    went through many editions. Its author was Alexander Montgomerie, who also wrote
                    some translations of the Psalms and the <hi rend="italic">Flyting betwixt
                        Montgomerie and Polwarth,</hi> in imitation of Dunbar’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Flyting with Kennedie.</hi> In 1599 was published an interesting volume of
                    poems written by Alexander Hume, entitled <hi rend="italic">Hymnes or Sacred
                        Songs, wherein the Right Use of Poesie may be espied.</hi> One is on the
                    defeat of the Spanish Armada. To the beginning of the 17th century belongs a
                    comedy in rhyming stanza, the authorship of which is unknown,— <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ane verie Excellent and Delectabili Treatise intitulit Philotus, quhairin
                        we may perceive the Greit Inconveniences that fallis out in the Marriage
                        betuix Aige and Youth</hi> (1603). Its versification is easy and pleasant,
                    and its plan a nearer approximation to the modern drama than the satire of
                    Lyndsay. In the same year appeared the poems of Sir William <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Alexander</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> earl of Stirling. One, called
                        <hi rend="italic">Doomsday, or the Great Day of the Lord's Judgment,</hi>
                    consists of 11,000 verses. His <hi rend="italic">Monarchicke Tragedies,</hi>
                    four in number, were not intended for representation on the stage. His
                    exhortation or <hi rend="italic">Paraenesis to Prince Henry</hi> (1604) is his
                    best poem. He also wrote <hi rend="italic">Recreations with the Muses</hi>
                    (1637), which is of a somewhat philosophical character. One of the most
                    distinguished writers of this era was William <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Drummond</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> of Hawthornden, who<pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n568/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0568-0543"/> published <hi rend="italic">Poem</hi> s, <hi
                        rend="italic">amorous, funerali, divine, pastorall</hi> (1616), and <hi
                        rend="italic">Flowers of Zion, or Spiritual Poems</hi> (1623). He also wrote
                    a <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland during the Reigns of the Five
                        Jameses</hi> (1655), some political tracts, and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cypress Grove,</hi> a moral treatise in prose. As a writer of sonnets he
                    has always been highly esteemed. Nearly contemporary with Drummond was Patrick
                    Hannay, a native of Galloway, who seems to have followed James to England. He
                    published his poems in 1622, the principal of which are <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philomela the Nightingale</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sheretrine and
                        Mariana.</hi> He occupies a favourable position amongst the minor Scottish
                    poets. After the removal of the Scottish court to London and the union of the
                    crowns in 1603, the old language began to be considered as a provincial dialect;
                    and the writers subsequent to Drummond, who was the first Scottish poet that
                    wrote well in English, take their places amongst British authors.</p>
                <p>To the short sketch above given may be added a notice of the early Scottish
                    writers on mathematics, philosophy, jurisprudence, and medicine. In mathematical
                    science the name of Joannes Sacro Bosco (John Holywood or Holybush) may be
                    mentioned, as he is believed to have been a native of Nithsdale and a canon of
                    the monastery of Holywood, from which he took his name. He flourished about the
                    beginning of the 13th century, and his treatise <hi rend="italic">Dc Sphera
                        Mundi</hi> was very generally taught in colleges and schools. The system of
                    astronomy and the other mathematical treatises of James Bassantie, who taught at
                    Paris about 1560 with much success, were celebrated in their time. The greatest
                    of the Scottish mathematicians, however, was John <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Napier</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.</hi>) of Merchiston, who wrote on
                    various kindred subjects, and in 1614 astonished the world by his discovery of
                    logarithms. In philosophy, besides the voluminous works of Duns Scotus and John
                    Major already mentioned, various learned commentaries on Aristotle, of which
                    Scottish philosophy then almost entirely consisted, were published by Robert
                    Balfour, principal of the college of Guienne; by John Rutherford, professor of
                    philosophy at St Andrews (under whom Admirable Crichton was a pupil); and by
                    James Cheyne, professor of philosophy at Douai. In jurisprudence a celebrated
                    treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Feudal Law</hi> was written by Sir Thomas
                    Craig about 1603. It was not, however, published till about half a century after
                    his death, as the printing of any treatise on the law of Scotland while he lived
                    seems to have been considered as out of the question. Commentaries on some of
                    the titles of the <hi rend="italic">Pandects</hi> of Justinian, and a treatise
                        <hi rend="italic">De Potestate Papae</hi> (1609), in opposition to the
                    usurpation of temporal power by the pope, were written by William Barclay,
                    professor of law in the university of Angers. Another early legal work was a
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Connexion between Government and
                        Religion,</hi> by Adam Blackwood, judge of the parlement of Poitiers, who
                    was the antagonist of Buchanan and a strenuous defender of Mary queen of Scots.
                    In medicine the principal early Scottish works were written by Duncan Liddell, a
                    native of Aberdeen, who in 1605 published at Helmstädt his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Disputationes medicinales,</hi> containing the theses or disputations
                    maintained by himself and his pupils from 1592 to 1606. He also published other
                    works, which contain an able digest of the medical learning of his age. Henry
                    Blackwood, dean of faculty to the college of physicians at Paris, wrote various
                    treatises on medicine, of which a list will be found in Mackenzie’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Lives of the Scottish Writers,</hi> but which are now only
                    historically interesting. (J. SM.)</p>
