                    its own genealogy no further back than 1262. The family was divided into eleven
                    distinct lines, but at present only three are preserved, widely distributed
                    throughout Prussia, Würtemberg, and Bavaria.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Gudentine line, was born at Herzogenaurach (near Erlangen) in Upper Franconia,
                    20th December 1626. His youth fell in the midst of the Thirty Years’ War, in
                    which his father was actively<pb break="no"

                    carefully watched over his education. In Coburg, Mühlhausen, and finally in
                    Erfurt, whither his mother removed in 1636, he acquired the Latin, Greek, and
                    French languages. In 1639 he returned to Coburg, and the reigning duke, Ernest
                    the Pious, made him his <hi rend="italic">protégé.</hi> Entering the university
                    of Strasburg in 1612, he devoted himself to history and jurisprudence. After he
                    finished his university course his patron gave him an appointment in his court
                    at Gotha, with the charge of his valuable library. He there laid the foundation
                    of his great collection of historical materials and mastered the principal
                    modern languages. In 1652 he was appointed to important judicial positions and
                    sent on weighty embassages. In 1656 he was made judge in the ducal court at
                    Jena, a position which he held many years and in which he took the leading part
                    in the numerous beneficent reforms of the duke. In 1661 he resigned office under
                    Duke Ernest, who had just made him chancellor and with whom he continued on
                    excellent terms, and entered the service of Duke Maurice of Zeitz (Altenburg),
                    with the view of lightening his official duties. After the death of Maurice in
                    1681 he retired to his estate, Meuselwitz in Altenburg, from nearly all public
                    offices, and devoted himself to his intellectual labours. Although living in
                    retirement, he kept up a correspondence with the principal learned men of the
                    day. He was especially interested in the endeavours of the pietist Spener to
                    effect a practical reform of the German church, although he was hardly himself a
                    pietist. In 1692 he was appointed chancellor of the new university of Halle, but
                    died a few weeks afterwards, on the 18th of December.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Der Christenstaat</hi> (1685), partly an apology for

                    1680), his most important work, and still indispensable to the historian of the
