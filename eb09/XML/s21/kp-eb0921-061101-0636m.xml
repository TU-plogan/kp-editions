                    of the globe; its average depth may be estimated as 2000 fathoms, and its total
                    mass at 1·322 × 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 18</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>,
                    1·3 million million millions) tons. Its general configuration must be assumed to
                    have been substantially the same as it is now for thousands of years; hence we
                    may safely conclude that the absolute composition of the ocean as a whole is
                    constant in the sense of being only subject to very slow progressive millennial
                    variation, and that, taking one part of the ocean with another, the percentage
                    composition of the fixed part of the <hi rend="italic">solutum</hi> can
                    oscillate only within narrow limits. The composition of this solutum is very
                    complex. According to Forchhammer, ocean salt in addition to the chlorides and
                    sulphates of sodium, magnesium, potassium, and calcium—which had long been known
                    to be its principal components—includes silica, boric acid, bromine, iodine,
                    fluorine as acid, and the oxides of nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminium, zinc,
                    silver, lead, copper, barium, and strontium as basic components. Arsenic, gold,
                    lithium, rubidium, caesium have been discovered since Forchhammer wrote. But all
                    these subsidiary components, as that investigator found, amount to very
                    little,—so little that in his numerous quantitative analyses of waters which he
                    had procured from all quarters of the globe he confined himself to the
                    determination of the chlorine, sulphuric acid, magnesia, lime, potash, and soda.
                    The soda, however, he determined only by difference, assuming that the muriatic
                    and sulphuric acids are united with the bases into perfectly neutral salts. As a
                    general result he found that, in the open ocean, the ratio to one another of the
                    several acids and bases named is subject to only slight variations. But his
                    samples had all been collected at the surface; the potash had been determined by
                    an insufficiently exact method; and the assumed neutrality of the total salt had
                    not been proved. With the view primarily of supplementing Forchhammer’s work,
                    Dittmar made complete analyses of 77 of the samples brought home by the
                    “Challenger,” so selected that 34 out of the 77 represented depths of 1000
                    fathoms or more. His analyses brought out a small surplus of base, proving the
                    presence of carbonate in all the waters; but the numerical values thus found for
                    the “alkalinity,” being charged with the observational errors of the whole
                    series of determinations, could not be relied on. Dittmar therefore subsequently
                    availed himself of a very easy and yet exact method for the direct determination
                    of this quantity, which meanwhile had been discovered by Tornöe, and applied it
                    to over 130 “Challenger” samples. He besides made a special inquiry into the
                    relation between the quantity of lime and the depth at which the water had been
                    collected, and a similar inquiry in regard to the bromine. As a general summary
                    he gives the following three tables. The total salts contained in ocean water
                    amount on an average to about 3·5 per cent., thus leaving 96·5 per cent. for the
                    water proper.</p>

                <p>Of the several quantities recorded in columns 2 or 3 of Table I. “carbonic acid”
                    is proved to be subject to variation; all the rest, including even the bromine,
                    are practically constant. This shows that Forchhammer’s proposition holds for
                    ocean water from all depths, with one important qualification: special research
                    on the lime showed that its quantity increases slightly but appreciably with the
                    depth. Taking <hi rend="italic">s, m, d</hi> as representing the lime per 100 of
                    chlorine in shallow, medium-depth, and deep-sea water respectively, Dittmar
                    found as mean results of analyses which agreed very well together—</p>

                    rend="italic">d-s</hi> = 0·0132. One explanation of this result is that the
                    crustaceans, foraminifera, and molluscs which form carbonate of lime shells live
                    chiefly in surface waters, but after their death sink to the bottom,
                    where—especially in great depths—their carbonate of lime is partially
                    redissolved.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Oceanic Carbonic Acid.—</hi> It is well known that not only in
                    the neighbourhood of actual volcanoes but in thousands of other places on the
                    dry land carbonic acid gas is constantly streaming forth into the atmosphere,
                    and it is generally admitted now that this supply of telluric carbonic acid
                    amounts to more than all that is furnished by processes of combustion and
                    respiration. That carbonic acid springs should be absent from the bottom of the
                    ocean is too absurd an assumption to be entertained; hence, supposing even the
                    water of the ocean were perfectly neutral, it could not but contain dissolved
                    carbonic acid. But such carbonic acid, at the ocean surface at least, would
                    constantly tend to assume, and in general probably actually would come down to,
                    the small limit value prescribed to it by the given proportion by volume of the
                    carbonic acid in the atmosphere and the laws of gas - absorption. This
                    proportion, according to the best modern researches, is almost constant,
                    everywhere amounting to very nearly 0·0003 volume per unit volume of air. The
                    coefficient of absorption by even pure water is 1·8 at 0° and 1·0 at 15° C.
                    Hence, even in the polar regions, the surface water could not hold in permanent
                    solution more than about 0·54 c.c., or say one milligramme per litre of water.
                    Jacobsen, in his<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n637/mode/1up"

                    North Sea water, found from 90 to 100 milligrammes per litre; hut he also
                    observed that only a small portion of the carbonic acid is eliminated on
                    boiling: the rest comes out only when the water is distilled to dryness. He
                    presumed that the gas was retained chemically by the chloride of magnesium.
                    Buchanan, who inquired into the subject synthetically, arrived at the conclusion
                    that it was the sulphates<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    retained the carbonic acid. Accordingly in his numerous carbonic acid
                    determinations he liberated the gas by distilling the water down with an excess
                    of chloride of barium. Tornöe was the first to prove that the carbonic acid in
                    sea water is present as carbonate, and that, in the northern part of the North
                    Atlantic at least, the total carbonic acid, while considerably greater than the
                    quantity which would convert the surplus base into normal, falls short of that
                    which would be required to produce fully saturated acid carbonate.</p>
                <p>Even without Tomöe’s discovery it would have been necessary to find the true
                    interpretation of the results of the numerous carbonic acid determinations made
                    during the voyage of the “Challenger” by Buchanan. Dittmar had no difficulty in
                    proving the non-existence of the alleged affinity of sulphates for carbonic
                    acid, and naturally concluded that the chloride of barium used in the processes
                    liberates the <hi rend="italic">loose</hi> part of the carbonic acid by
                    converting the normal carbonate part into a precipitate of carbonate of baryta,
                    thus—R"CO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + <hi rend="italic">x</hi> CO <hi

                    synthetical experiments showed that this is substantially, though not exactly,
                    correct. If Buchanan’s <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> be rigorously
                    followed, the carbonic acid obtained, as a rule, falls somewhat short of the
                    actual amount of loose carbonic acid present, while on resuming the distillation
                    after addition of fresh water an appreciable part of fixed carbonic acid passes
                    away as gas. Yet, Buchanan’s results being of great value, Dittmar discussed
                    them (conjointly with his own alkalinity determinations) on the basis of the
                    assumption that they afforded a fair approximation to the proportions of loose
                    carbonic acid in the respective waters. His general conclusions are as follows.
                    Taking “alkalinity” as meaning the “weight” of the carbonic acid, CO <hi

                    per 100 parts of total solids, the alkalinity in the water samples analysed

                <p>Values above 0.16 are obviously exceptional; hence the normal range may be said
                    to be from 0.14 to 0.16. The most frequently occurring values were found to be
                    about 0146 in the case of surface or shallow sea water, and in the case of
                    bottom water about 0·152. In regard to the loose carbonic acid a full discussion
                    of Buchanan’s results led to the following conclusions :—(1) carbonic acid
                    rarely occurs in the free state; as a rule it falls short of the quantity which
                    would produce bicarbonate; (2) in surface waters it is relatively high where the
                    natural temperature is relatively low, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa;</hi>
                    (3) within equal ranges of temperature it seems to be less in the surface water
                    of the Pacific than it is in that of the Atlantic Ocean. Of the 195 samples of
                    sea water which Buchanan analysed for carbonic acid only 22 contained fully
                    saturated bicarbonate, and only 2 out of these are proved by the analyses to
                    have contained free carbonic acid in addition to bicarbonate. In all the
                    remaining 173 samples the “carbonic acid deficit” (meaning the proportion of
                    carbonic acid which was wanted to completely transform the carbonate into
                    bicarbonate) assumed tangible and often considerable values. We are probably
                    safe in concluding that the ocean as a whole will have to continue taking in
                    carbonic acid for thousands of years before its carbonic acid deficit has been
                    reduced to nothing. But it is as well to observe that at its surface in the
                    warmer latitudes the attainment of this condition is a physical impossibility as
                    long as the percentage of carbonic acid in the air retains its present low
                    value.</p>
                <p>A solution of a bicarbonate when shaken, say in a bottle, with pure air (free of
                    carbonic acid) at summer heat gives up its comined carbonic acid to the air
                    space in the bottle until the partial tension of the acid gas there has come up
                    to a limit value <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which is called the dissociation
                    tension of the bicarbonate at the prevailing temperature <hi rend="italic"
                    >t.</hi> General experience concerning such phenomena warrants the presumption

                    that the bicarbonate in a solution when shaken again and again with even pure
                    air tends to become normal carbonate; for aught we know, the elimination of
                    carbonic acid may stop as soon as the residual carbonate has come down to some
                    composition</p>

                    (air freed of its carbonic acid) and ordinary air on the other. One sample of
                    sea water containing its surplus base as practically bicarbonate served for all
                    the experiments. It was shaken again and again at a fixed temperature <hi

                <p>Hence we see that even at the highest temperature, and with air free from
                    carbonic acid, the carbonate never came down below the state of sesquicarbonate,
                    while with ordinary air, even at 32° C., it never fell below <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> = l·8. At 2° <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> n</hi>
                    as well as n <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> was =2, the value characteristic of
                    bicarbonate. Now Buchanan reports a good number of cases where, even at lower
                    temperatures, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> was considerably less than 1 ’ 8 at any
                    rate. Hence, if his numbers are correct, unless the atmosphere acts more
                    powerfully than the air in Dittmar’s bottle, it would appear that deep-sea water
                    is in general below even the stage of carbonic acid saturation which it could
                    attain at the surface at high temperatures.</p>
                <p>In any mixed solution of salts every base is combined with every acid; hence the
                    “carbonate” of seawater is strictly speaking a complex plural. But as a matter
                    of probability the carbonic acid has very little chance of uniting with any of
                    the potash or soda, and the overwhelmingly large quantity of alkaline chloride
                    would no doubt convert any carbonate of magnesia that was introduced into double
                    chloride of magnesium and alkali metal; hence it is fair to assume that oceanic
                    carbonate is chiefly carbonate of lime. Now immense quantities of this compound
                    are being constantly introduced into the ocean by rivers. Dumas once gave it as
                    his opinion that this imported carbonate remains dissolved in the ocean as long
                    as and wherever the carbonate there is at the bicarbonate stage; but, as soon as
                    part of the loose carbonic acid goes off into the air, the corresponding weight
                    of normal carbonate separates out as an addition, ultimately, to the solids on
                    the bottom. Dittmar has tried to test this notion synthetically, but without
                    arriving at very definite results. According to his experiments sea water which
                    contains free carbonic acid dissolves added solid carbonate of lime, and more
                    largely carbonate of magnesia; sea water which contains fully, or almost fully,
                    saturated bicarbonate dissolves carbonate of magnesia very appreciably, but
                    would not appear to act on carbonate of lime at all. But, when carbonate of lime
                    was produced in the water by successive additions of potential calcium carbonate
                    in the form of dissolved sodium carbonate and its equivalent of calcium
                    chloride, the original carbonate of lime could be increased very largely, with
                    formation of solutions which remained clear during a long-continued period of
                    observation. As a set-off against this a few of the many hundred samples of sea
                    water which he received from the “Challenger” deposited in the course of a
                    number of years crystalline crusts of carbonate of lime on the sides of the
                    bottles; and the mother-liquor never contained more than the normal quantity of
                    lime per 100 parts of chlorine. In discussing this question Dittmar gives an
                    estimate, based on data furnished by Boguslawski’s work, of the total carbonate
                    of lime introduced into the ocean annually by the thirteen principal rivers; and
                    by doubling the quantity he estimates the carbonate of lime introduced by all
                    rivers as equal to about 1 ’ 34 × 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> tons. Now
                    the sum total of carbonate of lime, CaCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, in the
                    ocean amounts to about 160×10 <hi rend="superscript"> 12</hi> tons; hence it
                    would take 1190 years to increase the present stock of carbonate of lime in the
                    ocean by one per cent. of its value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Absorbed Oxygen and Nitrogen in Ocean Water.—</hi> As a matter
                    of physical necessity these two gases must be present in the water of the
                    ocean—and they may be presumed in general to pervade it to its greatest
                    depth—because the whole of the surface of the sea is in constant contact with
                    the atmosphere. Our knowledge regarding their distribution in the ocean may be
                    said to date from 1872, when Jacobsen inquired into the matter in a most
                    masterly manner in connexion with the German North Sea expedition. The work of
                    his predecessors possesses no scientific value, because they employed inadequate
                    methods. Unlike them, Jacobsen did not attempt to analyse a sample of sea water
                    air on board ship: he extracted the air from measured samples (by an excellent
                    method of his own) and then sealed them up in glass tubes, to measure and
                    analyse them after his return home. Buchanan, during the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n638/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0638-0613"/> “Challenger” cruise adopted Jacobsen’s method. Of
                    the 164 samples which he sealed up successfully 69 came from the surface and 95
                    from depths varying from 5 to 4575 fathoms. A good number of these he analysed
                    himself after his return; the majority, however, were analysed and all were
                    measured by Dittmar. The latter, in order to be able to interpret the results,
                    also investigated the absorption of oxygen and nitrogen gas from air by sea
                    water. The following table (VI.) gives the result of his investigations. One

                <p>The method used for obtaining these numbers adapted itself closely to the one
                    which Buchanan had employed for extracting the gas samples. In the calculations
                    it was assumed that atmospheric air contains 21∙0 volumes of oxygen for 79Ό
                    volumes of nitrogen, the slight variation in this ratio, which is known to
                    occasionally present itself, being neglected. From the table we can calculate
                    approximately the limits between which the proportions of dissolved oxygen and
                    nitrogen in the water of the ocean must be presumed to oscillate in nature. The
                    pressure of the atmosphere at the sea-level, though by no means constant, is
                    never far removed from that of 760 mm. of mercury. The temperature of the
                    surface water (with rare exceptions) may be said to vary from - 2° C. (in the
                    liquid part of the ocean in the arctic and antarctic regions) to about 30° C.
                    (in the tropics). The ocean receives all its dissolved oxygen and nitrogen from
                    the surface; neither gas comes in from below, except perhaps a relatively
                    insignificant quantity of nitrogen derived from the decay of dead organisms,
                    which may safely be neglected. Hence the ocean can contain nowhere more than
                    15·6 c.c. of nitrogen or more than 8.18 c.c. of oxygen per litre, and the
                    nitrogen will never fall below 8·55 c.c. We cannot make a similar assertion in
                    regard to the oxygen, because its theoretical minimum of 4·30 c.c. per litre is
                    liable to further diminution by processes of life and putrefaction and by
                    oxidation generally.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                    calculating these limit values the tension of the vapour of water is taken into
                    account; hence the apparent non-agreement with the entries in the
                    table.</p></note></p>
                <p>At any point in the surface of the ocean the water constantly tends to assume the
                    composition demanded for the prevailing temperature by the laws of gas
                    absorption. But it is rarely possible for it to assume this composition, owing
                    to the water being in a continual state of motion; and, supposing a certain area
                    of the ocean surface were in a state of stagnation, the temperature would vary
                    in diurnal cycles, and even the calculated volume of nitrogen per litre would be
                    a periodic function of time, exhibiting its maximum at the hour of minimum
                    temperature, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The process of
                    absorptiometric exchange, however, even at the constantly oscillating surface of
                    the ocean, is slow; it could not keep pace with the change of temperature, and
                    the actual nitrogen curve would never go as high up or as low down as the
                    theoretical one. In addition to this, the lower strata of the water constantly
                    add to, or take away from, the surface nitrogen by diffusion and occasional
                    intermixture. All this holds for the oxygen likewise, except that it is liable
                    to constant diminution by oxidation. On the whole we may assume that all the
                    disturbing influences will only modify, not efface, the course of events as
                    prescribed by the laws of gas-absorption.</p>
                <p>In regard to non-surface water we have to confront a greater complexity of
                    phenomena. The gas-contents of deep-sea water, of course, have nothing to do
                    with the low temperature and the high pressure which in general prevail there.
                    For the purpose of a preliminary survey, let us imagine a deep-sea water formed
                    from one kind of surface water, which took up its air at a constant temperature
                    (Z), and then sank down unmixed with other waters. The volumes of the oxygen and
                    nitrogen per litre have at first the values assigned to them by the laws of gas
                    absorption. But, while the nitrogen (as long as the water remains unmixed with
                    other water) remains constant, the oxygen will become less and less through the
                    processes of oxidation which go on in the deep without compensation. Hence if
                    there were absolute stagnation in the ocean anywhere the proportion of oxygen
                    there might be reduced ultimately to nothing. Among the many “Challenger”
                    deep-sea specimens which were analysed for their gas-contents none was found
                    quite free from absorbed oxygen; and this confirms the conclusion that absolute
                    stagnation exists nowhere in the ocean, not even at its greatest depth.
                    Occasionally, however, the oxygen was found to have sunk down to very little, as
                    shown by the following two examples :—</p>
                <p>No. of C.e. per Litre of C.c. of Oxygen calculated Depth in</p>
                <p>Sample. Nitrogen. Oxygen. from Nitrogen. Fathoms.</p>
                <p>1001 1508 0∙6 8'21 2875</p>
                <p>1645 13'38 2 04 6 95 1500</p>
                <p>There must have been an approximation to absolute rest at these two places at any
                    rate. On the whole, the results of the gas analysis, as interpreted on the basis
                    of Dittmar's absorptiometric determinations, agreed fairly well with the
                    inferences which we have just been deducing from physical laws. There was no
                    lack of anomalous results, but it was not found possible to trace them to
                    natural causes. The equilibrium in regard to the absorbed nitrogen and oxygen in
                    the ocean is maintained by the atmosphere; and, from the fact that the air
                    contained in surface water is always richer in oxygen than is atmospheric air,
                    one naturally concludes that the ocean should constantly add to the percentage
                    of oxygen in the air in the tropics and constantly diminish it in the colder
                    latitudes. But Regnault’s numerous air-analyses do not confirm this. Nor need
                    this be wondered at, since, as we have seen, even the corresponding influence on
                    the atmospheric carbonic acid has so far defied the powers of chemical
                    analysis.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Salinity of Ocean Water.—</hi> Even in the open ocean the
                    “salinity” —meaning in a given quantity the ratio between the weight of
                    dissolved salt and the weight or volume of the whole—is subject to considerable
                    variation; and it obviously is one of the foremost duties of observing
                    oceanographers to collect the data by means of which it may be possible one day
                    to represent that quantity mathematically as a function of geographic position,
                    depth, and time. For the quantitative determination of the salinity an obvious,
                    easy, and sufficient method is to determine the specific gravity S at a
                    convenient temperature <hi rend="italic">t</hi>; this in fact is the method
                    which has so far been employed by all observers almost to the exclusion of every
                    other. Buchanan used it during the “Challenger” cruise perhaps more extensively
                    than any of his predecessors had done. Of the arithmetical relation between
                    salinity on the one hand and S and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> on the other the
                    successive researches of Ekman (as supplemented by Tornoe), Thorpe and Riicker,
                    Dittmar, and others have given us a practically sufficient knowledge. According
                    to Dittmar the function (within the limits of Buchanan’s values) coincides
                    practically with the formula <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"

                    t</hi> has a similar meaning in reference to pure water; χ stands for the weight
                    of total halogen calculated as chlorine per 1000 parts, by weight, of sea water;
                    and α = l <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 45993, δ=-0 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 005592, c=+0O0Ö0649. For oceanographic purposes, however, it is not
                    necessary to go back to χ; it suffices from series of values <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> to deduce the
                    corresponding values <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi>
                    θ for a convenient standard temperature, and to reason on these reduced numbers
                    as if they measured the salinity, just as we take the readings of a thermometer
                    as in themselves representing ’ ' temperatures.” This, in fact, is always done;
                    only unfortunately different standard temperatures have been chosen by different
                    observers; Buchanan adopted 15° ∙56 C. =60° Fahr. Before going further, let us
                    observe that the specific gravity of sea water, taking it as it is <hi
                    rend="italic">in situ,</hi> has an important oceanographic significance, even as
                    such. But this quantity in the case of deep-sea waters is influenced very
                    largely<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to
                    Grassi’s experiments, if sea water under the pressure of one atmosphere has the

                    of 1026 + 1, 2, 3 times 7 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9 units=1033∙9, 1041'8,

                    of the superincumbent layer of water—which in itself is a complex function of
                    the successive temperatures and salinities—and unfortunately we still lack the
                    constants and formulae for making the necessary reductions with adequate
                    exactitude. Meanwhile all our statistics of sea water specific gravities,
                    valuable as they are, constitute statistics of only salinities and nothing
                    else.</p>
                <p>At the surface of the ocean the salinity is liable chiefly to three
                    influences,—(1) concentration by formation of ice or by the action of dry winds;
                    (2) dilution through the melting of ice or the falling of rain; (3)
                    concentration or dilution through the virtual addition of salt or water by
                    inflowing currents of salter or fresher water respectively. The effect of the
                    formation or melting of ice, though great within the arctic circles, does not
                    tell much on the non-polar seas. More important in regard to these is the effect
                    of the south-east and the north-east trade winds, which in the Pacific blow
                    between about 3° and 21° S. lat. and between about 2° and 20° N. lat.
                    respectively, leaving between the two a belt of 5° of a region of calms (see
                    more exactly, <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 144). In the
                    Atlantic the limiting lines of both trades oscillate annually, so that the
                    equatorial boundary of the north-east trade shifts from 3° to 11° N. lat., and
                    that of the south-east trade from about 1° to 3° N. lat.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n639/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0639-0614"/> Both trades blowing from colder into warmer
                    regions absorb water largely and thus raise the salinity within their areas of
                    action. The western anti-trades which blow on the polar sides of the two trades,
                    passing from hotter to colder regions, should dilute the ocean there; but they
                    do not seem to act so powerfully in this direction as might be expected. In the
                    belt of equatorial calms between the two trades abundant rains fall frequently
                    and dilute the water very perceptibly.</p>
                <p>What has been said thus far about the distribution of surface salinity applies
                    chiefly to the Atlantic, which in fact is far more completely known in this
                    respect than any other ocean. The ac companying diagram shows how on the average
                    the surface salinity varies there with the latitude. The bolder curve is drawn
                    after a table given by Buchanan in his part of the <hi rend="italic">Narrative
                    of the Cruise of the “Challenger</hi>,” the other after a more extensive table
                    given by Boguslawski as embodying the mean results of many observations by

                    to 17°·5 C.,—coast waters affected by the influx of large rivers having been

                    curve for the Pacific drawn after Buchanan’s summary tabulation of his
                    results.</p></note> In the North Atlantic there is an area of maximum (surface)
                    salinity (S = 1028∙5) between 25° and 35° N. lat. and 30° and 20° W. long. The
                    zone of minimum salinity lies between 15° N. lat. and the equator. In the South
                    Atlantic (surface) there are two concentration centres,—an eastern about St
                    Helena and between that island and Ascension, and a western north of San
                    Trinidad,—both nearer the equator than that of the North Atlantic. As pointed
                    out by Buchanan, a relatively high salinity (not merely on the surface) is quite
                    a characteristic feature of the Atlantic, and in its northern part prevails up
                    to the high latitudes of the Norwegian Sea, which was so thoroughly investigated
                    by Swensden (1876) and Tornöe (1877 and 1878) during the Norwegian expeditions.
                    The salt (and heat) conveying influence of the Gulf Stream makes itself felt up
                    to Spitzbergen (76° N. lat.). On both sides of the Faroe Islands the specific
                    gravity <hi rend="subscript"> 17 5</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> 17 5</hi> comes
                    up to 1027.0; at the Bear Islands it sinks to 10267, and thence farther
                    northwards to 10261. While the Gulf Stream pushes northwards, a current of
                    relatively fresh polar water travels southwards and, creeping along the eastern
                    coast of the United States, forms what is known as the “cold wall.” In passing
                    from the surface to the depth of the ocean the general rule (Buchanan) is that
                    the actual specific gravity <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> increases with the
                    depth; but this does not hold for the salinity (or specific gravity reduced to
                    standard temperature). In places where there is active dilution at the surface
                    <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in the belt of equatorial calms) the salinity as a
                    rule increases down to some 50 or 100 fathoms; but thence downwards it follows
                    the general rule, that is, it <hi rend="italic">decreases</hi> down to 800 or
                    1000 fathoms, and thence increases steadily to the bottom. In the South Atlantic
                    the salinity of the bottom water has an almost constant value (<hi

                <p>In regard to the Pacific our knowledge is far less complete. A glance at the
                    curve shows that the (surface) salinity at a given latitude is less there than
                    it is in the Atlantic. In the whole of the Pacific there is only one
                    concentration centre, which lies about the Society Islands, with a maximum
                    salinity corresponding to <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> S <hi rend="subscript">
                    15·8</hi> = 1027∙19. (W. D.)</p>
