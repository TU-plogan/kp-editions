                    January 1767. His father, Jean Étienne Say, was of a Protestant family which had
                    originally belonged to Nîmes, but had removed to Geneva for some time in
                    consequence of the revocation of the edict of Nantes. Young Say was intended to
                    follow a commercial career, and was accordingly sent, with his brother Horace,
                    to England, and lived first at Croydon, in the house of a merchant, to whom he
                    acted as clerk, and afterwards at London, where he was in the service of another
                    employer. When, on the death of the latter, he returned to France, he was
                    employed in the office of a life assurance company directed by Clavière,
                    afterwards known in politics. It was Clavière who called his attention to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations,</hi> and the study of that work revealed to
                    him his vocation. His first literary attempt was a pamphlet on the liberty of
                    the press, published in 1789. He worked under the celebrated Mirabeau on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Courrier de Provence.</hi> In 1792 he took part as a volunteer in
                    the campaign of Champagne; in 1793 he assumed, in conformity with the
                    Revolutionary fashion, the pre-name of <hi rend="italic">Atticus,</hi> and
                    became secretary to Clavière, then finance minister. He married in 1793 Mlle.
                    Deloche, daughter of a former <hi rend="italic">avocat au conseil</hi>; the
                    young pair were greatly straitened in means in consequence of the depreciation
                    of the assignats. From 1794 to 1800 Say edited a periodical entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">La Decade philosophique, littéraire, et politique,</hi> in which
                    he expounded the doctrines of Adam Smith. He had by this time established his
                    reputation as a publicist, and, when the consular government was established in
                    the year VIII (1799), he was selected as one of the hundred members of the
                    tribunate, and resigned, in consequence, the direction of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decade.</hi> He published in 1800 <hi rend="italic">Olbie, ou Essai sur les
                    moyens de reformer les moeurs d’une nation.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1803 appeared his principal work, the <hi rend="italic">Traité d’ Economie
                    Politique.</hi> In 1804, having shown his unwillingness to sacrifice his
                    convictions for the purpose of furthering the designs of Napoleon, he was
                    removed from the office of tribune, being at the same time nominated to a
                    lucrative post, which, however, he thought it his duty to resign. He then turned
                    to industrial pursuits, and, having made himself acquainted with the processes
                    of the cotton manufacture, founded at Auchy, in the Pas de Calais, a
                    spinning-mill which employed four or five hundred persons, principally women and
                    children. He devoted his leisure hours to the improvement of his economic
                    treatise, which had for some time been out of print, but which the censorship
                    did not permit him to republish; and in 1814 he availed himself (to use his own
                    words) of the sort of liberty arising from the entrance of the allied powers
                    into France to bring out a second edition of the work, dedicated to the emperor
                    Alexander, who had professed himself his pupil. In the same year the French
                    Government sent him to study the economic condition of Great Britain. The
                    results of his observations during his journey through England and Scotland
                    appeared in a tract <hi rend="italic">De l’Angleterre et des Anglais·,</hi> and
                    his conversations with distinguished men in those countries contributed, he
                    tells us, to give greater correctness to the exposition of principles in the
                    third edition of the <hi rend="italic">Traité,</hi> which appeared in 1817. A
                    chair of industrial economy was founded for him in 1819 at the Conservatoire des
                    Arts et Métiers, in which he lectured with ability and success. In 1831 he was
                    made professor of political economy at the Collége de France. He published in
                    1828-30 his <hi rend="italic">Cours Complet d'Économie Politique pratique,</hi>
                    which is in the main an expansion of the <hi rend="italic">Traité,</hi> with
                    practical applications. In his later years he became subject to attacks of
                    nervous apoplexy, which increasingly reduced his strength. He lost his wife, to
                    whom he was fondly attached, in January 1830; and from that time his health
                    constantly declined. When the revolution of that year broke out, he was named a
                    member of the council-general of the department of the Seine, but found it
                    necessary to resign that position, He died at Paris 16th November 1832, leaving
                    behind him a well-earned reputation for private worth and political
                    integrity.</p>
                <p>Say was essentially a propagandist, not an originator. His great service to
                    mankind lies in the fact that he disseminated throughout Europe by means of the
                    French language, and popularized by his clear and easy style, the economic
                    doctrines of Adam Smith. It is true that his French panegyrists (and he is not
                    himself free from censure on this score) are unjust in their estimate of Smith
                    as an expositor; they give false or exaggerated ideas of his obscurity, his
                    prolixity, and his want of method; and they accordingly extol too highly the
                    merits of Say. Those merits are, however, real and considerable; his writings
                    were without doubt very effective in diffusing throughout Continental Europe a
                    taste for economic inquiry and a knowledge of its principal results On the side
                    of the philosophy of science Say is weak; his observations on that subject are
                    usually commonplace or superficial. Thus he accepts the shallow dictum of
                    Condillac that <hi rend="italic">toute science se réduit à une langue bien
                    faite.</hi> He recognizes political economy and statistics as alike sciences,
                    and represents the distinction between them as having never been made before
                    him, though he quotes what Smith had said of political arithmetic. Whilst always
                    deserving the praise of honesty, sincerity, and independence, he is very
                    inferior to his great predecessor in breadth of view on moral and political
                    questions. In his general conception of human affairs there is a tendency to
                    regard too exclusively the material side of things, which made him pre-eminently
                    the economist of the French liberal <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>; thus
                    Storch justly censures the levity with which he doubts the necessity of a public
                    religious cultus, suggesting that enlightened nations might dispense with it “as
                    the Pacific islanders do.” He is inspired with the dislike and jealousy of
                    Governments so often felt and expressed by thinkers formed in the social
                    atmosphere of the last century. Soldiers are for him not merely<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n382/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0382-0361"/> unproductive labourers, as Smith called them;
                    they are rather “destructive labourers.” “A nation might,” he says; “strictly
                    speaking, subsist without a government, each profession exchanging the fruits of
                    its labours with the products of the labours of others,”—a remark which betrays
                    the notion that economic coincides with social life. Taxes are uncompensated
                    payments; they are plagues like hail, war, or depredation; they may fitly be
                    described as of the nature of robbery. When he says, “Lorsqu’ on vous vend un
                    privilège, comme le droit de chasse, ou seulement de port d’armes, on vous vole
                    votre droit naturel d’être armé pour le vous vendre après l’avoir volé,” we see
                    that we are still in the region of the <hi rend="italic">jus naturae,</hi> which
                    lies at the basis of all the old economics.</p>
                <p>Say is considered to have brought out the importance of capital as a factor in
                    production more distinctly than the English economists, who unduly emphasized
                    labour. The special doctrines most commonly mentioned as due to him are—(1) that
                    of "immaterial products,” and (2) what is called his “théorie des débouchés.”
                    objecting, as Germain Garnier had done before him, to Smith’s well-known
                    distinction between productive and unproductive labour, he maintains that,
                    production consisting in the creation or addition of a utility, all useful
                    labour is productive. He is thus led to recognize immaterial products, whose
                    characteristic quality is that they are consumed immediately and are incapable
                    of accumulation; under this head are to be ranged the <hi rend="italic"
                    >services</hi> rendered either by a person, a capital, or a portion of land, as,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the advantages derived from medical attendance, or
                    from a hired house, or from a beautiful view. But in working out the
                    consequences of this view Say is not free (as Storch has shown) from obscurities
                    and inconsistencies; and by his comprehension of these immaterial products
                    within the domain of economics he is confirmed in the error of regarding that
                    science as filling the whole sphere which really belongs to sociology. His
                    “théorie des débouchés” amounts to this, that, products being, in last analysis,
                    purchased only with products, the extent of the markets (or outlets) for home
                    products is proportional to the quantity of foreign productions; when the sale
                    of any commodity is dull, it is because there is not a sufficient number, or
                    rather value, of other commodities produced with which it could be purchased.
                    Another proposition on which Say insists is that every value is consumed and is
                    created only to be consumed. Values can therefore be accumulated only by being
                    reproduced in the course or, as often happens, by the very act of consumption;
                    hence his distinction between reproductive and unproductive consumption. We find
                    in him other corrections or new presentations of views previously accepted, and
                    some useful suggestions for the improvement of nomenclature.</p>
                <p>, Say's writings occupy vols, ix.-xii. of Guillaumin’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Collection des Principaux Economistes.</hi> Among them are, in addition to
                    those already mentioned, <hi rend="italic">Catéchisme d' Économie
                    Politique,</hi> 1815; <hi rend="italic">Petit Volume contenant quelques aperçus
                    des Hommes et de la Société, Lettres à Malthus sur différens sujets d’ Économie
                    Politique,</hi> 1820; <hi rend="italic">Épitomé des Principes de V Économie
                    Politique,</hi> 1831. A volume of <hi rend="italic">Mélanges et
                    Correspondance</hi> was published posthumously by Charles Comte, author of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Traité de Législation,</hi> who was his son-in-law. To the
                    above must be added an addition of Storch’s <hi rend="italic">Cours d'Économie
                    Politique,</hi> which Say published in 1823 without Storch’s authorization, with
                    notes embodying a “critique amère et virulente,” a proceeding which Storch
                    justly resented.</p>
                <p>The last edition of the <hi rend="italic">Traité d'Économie Politique</hi> which
                    appeared during the life of the author was the 5th(1826); the 6th, with the
                    author's final corrections, was edited by the eldest son, Horace Émile Say,
                    himself known as an economist, in 1846. The work was translated into English
                    “from the 4th edition of the French” by C. R. Prinsep (1821), into German by
                    Ludwig Heinrich von Jakob (1807) and by C. Ed. Morstadt (1818, and 1830), and,
                    ns Say himself informs us, into Spanish by José Queypo. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cours d'Économie Politique pratique,</hi> from which Morstadt had given
                    extracts, was translated into German by Max Stirner (1845). The <hi

                    also been translated into several European languages. An English version of the
