                <p><label type="entry">SANGALLO</label>, the surname of a Florentine family, several
                    members of which became distinguished in the fine arts.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Giuliano di Sangallo</hi> (1443-1517) was a distinguished
                    Florentine architect, sculptor, tarsiatore, and military engineer. His father,
                    Francesco di Paolo Giamberti, was also an able architect, much employed by
                    Cosimo de’ Medici. During the early part of his life Giuliano worked chiefly for
                    Lorenzo the Magnificent, for whom he built a fine palace at Poggio-a-Cajano,
                    between Florence and Pistoia, and strengthened the fortifications of Florence,
                    Castellana, and other places. Lorenzo also employed him to build a monastery of
                    Austin Friars outside the Florentine gate of San Gallo, a nobly designed
                    structure, which was destroyed during the siege of Florence in 1530. It was from
                    this building that Giuliano received the name of Sangallo, which was afterwards
                    used by so many Italian architects. While still in the pay of Lorenzo, Giuliano
                    visited Naples, and worked there for the king, who highly appreciated his
                    services and sent him back to Florence with many handsome presents of money,
                    plate, and antique sculpture, the last of which Giuliano presented to his patron
                    Lorenzo, who was an enthusiastic collector of works of classic art. After
                    Lorenzo’s death in 1492, Giuliano visited Loreto, and with great constructive
                    skill built the dome of the church of the Madonna, in spite of serious
                    difficulties arising from its defective piers, which were already built. In
                    order to gain strength by means of a strong cement, Giuliano built his dome with
                    pozzolana brought from Rome. Soon after this, at the invitation of Pope
                    Alexander VI., Giuliano went to Rome, and designed the fine panelled ceiling of
                    S. Maria Maggiore. He was also largely employed by Julius II., both for
                    fortification walls round the castle of S. Angelo, and also to build a palace
                    adjoining the church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, of which Julius had been titular
                    cardinal. Giuliano was much disappointed that Bramante was preferred to himself
                    as architect for the new basilica of St Peter, and this led to his returning to
                    Florence, where he was warmly received by the gonfaloniere Pier Soderini, and
                    did much service to his native state by his able help as a military engineer and
                    builder of fortresses during the war between Florence and Pisa. Soon after this
                    Giuliano was recalled to Rome by Julius II., who had much need for his military
                    talents both in Rome itself and also during his attack upon Bologna. For about
                    eighteen months in 1514-1515 Giuliano acted as joint-architect to St Peter’s
                    together with Raphael, but owing to age and ill-health he resigned this office
                    about two years before his death in 1517. But little remains to enable one to
                    judge of Giuliano’s talents in the artistic side of his profession; the greater
                    part of his life was spent on military works, in which he evidently showed great
                    skill and practical knowledge of construction.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Antonio di Sangallo</hi> (1448?-1534) was the younger
                    brother of Giuliano, and took from him the name of Sangallo. To a great extent
                    he worked in partnership with his brother, but he also executed a number of
                    independent works. As a military engineer he was as skilful as Giuliano, and
                    carried out important works of walling and building fortresses at Arezzo,
                    Montefiascone, Florence, and Rome. His finest existing work as an architect is
                    the church of S. Biagio at Montepulciano, in plan a Greek cross with central
                    dome and two towers, much resembling, on a small scale, Bramante’s design for St
                    Peter’s. He also built a palace in the same city, various churches and palaces
                    at Monte Sansavino, and at Florence a range of monastic buildings for the
                    Servite monks. Antonio retired early from the practice of his profession, and
                    spent his latter years in farming.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Francesco di Sangallo</hi> (1493-1570), the son of
                    Giuliano di Sangallo, was a pupil of Andrea Sansovino, and worked chiefly as a
                    sculptor. His works have for the most part but little merit,—the finest being
                    his noble effigy of Bishop Leonardo Bonafede, which lies on the pavement of the
                    church of the Certosa, near Florence. It is simply treated, with many traces of
                    the better taste of the 15th century. His other chief existing work is the group
                    of the Virgin and Child and St Anne, executed in 1526 for the altar of Or San
                    Michele, where it still stands.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bastiano di Sangallo</hi> (1481—1551), Florentine
                    sculptor and painter, was a nephew of Giuliano and Antonio. He is usually known
                    as Aristotile, a nickname he received from his air of sententious gravity. He
                    was at first a pupil of Perugino, but afterwards became a follower of
                    Michelangelo. His life is given at great length by Vasari, in spite of his being
                    an artist of very mediocre powers.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Antonio di Sangallo,</hi> the younger (?—1546), another
                    nephew of Giuliano, went while very young to Rome, and became a pupil of
                    Bramante, of whose style he was afterwards a close follower. He lived and worked
                    in Rome during the greater part of his life, and was much employed by several of
                    the popes. His most perfect existing work is the brick and travertine church of
                    S. Maria di Loreto, close by Trajan’s column, a building remarkable for the
                    great beauty of its proportions, and its noble effect produced with much
                    simplicity. The lower order is square in plan, the next octagonal; and the whole
                    is surmounted by a fine dome and lofty lantern. The lantern is, however, a later
                    addition. The interior is very impressive, considering its very moderate size.
                    Antonio also carried out the lofty and well-designed church of S. Giovanni dei
                    Fiorentini, which had been begun by Jacobo Sansovino. The east end of this
                    church rises in a very stately way out of the bed of the Tiber, near the bridge
                    of S. Angelo; the west end has been ruined by the addition of a later façade,
                    but the interior is a noble example of a somewhat dull style. Great skill has
                    been shown in successfully building this large church, partly on the solid
                    ground of the bank and partly on the shifting sand of the river bed. Antonio
                    also built the Cappella Paolina and other parts of the Vatican, together with
                    additions to the walls and forts of the Leonine City. His most ornate work is
                    the lower part of the cortile of the Farnese palace, afterwards completed by
                    Michelangelo, a very rich and well-proportioned specimen of the then favourite
                    design, a series of arches between engaged columns supporting an entablature, an
                    arrangement taken from the outside of the Colosseum. A palace in the Via Giulia
                    built for himself still exists under the name of the Palazzo Sacchetti, but is
                    much injured by alterations. Antonio also constructed the very deep and
                    ingenious rock-cut well at Orvieto, formed with a double spiral staircase, like
                    the well of Saladin in the citadel of Cairo.</p>
