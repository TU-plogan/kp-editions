                <p><label type="entry">SALAMANDRA</label>. In the nomenclature of zoology this name
                    designates a genus of animals belonging to the vertebrate class <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi> The genus was first defined under this name by
                    Laurenti.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Synopsis reptilium emendata,</hi> &amp;c., Vienna,
                    1768.</p></note> It will be seen on referring to the taxonomic synopsis of the
                    class given at the end of the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibia</hi> that
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Salamandra</hi> belongs to the first tribe <hi
                    rend="italic">Mecodonta</hi> of the fifth division <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salamandrida.</hi> The diagnosis of the genus is as follows :—no
                    fronto-squamosal arch in the skull; tongue large, adherent below, free at the
                    sides and slightly so behind; toes five; tail cylindrical. There are three
                    species, distinguished as follows :—(1) <hi rend="italic">S. maculosa,</hi>
                    Laurenti, tail not so long as rest of body, colour black with yellow spots; (2)
                    <hi rend="italic">S. atra,</hi> Laurenti, tail not so long as rest of body,
                    colour uniform black; (3) <hi rend="italic">S. caucasica,</hi> Waga, tail longer
                    than rest of body. In all the species the body is plump and rounded, and there
                    is no dorsal crest or fin; the head is depressed, its greatest width being at
                    the angle of the jaws; the snout is rounded. The vent is a longitudinal slit,
                    the borders of which in the male are slightly swollen. The skin is smooth and
                    shining; at the junction of the head and neck is a pronounced fold of skin
                    called the gular fold. The swollen patches of skin behind the tympana, caused by
                    the presence of large cutaneous glands, and known as parotids, are well
                    developed and exhibit the openings of the glands as distinct pores. Similar
                    gland-openings form a series along either side of the body. In the first two
                    species there is also a longitudinal series of warts on each side; these are
                    wanting in <hi rend="italic">S. caucasica.</hi> Depressions of the skin between
                    the vertebrae are present, and are known as costal grooves. The palatine
                    teeth-series are S-shaped, and the anterior ends of the two series do not
                    meet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a figure of

                    >S. maculosa</hi> is the largest of the three species, attaining a length of 7
                    to 8½ inches. <hi rend="italic">S. atra</hi> is about 4 <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and <hi rend="italic">S. caucasica</hi>
                    about 6 inches in length.</p>
                <p>The genus is confined to the western sub-region of the palaearctic region,
                    extending over almost the whole of Europe, especially the central and southern
                    parts, and occurring also in Algiers and Syria. The spotted species is the
                    commonest and most widely distributed, being found in nearly all parts of
                    Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. The genus is entirely absent from the British
                    Islands. The black salamander, <hi rend="italic">S. atra,</hi> is confined to
                    the Alps of Central Europe, and there only occurs between the limits of 2500 to
                    10,000 feet of altitude; it is found in the mountains of South Germany, France,
                    Switzerland, and Austria. <hi rend="italic">S. caucasica</hi> is only known from
                    one specimen, which was obtained from the Caucasus and was sent to the Paris
                    Museum by Dr Waga.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Waga, <hi rend="italic">Rev. Mag. Zool.,</hi> 1876, p. 326.</p></note></p>
                <p>The food of <hi rend="italic">Salamandra</hi> consists of worms and insects, and,
                    like British frogs and toads, the animals can only exist in damp shady
                    localities. As in all <hi rend="italic">Salamandrida,</hi> the process of
                    reproduction is commenced by a true copulation, which takes place in spring and
                    summer. The seminal fluid is passed into the female cloaca, where it is received
                    into a tube-shaped receptaculum seminis. The eggs are thus fertilized in the
                    oviduct, but the development takes place under somewhat different conditions in
                    the two species <hi rend="italic">S. maculosa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">S.
                    atra.</hi> Both species are viviparous; in the former thirty to forty eggs
                    undergo development in the oviducts at one time, and they are brought forth and
                    deposited in stagnant or sluggishly-flowing water when they have reached a stage
                    similar to that of adult <hi rend="italic">Perennibranchiata,</hi> the
                    newly-born larvae having long feather-like external gills and a length of 12 to
                    15 mm. (one-third to one-half an inch). After a period of aquatic life, the
                    larvae pass through a metamorphosis: the limbs appear; the gill slits close up;
                    and the young animals, having reached the adult condition, leave the water for a
                    terrestrial life. In <hi rend="italic">S. atra</hi> only the two lowest eggs
                    which pass into the oviducts, one in the duct of each side, undergo development.
                    The rest of the eggs fuse into a mass of yolk material and are devoured by the
                    two developing larvae. In this way the larvae are provided with nutriment during
                    the later stages of development, for in this species they are retained within
                    the body of the mother until they have reached the air-breathing condition and
                    are in all respects similar to the parents. This peculiarity in the process of
                    reproduction bears an obvious relation to the physical conditions of the habitat
                    of <hi rend="italic">S. atra.</hi> In the elevated regions that the species
                    inhabits stagnant and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n224/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0224-0205"/> sluggish waters are wanting, and therefore the
                    process of reproduction that occurs in <hi rend="italic">S. maculosa</hi> is
                    rendered impossible. The black <hi rend="italic">Salamandra</hi> has become
                    adapted to its environment (1) by the slight changes in colour and structure
                    which distinguish it from the spotted, and (2) by a modification in its
                    reproductive processes, which eliminates the aquatic stage of existence from the
                    life-history of the individual. It is to be noted that the stage characterized
                    by the presence of pinnate external gills is exhibited by the larva during its
                    development in the oviduct, and the gills doubtless there perform their
                    function. Fräulein von Chauvin<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zoologie,</hi> vol.
                    xxvii. p. 534, and C. von Siebold, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> p. 536; M. v.
                    Chauvin, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> vol. xxiv.</p></note> made the experiment
                    of taking the larvae of <hi rend="italic">S. atra</hi> from the pregnant female
                    when they were in the branchiate condition, and placing them in water to see if
                    they would survive and pass through their metamorphosis under these
                    circumstances. On one occasion the experiment was perfectly successful in the
                    case of one specimen; the rest of the larvae died.</p>
                <p>The tailed <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> of Europe have from the very earliest
                    times down to the present day been almost universally known in popular language
                    as salamanders, and identified in the popular mind with, the salamander of myth
                    and fable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristotle
                    (<hi rend="italic">H. A.,</hi> v. 19) cites the salamander, which “when it walks
                    through fire extinguishes it,” as a proof that some animal frames are
                    incombustible, and Aelian (<hi rend="italic">Hat. An.,</hi> ii. 31) will have it
                    that those who work with forges are familiar with this fact and when their
                    bellows fail to quicken the flame know to look for a salamander and put things
                    right by killing it. According to this form of the fable the salamander, as
                    Aelian expressly says, is not born of fire, nor does it live therein. On the
                    contrary, according to Pliny (<hi rend="italic">H. N.,</hi> x. 67 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> xxix. 4) it is of a cold complexion and emits a cold
                    venom like aconite, but so virulent that even bread baked with wood of a tree on
                    which a salamander has crept is poisonous. The touch of its saliva even on the
                    foot, says Pliny, causes the hair to fall out. So Dioscorides speaks of
                    salamander prepared in oil as a depilatory; comp. Petronius, c. 107, and
                    Burman’s notes, and for late survivals in Europe of the belief in a deadly
                    lizard, identified with the salamander, Bochart, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hierozoicon,</hi> bk. iv. c. 1. That the salamander extinguishes fire appears
                    also in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Phtsiologus (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.),</hi>
                    and so became a common part of mediaeval animal lore; but the Arabic <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiologus</hi> (Land, <hi rend="italic">Anec. Syr.,</hi> iv.
                    166) speaks instead of a stone that quells fire. This stone is asbestos, the
                    salamander of Marco Polo (i. 215, Yule), of whose fibres a sort of incombustible
                    cloth was made, which was represented in the East as made of the hair of the
                    salamander or of its plumage; for the Arabs mixed up the salamander fable with
                    that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Phoenix</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.)</hi> and
                    were not sure whether it was beast or bird. In later story the salamander is
                    represented as born and living in fire and so the name is used by cabbalistic
                    moderns for the spirits of that element. Salamander’s wool or hair as a name for
                    asbestos occurs in Bacon and other English writers. Francis I. chose as his
                    emblem a salamander with the motto, “J’y vis et je l’éteins.”</p></note> Besides
                    the species of <hi rend="italic">Salamandra</hi> there are, according to
                    Boulanger (<hi rend="italic">Brit. Mus. Cat.,</hi> 1881), eighteen other species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Urodela</hi> in Europe, of which fourteen belong to the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Triton (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.). Chioglossa
                    lusitanica,</hi> Bocage, is distinguished by having a tongue supported
                    anteriorly by a protractile median pedicle and free everywhere else, and by
                    having its tail cylindrical at the base but compressed at the end. It occurs in
                    Spain and Portugal. <hi rend="italic">Salamandrina perspicillata,</hi> Tschudi,
                    occurs in Italy; like <hi rend="italic">Chioglossa,</hi> it belongs to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mecodonta</hi> and is distinguislied by the following characters
                    :—tongue large, subtriangular, free everywhere except on anterior median line;
                    toes four; tail slightly compressed; a strong bony fronto-squamosal arch. <hi
                    rend="italic">Spelerpes fuscus,</hi> Strauch, occurs in Italy and in France in
