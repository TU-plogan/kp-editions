                    King Edward IV., would have been unknown by name even to the studious antiquary
                    but for the events which took place after the death of her royal paramour. She
                    was the first of three concubines whom he described respectively as the
                    merriest, the wilyest, and the holiest harlot in his realm. A handsome woman of
                    moderate stature, round face, and fair complexion, she was more captivating by
                    her wit and conversation than by her beauty; yet Sir Thomas More, writing when
                    she was still alive, but old, lean, and withered, declares that even then an
                    attentive observer might have discerned in her shrivelled countenance some
                    traces of its lost charms. She was born in London, and married before she was
                    quite out of girlhood to a citizen named William Shore, who, though young,
                    handsome, and well-to-do, never really won her affections; and thus she yielded
                    the more readily to the solicitations of King Edward. Her husband on this
                    abandoned her, and after Edward’s death she became the mistress of Lord
                    Hastings, whom Richard III., then duke of Gloucester, as protector during the
                    minority of Edward V., suddenly ordered to be beheaded on 13th June 1483.
                    According to the report given by More, Richard had accused Hastings at the
                    council table of conspiring against him along with the queen-dowager and Shore’s
                    wife, who by sorcery and witchcraft had given him a withered arm. So having got
                    rid of Hastings he caused Jane Shore to be committed to prison and spoiled her
                    house, containing property to the value of 2000 or 3000 marks, equivalent to a
                    sum of £20,000 or £30,000 at the present day. But having sought in the first
                    place to charge her with conspiracy—a charge which apparently he could not
                    substantiate—he thought better afterwards to get the bishop of London to put her
                    to open penance at Paul’s Cross for her vicious life. She accordingly went in
                    her kirtle through the streets one Sunday with a taper in her hand, her beauty
                    really enhanced by the blush which her humiliation called up in her usually pale
                    cheeks; and many who detested her mode of life could not but pity her as the
                    victim of a hypocritical tyranny. The penance certainly did not induce her to
                    reform, for she immediately afterwards became the mistress of the marquis of
                    Dorset; and, what is still more extraordinary, next year, having been taken
                    again into custody, and her husband, it may be presumed, being by that time
                    dead, she so captivated the king’s solicitor, Thomas Lynom, that he actually
                    entered into a contract of marriage with her. This we know from a letter of King
                    Richard to his chancellor on the occasion, desiring him to dissuade Lynom from
                    the match, as far as he could, by argument, but, if he found him determined,
                    then, provided it was not against the laws of the church, he might convey the
                    king’s consent and meanwhile deliver Jane out of prison to her father’s custody.
                    Conduct so<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n861/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0861-0836"/> unlike his previous severity shows that Richard
                    knew how to be gracious as well as despotic. Whether the marriage actually took
                    place is not known. Jane certainly lived to the year 1513, when More wrote his
                    history of Richard III., but how much later we cannot tell.</p>
