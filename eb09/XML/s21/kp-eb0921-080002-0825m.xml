                    as an executive officer in the United States is very similar to that of the
                    English sheriff. He is usually appointed by popular election. The marshals of
                    the United States and their deputies have in each State the same powers in
                    executing the laws of the United States as the sheriffs and their deputies have
                    in executing the laws of the State.</p>
                <p>So far as is known the sheriff, notwithstanding the Saxon etymology of his name
                    (shire grieve or reeve), did not exist in Scotland before the beginning of the
                    Norman period. In the feudal system he became the centre of the local
                    administration of justice, the representative of the crown in executive as well
                    as judicial business, and was always a royal officer appointed by and directly
                    responsible to the king. The earliest sheriffs on record belong to the reigns of
                    Alexander I. and David I., and the office was common before the death of
                    Alexander III. In many cases it had become hereditary, the most remarkable
                    instance being that of Selkirk, where a De Sinton held it from 1265 to 1305. The
                    ordinance of Edward I. in 1305 recognized most of the existing officers, but
                    rejected the hereditary character of the office by a declaration that the
                    sheriffs were to be appointed and removable at the discretion of the king’s
                    lieutenant and the chamberlain. The inveterate tendency of feudalism reasserted
                    itself, however, notwithstanding various attempts to check it, and an Act of
                    James II. shows that the office had again become hereditary.</p>
                <p>One of the consequences was that sheriffs ignorant of law required deputes to
                    discharge their judicial duties. In the course of succeeding reigns, down to
                    that of James VI., the jurisdiction of the sheriffs came to be much limited by
                    grants of baronies and regalities which gave the grantees the right to hold both
                    civil and criminal courts of less or greater jurisdiction to the exclusion of
                    the sheriff.</p>
                <p>The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff was originally of very wide extent, and was
                    deemed specially applicable to questions relating to the land within the shire,
                    but after the institution of the court of session in 1532 it became restricted,
                    and all causes relating to property in land, as well as those requiring the
                    action called declarator for establishing ultimate right, and most of those
                    requiring equitable remedies, were withdrawn from it. Nor did it possess any
                    consistorial jurisdiction, as its subjects (marriage, legitimacy, and wills)
                    belonged to the officials of the bishop after the Reformation, when it was
                    transferred to the commissary courts, and at a later period to the court of
                    session. Practically, therefore, the civil jurisdiction of the sheriff fell
                    under the head of actions concluding for payment of money and actions to
                    regulate the possession of land. The criminal jurisdiction of the sheriff was in
                    like manner in its origin of almost universal extent. But this was first limited
                    to oases where the offenders were caught in or shortly after the act, afterwards
                    to cases in which the trial could be held within forty days, and subsequently
                    further restricted as the business of the justiciary court became more
                    organized. The punishment of death, having by long disuse come to be held beyond
                    the power of the sheriff, and the statutory punishments of transportation or
                    penal servitude<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0826-0801"/> never having been entrusted to him, his
                    jurisdiction as regards crimes was usually said to be limited to those
                    punishable arbitrarily, that is, by imprisonment, fine, or admonition.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of the suppression of the Jacobite rising of 1745, after 1st
                    March 1748 all heritable sheriffships were extinguished, and no sheriffship was
                    to be thereafter granted either heritably or for life, or for any certain term
                    exceeding one year, but this provision was not taken advantage of, and the
                    office of sheriff-principal practically ceased, though that name is sometimes
                    given to the sheriff-depute, 20 Geo. II. c. 43. The Act declared that there
                    should be but one sheriff-depute or stewart-depute in every shire or stewartry,
                    who was to be an advocate of three years’ standing, appointed by the crown, with
                    such continuance as His Majesty should think fit for the next seven years, and
                    after that period <hi rend="italic">ad vitam aut culpam.</hi> This period was
                    extended by 28 Geo. II. c. 7 for fifteen years, and thereafter (since 1769) the
                    sheriff-depute has held his office <hi rend="italic">ad vitam aut culpam.</hi>
                    Power was given to him by 20 Geo. II. c. 43 to appoint one or more persons as
                    substitutes during his pleasure, for whom he should be answerable. At first no
                    legal qualification was necessary and no salary paid, but gradually the
                    sheriff-depute delegated more legal business to the substitute, and before 1761
                    it had become customary for the sheriff-depute to give him some allowance. In
                    1787 he was placed on the civil establishment and paid by the crown; in 1825 a
                    qualification of three years’ standing (now five years by 40 and 41 Vict. c. 50)
                    as an advocate or procurator before a sheriff court was required (6 Geo. IV. c.
                    23); in 1838 he was made removable by the sheriff-depute, only with the consent
                    of the lord president and lord justice clerk, and it was made compulsory that he
                    should reside in the sheriffdom, the provision of 20 Geo. II. c. 43, which
                    required the sheriff-depute so to reside for four months of each year, being
                    repealed (1 and 2 Vict. c. 119); and in 1877 the right of appointment of the
                    substitutes was transferred from the sheriff-depute to the crown (40 and 41
                    Vict. c. 50).</p>
                <p>While the sheriff-depute has still power to hear cases in the first instance, and
                    is required to hold a certain number of sittings in each place where the
                    sheriff-substitute holds courts, and also once a year a small-debt court in
                    every place where a circuit small-debt court is appointed to be held, the
                    ordinary course of civil procedure is that the sheriff-substitute acts as judge
                    of first instance, with an appeal under certain restrictions from his decision
                    to the sheriff-depute, and from him to the court of session in all causes
                    exceeding £25 in value. An appeal direct from the sheriff-substitute to the
                    court of session is competent, but is not often resorted to.</p>
                <p>As regards criminal proceedings, summary trials are usually conducted by the
                    sheriff-substitute; trials with a jury either by him or, in important cases, by
                    the sheriff-depute. The sheriff-substitute also has charge of the preliminary
                    investigation into crime, the evidence in which, called a precognition, is laid
                    before him, and if necessary taken before him on oath at the instance of his
                    procurator-fiscal, the local crown prosecutor.</p>
                <p>The duties of the sheriff-depute are now divided into ministerial or
                    administrative and judicial. The ministerial are the supervision of the accounts
                    of the inferior officers of the sheriffdom; the superintendence of parliamentary
                    elections; the holding by himself or his substitutes of the courts for
                    registration of electors; the preparation of the list of persons liable to serve
                    both on criminal and civil juries; the appointment of sheriff officers and
                    supervision of the execution of judicial writs by them; and the striking of the
                    “fiars.” He has also to attend the judges of justiciary at the circuit courts
                    for the county or counties over which his jurisdiction extends. He is generally
                    responsible for the peace of the county, and supervises the police
                    establishment. He is <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> a justice of the peace
                    and commissioner of supply. In addition to those general duties of
                    sheriffs-depute, particular sheriffs are attached to the Board of Supervision
                    for the Relief of the Poor, the Prison Board of Scotland, the Board of Northern
                    Lighthouse Commissioners, and the Scottish Fishery Board.</p>
                <p>The judicial duties of the sheriff-depute are, as regards crimes, the trial of
                    all causes remitted by the counsel of the crown for the trial by sheriff and
                    jury, as well as summary trials if he chooses to take them. This now means most
                    crimes for which a maximum of two years’ imprisonment (in practice eighteen
                    months is the longest sentence imposed) is deemed sufficient, and which are not
                    by statute reserved for the justiciary court. His civil jurisdiction is
                    regulated by several statutes too technical for detail, but may be said
                    generally to extend to all suits which conclude for payment of money, whatever
                    may be the cause of action, with the exception of a few where the payment
                    depends on status, all actions with reference to the possession of land or right
                    in land, and actions relative to the right of succession to movable property. In
                    bankruptcy he has a cumulative and alternative jurisdiction with the court of
                    session, and in the service of heirs with the sheriff of chancery. Formerly the
                    jurisdiction of the sheriff was absolutely excluded after the institution of the
                    court of session in four important classes of action—(1) relative to property in
                    lands or rights in lands; (2) requiring the use of peculiar forms of action, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> declarator, reduction, and suspension; (3) involving
                    the exercise of the <hi rend="italic">nobile officium,</hi> a supreme equitable
                    jurisdiction of the court of session; and (4) for the determination of rights of
                    status, as well as in many cases in which the proceedings rest on special
                    statutes which gave an exclusive jurisdiction to the court of session. But large
                    exceptions have been made by recent legislation from this exclusion. By another
                    series of statutes, for the most part connected with local administration, as
                    the Road, Burial Grounds, Lunacy, Public-houses, and General Police and
                    Education Acts, the jurisdiction of the court of session is excluded either as
                    an original court or a court of review, and the sheriff court has exclusive
                    jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>The courts which the sheriff holds are (1) the criminal court; (2) the ordinary
                    civil court; (3) the small-debt court for cases under £12 in value (6 Geo. IV.
                    c. 48); (4) the debts recovery court for cases above £12 and under £50 in value
                    (30 and 31 Vict. c. 96); and (5) the registration court. His judgment in the
                    criminal court is subject to review by the court of justiciary, and in the
                    ordinary civil court and the debts recovery court by the court of session. In
                    the small debt court it is final, except in certain cases where an appeal lies
                    to the next circuit court of justiciary. The sheriff-substitute may competently
                    exercise all the judicial jurisdiction of the sheriff, subject to appeal in
                    civil cases other than small-debt cases. As regards his administrative functions
                    he assists the sheriff generally, and may act for him in the registration and
                    fiars court, and he superintends the preliminary stage of criminal inquiries,
                    consulting with the sheriff if necessary; but the other administrative duties of
                    the office are conducted by the sheriff-depute in person. The salaries of
                    sheriffs-depute vary from £2000 to £500 a year, those of sheriffs-substitute
                    from £1400 to £500.</p>
                <p>There is a principal sheriff-clerk appointed by the crown for each county, who
                    has depute clerks under him in the principal towns, and a procurator-fiscal for
                    the conduct of criminal prosecutions for each county and district of a county,
                    who is appointed by the sheriff with the sanction of the home secretary.</p>
                <p>Besides the sheriffs of counties, there is a sheriff of chancery appointed by the
                    crown, whose duties are confined to the service of heirs, with a salary of £500.
