                <p><label type="entry">ST GALL</label> (German <hi rend="italic">Sankt Gallen),</hi>
                    capital of the above canton, occupies along with its suburbs St Fiden, Neudorf,
                    and Langgasse (to the east), and Lachen and Vonwil (to the west), an area 4
                    miles long by 1 broad in the highland valley of the Steinach, which descends
                    north-east to the Lake of Constance. On a pillar in the marketplace are the
                    following details:—Lat. 47° 25' 36" N.; long. 7° 2' 27" E. from Paris (9° 22'
                    41" Green.); height above the sea, 2196·6 feet; mean annual temperature, 45·6;
                    annual rainfall, 50 inches; air-distance from Zurich 39 miles, from Geneva 174.
                    The only town—not village—in Europe which has a higher position than St Gall is
                    Madrid. The chief building in St Gall is the abbey, of which (as it was
                    originally arranged) a ground plan and description are given in vol. i. pp. 12,
                    13. The abbey church, since 1846 the Roman Catholic cathedral, was entirely
                    rebuilt in the latter part of the 18th century in the rococo style. Partly from
                    the desire to include within the choir the tombs of the two founders and partly
                    from the hostility which long existed between town and tonsure, both the towers
                    (217 feet) are placed at the east end and the main entrance is in the north
                    side. The whole church has a length of 400 feet (with the sacristy 454 feet),
                    and a breadth in the nave of 95 feet, a disproportion which is considerably
                    disguised by the arrangement of the interior. Among the internal decorations are
                    two colossal statues of St Desiderius and St Mauritius, the original patrons of
                    the church, whose relics were brought from Scotland. Other buildings of
                    importance are the (Protestant) church of St Lawrence, partially rebuilt
                    (1851-53) according to plans by the Swiss poet Johann G. Müller, the Government
                    offices on the east side of the abbey-court (where Scholl’s famous relief of the
                    cantons of St Gall and Appenzell is to be seen), the town-house, the offices of
                    the Mercantile Directorium (a 17th-century institution to which the town owes
                    much of its commercial prosperity), the great cantonal school—comprising a
                    gymnasium, a technical school (preparatory to the polytechnicum at Zurich), and
                    a mercantile school—the cantonal reformatory of St Jacob, the hospitals, and the
                    infantry and cavalry barracks. In the town park, part of which is occupied by
                    the botanic gardens, stands the public museum, containing natural history
                    collections, the industrial collections and industrial drawing-school of the
                    Mercantile Directorium, the picture gallery of the Art Society, and the
                    antiquarian collections of the Historical Society. The museum of the East Swiss
                    Geographical Commercial Society is located in the cantonal school. Besides the
                    abbey library, famous for its ancient MSS. (original of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Niebelungenlied,</hi> &amp;c.), there is a town library (Bibliotheca Vadiana),
                    founded by the reformer Joachim de Watt or Vadianus. In spite of its position
                    and climate, St Gall is the seat of extensive industries and trades. About
                    45,000 persons in the surrounding cantons are engaged in the manufacture of
                    embroidered goods, mainly muslins, for the St Gall capitalists, who also employ
                    some 6000 or 7000 women in chain-stitch and hand embroidery. In 1872 6384
                    machines were at work in this department in the town and vicinity, and in 1882
                    14,883. The value of textile fabrics and embroidered goods annually exported
                    from St Gall is £3,600,000 to £4,000,000. All round the town the meadows are
                    used as bleaching-grounds for the webs. In 1870 the population was 16,675, in
                    1880 21,438.</p>
                <p>The abbey of St Gall was named after its founder, a follower of St Columba, who
                    along with Columban left Ireland on the destruction of Bangor and finally
                    settled down in the midst of the great forest which then stretched from the Lake
                    of Constance to the Santis Mountains, for the purpose of converting the
                    Alemanns. On his death on 16th October 625 this apostle of Celtic Christianity
                    was buried in his oratory, and in the 9th century the spot thus consecrated
                    became the site of the monastic buildings erected by Abbots Gozbert and
                    Grimoald. The foundation was already a wealthy one, and it soon became a great
                    centre of literary and artistic culture, attracting numerous pupils and
                    receiving the homage of dukes and emperors. In the 10th century the abbey and
                    its cluster of houses were surrounded with a wall, which in 954 had to defend
                    the settlement against an attack by a band of Saracens. In the reign of Rudolph
                    of Hapsburg the town obtained a recognition of its communal independence from
                    Abbot Ulrich and from the emperor himself a variety of important privileges. An
                    alliance defensive and offensive was formed in 1312 with Zurich, Constance, and
                    Schaffliausen; and, although the prosperity of the town received a severe check
                    by a great conflagration in 1314, the vigour with which the burghers prosecuted
                    the newly introduced linen manufacture soon made it one of the most flourishing
                    towns of Switzerland. About the middle of the 14th century the burghers began to
                    share in the government of the town; and in 1457 they bought up all the claims
                    of the abbots to territorial jurisdiction. In 1454 St Gall joined the
                    confederation of the Swiss towns, Zurich, &amp;c. Abbot Ulrich VIII. determined
                    to remove the abbey to Rorschach; but the inhabitants of St Gall, Appenzell,
                    &amp;c., combined to destroy his new buildings, and, though St Gall was besieged
                    by the abbot’s supporters and had to pay grievous damages (1490), the treaty
                    which it signed bound the abbots never to attempt to remove the relics of the
                    founder. The abbey, which had purchased the countship of Toggenburg, passed at
                    the Reformation into the hands of the town (1529), but it was restored to the
                    abbots in 1530; and, when in 1712 in the “Toggenburg War” Zurich and Bern
                    devastated the abbey and its possessions, the townsfolk remained neutral. The
                    final dissolution of the abbey occurred in 1798. Under the French, St Gall was
                    the chief town of the canton of Santis.</p>
