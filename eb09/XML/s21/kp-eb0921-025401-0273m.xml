                <p><label type="entry">SANÁ’Í</label>. Abulmajd Majdúd b. Adam, commonly known as
                    the hakim or philosopher Saná’í, the earliest among the great Sufic poets of
                    Persia, was a native of Ghazna or Ghaznín (in the present Afghánistán), and
                    flourished in the reigns of the Ghaznawid sultáns Ibráhím (1059- 1099, 451-492
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> his son Mas'úd (1099-1114), and his grandson
                    Bahrámsháh, who, after some years of desperate struggle among members of his own
                    family, ascended the throne in 1118 (512 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.)</hi> and
                    died after a long and prosperous reign in 1152 (547 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.h.).</hi> The exact dates of the poet’s birth and death are uncertain,
                    Persian authorities giving the most conflicting statements. At any rate, he must
                    have been born in the beginning of the second half of the 11th century and have
                    died between 1131 and 1150 (525 and 545 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.).</hi> He
                    gained already at an early age the reputation of a very learned and pious man
                    and of an accomplished minstrel. Like his contemporaries Mas'úd b. Sa'd b.
                    Salmán (died 1131), Hasan of Ghazna (died 1179), and Uthmán Mukhtárí (died 1149
                    or 1159), who was his master in the poetical art, he composed chiefly ḳaṣídas in
                    honour of his sovereign and the great men of the realm, but a peculiar incident
                    made him for ever abandon the highly remunerative although often perilous career
                    of a court-panegyrist, and turn his poetical aspirations to higher and less
                    worldly aims. One day, when he was proceeding to the royal palace to present an
                    encomiastic song to Sultán Ibráhím, he was taunted by a half-mad but witty
                    jester, who proposed a toast to the poet’s blindness, because with all his
                    learning and piety he had as yet only succeeded in flattering kings and princes,
                    who were mere mortals like himself, and entirely misinterpreted God’s motive in
                    creating him; Saná’í was so struck with the appropriateness of this satirical
                    remark that he forthwith gave up all the luxuries of court-life, retired from
                    the world, and devoted himself after the due performance of the pilgrimage
                    exclusively to devotional exercises, pious meditations, and the composition of
                    Ṣúfic poetry in praise of the Godhead and the divine unity. For forty years he
                    led a life of retirement and poverty, and, although Sultán Bahrámsháh offered
                    him not only a high position at court, but also his own sister in marriage, he
                    remained faithful to the austere and solitary life he had chosen. But, partly to
                    show his gratitude to the king, partly to leave a lasting monument of his genius
                    behind him, that might act as a stimulus to all disciples of the pantheistic
                    creed, he began to write his great double-rhymed poem on ethics and religious
                    life, which has served as model to Faríd-uddín 'Attár’s and Jalál-uddín Rumi’s
                    Sufic masterpieces, the <hi rend="italic">Ḥadíḳat-ulḥaḳíḳat,</hi> or “Garden of
                    Truth” (also called <hi rend="italic">Alkitáb alfakhrí),</hi> in ten cantos,
                    dealing with the following topics;—unity of the Godhead, the divine word, the
                    excellence of the prophet, reason, knowledge and faith, love, the soul, worldly
                    occupation and inattention to higher duties, stars and spheres and their
                    symbolic lore, friends and foes, separation from the world, &amp;c. One of
                    Saná’í’s earliest disciples, who wrote a preface to this work, 'All al-Raffá,
                    <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Muhammed b. 'All Raḳḳám, assigns to its composition
                    the date 1131 (525 A.H.), which in a considerable number of copies appears as
                    1140 (535 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> and states besides that the poet died
                    immediately after the completion of his task. Now, Saná’í cannot possibly have
                    died in 1131, as another of his mathnawís, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ṭaríḳ-i-taḥḳíḳ,</hi> or “Path to the Verification of Truth,” was composed,
                    according to a chronogram in its last verses, in 1134 (528 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.h.),</hi> nor even in 1140, if he really wrote, as the Átashkada says, an
                    elegy on the death of Amir Mu'izzí; for this court-poet of Sultán Sanjar lived
                    till 1147 or 1148 (542 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.).</hi> It seems, therefore,
                    that Taḳí Káshí, the most accurate among Persian biographers, is right after all
                    in fixing Saná’í’s death in 1150 (545 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> the more
                    so as 'Alí al-Raffá himself distinctly says in his preface that the poet
                    breathed his last on the 11th of Sha'bán, “which was a Sunday,” and it is only
                    in 1150 that this day happened to be the first of the week. Saná’í left, besides
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ḥadíḳah</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ṭaríḳ-i-taḥḳíḳ,</hi> several other Ṣúfic mathnawís of similar purport;—for
                    instance, the <hi rend="italic">Sair ul'iibád ilá’lma'ád,</hi> or “Man’s Journey
                    towards the Other World” (also called <hi rend="italic">Kunúz-urrumúz, "</hi>
                    The Treasures of Mysteries ”); the ' <hi rend="italic">Ishknáma,</hi> or “Book
                    of Love;” the <hi rend="italic">'Aklnáma,</hi> or “Book of Intellect;” the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kárnáma,</hi> or “Record of Stirring Deeds,” &amp;c.; and an
                    extensive díwán or collection of lyrical poetry. His tomb, called the “Mecca” of
                    Ghazna, is still visited by numerous pilgrims.</p>
                <p>Saná'í’s <hi rend="italic">Ḥadíḳah</hi> still lacks a critical edition, for which
                    ’Abd-ullatíf al-'Abbási’s commentary (completed 1632 and preserved in a somewhat
                    abridged form in several copies of the India office Library) would form an
                    excellent basis. See, on the poet’s life and works, Ouseley, <hi rend="italic"
