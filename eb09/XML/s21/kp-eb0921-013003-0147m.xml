                    art; Andrea then passed into the studio of Albani, of whom he was the last and
                    the most eminent pupil, and under Albani he made his reputation early. The
                    painter of Sacchi’s predilection was Raphael; he was the jealous opponent of
                    Pietro da Cortona, and more especially of Bernini. In process of time he became
                    one of the most learned designers and one of the soundest colourists of the
                    Roman school. He went to Venice and to Lombardy to study Venetian colour and the
                    style of Correggio; but lie found the last-named master unadaptable for his own
                    proper methods in art, and he returned to Rome. Sacchi was strong in artistic
                    theory, and in practice slow and fastidious; it was his axiom that the merit of
                    a painter consists in producing, not many middling pictures, but a few and
                    perfect ones. His works have dignity, repose, elevated yet natural forms, severe
                    but not the less pleasing colour, a learned treatment of architecture and
                    perspective; he is thus a painter of the correct and laudable academic order,
                    admired by connoisseurs rather than by ambitious students or the large public.
                    His principal painting, often spoken of as the fourth best easel-picture in
                    Rome— in the Vatican Gallery—is St Romuald relating his Vision to Five Monks of
                    his Order. The pictorial <hi rend="italic">crux</hi> of dealing with these
                    figures, who are all in the white garb of their order, has often been remarked
                    upon; and as often the ingenuity and judgment of Sacchi have been praised in
                    varying the tints of these habits according to the light and shade cast by a
                    neighbouring tree. The Vatican Gallery contains also an early painting of the
                    master,—the Miracle of St Gregory, executed in 1624; a mosaic of it was made in
                    1771 and placed in St Peter’s. Other leading examples are the Death of St Anna,
                    in S. Carlo ai Catinari; St Andrew, in the Quirinal; St Joseph, at Capo alle
                    Case; also, in fresco, a ceiling in the Palazzo Barberini—Divine Wisdom—reckoned
                    superior in expression and selection to the rival work of Pietro da Cortona.
                    There are likewise altar-pieces in Perugia, Foligno, and Camerino. Sacchi, who
                    worked almost always in Rome, left few pictures visible in private galleries:
                    one, of St Bruno, is in Grosvenor House. He had a flourishing school: Nicholas
                    Poussin and Carlo Maratta were his most eminent scholars; Luigi Garzi and
                    Francesco Lauri were others, and Sacchi’s own son Giuseppe, who died young,
                    after giving very high hopes. This must have been an illegitimate son, for
                    Andrea died unmarried. This event took place in Rome in 1661.</p>
