                    exact position as determined by the Transit of Venus Expedition in 1874 is 38°
                    42' 50" S. Lat. and 77° 32' 29" E. Long. Though the distance between the two
                    islands St Paul and New Amsterdam is only 50 miles, they belong to two separate
                    eruptive areas characterized by quite different products; and the comparative
                    bareness of St Paul is in striking contrast to the dense vegetation of New
                    Amsterdam. St Paul is 1½ miles long from north-west to southeast and its
                    coast-line is estimated at 5 nautical miles. In shape it is almost an isosceles
                    triangle with a circle inscribed tangentially to the north-east side,—the circle
                    (3940 feet in diameter) being the volcanic crater which previous to 1780 formed
                    an inland lake, but which, since the sea broke down its eastern barrier, has
                    become practically a land-locked bay entered by a narrow but gradually widening
                    passage not quite 6 feet deep. The highest ridge of the island is not more than
                    820 feet above the sea. On the south-west side the coasts are inaccessible.
                    According to M. Vélain, the island originally rose above the ocean as a mass of
                    rhyolithic trachyte similar to that which still forms the Nine Pin rock to the
                    north of the entrance to the crater. Next followed a period of activity in which
                    basic rocks were produced by submarine eruptions—lavas and scoriae of anorthitic
                    character, palagonitic tuffs, and basaltic ashes; and finally from the crater,
                    which must have been a vast lake of fire like those in the Sandwich Islands,
                    poured forth quiet streams of basaltic lavas. The island has been rapidly
                    cooling down in historic times. Dr Gillian (Lord Macartney’s visit, 1793)
                    mentions spots still too warm to walk on where no trace of heat is now
                    perceptible; and the remarkable zone of hot subsoil extending westwards from the
                    crater has lost most of the more striking characteristics recorded by
                    Hochstetter in 1857, though it is still easily distinguished by its
                    warmth-loving vegetation, <hi rend="italic">—Sphagnum lacteolum</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Lycopodium cernuum.</hi></p>
                <p>The general flora of the island is exceedingly meagre. If we leave out of view
                    the potato, carrot, parsley, cabbage, &amp;c., introduced by temporary
                    inhabitants, the list comprises <hi rend="italic">Umbclliferae,</hi> 1; <hi
                    rend="italic">Compositae,</hi> 2; <hi rend="italic">Plantaginaceae,</hi> 2; <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyperaceae,</hi> 2; <hi rend="italic">Graminaceae,</hi> 2; <hi
                    rend="italic">Lycopodiaceae,</hi> 1; ferns, 2; and from 35 to 40 species of
                    mosses and lichens. The only plants really abundant are an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isolepsis nodosa (Cyperaceae)</hi> and one or two grasses. None of the trees
                    (oak, apple, mulberry, pine, &amp;c.) introduced at different periods have
                    succeeded. The cabbage, which grows pretty freely in some parts, shows a
                    tendency to become like the Jersey variety. The pigs mentioned by Hochstetter
                    have died out; but goats, cats, rats, and mice continue to flourish,—the cats,
                    which feed mainly on birds and fish, living in apparent amity and in the same
                    holes with the rats. House-flies, bluebottles, slaters, &amp;c., literally
                    swarm. But nothing is so characteristic of St Paul as the multitude of its
                    sea-fowl,—albatrosses, petrels of many kinds, puffins, penguins, &amp;c. The
                    neighbouring waters teem with life, and, while the various genera of the seal
                    family are no longer a source of wealth, a number of vessels (50 to 80 tons)
                    from the Mascarene Islands still yearly carry on the fisheries off the coasts,
                    where <hi rend="italic">Cheilodactylus fasciatus</hi> (in shoals), <hi
                    rend="italic">Latris hecateia (cabot</hi> or <hi rend="italic">poisson de
                    fond),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mendosoma elongatum</hi> afford a rich
                    harvest. The stories told about gigantic sea creatures were curiously confirmed
                    by the Venus Expedition finding on the shore a Cephalopod (since named <hi
                    rend="italic">Mouchezis sancti pauli)</hi> which measured upwards of 22 feet
                    from the end of its body to the tip of its longest arm.</p>
                <p>The island now known as New Amsterdam was probably that sighted on 18th March
                    1522 by the companions of Magellan as they sailed back to Europe under the
                    command of Sebastian del Cano; and in 1617 the Dutch ship “Zeewolf” from Texel
                    to Bantam discovered the island which, instead of the name “Zeewolf” then
                    bestowed on it, soon after began to be called on the charts St Paul. The
                    designation “New Amsterdam” is derived from the vessel in which Van Diemen
                    sailed between the islands in 1633. The first navigator to set foot on St Paul
                    was Willem van Vlaming in 1696. Lord Macartney spent a day exploring it in 1793,
                    his guide being a marooned Frenchman, Captain Péron, whose narrative of his
                    sojourn from 1st September 1792 to 16th December 1795 is a document of great
                    value <hi rend="italic">{Mémoires du Capitaine Péron,</hi> vol. i., Paris,
                    1824). In 1843 the governor of Réunion took possession of the islands with a
                    detachment of marines,—seal-catching and the fisheries having attracted to them
                    a considerable floating population. In June 1871 the British frigate “Megaera”
                    was wrecked at the mouth of the crater and most of the 400 souls on board had to
                    reside on the island for upwards of three months. Landing on 23rd September
                    1874, a French Transit of Venus expedition remained on St Paul till 8th January
                    1875, and a visit of much importance was paid to New Amsterdam.</p>
