                    August 1802. His family had been known in Tyrol by its sculptors for three
                    centuries; young Ludwig received his earliest lessons from his father, and the
                    father had been instructed by the grandfather. The last to bear the name was
                    Xaver, who worked in his cousin Ludwig’s studio and survived till 1854. For
                    successive generations the family lived by the carving of busts and sepulchral
                    monuments, and from the condition of mechanics rose to that of artists.</p>
                <p>From the Munich gymnasium Schwanthaler passed as a student to the Munich academy;
                    at first he purposed to be a painter, but afterwards reverted to the plastic
                    arts of his ancestors. His talents received timely encouragement by a commission
                    for an elaborate silver service for the king’s table. Cornelius also befriended
                    him; the great painter was occupied on designs for the decoration in fresco of
                    the newly erected Glyptothek, and at his suggestion Schwanthaler was employed on
                    the sculpture within the halls. Thus arose between painting, sculpture, and
                    architecture that union and mutual support which characterized the revival of
                    the arts in Bavaria. Schwanthaler in 1826 went to Italy as a pensioner of King
                    Louis, and on a second visit in 1832 Thorwaldsen gave him kindly help. His skill
                    was so developed that on his return he was able to meet the extraordinary demand
                    for sculpture consequent on King Louis’s passion for building new palaces,
                    churches, galleries, and museums, and he became the fellow-worker of the
                    architects Klenze, Gärtner, and Ohlmüller, and of the painters Cornelius,
                    Schnorr, and Hess. Owing to the magnitude and multitude of the plastic products
                    they turned out, over-pressure and haste in design and workmanship brought down
                    the quality of the art. The works of Schwanthaler in Munich are so many and
                    miscellaneous that they can only be briefly indicated. The new palace is peopled
                    with his statues: the throne-room has twelve imposing gilt bronze figures 10
                    feet high; the same palace is also enriched with a frieze and with sundry other
                    decorations modelled and painted from his drawings. The sculptor, like his
                    contemporary painters, received help from trained pupils. The same prolific
                    artist also furnished the old Pinakothek with twenty-five marbles, commemorative
                    of as many great painters; likewise he<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n482/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0482-0461"/> supplied a composition for the pediment of the
                    exhibition building facing the Glyptothek, and executed sundry figures for the
                    public library and the hall of the marshals. Sacred art lay outside his ordinary
                    routine, yet in the churches of St Ludwig and St Mariahilf he gave proof of the
                    widest versatility. The Ruhmeshalle afforded further gauge of unexampled power
                    of production; here alone is work which, if adequately studied, might have
                    occupied a lifetime; ninety-two metopes, and, conspicuously, the giant figure of
                    Bavaria, 60 feet high, rank among the boldest feats of physical force. A short
                    life of forty-six years did not permit serious undertakings beyond the Bavarian
                    capital, yet time was found for the groups within the north pediment of the
                    Walhalla, Ratisbon, and also for numerous portrait statues, including those of
                    Mozart, Jean Paul Richter, Goethe, and Shakespeare. Schwanthaler died at Munich
                    in 1848, and left by will to the Munich academy all his models and studies,
                    which now form the Schwanthaler Museum. The sculptor’s style may be designated
                    as romantic-classic or modern-antique, and its conventional ideal stands far
                    removed from the schools of naturalism and of realism.</p>
