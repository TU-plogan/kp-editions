                <p><label type="entry">SHAKERS</label> is the name commonly applied to and not
                    rejected by a religious denomination of which the official title is “The United
                    Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing.” The foundress was Ann Lee,
                    who was born in Toad Lane, Manchester, 29th February 1736, but only privately
                    baptized 1st June 1742. Her father was a blacksmith, and at an early age she
                    found employment, being at one time a cutter of hatter’s fur, and at another
                    cook in the infirmary of her native town. She was a quiet child of a somewhat
                    visionary temperament, and in 1758 joined a small religious body, a remnant of
                    the French Prophets. The leader was Jane Wardley, who was regarded by her
                    followers as the “spirit of John the Baptist operating in the female line.”
                    These people were called Shakers because, like the early Quakers, they were
                    seized with violent tremblings and shakings when under the influence of strong
                    religious emotion. Ann Lee in 1762 married a blacksmith whose character was not
                    very good. Their four children died in infancy. She became “a seeker after
                    salvation,” and her conversion was followed by her taking the lead in the Shaker
                    Society, to which she promulgated a doctrine of celibacy. Their previous
                    training had led them to expect that the second coming of Christ would be in the
                    form of a woman; as Eve was the mother of all living, so in their new leader the
                    Shakers recognized “the first mother or spiritual parent in the line of the
                    female.” With their new-born zeal aflame, they preached their doctrine in season
                    and out of season, and suffered something from mob violence and from the
                    intolerance of the constituted authorities. In<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0762-0737"/> 1774 Ann the Word and eight of her disciples
                    emigrated to America, and landed at New York on August 1st of that year. Abraham
                    Stanley, not relishing his wife’s celibate creed, abandoned her for another
                    woman. The “Believers” settled at Neuskenna, now called Watervliet, and were
                    imprisoned for refusing to take the oath, for which reason they were suspected
                    of being unfavourable to the cause of the Revolution. On being released they
                    preached their creed and gradually gained converts. Ann Lee died at Watervliet
                    8th September 1780. She was succeeded by James Whittaker, who died in 1788, when
                    Joseph Meacham succeeded to the leadership and organized the society on that
                    communistic basis which now distinguishes it. In the early history of the
                    Shakers various charges were brought against them, including flagellation and
                    naked dancing, but they have outlived these scandals and are now generally
                    respected. There is an interesting sketch of a Shaker community in Howell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Undiscovered Country.</hi> They all work; they are capital
                    agriculturists; they have a widespread reputation for thoroughness, frugality,
                    and temperance. They believe in the reality of constant intercourse with the
                    world of spirits. There are “poems” by Mother Ann which it is claimed have been
                    dictated by her from the spirit world. They claim from time to time the exercise
                    of the gift of tongues and the gift of healing. The theological ideas of the
                    Shakers are set forth in the <hi rend="italic">Testimony of Christ's Second
                    Appearing exemplified by the Principle and Practice of the True Church of
                    Christ,</hi> of which a fourth edition, printed in 1856, was extensively
                    circulated. A compacter statement is that in F. W. Evans’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shakers’ Compendium,</hi> which was printed at New Lebanon in 1859. Elder
                    Evans, who is the best-known representative of Shakerism, is of English birth,
                    and has published an autobiography. In 1870 there were eighteen distinct Shaker
                    communities, with eighteen church buildings capable of seating 8850 persons, and
                    possessing property valued at $86,900. These socialist villages are in
                    Connecticut, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, and
                    Ohio.</p>
                <p>The best known of the settlements is that at New Lebanon, where there are three
                    separate societies in view of each other. The North Family, the Church Family,
                    and the Second Family are distinct groups, whose members live together and have
                    a common right to land, house, hats, tools, books, and all that there is. The
                    only form of government is that supplied by the public opinion of the community,
                    as expressed in its social meetings for mutual confession, counsel, and
                    criticism. Mr Hepworth Dixon’s <hi rend="italic">New America</hi> gives an
                    interesting account of their communistic methods.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is considerable similarity between the
                    American disciples of Ann Lee and the English Shakers of the New Forest, who
                    came into public notice in 1874. One of their members had bought 31 acres of
                    land, which they cultivated under the direction of “Mother” Mary Ann Girling,
                    who was at once their foundress and prophetess. As the result of some litigation
                    the Shakers were ejected in 1874, and, after having shelter for a time on a farm
                    belonging to the Hon. Auberon Herbert, they then became a tent community.
                    Charges were made against them of naked dancing in the course of their religious
                    ecstasies. They believe in the second advent, regard Mrs Girling as the woman
                    Messiah, have all property in common, and preach the doctrine of
                    celibacy.</p></note></p>
                <p>There is an extensive literature respecting the Shakers; a bibliography is
                    appended to W. E. A. Axon’s <hi rend="italic">Biographical Notice of Ann
