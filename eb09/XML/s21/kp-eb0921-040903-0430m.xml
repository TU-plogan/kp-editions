                    was placed by his parents in a Moravian school at Niesky in Upper Lusatia, and
                    two years later in the seminary of the same sect at Barby near Halle. Here
                    Moravian theology proved inadequate to satisfy the deep religious needs and
                    awakening intellect of the youth. It was particularly the doctrines of eternal
                    punishment, of the deity and the substitutionary sufferings of Christ, and of
                    the total corruption of human nature that were stumbling-blocks to him. He was
                    also unable to make his own the peculiar religious experiences of his Moravian
                    and pietistic teachers. The efforts of his strictly orthodox father and of the
                    heads of the seminary to lead him to crush his doubts as sinful, and to shun
                    modern theology and literature, tended only to strengthen his desire to explore
                    the great world of knowledge. Reluctantly his father gave him permission to
                    leave Barby for the university of Halle, and the correspondence between the
                    father and the son on this painful crisis in Friedrich’s life supplies a
                    striking illustration of a typical phase of distressing modern mental history.
                    When Schleiermacher entered the university of Halle (1787) the reign of pietism
                    there had ceased, having given way to the rationalistic philosophy of Wolf with
                    the critical theology of Sender, though the new philosophy of Kant was rapidly
                    displacing Wolf’s. As a student he pursued an independent course of reading and
                    neglected to his permanent loss the study of the Old Testament and the Oriental
                    languages. But he frequented the lectures of Semler and of J. A. Eberhard,
                    acquiring from the former the principles of an independent criticism of the New
                    Testament and from the latter his love of Plato and Aristotle. At the same time
                    he studied with great earnestness the writings of Kant and Jacobi. He commenced
                    thus early his characteristic habit of forming his opinions by the process of
                    patiently examining and weighing the positions of all thinkers and parties. But
                    with the receptivity of a great eclectic he combined the reconstructive power of
                    a profoundly original thinker. While yet a student he began to apply ideas
                    gathered from the Greek philosophers in a reconstruction of Kant’s system. At
                    the completion<pb break="no"

                    through the influence of the court-chaplain Sack an appointment as private tutor
                    in the family of Count Dohna-Schlobitten, which he held upwards of two years,
                    developing in a cultivated and aristocratic household his deep love of family
                    and social life. After short engagements in tuition and as <hi rend="italic"
                    >locum tenens</hi> to a clergyman of the small town of Landsberg, he received
                    (1796) the appointment of chaplain to the Charité Hospital in Berlin, a position
                    which he held nearly six years, and which offered no scope for the development
                    of his powers as a preacher. He was the more induced to seek the satisfaction of
                    his mental and spiritual necessities in the cultivated society of Berlin, and in
                    profound philosophical studies. This was the period in which he was constructing
                    the framework of his philosophical and religious system. It was the period too
                    when he made himself widely acquainted with art, literature, science, aud modern
                    culture generally. He was at that time profoundly affected by German
                    Romanticism, as represented by his friend Friedrich Schlegel, and it required
                    all the energy of his moral nature and the force of his intellect to preserve
                    himself from its moral and mental extravagances. Of this his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confidential Letters</hi> on Schlegel’s <hi rend="italic">Lucinde</hi> (1801),
                    as well as his perilous relation to Eleonore Grunow, the wife of a Berlin
                    clergyman, are proof and illustration. Gradually his sound moral nature, his
                    deep religiousness, and his powerful intellect enabled him to emancipate himself
                    entirely from the errors and weaknesses of a transient phase of mental and
                    social history, and to appropriate at the same time the elements of truth and
                    goodness which it possessed in rich measure. Romanticism unlocked for him the
                    divine treasures of life and truth which are stored in the feelings and
                    intuitions of the human soul, and thus enabled him to lay the foundations of his
                    philosophy of religion and his ethical system. It enriched his imagination and
                    life too with ideals ancient and modern, which gave elevation, depth, and colour
                    to all his thought. Meantime he studied Spinoza and Plato, and was profoundly
                    influenced by both, though he was never a Spinozist; he made Kant more and more
                    his master, though he departed on fundamental points from him, and finally
                    remodelled his philosophy; with some of Jacobi’s positions he was in sympathy,
                    and from Fichte and Schelling he accepted ideas, which in their place in his
                    system, however, received another value and import. The literary fruit of this
                    period of intense fermentation and of rapid development was his “epoch-making”
                    book, <hi rend="italic">Reden Über die Religion</hi> (1799), and his “new year’s
                    gift” to the new century, the <hi rend="italic">Monologen</hi> (1800). In the
                    first book he vindicated for religion an eternal place amongst the divine
                    mysteries of human nature, distinguished it from all current caricatures of it
                    and allied phenomena, and described the perennial forms of its manifestation and
                    life in men and society, giving thereby the programme of his subsequent
                    theological system. In the <hi rend="italic">Monologen</hi> he threw out his
                    ethical manifesto, in which he proclaimed his ideas as to the freedom and
                    independence of the spirit, and as to the relation of the mind to the world of
                    sense and imperfect social organizations, and sketched his ideal of the future
                    of the individual and society. In 1802, to his great advantage morally and
                    intellectually, Schleiermacher exchanged the brilliant circle of Berlin
                    Romanticists for the retired life of a pastor in the little Pomeranian town of
                    Stolpe. Here he remained two years, which were full of pastoral and literary
                    work, as well as rich in personal and moral progress. He relieved Friedrich
                    Schlegel entirely of his nominal responsibility for the translation of Plato,
                    which they had together undertaken, and regarded the completion of it as the
                    work of his life. The first volume was published in 1804, and the last (the <hi
                    rend="italic">Republic)</hi> in 1828. At the same time another work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Grundlinien einer Kritik der bisherigen Sittenlehre</hi> (1803),
                    the first of his strictly critical and philosophical productions, occupied him.
                    This work is a severe criticism of all previous moral systems, especially those
                    of Kant and Fichte, Plato’s and Spinoza’s finding most favour; its leading
                    principles are that the tests of the soundness of a moral system are the
                    completeness of its view of the laws and ends of human life as a whole and the
                    harmonious arrangement of its subject-matter under one fundamental principle;
                    and, though it is almost exclusively critical and negative, the book announces
                    clearly the division and scope of moral science which Schleiermacher
                    subsequently adopted, attaching prime importance to a “Güterlehre,” or doctrine
                    of the ends to be obtained by moral action. But the obscurity of the style of
                    the book as well as its almost purely negative results proved fatal to its
                    immediate success. In 1804 Schleiermacher removed as university preacher and
                    professor of theology to Halle, where he remained until 1807, and where he
                    quickly obtained a reputation as professor and preacher, and exercised a
                    powerful influence in spite of the contradictory charges of his being an
                    atheist, Spinozist, and pietist. In this period he wrote his dialogue the <hi
                    rend="italic">Weihnachtsfeier</hi> (1806), a charming production, which holds a
                    place midway between his <hi rend="italic">Reden</hi> and his great dogmatic
                    work the <hi rend="italic">Christliche Glaube,</hi> and presents in the persons
                    of its speakers phases of his growing appreciation of Christianity as well as
                    the conflicting elements of the theology of the period. After the battle of Jena
                    he returned to Berlin (1807), was soon appointed pastor of the Trinity Church
                    there, and the next year married the widow of his friend Willich. At the
                    foundation of the Berlin university (1810), in which he took a prominent part,
                    he was called to a theological chair, and soon became secretary to the Academy
                    of Sciences. He was thus placed in a position suited to his powers and in
                    domestic and social surroundings adapted to meet the wants of his rich nature.
                    At the same time he approved himself in the pulpit and elsewhere as a
                    large-hearted and fearless patriot in that time of national calamity and
                    humiliation, acquiring a name and place in his country’s annals with Arndt,
                    Fichte, Stein, and Scharnhorst. He took a prominent part too in the
                    reorganization of the Prussian church, and became the most powerful advocate of
                    the union of the Lutheran and Reformed divisions of German Protestantism. The
                    twenty-four years of his professional career in Berlin were opened with his
                    short but important outline of theological study <hi rend="italic">(Kurze
                    Darstellung des theologischen Studiums,</hi> 1810), in which he sought to do for
                    theology what he had done for religion in his <hi rend="italic">Reden.</hi>
                    While he preached every Sunday, he also gradually took up in his lectures in the
                    university almost every branch of theology and philosophy—New Testament
                    exegesis, introduction to and interpretation of the New Testament, ethics (both
                    philosophic and Christian), dogmatic and practical theology, church history,
                    history of philosophy, psychology, dialectics (logic and metaphysics), politics,
                    paedagogy, and aesthetics. His own materials for these lectures and his
                    students’ notes and reports of them are the only form in which the larger
                    proportion of his works exist,—a circumstance which has greatly increased the
                    difficulty of getting a clear and harmonious view of fundamental portions of his
                    philosophical and ethical system, while it has effectually deterred all but the
                    most courageous and patient students from reading these posthumous collections.
                    As a preacher he produced a powerful effect, yet not at all by the force of his
                    oratory but by his intellectual strength, his devotional spirit, and the
                    philosophical breadth and unity of his thought. In politics he was an earnest
                    friend of<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n432/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0432-0411"/> liberty and progress, and in the period of
                    reaction which followed the overthrow of Napoleon he was charged by the Prussian
                    Government with “demagogic agitation” in conjunction with the great patriot
                    Arndt. At the same time he prepared for the press his chief theological work <hi
                    rend="italic">Der christliche Glaube nach den Grundsätzen der evangelischen
                    Kirche</hi> (1821-22; 2d edition, greatly altered, 1830-31). The fundamental
                    principle of this classical work is, that religious feeling, the sense of
                    absolute dependence on God as communicated by Jesus Christ through the church,
                    and not the creeds or the letter of Scripture or the rationalistic
                    understanding, is the source and law of dogmatic theology. The work is therefore
                    simply a description of the facts of religious feeling, or of the inner life of
                    the soul in its relations to God, and these inward facts are looked at in the
                    various stages of their development and presented in their systematic connexion.
                    The aim of the work was to reform Protestant theology by means of the
                    fundamental ideas of the <hi rend="italic">Reden,</hi> to put an end to the
                    unreason and superficiality of both super naturalism and rationalism, and to
                    deliver religion and theology from a relation of dependence on perpetually
                    changing systems of philosophy. Though the work added to the reputation of its
                    author, it naturally aroused the increased opposition of the theological schools
                    it was intended to overthrow, and at the same time Schleiermacher’s defence of
                    the right of the church to frame its own liturgy in opposition to the arbitrary
                    dictation of the monarch or his ministers brought upon him fresh troubles. He
                    felt himself in Berlin more and more isolated, although his church and his
                    lecture-room continued to be largely attended. But he prosecuted his translation
                    of Plato and prepared a new and greatly altered edition of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Christliche Glaube,</hi> anticipating the latter in two letters to his friend
                    Lücke (in the <hi rend="italic">Studien und Kritiken,</hi> 1829), in which he
                    defended with a masterly hand his theological position generally and his book in
                    particular against opponents on the right and the left. The same year he lost
                    his only son—a blow which, he said, “drove the nails into his own coffin.” But
                    he continued to defend his theological position against Hengstenberg’s party on
                    the one hand and the rationalists Von Cölln and D. Schulz on the other,
                    protesting against both subscription to the ancient creeds and the imposition of
                    a new rationalistic formulary. In the midst of such labours, and enjoying still
                    full bodily and mental vigour, he was carried off after a few days’ illness by
                    inflammation of the lungs. He died thinking “the profoundest speculative ideas
                    which were one with his deepest religious feeling,” and partaking of the
                    sacrament of the Lord’s supper, February 12, 1834.</p>
                <p>Schleiermacher’s friend, the naturalist and poet Steffens, has left the following
                    description of his appearance about the beginning of the century
                    :—“Schleiermacher was of small stature, a little deformed, yet hardly enough to
                    disfigure him; all his movements were animated, and his features in the highest
                    degree expressive; a certain keenness in his glance produced perhaps a repellent
                    effect; indeed, he appeared to see through every one; his face rather long, all
                    his features sharply cut, the lips firmly closed, the chin projecting, the eyes
                    animated and flashing, his look always serious, collected, and thoughtful.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Schleiermacher's Philosophical System.—</hi> A great antithesis
                    lies at the basis of all thought and life—that of the real and the ideal, of
                    organism, or sense, and intellect. But the antithesis is not absolute, for in
                    life and being both elements are united—though without its presence life and
                    thought would be impossible. In the actual world the antithesis appears as
                    reason and nature, in each of which, however, there is a combination of its two
                    elements—the ideal and the real,—the reason having a preponderance of the first
                    and nature a preponderance of the second. At the basis of nature lies universal
                    reason as its organizing principle, and when reason becomes a conscious power in
                    man it finds itself in conflict as well as in harmony with external nature. The
                    whole effort and end of human thought and action is the gradual reduction of the
                    realm and the power of this antithesis in the individual, the race, and the
                    world. Though the antithesis is real and deep, the human mind cannot admit its
                    absolute nature; we are compelled to suppose a transcendental reality or entity
                    in which the real and the ideal, being and thought, subject and object, are one.
                    Consciousness itself involves the union of the antithetic elements, and prior to
                    moral action nature is found organized and reason manifested or symbolized
                    therein. We are ourselves proofs of the unity of the real and the ideal, of
                    thought and being, for we are both, our selfconsciousness supplying the
                    expression of the fact. As we have in ourselves an instance of the identity of
                    thought and being, we must suppose a universal identity of the ideal and real
                    behind the antithesis which constitutes the world. This supposition is the basis
                    of all knowledge, for thought becomes knowledge only when it corresponds to
                    being. The supposition may be called a belief, but it is so only in the sense in
                    which belief appears in the religious department, where it is the ultimate
                    ground of all action. The supposition is the basis of all ethics, for without
                    the conviction of the correspondence of thought and reality action would be
                    fruitless and in the end impossible. It is above all the substance of religious
                    feeling, which is the immediate consciousness of the unity of the world, of the
                    absolute oneness behind the infinite multiplicity of contrasts; indeed, it is
                    the religious conviction of the unity which is the best guarantee of the truth
                    of the suppositions of philosophy. It is “the religious consciousness of the
                    unity of the intellectual and physical world in God” which is to overcome the
                    scepticism of the critical philosophy. But, though this unity must be laid down
                    as the basis of knowledge, it is absolute and transcendental. In contrast with
                    the “world,” as the totality of being in its differentiation, this absolute
                    unity, or God, in whom the real as manifold, and the spirit as one, find their
                    unifying base, by its very nature is unphenomenal, indefinable, and
                    inconceivable. The idea is outside the boundary of thought, though its necessary
                    postulate, and it is no less inaccessible to religious feeling, though it is its
                    life and soul. Neither member of the antithesis of the real and the ideal must
                    be conceived as producing the other; they are both equally existent and equally
                    constituent elements of the world; but in God they are one, and therefore the
                    world must not be identified with Him. The world and God are distinct, but
                    correlative, and neither can be conceived without the other. The world without
                    God would be “chaos,” and God without the world an empty “phantasm.” But though
                    God is transcendent and unknowable He is immanent in the world. In
                    self-consciousness God is present as the basis of the unity of our nature in
                    every transition from an act of knowledge to an act of will, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> As far as man is the unity of the real and the
                    ideal, God is in him. He is also in all things, inasmuch as in everything the
                    totality of the world and its transcendental basis is presupposed by virtue of
                    their being and correlation. The unity of our personal life amidst the
                    multiplicity of its functions is the symbol of God’s immanence in the world,
                    though we may not conceive of the Absolute as a person. The idea of the world as
                    the totality of being is, like the correlative idea of God, only of regulative
                    value; it is transcendent, as we never do more than make approaches to a
                    knowledge of the sum of being. The one idea is the transcendental <hi
                    rend="italic">terminus a quo</hi> and the other the transcendental <hi
                    rend="italic">terminus ad quem</hi> of all knowledge. But though the world
                    cannot be exhaustively known it can be known very extensively, and though the
                    positive idea of God must always remain unattainable we are able to reject those
                    ideas which involve a contradiction of the postulate of the Absolute. Thus the
                    pantheistic and the theistic conceptions of God as the supreme power, as the
                    first cause, as a person, are alike unallowable, since they all bring God within
                    the sphere of antithesis and preclude His absolute unity. On the other hand, the
                    world can be known as the realm of antithesis, and it is the correlative of God.
                    Though He may not be conceived as the absolute cause of the world, the idea of
                    absolute causality as symbolized in it may be taken as the best approximate
                    expression of the contents of the religious consciousness. The unbroken
                    connexion of cause and effect throughout the world becomes thus a manifestation
                    of God. God is to be sought only in ourselves and in the world. He is completely
                    immanent in the universe. It is impossible that His causality should have any
                    other sphere than the world, which is the totality of being. “No God without a
                    world, and no world without God.” The divine omnipotence is quantitatively
                    represented by the sum of the forces of nature, and qualitatively distinguished·
                    from them only as the unity of infinite causality from the multiplicity of its
                    finite phenomena. Throughout the world—not excepting the realm of mind—absolute
                    necessity prevails. As <hi rend="italic">a</hi> whole the world is as good and
                    perfect as a world could possibly be, and everything in it, as occupying its
                    necessary place in the whole, is also good, evil being only the necessary
                    limitation of individual being.</p>
                <p>Schleiermacher’s psychology takes as its basis the phenomenal dualism of the ego
                    and the non-ego, and regards the life of man as<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n433/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0433-0412"/> the interaction of these elements with their
                    interpenetration as its infinite destination. The dualism is therefore not
                    absolute, and, though present in man’s own constitution as composed of body and
                    soul, is relative only even there. The ego is itself both body and soul,—the
                    conjunction of both constitutes it; our “organization” or sense nature has its
                    intellectual element, and our “intellect” its organic element. There is no such
                    thing as “pure mind” or “pure body.” The one general function of the ego,
                    thought, becomes in relation to the non-ego either receptive or spontaneous
                    action, and in both forms of action its organic, or sense, and its intellectual
                    energies co-operate; and in relation to man, nature, and the universe the ego
                    gradually finds its true individuality by becoming a part of them, “every
                    extension of consciousness being higher life.” The specific functions of the
                    ego, as determined by the relative predominance of sense or intellect, are
                    either functions of the senses (or organism) or functions of the intellect. The
                    former fall into the two classes of feelings (subjective) and perceptions
                    (objective); the latter, according as the receptive or the spontaneous element
                    predominates, into cognition and volition. In cognition being is the object and
                    in volition it is the purpose of thought: in the first case we receive (in our
                    fashion) the object of thought into ourselves; in the latter we plant it out
                    into the world. Both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as
                    forms of moral action. It is in those two functions that the real life of the
                    ego is manifested, but behind them is <hi rend="italic">self-consciousness</hi>
                    permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective—consciousness
                    of ourselves and of tho non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special
                    form or function of thought,—which is also called feeling and immediate
                    knowledge. In it we cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego. As
                    the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, we feel
                    pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral, and religious feelings are respectively
                    produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas,—nature, mankind,
                    and the world; those feelings are the sense of being one with these vast
                    objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life;
                    in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense
                    of absolute dependence. Schleiermacher’s doctrine of knowledge accepts the
                    fundamental principle of Kant that knowledge is bounded by experience, but it
                    seeks to remove Kant’s scepticism as to knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">Bing
                    an sich,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sein,</hi> as Schleiermacher’s term is. The
                    idea of knowledge or scientific thought as distinguished from the passive form
                    of thought—of aesthetics and religion—is thought which is produced by all
                    thinkers in the same form and which corresponds to being. All knowledge takes
                    the form of the concept <hi rend="italic">(Begriff)</hi> or the judgment <hi
                    rend="italic">(Urtheil),</hi> the former conceiving the variety of being as a
                    definite unity and plurality, and the latter simply connecting the concept with
                    certain individual objects. In the concept therefore the intellectual and in the
                    judgment the organic or sense element predominates. The universal uniformity of
                    the production of judgments presupposes the uniformity of our relations to the
                    outward world, and the uniformity of concepts rests similarly on the likeness of
                    our inward nature. This uniformity is not based on the sameness of cither the
                    intellectual or the organic functions alone, but on the correspondence of the
                    forms of thought and sensation with the forms of being. The essential nature of
                    the concept is that it combines the general and the special, and the same
                    combination recurs in being; in being the system of substantial or permanent
                    forms answers to the system of concepts and the relation of cause and effect to
                    the system of judgments, the higher concept answering to “force” and tho lower
                    to the phenomena of force, and the judgment to the contingent interaction of
                    things. The sum of being consists of the two systems of substantial forms and
                    interactional relations, and it reappears in the form of concept and judgment,
                    the concept representing being and the judgment being in action. Knowledge has
                    under both forms the same object, the relative difference of the two being that
                    when the conceptual form predominates we have speculative science and when the
                    form of judgment prevails we have empirical or historical science. Throughout
                    the domain of knowledge the two forms are found in constant mutual relations,
                    another proof of the fundamental unity of thought and being or of the
                    objectivity of knowledge. It is obvious that Plato, Spinoza, and Kant had
                    contributed characteristic elements of their thought to this system, and
                    directly or indirectly it was largely indebted to Schelling for fundamental
                    conceptions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Schleicrmacher's Ethics.—</hi> Next to religion and theology it
                    was to the moral world, of which, indeed, the phenomena of religion and theology
                    were in his systems only constituent elements, that he specially devoted
                    himself. In his earlier essays he endeavoured to point out the defects of
                    ancient and modern ethical thinkers, particularly of Kant and Fichte, Plato and
                    Spinoza only finding favour in his eyes. He failed to discover in previous moral
                    systems any necessary basis in thought, any completeness as regards tho
                    phenomena of moral action, any systematic arrangement of its parts, and any
                    clear and distinct treatment of specific moral acts and relations. His own moral
                    system is an attempt to supply these deficiencies. It connects the moral world
                    by a deductive process with the fundamental idea of knowledge aud being; it
                    offers a view of the entire world of human action which at all events aims at
                    being exhaustive; it presents an arrangement of the matter of the science which
                    tabulates its constituents after the model of the physical sciences; and it
                    supplies a sharply defined treatment of specific moral phenomena in their
                    relation to the fundamental idea of human life as a whole. Schleiermacher
                    defines ethics as the theory of the nature of the reason, or as the scientific
                    treatment of the effects produced by human reason in the world of nature and
                    man. As a theoretical or speculative science it is purely descriptive and not
                    practical, being correlated on the one hand to physical science and on the other
                    to history. Its method is the same as that of physical science, being
                    distinguished from the latter only by its matter. The ontological basis of
                    ethics is the unity of the real and the ideal, and the psychological and actual
                    basis of the ethical process is the tendency of reason and nature to unite in
                    the form of the complete organization of the latter by the former. The end of
                    the ethical process is that nature <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> all that is not
                    mind, the human body as well as external nature) may become the perfect symbol
                    and organ of miud. Conscience, as the subjective expression of the presupposed
                    identity of reason and nature in their bases, guarantees the practicability of
                    our moral vocation. Nature is preordained or constituted to become the symbol
                    and organ of mind, just as mind is endowed with the impulse to realize this end.
                    But the moral law must not be conceived under the form of an “imperative” or a
                    <hi rend="italic">“Sollen”</hi>; it differs from a law of nature only as being
                    descriptive of the fact that it ranks the mind as conscious will, or <hi
                    rend="italic">zweckdenkend,</hi> above nature. Strictly speaking, the antitheses
                    of good and bad and of free and necessary have no place in an ethical system,
                    but simply in history, which is obliged to compare the actual with the ideal,
                    but as far as the terms “good” and “bad” are used in morals they express the
                    rule or the contrary of reason, or the harmony or the contrary of the particular
                    and the general. The idea of “free” as opposed to necessary expresses simply the
                    fact that the mind can propose to itself ends, though a man cannot alter his own
                    nature. In contrast to Kant and Fichte and modern moral philosophers
                    Schleiermacher reintroduced and assigned pre-eminent importance to the doctrine
                    of the <hi rend="italic">summum bonum,</hi> or highest good. It represents in
                    his system the ideal and aim of the entire life of man, supplying the ethical
                    view of the conduct of individuals in relation to society and the universe, and
                    therewith constituting a philosophy of history at the same time. Starting with
                    the idea of the highest good and of its constituent elements <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Guter),</hi> or the chief forms of the union of mind and nature,
                    Schleiermacher’s system divides itself into the doctrine of moral ends, the
                    doctrine of virtue, and the doctrine of duties; in other words, as a development
                    of the idea of the subjection of nature to reason it becomes a description of
                    the actual forms of the triumphs of reason, of the moral power manifested
                    therein, and of the specific methods employed. Every moral good or product has a
                    fourfold character: it is individual and universal; it is an organ and symbol of
                    the reason, that is, it is the product of the individual with relation to the
                    community, and represents or manifests as well as classifies and rules nature.
                    The first two characteristics provide for the functions and rights of the
                    individual as well as those of the community or race. Though a moral action may
                    have these four characteristics at various degrees of strength, it ceases to be
                    moral if one of them is quite absent. All moral products may be classified
                    according to the predominance of one or the other of these characteristics.
                    Universal organizing action produces the forms of intercourse, and universal
                    symbolizing action produces the various forms of science; individual organizing
                    action yields the forms of property and individual symbolizing action the
                    various representations of feeling, all these constituting the relations, the
                    productive spheres, or the social conditions of moral action. Moral functions
                    cannot be performed by the individual in isolation but only in his relation to
                    the family, the state, the school, the church, and society,—all forms of human
                    life which ethical science finds to its hand and leaves to the science of
                    natural history to account for. The moral process is accomplished by the various
                    sections of humanity in their individual spheres, and the doctrine of virtue
                    deals with the reason as the moral power in each individual by which the
                    totality of moral products is obtained. Schleiermacher classifies the virtues
                    under the two forms of <hi rend="italic">Gesinnung</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fertigkeit,</hi> the first consisting of the pure ideal element in action and
                    the second the form it assumes in relation to circumstances, each of the two
                    classes falling respectively into the two divisions of wisdom and love and of
                    intelligence and application. In his system the doctrine of duty is the
                    description of the method of the attainment of ethical ends, the conception of
                    duty as an imperative, or obligation, being excluded, as we have seen. No action
                    fulfils the conditions of duty except as it combines the three following
                    antitheses: reference to the moral idea in its whole extent and likewise to a
                    definite moral sphere; connexion with existing conditions and at the same time
                    absolute personal production; the fulfilment of the entire moral vocation every
                    moment though<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n434/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0434-0413"/> it can only be done in a definite sphere. Duties
                    are divided with reference to the principle that every man make his own the
                    entire moral problem and act at the same time in an existing moral society. This
                    condition gives four general classes of duty: duties of general association or
                    duties with reference to the community <hi rend="italic">(Rechtspflicht),</hi>
                    and duties of vocation <hi rend="italic">(Berufspflicht,)—</hi> both with a
                    universal reference, duties of the conscience (in which the individual is sole
                    judge), and duties of love or of personal association. It was only the first of
                    the three sections of the science of ethics —the doctrine of moral ends—that
                    Schleiermacher handled with approximate completeness; the other two sections
                    were treated very summarily. In his <hi rend="italic">Christian Ethics</hi> he
                    dealt with the subject from the basis of the Christian consciousness instead of
                    from that of reason generally; the ethical phenomena dealt with are the same in
                    both systems, and they throw light on each other, while the Christian system
                    treats more at length and less aphoristically the principal ethical
                    realities—church, state, family, art, science, and society. Rothe, amongst other
                    moral philosophers, bases his system substantially, with important departures,
                    on Schleiermacher’s. In Beneke’s moral system his fundamental idea was worked
                    out in its psychological relations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Schleiermacher's Religious System.—</hi> From Leibnitz,
                    Lessing, Fichte, Jacobi, and the Romantic school he had imbibed a profound and
                    mystical view of the inner depths of the human personality. The ego, thø person,
                    is an individualization of universal reason; and the primary act of
                    self-consciousness is the first conjunction of universal and individual life,
                    the immediate union or marriage of the universe with incarnated reason. Thus
                    every person becomes a specific and original representation of the universe and
                    a compendium of humanity, a microcosmos in which the world is immediately
                    reflected. While therefore we cannot, as we have seen, attain the idea of the
                    supreme unity of thought and being by either cognition or volition, we can find
                    it in our own personality, in immediate self-consciousness or (which is the same
                    in Schleiermacher’s terminology) feeling. Feeling in this higher sense (as
                    distinguished from “organic” sensibility, <hi rend="italic">Empfindung),</hi>
                    which is the minimum of distinct antithetic consciousness, the cessation of the
                    antithesis of subject and object, constitutes likewise the unity of our being,
                    in which the opposite functions of cognition and volition have their fundamental
                    and permanent background of personality and their transitional link. Having its
                    seat in this central point of our being, or indeed consisting in the essential
                    fact of self-consciousness, religion lies at the basis of all thought and
                    action. At various periods of his life Schleiermacher used different terms to
                    represent the character and relation of religious feeling. In his earlier days
                    he called it a feeling or intuition of the universe, consciousness of the unity
                    of reason and nature, of the infinite and the eternal within the finite and the
                    temporal. In later life he described it as the feeling of absolute dependence,
                    or, as meaning the same thing, the consciousness of being in relation to God. In
                    our consciousness of the world the feelings of relative dependence and relative
                    independence are found; we are acted upon, but we also react. In our religious
                    consciousness the latter element is excluded, and everything within and without
                    us is referred to its absolute cause, that is, God. But, when we call this
                    absolute cause God, the name stands solely as indicating the unknown <hi
                    rend="italic">source</hi> of our receptive and active existence; on the one hand
                    it means that the world upon which we can react is not the source of the
                    feeling, on the other, that the Absolute is not an object of thought or
                    knowledge. This feeling of absolute dependence can arise only in combination
                    with other forms of consciousness. We derive the idea of a totality by means of
                    its parts, and the transcendental basis of being comes to us through the agency
                    of individual phenomena. As in every affection of our being by individual
                    phenomena we are brought into contact with the whole universe, we are brought
                    into contact with God at the same time as its transcendental cause. This
                    religious feeling is not knowledge in the strict sense, as it is purely
                    subjective or immediate; but it lies at the basis of all knowledge. As immediate
                    knowledge, however, it is no more than the consciousness of the unity of the
                    world, a unity which can never be reached by human inquiry. Religious truths,
                    such as the determination of all things by God, are simply the implications of
                    the feeling of absolute dependence. While that feeling is the characteristic of
                    religion generally, this assumes various forms as the religions of the world.
                    The so-called natural as distinguished from positive religion, or the religion
                    of reason, is a mere abstraction. All religions are positive, or their
                    characteristics and value are mainly determined by the manner in which the world
                    is conceived and imagined. But these varying conceptions with their religious
                    meaning become religiously productive only in the souls of religious heroes, who
                    are the authors of new religions, mediators of the religious life, founders of
                    religious communities. For religion is essentially social. It everywhere forms
                    churches, which are the necessary instruments and organs of its highest life.
                    The specific feature of Christianity is its mediatorial element, its profound
                    feeling of the striving of the finite individual to reach the unity of the
                    infinite whole, and its conception of the way in which Deity deals with this
                    effort by mediatorial agencies, which are both divine and human. It is the
                    religion of mediatorial salvation, and, as Schleiermacher emphatically taught in
                    his riper works, of salvation through the mediation of Christ; that is, its
                    possessors are conscious of having been delivered by Jesus of Nazareth from a
                    condition in which their religious consciousness was overridden by the
                    sense-consciousness of the world and put into one in which it dominates, and
                    everything is subordinated to it. The consciousness of being saved in this sense
                    is now transmitted and mediated by the Christian church, but in the case of
                    Jesus, its originator, it was an entirely new and original factor in the process
                    of religious development, and in so far, like every new and higher stage of
                    being, a supernatural revelation. It was at the same time a natural attainment,
                    in as far as man’s nature and the universe were so constituted as to involve its
                    production. The appearance of the Saviour in human history is therefore as a
                    divine revelation neither absolutely supernatural nor absolutely beyond reason,
                    and the controversy of the 18th century between the rationalists and
                    supernaturalists rests on false grounds, leads to wrong issues, and each party
                    is right and wrong (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rationalism). As</hi> regards
                    Christian theology, it is not its business to formulate and establish a system
                    of objective truth, but simply to present in a clear and connected form a given
                    body of Christian faith as the contents of the Christian consciousness. Dogmatic
                    theology is a connected and accurate account of the doctrine held at a
                    particular time in a given section of the Christian church. But such doctrines
                    as constitute no integral part of the Christian consciousness— <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the doctrine of the Trinity—must be excluded from the theological
                    system of the evangelical theologian. As regards the relation of theology and
                    philosophy, it is not one of dependence or of opposition on either side, but of
                    complete independence, equal authority, distinct functions, and perfect harmony.
                    Feeling is not a mental function subordinate to cognition or volition, but of
                    equal rank and authority; yet feeling, cognition, and volition alike conduct to
                    faith in the unknown Absolute, though by different paths and processes.</p>
                <p>The marked feature of Schleiermacher’s thought in every department is the effort
                    to combine and reconcile in the unity of a system the antithetic conceptions of
                    other thinkers. He is realistic and idealistic, individualistic and
                    universalistic, monistic and dualistic, sensationalist and intellectualist,
                    naturalist and supernaturalist, rationalist and mystic, gnostic and agnostic. He
                    is the prince of the <hi rend="italic">Vermittler</hi> in philosophy, ethics,
                    religion, and theology. But he does not seek to reconcile the antitheses of
                    thought and being by weakening and hiding the points of difference; on the
                    contrary, he brings them out in their sharpest outlines. His method is to
                    distinctly define the opposing elements and then to seek their harmonious
                    combination by the aid of a deeper conception. Apart from the positive and
                    permanent value of the higher unities which he succeeds in establishing, the
                    light and suggestiveness of his discussions and treatment of the great points at
                    issue in all the principal fields of human thought, unsatisfactory as many of
                    his positions may be considered, make him one of the most helpful and
                    instructive of modern thinkers. And, since the focus of his almost universal
                    thought and inquiry and of his rich culture and varied life was religion and
                    theology, he must be regarded as the classical representative of modern effort
                    to reconcile science and philosophy with religion and theology, and the modern
                    world with the Christian church.</p>
