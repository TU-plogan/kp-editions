                <p><label type="entry">SEA-SERPENT</label>. The belief in enormous serpents, both
                    terrestrial and marine, dates from very early times. Pliny (<hi rend="italic"
                        >H.N</hi>., viii. 14), following Livy <hi rend="italic">(Epic,</hi> xviii.),
                    tells us of a land-serpent 120 feet long, which Regulus and his army besieged
                    with balistae, as though it had been a city, and this story is repeated by
                    several other writers (Florus, ii. 2; Val. Max., i. 8; Gellius, vi. 3). The most
                    prolific in accounts of the sea-serpent, however, are the early Norse writers,
                    to whom the “Sö-Orm” was a subject both for prose and verse. Olaus Magnus <hi
                        rend="italic">(Hist. Gent. Sept.,</hi> xxi. 24) describes it as 200 feet
                    long and 20 feet round, and states that it not only ate calves, sheep, and
                    swine, but also “disturbs ships, rising up like a mast, and sometimes snaps some
                    of the men from the deck,” illustrating his account with a vivid representation
                    of the animal in the very act. Pontoppidan, in his <hi rend="italic">Natural
                        History</hi> (Eng. tr., 1755, p. 195 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> says that
                    its existence was generally believed in by the sailors and fishermen of his
                    time, and recounts the means they adopted to escape it, as well as many details
                    regarding the habits of the creature. The more circumstantial records of
                    comparatively modern times may be most conveniently grouped according to the
                    causes which presumably gave rise to the phenomena described. (1) A number of
                    porpoises swimming one behind another may, by their characteristic mode of half
                    emerging from and then re-entering the water during respiration, produce the
                    appearance of a single animal showing a succession of snake-like undulations.
                    The figure given by Pontoppidan was very likely suggested by such an appearance,
                    and a sketch of an animal seen off Llandudno by several observers<note

                    swimming at the surface of the water. (3) A large mass of seaweed has on more
