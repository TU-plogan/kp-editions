                <p><label type="entry">SCOTT, <hi rend="smallcaps">David</hi></label> (1806-1849),
                    historical painter, was born at Edinburgh in October 1806, and studied under his
                    father, Robert Scott, an engraver of repute in the city. For a time in his youth
                    he occupied himself with the burin; but he soon turned his attention to original
                    work in colour, and in 1828 he exhibited his first oil picture, the Hopes of
                    Early Genius dispelled by Death, which was followed by Cain, Nimrod, Adam and
                    Eve singing their Morning Hymn, Sarpedon carried by Sleep and Death, and other
                    subjects of a poetic and imaginative character. In 1829 he became a member of
                    the Scottish Academy, and in 1832 visited Italy, where he spent more than a year
                    in study. At Rome he executed a large symbolical painting, entitled the Agony of
                    Discord, or the Household Gods Destroyed. On his return to Scotland he continued
                    the strenuous and unwearied practice of his art; but his productions were too
                    recondite and abstract in subject ever to become widely popular, while the
                    defects and exaggerations of their draftsmanship repelled connoisseurs. So the
                    gravity which had always been characteristic of the artist passed into gloom; he
                    shrank from society and led a secluded life, hardly quitting his studio, his
                    mind constantly occupied with the great problems of life and of his art. The
                    works of his later years include Vasco da Gama encountering the Spirit of the
                    Storm, a picture— immense in size and most powerful in conception—finished in
                    1842, and now preserved in the Trinity House, Leith; the Duke of Gloucester
                    entering the Water Gate of Calais (1841), an impressive subject, more complete
                    and harmonious in execution than was usual with the artist; the Alchemist
                    (1838), Queen Elizabeth at the Globe Theatre (1840), and Peter the Hermit
                    (1845), remarkable for their varied and elaborate character-painting; and Ariel
                    and Caliban (1837) and the Triumph of Love (1846), distinguished by their beauty
                    of colouring and depth of poetic feeling. The most important of his religious
                    subjects are the Descent from the Cross (1835) and the Crucifixion— the Dead
                    Rising (1844). In addition to his works in colour Scott executed several
                    remarkable series of designs. Two of these—the Monograms of Man and the
                    illustrations to Coleridge’s <hi rend="italic">Ancient Mariner—</hi> were etched
                    by his own hand, and published in 1831 and 1837 respectively, while his subjects
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</hi> and Nichol’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Architecture of the Heavens</hi> were issued after his death.
                    Among his literary productions are five elaborate and thoughtful articles on the
                    characteristics of the Italian masters, published in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Blackwood's Magazine,</hi> 1839 to 1841, and a pamphlet on <hi
                        rend="italic">British, French, and German Painting,</hi> 1841. He died in
                    Edinburgh on the 5th of March 1849. As a colourist David Scott occupies a high
                    place in the Scottish school, but the most distinctive merit of his works lies
                    in the boldness of their conception and their imaginative and poetic power.</p>
