                    have voluntarily saved or assisted in saving a ship or boat, or their apparel,
                    or any part thereof; or the lives of persons at sea; or a ship’s cargo or any
                    part thereof from peril; or a wreck from total loss” (Roscoe, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Admiralty Law and Practice,</hi> p. 13). The word salvage is indifferently used
                    to denote the claim, the reward, or the property saved. Salvage is interesting
                    as being perhaps the one case in English law in which a person may become liable
                    to a claim upon him for services rendered to him without his request, express or
                    implied. Salvage may be either military or civil. Claims for military salvage,

                    >Prize),</hi> are decided by a prize court. The tribunal for determining cases
                    of civil salvage, the usual kind, is a court having admiralty jurisdiction. In
                    England or Ireland the High Court of Justice (Admiralty Division), in Scotland
                    the Court of Session, have cognizance of salvage claims to any amount. The
                    Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, confers jurisdiction on justices of the peace to
                    arbitrate on claims not exceeding £200, or where the value of the property saved
                    does not exceed £1000. Certain county courts named by order in council have by
                    the County Courts Admiralty Jurisdiction Act, 1868, jurisdiction in any claim in
                    which the value of the property saved does not exceed £1000, or in which the
                    amount claimed does not exceed £300. The jurisdiction of the inferior courts is
                    protected by provisions depriving the suitor in the High Court of his costs
                    without a certificate from the judge in cases where the claim might have been
                    made before justices or in a county court. In addition there are various local
                    tribunals exercising a more or less limited jurisdiction in salvage claims. Such
                    are the Commissioners within the Cinque Ports, the Court of Passage of the city
                    of Liverpool, and the Royal Courts of Jersey and Guernsey, besides the various
                    Vice-Admiralty Courts throughout the British empire.</p>
                <p>The rules which guide the courts in the award of salvage are reducible to a few
                    simple principles, depending partly upon the general maritime law, partly upon
                    the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1854 and 1862. (1) The salvage services must have
                    been rendered within the jurisdiction of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Admiralty
                    (q.v.).</hi> (2) There must be no legal duty on the part of the salvors to
                    render assistance. Therefore there must be very meritorious and exceptional
                    services on the part of the crew, or even of a pilot, a passenger, or the crew
                    of a tug, to entitle any of them to salvage. The same is the case with the
                    officers and crew of a queen’s ship, coastguardsmen, &amp;c., who are bound by
                    their position to assist. (3) The property must have been in peril, and rescued
                    by the salvors. (4) The services must have been successful. Of course where a
                    request for help has actually been made, and the property perishes, the right of
                    remuneration nevertheless survives, on the ordinary principles of contract. The
                    basis of salvage proper is service independently of contract.</p>
                <p>If these conditions be satisfied, salvage claims take priority of all others
                    against the property saved, and give the salvors a maritime lien upon such
                    property, enforceable by an action <hi rend="italic">in rem.</hi> Salvage of
                    life from a British ship or a foreign ship in British waters ranks before
                    salvage of goods. In distributing the salvage reward the court considers (1) the
                    extent of the peril of the property saved, (2) its value, (3) the nature of the
                    services. This is subject to any contract, not inequitable, made between the
                    parties. Seamen cannot abandon their right to salvage unless they specially
                    engage themselves on a ship to be employed on salvage duty. Salvage of life is
                    rewarded at a higher rate than salvage of property. Misconduct of salvors may
                    operate as a bar to their claim. Salvage reward is commonly apportioned between
                    the officers and crew of the salving ship, its owners, and other persons
                    assisting. The amount is at the discretion of the distributing authority. It
                    seldom exceeds in the whole one-half the value of the property saved.
                    Apportionment for salvage services rendered within the United Kingdom, where the
                    sum does not exceed £200, due by agreement or the order of justices, may be made
                    by the receiver of wreck on application of the parties liable to pay it.</p>
                <p>Salvage is a term also applied by analogy to property not saved at sea, but from
                    fire on land, and also to property recovered from destruction by the aid of
                    voluntary payments. The person making the last advance is entitled to priority
                    in the nature of quasi-salvage, as the continued existence of the property at
                    all may be due to him, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the case of a payment made
                    to prevent the forfeiture of a policy of insurance. Chargcs in favour of a
                    solicitor upon property recovered or preserved by his means have been several
                    times declared by the courts to be in the nature of salvage of this kind.</p>
                <p>The law of the United States is in general agreement with that of England. The
                    court of admiralty jurisdiction is the district court. The area in which salvage
                    services may be rendered is much wider than in England, as it includes the great
                    freshwater navigable rivers and lakes. This difference arises from the greater
                    importance of inland navigation in the United States. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
