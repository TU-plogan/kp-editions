                    he set himself with unwearied diligence to repair the cathedral, till the fire
                    of London in 1666 necessitated the rebuilding of it, towards which he gave
                    £1400. He also rebuilt the deanery, and improved its revenue. In 1668 he was
                    admitted archdeacon of Canterbury upon the king’s presentation, but he resigned
                    the post in 1670. In 1677, being now prolocutor of the Convocation, he was
                    unexpectedly advanced to the archbishopric of Canterbury. He attended Charles
                    II. upon his deathbed, and “made to him a very weighty exhortation, in which he
                    used a good degree of freedom.” He wrote with his own hand the petition
                    presented in 1687 against the reading of the Declaration of Indulgence, which
                    was signed by himself and six of his suffragans. For this they were all
                    committed to the Tower, but after a trial for misdemeanour they were acquitted.
                    Upon the withdrawal of James II. he concurred with the Lords in a declaration to
                    the prince of Orange for a free parliament, and due indulgence to the Protestant
                    dissenters. But, when that prince and his consort were declared king and queen,
                    he refused to take the oath to them, and was accordingly suspended and deprived.
                    From 5th August 1691 till his death on Novem ber 24, 1693, he lived a very
                    retired life in his native place. He was buried in the churchyard of
                    Fressingfield, where there is a Latin epitaph to his memory.</p>
