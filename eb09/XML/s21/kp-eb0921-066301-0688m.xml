                    (1790-1864), English political economist, was born at Compton, Berks, on 26th
                    September 1790, the eldest son of the Rev. J. R. Senior, vicar of Durnford,
                    Wilts. He was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford; at the university
                    he was a private pupil of Richard Whately, afterwards archbishop of Dublin, with
                    whom he remained connected by ties of lifelong friendship. He took the degree of
                    B.A. in 1811, was called to the bar in 1819, and in 1836, during the
                    chancellorship of Lord Cottenham, was appointed a master in chancery. On the
                    foundation of the professorship of political economy at Oxford in 1825, Senior
                    was elected to fill the chair, which he occupied till 1830, and again from 1847
                    to 1852. In 1830 he was requested by Lord Melbourne to inquire into the state of
                    combinations and strikes, to report on the state of the law, and to suggest
                    improvements in it. He was a member of the Poor Law Inquiry Commission of 1832,
                    and of the Handloom Weavers Commission of 1837; the report of the latter,
                    published in 1841, was drawn up by him, and he embodied in it the substance of
                    the report he had prepared some years before on combinations and strikes. He was
                    also one of the commissioners appointed in 1861 to inquire into popular
                    education in England. In the later years of his life, during his visits to
                    foreign countries, he studied with much care the political and social phenomena
                    they exhibited. Several volumes of his journals have been published, which
                    contain much interesting matter on these topics, though the author probably
                    rated too highly the value of this sort of social study. Senior was for many
                    years a frequent contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh, Quarterly,
                    London,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">North British Reviews,</hi> dealing in their
                    pages with literary as well as with economic and political subjects. He died at
                    Kensington on 4th June 1864.</p>
                <p>His writings on economic theory consisted of an article in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopaedia Metropolitana,</hi> afterwards separately published as <hi
                    rend="italic">An Outline of the Science of Political Economy</hi> (1836, 3d ed.
                    1854), and his lectures delivered at Oxford. Of the latter the following were
                    printed— <hi rend="italic">An Introductory Lecture</hi> (1827, 3d ed. 1831); <hi
                    rend="italic">Two Lec</hi><hi rend="italic">tures on Population,</hi> with a
                    correspondence between the author and Malthus (1831); <hi rend="italic">Three

                    translated into French by M. Arrivabène under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principes Fondamentaux d’Économie Politique</hi> (1835). Senior also wrote on
                    administrative and social questions— <hi rend="italic">A Letter to Lord Howick
                    on a Legal Provision for the Irish Poor, Commutation of Tithes, and a Provision

                <p>Senior’s literary criticisms do not seem to have ever won the favour of the
                    public; they are, indeed, somewhat formal and academic in spirit. The author,
                    while he had both good sense and right feeling, appears to have wanted the
                    deeper insight, the geniality, and the catholic tastes which are necessary to
                    make a critic of a high order, especially in the field he chose,—that, namely,
                    of imaginative literature. His tracts on practical politics, though the theses
                    they supported were sometimes questionable, were ably written and are still
                    worth reading, but cannot be said to be of much permanent interest. But his name
                    will continue to hold an honourable, though secondary, place in the history of
                    political economy. Senior regards political economy as a purely deductive
                    science, all the truths of which are inferences from four elementary
                    propositions. It is, in his opinion, wrongly supposed by J. S. Mill and others
                    to be a hypothetic science,—founded, that is to say, on postulates not
                    corresponding with social realities. The premises from which it sets out are,
                    according to him, not assumptions but facts. It concerns itself, however, with
                    wealth only, and can therefore give no practical counsel as to political action:
                    it can only suggest considerations which the politician should keep in view as
                    elements in the study of the questions with which he has to deal. The conception
                    of economics as altogether deductive is certainly erroneous, and puts the
                    science from the outset on a false path. But deduction has a real, though
                    limited, sphere within it. Hence, though the chief difficulties of the subject
                    are not of a logical kind, yet accurate nomenclature, strict definition, and
                    rigorous reasoning are of great importance. To these Senior has given special
                    attention, and, notwithstanding occasional pedantries, with very useful results.
                    He has in several instances improved the forms in which accepted doctrines were
                    habitually stated. He has also done excellent service by pointing out the
                    arbitrary novelties and frequent inconsistencies of terminology which deface
                    Ricardo’s principal work,—as, for example, his use of “value” in the sense of
                    “cost of production,” and of “high” and “low” wages in the sense of a certain
                    proportion of the product as distinguished from an absolute amount, and his
                    peculiar employment of the epithets “fixed” and “circulating” as applied to
                    capital. He shows, too, that in numerous instances the premises assumed by
                    Ricardo are false. Thus he cites the assertions that rent depends on the
                    difference of fertility of the different portions of land in cultivation; that
                    the labourer always receives precisely the necessaries, or what custom leads him
                    to consider the necessaries, of life; that, as wealth and population advance,
                    agricultural labour becomes less and less proportionately productive; and that
                    therefore the share of the produce taken by the landlord and the labourer must
                    constantly increase, whilst that taken by the capitalist must constantly
                    diminish; and he denies the truth of all these propositions. Besides adopting
                    some terms, such as that of “natural agents,” from Say, Senior<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n689/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0689-0664"/> Introduced the word “abstinence”—which, though
                    obviously not free from objection, is for some purposes useful—to express the
                    conduct of the capitalist which is remunerated by interest; but in defining
                    “cost of production” as the sum of labour and abstinence necessary to production
                    he does not seem to see that an amount of labour and an amount of abstinence are
                    disparate, and do not admit of reduction to a common quantitative standard. He
                    has added some important considerations to what had been said by Smith on the
                    division of labour. He distinguishes usefully between the rate of wages and the
                    price of labour. But in seeking to determine the law of wages he falls into the
                    error of assuming a determinate wage-fund, and states as an economic truth what
                    is only an identical proposition in arithmetic. Whilst entertaining such an
                    exaggerated estimate of the services of Malthus that he extravagantly pronounces
                    him “as a benefactor of mankind on a level with Adam Smith,” he yet shows that
                    he modified his opinions on population considerably in the course of his career,
                    regards his statements of the doctrine with which his name is associated as
                    vague and ambiguous, and asserts that, “in the absence of disturbing causes,
                    subsistence may be expected to increase in a greater ratio than population.” It
                    is urged by Périn, and must, we think, be admitted, that by his isolation of
                    economics from morals, and his assumption of the desire of wealth as the sole
                    motive-force in the economic domain, Senior has, in common with most of the
                    other followers of Smith, tended to set up egoism as the legitimate ruler and
                    guide of practical life. It is no sufficient answer to this charge that he makes
                    formal reserve in favour of higher ends. From the scientific side, Cliffe Leslie
                    has abundantly proved the unsubstantial nature of the abstraction implied in the
                    phrase “desire of wealth,” and the inadequacy of such a principle for the
                    explanation of economic phenomena. (J. K. I.)</p>
