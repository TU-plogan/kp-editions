                            von</hi></label> (1775-1854), a distinguished German philosopher, was
                    born on 27th January 1775 at Leonberg, a small town of Würtemberg, otherwise
                    notable as scene of the early years of Kepler’s life. Through both parents he
                    was connected with families of distinction in the Protestant church community.
                    His father, a solidly trained scholar of Oriental languages, was called in 1777
                    as chaplain and professor to the cloister school of Bebenhausen, near Tübingen,
                    a preparatory seminary for intending students of theology at Tübingen. Here
                    Schelling received his earliest education and gave the first evidences of what
                    afterwards so eminently distinguished him, remarkable precocity and quickness of
                    intellect. From the Latin school at Nürtingen, whither he had been sent in his
                    tenth year, he was returned in two years as having already acquired all the
                    school could give him, and his father with regret was compelled to allow him at
                    so abnormally young an age to study with the seminarists at Bebenhausen. In
                    1790, with special permission, for he was yet three years under the prescribed
                    age, Schelling entered the theological seminary at Tübingen, where he had as
                    fellow students, contemporary as scholars though elder in years, Hegel and
                    Hölderlin. The character and direction of his studies may be gathered
                    sufficiently from the titles of the essays which for various purposes were
                    accomplished during the five years of his student career. In 1792 he graduated
                    in the philosophical faculty with a thesis <hi rend="italic">Antiquissimi de
                        prima malorum humanorum origine philosophematis explicandi tentamen criticum

                    they contributed to strengthen his natural tendency to dwell rather on the large
                    historico-speculative problems than on the difficulties of abstract thinking.
                    Before the date of his last essay noted above, a new and much more important
                    influence had begun to operate on him. In conjunction with some of his
                    fellow-students he was in 1793 studying the Kantian system. The difficulties or
                    imperfections of that system he claims soon to have perceived, and no doubt the
                    perception was quickened by acquaintance with the first of those writings in
                    which Fichte put forward his amended form of the critical philosophy. The
                    “Review of Aenesidemus” and the tractate <hi rend="italic">On the Notion of
                        Wissenschaftslehre</hi> found in Schelling’s mind most fruitful soil. With
                    characteristic zeal and impetuosity Schelling had no sooner grasped the leading
                    ideas of Fichte’s new mode of treating philosophy than he threw together the
                    thoughts suggested to him in the form of an essay, which appeared, under the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Ueber die Möglichkeit einer Form der Philosophie
                        überhaupt,</hi> towards the end of 1794. There was nothing original in the
                    treatment, but it showed such power of appreciating the new ideas of the
                    Fichtean method that it was hailed with cordial recognition by Fichte himself,
                    and gave the author immediately a place in popular estimation as in the foremost
                    rank of existing philosophical writers. The essay was followed up in 1795 by a
                    more elaborate writing, <hi rend="italic">Vom Ich als Princip der Philosophie,
                        oder über das Unbedingte im menschlichen Wissen,</hi> which, still remaining
                    within the limits of the Fichtean idealism, yet exhibits unmistakable traces of
                    a tendency to give the Fichtean method a more objective application, and to
                    amalgamate with it Spinoza’s more realistic view of things.</p>
                <p>The reputation so quickly gained led soon to its natural result. In midsummer
                    1798 Schelling was called as extraordinary professor of philosophy to Jena, and
                    thus stepped into the most active literary and philosophical circle of the time.
                    The intervening period had not been unfruitful. While discharging for two years
                    at Leipsic the duties of companion or tutorial guardian to two youths of noble
                    family, Schelling had contributed various articles and reviews to Fichte and
                    Niethammer’s <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> and had thrown himself with all his
                    native impetuosity into the study of physical and medical science. From 1796
                    date the <hi rend="italic">Briefe über Dogmatismus und Kriticismus,</hi> an
                    admirably written critique of the ultimate issues of the Kantian system, which
                    will still repay study; from 1797 the essay entitled <hi rend="italic">Neue
                        Deduction des Naturrechts,</hi> which to some extent anticipated Fichte’s
                    treatment in the <hi rend="italic">Grundlage des Naturrechts,</hi> published in
                    1796, but not before Schelling’s essay had been received by the editors of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Journal.</hi> The reviews of current philosophical
                    literature were afterwards collected, and with needful omissions and corrections
                    appeared under the title “Abhandlungen zur Erläuterung des Idealismus der
                    Wissenschaftslehre” in Schelling’s <hi rend="italic">Philos. Schriften,</hi>
                    vol. i., 1809. The studies of physical science bore rapid fruit in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur,</hi> 1797, and the
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">Von der Weltseele,</hi> 1798, the drift of which will
                    be noted later.</p>
                <p>Schelling’s professoriate in Jena lasted till the early part of 1803. His
                    lectures were extraordinarily attractive; his productive powers were at their
                    best; and the circumstances of his surroundings developed forcibly the good and
                    evil qualities of his character. Of his writings during this period a merely
                    chronological notice will meanwhile suffice. In 1799 appeared the <hi
                        rend="italic">Erster Entururf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie,</hi> with
                    an independent and subsequent <hi rend="italic">Einleitung</hi>; in 1800 the <hi
                        rend="italic">System des transcendentalen Idealismus,</hi> in form one of
                    the most finished, in substance one of the most satisfactory of his works; in
                    the same year, in the <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für spekulative Physik,</hi>
                    edited by him, “Allgemeine Deduction des dynamischen Processes ”; and in 1801
                    the <hi rend="italic">Darstellung meines Systems der Philosophie-,</hi> in 1802,
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Neue Zeitschr. für spek. Physik,</hi> the “Fernere
                    Darstellungen aus dem System der Philosophie”; also in 1802 the dialogue <hi
                        rend="italic">Bruno</hi> and the excellently written <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vorlesungen über die Methode des akademischen Studiums.</hi> In conjunction
                    with Hegel, who in 1801 at Schelling’s invitation had come to Jena, he edited
                    the <hi rend="italic">Kritisches Journal für Philosophie,</hi> the greater part
                    of which was written by Hegel. Regarding the authorship of certain articles in
                    the volume and a half of this <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> a discussion of no
                    great significance has arisen, concerning which perhaps the best statement is
                    that by Schelling’s son in the preface to vol. v. of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sämmtliche Werke,</hi> Abth. i.</p>
                <p>The philosophical renown of Jena reached its culminating point during the years
                    of Schelling’s residence there, in no small measure through the imposing force
                    of his character and teaching. Recognized as of the first rank among living
                    thinkers he was received with every mark of distinction, and his intellectual
                    sympathies soon united him closely with some of the most active literary
                    tendencies of the time. With Goethe, who viewed with interest and appreciation
                    the poetical fashion of treating fact characteristic of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Naturphilosophie,</hi> he continued on excellent terms, while on the other
                    hand he was repelled by Schiller’s less expansive disposition, and failed
                    altogether to understand the lofty ethical idealism that animated his work. By
                    the representatives of the Romantic school, then in the height of their fervour
                    and beginning their downward course, he was hailed as a most potent ally, and
                    quickly became <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> the philosopher of the
                    Romantic type. The Schlegels and their friends, who had found at least one
                    fundamental principle of Romantic strain in Fichte, had begun to be dissatisfied
                    with the cold and abstract fashion of viewing nature that seemed necessarily to
                    follow from the notion of the <hi rend="italic">Wissenschaftslehre,</hi> and at
                    the same time the deep-seated antagonism of character between Fichte and the
                    impetuous litterateurs of the Romantic school was beginning to be felt. In
                    Schelling, essentially a self-conscious genius, eager and rash, yet with
                    undeniable power, they hailed a personality of the true Romantic type, and in
                    his philosophy a mode of conceiving nature adequate to the needs of poetic
                    treatment. During the Jena period the closest union obtained between Schelling
                    and those who either at Jena or at Berlin carried on warfare for the Romantic
                    idea. With August Wilhelm Schlegel and his gifted wife Caroline, herself the
                    embodiment of the Romantic spirit, Schelling’s relations were of the most
                    intimate kind. Personal acquaintance made at Dresden before Schelling began his
                    professorial career at Jena rapidly developed into a warm friendship, to which
                    circumstances soon gave a new and heightened colour. Caroline Schlegel, a woman
                    of remarkable receptive and appreciative power, emotional to excess, and full of
                    the ardent ill-balanced sympathies that constituted the Romantic tone, felt for
                    Schelling unbounded admiration. In him she found the philosophic view which gave
                    completeness and consistency to the tumultuous literary and personal feelings
                    that animated her, and she was not less attracted by the dominating force of his
                    personal character. It is probable that in the early stages of their friendship
                    a future marriage between Schelling and Caroline’s young daughter, Auguste
                    Böhmer, was, if not definitely understood, yet vaguely contemplated by both, and
                    that in consequence neither was fully aware of the nature of the feelings
                    springing up between them. The untimely death of Auguste in the summer of 1800,
                    a death in which Schelling’s rash confidence in his medical knowledge was
                        unfor-<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n412/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0412-0391"/> tunately involved, while a severe blow to
                    both, drew them much more closely together, and in the following year, A. W.
                    Schlegel having removed to Berlin, and Caroline remaining in Jena, affairs so
                    developed themselves that quietly, amicably, and in apparently the most friendly
                    manner, a divorce was arranged and carried to its completion in the early summer
                    of 1803. On the 2d June of the same year Schelling and Caroline, after a visit
                    to the former’s father, were married, and with the marriage Schelling’s life at
                    Jena came to an end. It was full time, for Schelling’s undoubtedly overweening
                    self-confidence and most arrogant mode of criticism had involved him in a series
                    of virulent disputes and quarrels at Jena, the details of which are in
                    themselves of little or no interest, but are valuable as illustrations of the
                    evil qualities in Schelling’s nature which deface much of his philosophic work.
                    The boiling fervour which the Romanticists prized is deplorably ineffective in
                    the clear cold atmosphere of speculation.</p>
                <p>A fresh field was found in the newly-constituted university of Würzburg, to which
                    he was called in September 1803 as professor of “Naturphilosophie,” and where he
                    remained till April 1806, when the Napoleonic conquests compelled a change. The
                    published writings of this period <hi rend="italic">(Philosophie und
                        Religion,</hi> 1804, and <hi rend="italic">Ueber das Verhältniss des Realen
                        und Idealen in der Natur,</hi> 1806), and still more the unpublished draft
                    of his lectures as continued in volumes v. and vi. of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sämmtliche Werke,</hi> exhibit an important internal change in his
                    philosophic views, a change which was accentuated by the open breach on the one
                    hand with Fichte and on the other hand with Hegel. Schelling’s little pamphlet
                        <hi rend="italic">Darlegung des wahren . Verhältnisses der Naturphilosophie
                        zur verbesserten Fichtischen Lehre</hi> was the natural sequel to the
                    difference which had brought the correspondence of the former friends to a close
                    in 1803, and to Fichte’s open condemnation in the <hi rend="italic">Grundzüge d.
                        gegenwärt. Zeitalters.</hi> Hegel’s preface to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phänomenologie des Geistes</hi> was in like manner the sequel to the severe
                    treatment which in his Jena lectures he had bestowed on the emptiness of the
                    Schellingian method, and with the appearance of that work correspondence and
                    friendship between the two ceased, and in Schelling’s mind there remained a
                    deeply rooted sense of injury and injustice.</p>
                <p>The Würzburg professoriate had not been without its inner trials. Schelling had
                    many enemies, and his irreconcilable and lofty tone of dealing with them only
                    increased the virulence of their attacks. He embroiled himself with his
                    colleagues and with the Government, so that it was doubtless with a sense of
                    relief that he found external events bring his tenure of the chair to a close.
                    In Munich, to which with his wife he removed in 1806, he found a long and quiet
                    residence. A position as state official, at first as associate of the academy of
                    sciences and secretary of the academy of arts, afterwards as secretary of the
                    philosophical section of the academy of sciences, gave him ease and leisure,
                    without resigning his official position he lectured for a short time at
                    Stuttgart, and during seven years at Erlangen (1820-27). In 1809 Caroline died,
                    and three years later Schelling married one of her closest, most attached
                    friends, Pauline Gotter, in whom he found a true and faithful companion.</p>
                <p>During the long stay at Munich (1806-1841) Schelling’s literary activity seemed
                    gradually to come to a standstill. The “Aphorisms on Naturphilosophie” contained
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Jahrbücher der Medicin als Wissenschaft</hi> (1806-8)
                    are for the most part extracts from the Würzburg lectures; and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Denkmal der Schrift von den göttlichen Dingen des Herrn
                        Jacobi</hi> was drawn forth by the special incident of Jacobi’s work. The
                    only writing of significance is the “Philosophische Untersuchungen über das
                    Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit,” which appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philosophische Schriften,</hi> vol. i. (1809), and which carries out, with
                    increasing tendency to mysticism, the thoughts of the previous work, <hi
                        rend="italic">Philosophie und Religion.</hi> In 1815 appeared the tract <hi
                        rend="italic">Ueber die Gottheiten zu Sarnothrake,</hi> ostensibly a portion
                    of the great work, <hi rend="italic">Die Weltalter,</hi> on which Schelling was
                    understood to be engaged, a work frequently announced as ready for publication,
                    but of which no great part was ever written. Probably it was the overpowering
                    strength and influence of the Hegelian system that constrained Schelling to so
                    long a silence, for it was only in 1834, after the death of Hegel, that, in a
                    preface to a translation by H. Beckers of a work by Cousin, he gave public
                    utterance to the antagonism in which he stood to the Hegelian and to his own
                    earlier conceptions of philosophy. The antagonism certainly was not then a new
                    fact; the Erlangen lectures on the history of philosophy <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Sämmt. Werke, x.</hi> 124-5) of 1822 express the same in a pointed
                    fashion, and Schelling had already begun the treatment of mythology and religion
                    which in his view constituted the true positive complement to the negative of
                    logical or speculative philosophy. Public attention, which had been from time to
                    time drawn to Schelling’s prolonged silence, was powerfully attracted by these
                    vague hints of a new system which promised something more positive, as regards
                    religion in particular, than the apparent results of Hegel’s teaching. For the
                    appearance of the critical writings of Strauss, Feuerbach, and Bauer, and the
                    evident disunion in the Hegelian school itself, had alienated the sympathies of
                    many from the then dominant philosophy. In Berlin particularly, the headquarters
                    of the Hegelians, the desire found expression to obtain officially from
                    Schelling a treatment of the new system which he was understood to have in
                    reserve. The realization of the desire did not come about till 1841, when the
                    appointment of Schelling as Prussian privy councillor and member of the Berlin
                    Academy, gave him the right, a right he was requested to exercise, to deliver
                    lectures in the university. The opening lecture of his course was listened to by
                    a large and most appreciative audience; and thus, in the evening of his career,
                    Schelling found himself, as often before, the centre of attraction in the world
                    of philosophy. The enmity of his old foe H. E. G. Paulus, sharpened by
                    Schelling’s apparent success, led to the surreptitious publication of a verbatim
                    report of the lectures on the philosophy of revelation, and, as Schelling did
                    not succeed in obtaining legal condemnation and suppression of this piracy, he
                    in 1845 ceased the delivery of any public courses. No authentic information as
                    to the nature of the new positive philosophy was obtained till after his death
                    in 1854, when his sons began the issue of his collected writings with the four
                    volumes of Berlin lectures :—vol. i., <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the
                        Philosophy of Mythology</hi> (1856); ii., <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of
                        Mythology</hi> (1857); iii. and iv., <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of
                        Revelation</hi> (1858).</p>
                <p>Whatever judgment one may form of the total worth of Schelling as a philosopher,
                    his place in the history of that important movement called generally German
                    philosophy is unmistakable and assured. It happened to him, as he himself
                    claimed, to turn a page in the history of thought, and one cannot ignore the
                    actual advance upon his predecessor achieved by him or the brilliant fertility
                    of the genius by which that achievement was accomplished. On the other hand it
                    is not to be denied that Schelling, to whom an unusually long period of activity
                    was accorded, nowhere succeeds in attaining the rounded completeness of
                    scientific system. His philosophical writings, extended over more than half a
                    century, lie before us, not as parts of one whole, but as the successive
                    manifestations of a restless highly endowed spirit, striving continuously but
                    unsuccessfully after a solution of its own problems. Such unity as they possess
                    is a unity of tendency and endeavour; they are not parts of a whole, and in some
                    respects the final form they assumed is the least satisfactory of all. Hence it
                    has come about<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0413-0392"/> that Schelling remains for the philosophic
                    student but a moment of historical value in the development of thought, and that
                    his works have for the most part ceased now to have more than historic interest.
                    Throughout his thinking bears the painful impress of hurry, incompleteness, and
                    spasmodic striving after an ideal which could only be attained by patient,
                    laborious, and methodic effort. Brilliant contributions there are without doubt
                    to the evolution of a philosophic idea, but no systematic fusion of all into a
                    whole. It is not unfair to connect the apparent failings of Schelling’s
                    philosophizing with the very nature of the thinker and with the historical
                    accidents of his career. In the writings of his early manhood, for example, more
                    particularly those making up <hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie,</hi> one finds
                    in painful abundance the evidences of hastily-acquired knowledge, impatience of
                    the hard labour of minute thought, over-confidence in the force of individual
                    genius, and desire instantaneously to present even in crudest fashion the newest
                    idea that has dawned upon the thinker. Schelling was prematurely thrust into the
                    position of a foremost productive thinker; and when the lengthened period of
                    quiet meditation was at last forced upon him there unfortunately lay before him
                    a system which achieved what had dimly been involved in his ardent and impetuous
                    desires. It is not possible to acquit Schelling of a certain disingenuousness in
                    regard to the Hegelian philosophy; and if we claim for him perfect
                    disinterestedness of view we can do so only by imposing on him the severer
                    condemnation of deficient insight.</p>
                <p>It was a natural concomitant of this continuous hurry under which Schelling’s
                    successive efforts at constructive work were carried out that he should have
                    been found at all stages supporting himself by calling to his aid the forms of
                    some other system. The successive phases of his development might without
                    injustice be characterized by reference to these external supports. Thus Fichte,
                    Spinoza, Jakob Boehme and the Mystics, and finally, the great Greek thinkers
                    with their Neoplatonic, Gnostic, and Scholastic commentators, give respectively
                    colouring to particular works in which Schelling unfolds himself. At the same
                    time it would be unjust to represent Schelling as merely borrowing from these
                    external sources. There must be allowed to him genuine philosophic spirit and no
                    small measure of philosophic insight. Of the philosophic <hi rend="italic"
                        >afflatus</hi> he was in no want; and it might be fairly added that, under
                    all the differences of exposition which seem to constitute so many differing
                    Schellingian systems, there is one and the same philosophic effort and spirit.
                    But what Schelling did want was power to work out scientifically, methodically,
                    the ideas with which his spirit was filled and mastered. Hence he could only
                    find expression for himself in forms of this or that earlier philosophy, and
                    hence too the frequent formlessness of his own thought, the tendency to relapse
                    into mere impatient despair of ever finding an adequate vehicle for transmitting
                    thought.</p>
                <p>It is thus, moreover, a matter of indifference how one distributes or classifies
                    the several forms and periods of Schelling’s philosophic activity. Whether one
                    adopts as basis the external form, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the foreign mode
                    of speculation laid under contribution, or endeavours to adhere closely to inner
                    differences of view, the result is very much the same. There is one line of
                    speculative thought, in the development of which inevitable problems call for
                    new methods of handling, while the results only in part can claim to have a
                    place accorded to them in the history of philosophy. It is fair in dealing with
                    Schelling’s development to take into account the indications of his own opinion
                    regarding its more significant momenta. In his own view the turning points seem
                    to have been —(1) the transition from Fichte's method to the more objective
                    conception of nature,—the advance, in other words, to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Naturphilosophie</hi>; (2) the definite formulation of that which
                    implicitly, as Schelling claims, was involved in the idea of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Naturphilosophie,</hi> viz., the thought of the identical, indifferent,
                    absolute substratum of both nature and spirit, the advance to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Identitätsvhilosophie;</hi> (3) the opposition of negative and positive
                    philosophy, an opposition which is the theme of the Berlin lectures, but the
                    germs of which may be traced back to 1804, and of which more than the germs are
                    found in the work on freedom of 1809. Only what falls under the first and second
                    of the divisions so indicated can be said to have discharged a function in
                    developing philosophy; only so much constitutes Schelling’s philosophy proper. A
                    very brief notice of the characteristic features of the three studia must here
                    suffice.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie.—</hi> The Fichtean method had striven to
                    exhibit the whole structure of reality as the necessary implication of
                    self-consciousness. The fundamental features of knowledge, whether as activity
                    or as sum of apprehended fact, and of conduct had been deduced as elements
                    necessary in the attainment of selfconsciousness. Fichtean idealism therefore at
                    once stood out negatively, as abolishing the dogmatic conception of the two real
                    worlds, subject and object, by whose interaction cognition and practice arise,
                    and as amending the critical idea which retained with dangerous caution too many
                    fragments of dogmatism; positively, as insisting on the unity of philosophical
                    interpretation and as supplying a key to the form or method by which a completed
                    philosophic system might be constructed. But the Fichtean teaching appeared on
                    the one hand to identify too closely the ultimate ground of the universe of
                    rational conception with the finite, individual spirit, and on the other hand to
                    endanger the <hi rend="italic">reality</hi> of the world of nature by regarding
                    it too much after the fashion of subjective idealism, as mere moment, though
                    necessitated, in the existence of the finite thinking mind. It was almost a
                    natural consequence that Fichte never succeeded in amalgamating with his own
                    system the aesthetic view of nature to which the <hi rend="italic">Kritik of
                        Judgment</hi> had pointed as an essential component in any complete
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>From Fichte’s position Schelling started. From Fichte he derived the ideal of a
                    completed whole of philosophic conception; from Fichte he derived the formal
                    method to which for the most part ho continued true. The earliest writings
                    tended gradually towards the first important advance. Nature must not be
                    conceived as merely abstract limit to the infinite striving of spirit, as a mere
                    series of necessary thoughts for mind. It must be that and more than that. It
                    must have reality for itself, a reality which stands in no conflict with its
                    ideal character, a reality the inner structure of which is ideal, a reality the
                    root and spring of which is spirit. Nature as the sum of that which is
                    objective, intelligence as the complex of all the activities making up
                    selfconsciousness, appear thus as equally real, as alike exhibiting ideal
                    structure, as parallel with one another. The philosophy of nature and
                    transcendental philosophy are the two complementary portions of philosophy as a
                    whole.</p>
                <p>Animated with this new conception Schelling made his hurried rush to <hi
                        rend="italic">Naturphilosophie,</hi> and with the aid of Kant and of
                    fragmentary knowledge of contemporary scientific movements, threw off in quick
                    succession the <hi rend="italic">Ideen,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Weltseele,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Erster Entwurf.
                        Naturphilosophie,</hi> which thus became an historical fact, has had scant
                    mercy at the hands of modern science; and undoubtedly there is much in it, even
                    in that for which Schelling alone is responsible, for which only contempt can be
                    our feeling. Schelling, one must say, had neither the strength of thinking nor
                    the acquired knowledge necessary to hold the balance between the abstract
                    treatment of cosmological notions and the concrete researches of special
                    science. His efforts after a construction of natural reality are bad in
                    themselves and gave rise to a wearisome flood of perfectly useless physical
                    speculation. Yet it would be unjust to ignore the many brilliant and sometimes
                    valuable thoughts that are scattered throughout the writings on <hi
                        rend="italic">Naturphilosophie,—</hi> thoughts to which Schelling himself is
                    but too frequently untrue. Regarded merely as a criticism of the notions with
                    which scientific interpretation proceeds, these writings have still importance
                    and might have achieved more had they been untainted by the tendency to hasty,
                    ill-considered, <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> anticipations of nature.</p>
                <p>Nature, as having reality for itself, forms one completed whole. Its manifoldness
                    is not then to be taken as excluding its fundamental unity; the divisions which
                    our ordinary perception and thought introduce into it have not absolute
                    validity, but are to be interpreted as the outcome of the single formative
                    energy or complex of forces which is the inner aspect, the soul of nature. Such
                    inner of nature we are in a position to apprehend and constructively to exhibit
                    to ourselves in the successive forms which its development assumes, for it is
                    the same spirit, though unconscious, of which we become aware in
                    self-consciousness. It is the realization of spirit. Nor is the variety of its
                    forms imposed upon it from without; there is neither external teleology in
                    nature, nor mechanism in the narrower sense. Nature is a whole and forms itself;
                    within its range we are to look for no other than natural explanations. The
                    function of <hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie</hi> is to exhibit the ideal as
                    springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal. The incessant
                    change which experience brings before us, taken in conjunction with the thought
                    of unity in productive force of nature, leads to the all-important conception of
                    the duality, the polar opposition through which nature expresses itself in its
                    varied products. The dynamical series of stages in nature, the forms in which
                    the ideal structure of nature is realized, are matter, as the equilibrium of the
                    fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate
                    processes, —magnetism, electricity, and chemical action; organism, with its
                    component phases of reproduction, irritability, and sensibility.<note

                    their point of union.</p>
                <p>(2) Nature and spirit, <hi rend="italic">Naturphilosophie</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Transcendentalρhilo-sοphie,</hi> thus stand as two relatively
                    complete, but complementary parts of the whole. It was impossible for Schelling,
                    the animating principle of whose thought was ever the reconciliation of
                    differences, not to take and to take speedily the step towards the conception of
                    the uniting basis of which nature and spirit are manifestations, forms, or
                    consequences. For this common basis, however, he did not succeed at first in
                    finding any other than the merely negative expression of indifference. The
                    identity, the absolute, which underlay all difference, all the relative, is to
                    be characterized simply as <hi rend="italic">neutrum</hi>, as absolute
                    undifferentiated self-equivalence. It lay in the very nature of this thought
                    that Spinoza should now offer himself to Schelling as the thinker whose form of
                    presentation came nearest to his new problem. The <hi rend="italic">Darstellung
                        meines Systems,</hi> and the more expanded and more careful treatment

                        und der Naturphilosophie insbesondere</hi> given in Würzburg, 1804
                    (published only in the <hi rend="italic">Sämmtliche Werke,</hi> vol. vi. p.
                    131-576), are thoroughly Spinozistic in form, and to a large extent in
                    substance. They are not without value, indeed, as extended commentary on
                    Spinoza. With all his efforts, Schelling does not succeed in bringing his
                    conceptions of nature and spirit into any vital connexion with the primal
                    identity, the absolute indifference of reason. No true solution •could be
                    achieved by resort to the mere absence of distinguishing, differencing feature.
                    The absolute was left with no other function than that of removing all the
                    differences on which thought turns. The criticisms of Fichte, and more
                    particularly of Hegel (in the “Vorrede” to the <hi rend="italic">Phänomenologie
                        des Geistes),</hi> point to the fatal defect in the conception of the
                    absolute as mere featureless identity.</p>
                <p>(3) Along two distinct lines Schelling is to be found in all his later writings
                    striving to amend the conception, to which he remained true, of absolute reason
                    as the ultimate ground of reality. It was necessary, in the first place, to give
                    to this absolute a <hi rend="italic">character,</hi> to make of it something
                    more than empty sameness; it was necessary, in the second place, to clear up in
                    some way the relation in which the actuality or apparent actuality of nature and
                    spirit stood to the ultimate real. Schelling had already (in the <hi
                        rend="italic">System der ges. Phil.</hi>) begun to endeavour after an
                    amalgamation of the Spinozistic conception of substance with the Platonic view
                    of an ideal realm, and to find therein the means of enriching the bareness of
                    absolute reason. In <hi rend="italic">Bruno,</hi> and in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philos. u. Religion,</hi> the same thought finds expression. In the realm
                    of ideas the absolute finds itself, has its own nature over against itself as
                    objective over against subjective, and thus is in the way of overcoming its
                    abstractness, of becoming concrete. This conception of a difference, of an
                    internal structure in the absolute, finds other and not less obscure expressions
                    in the mystical contributions of the <hi rend="italic">Menschliche Freiheit</hi>
                    and in the scholastic speculations of the Berlin lectures on mythology. At the
                    same time it connects itself with the second problem, how to attain in
                    conjunction with the abstractly rational character of the absolute an
                    explanation of actuality. Things,—nature and spirit,—have an actual being. They
                    exist not merely as logical consequence or development of the absolute, but have
                    a stubbornness of being in them, an antagonistic feature which in all times
                    philosophers have been driven to recognize, and which they have described in
                    varied fashion. The actuality of things is a defection from the absolute, and
                    their existence compels a reconsideration of our conception of God. There must
                    be recognized in God as a completed actuality, a dim, obscure ground or basis,
                    which can only be described as not yet being, but as containing in itself the
                    impulse to externalization, to existence. It is through this ground of Being in
                    God Himself that we must find explanation of that independence which things
                    assert over against God. And it is easy to see how from this position Schelling
                    was led on to the further statements that not in the rational conception of God
                    is an explanation of existence to be found, nay, that all rational conception
                    extends but to the form, and touches not the real,—that God is to be conceived
                    as act, as will, as something over and above the rational conception of the
                    divine. Hence the stress laid on will as the realizing factor, in opposition to
                    thought, a view through which Schelling connects himself with Schopenhauer and
                    Von Hartmann, and on the ground of which he has been recognized by the latter as
                    the reconciler of idealism and realism. Finally, then, there emerges the
                    opposition of negative, i.e., merely rational philosophy, and positive, of which
                    the content is the real evolution of the divine as it has taken place in fact
                    and in history and as it is recorded in the varied mythologies and religions of
                    mankind. Not much satisfaction can be felt with the exposition of either as it
                    appears in the volumes of Berlin lectures.</p>
                <p>Schelling’s works were collected and published by his sons, in 14 vols., 1856-61.
                    For the life good materials are to be found in the three vols., <hi
                        rend="italic">Aus Schelliηg's Leben in Briefen,</hi> 1869-70, in which a
                    biographic sketch of the philosopher's early life is given by his son, and in
                    Waitz, <hi rend="italic">Karοline,</hi> 2 vols., 1871 An interesting little work
                    is Klaiber, <hi rend="italic">Hölderlin, Hegel, u. Schelling in ihren

                    is complete and admirable. Apart from the expositions in the larger histories of
                    modern philosophy, in Michelet, Erdmann, Willm, and Kuno Fischer, and in Haym’s
