                    a long staff used by aged men (<hi rend="italic">Il</hi>. xviii. 410; Herod., i.
                    190), and thus came to be used as a sign of authority by officials of many kinds
                    —judges, military leaders, priests, heralds, and others. It is frequently
                    represented on Greek painted vases as a long staff, tipped with metal in some
                    ornamental fashion, and is borne by some of the gods. Among the Etruscans
                    sceptres of great magnificence were used by the kings and also by the upper
                    orders in the priesthood. Many representations occur on the walls of the painted
                    tombs of Etruria. Some specimens which still exist are among the finest examples
                    known of ancient jewellery. The British Museum, the Vatican, and the Louvre
                    possess Etruscan gold sceptres of the most minute and elaborate workmanship.
                    Some of these are hollow gold batons, about nine to twelve inches long and half
                    an inch in diameter, completely covered with that very delicate ornament for
                    which the Etruscan goldsmiths were so famed, produced by soldering thousands of
                    microscopically minute globules of gold arranged in rich patterns on to the
                    plain gold cylinder which forms the ground. One magnificent specimen in the
                    gold-ornament room of the British Museum has its top formed like a fiower, with
                    outer petals of beaten gold and an inner core made by a large emerald; it is of
                    the greatest beauty both in workmanship and design.</p>
                <p>The sceptre of the Romans, like most of their insignia of rank, is said to have
                    been derived from the Etruscans. An old and more Latinized form of the word is
                    <hi rend="italic">scipiο</hi> (see Liv., v. 41). Under the republic an ivory
                    sceptre <hi rend="italic">(sceptrum eburneum)</hi> was one of the marks of
                    consular rank. It was also used by victorious generals who received the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">imperator,</hi> and this use still survives in the modern
                    marshal’s baton. In Roman paintings the long staff-like sceptre is frequently
                    represented in the hands of Jupiter and Juno, as chief of the gods.</p>
                <p>Under the empire the <hi rend="italic">sceptrum Augusti</hi> (Suet., <hi
                    rend="italic">Galba,</hi> i.) was specially used by the emperors. It was often
                    of ivory, tipped with a gold eagle (Juv., <hi rend="italic">Sat,</hi> x. 43),
                    and is frequently shown on medallions of the later empire, which have on the
                    obverse a half-length figure of the emperor, holding in one hand the short
                    eagle-tipped sceptre and in the other the orb surmounted by a small figure of
                    Victory. The older staff-like form of sceptre still survived under<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n406/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0406-0385"/> the name <hi rend="italic">hasta pura</hi>; it is
                    shown on the reverses of many Roman coins in the hand of deities and of the
                    emperor or empress, though originally the <hi rend="italic">hasta pura</hi> had
                    a very different use, being simply a mark of distinction given by Roman generals
                    to soldiers who had shown unusual bravery (Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi>
                    iii. 21). After the introduction of Christianity as the state religion, the
                    imperial sceptre was frequently tipped with a cross instead of the eagle, though
                    both were used. All through the Middle Ages both these forms survived, and
                    sceptres of gold studded with jewels were used by most sovereigns of Europe. The
                    gold sceptre of Charlemagne, a magnificent specimen of early jeweller’s work,
                    still exists among the regalia at Vienna. Some mediaeval sceptres were of
                    crystal or ivory mounted in gold. Several fine ancient examples existed among
                    the regalia of England till after the death of Charles I., when the whole set
                    were broken up and melted by order of the Parliament.</p>
                <p>At the Restoration, four new sceptres were made for the coronation of Charles II.
                    (see <hi rend="italic">Archaeologia,</hi> xxix. p. 262); and these still exist
                    among the regalia in the Tower. They are—(1) the so-called St Edward’s staff of
                    gold, 4 feet 7 inches long, set with jewels, and surmounted with a cross and
                    orb—a copy of the older one which contained in the orb a fragment of the true
                    cross (this sceptre is borne in front of the sovereign during the processional
                    part of the ceremony of coronation); (2) a gold sceptre tipped with a cross,
                    which at the coronation is placed in the sovereign’s right hand by the
                    archbishop of Canterbury; (3) a similar sceptre tipped with a gold dove, which
                    is placed in the sovereign’s left hand;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Both these sceptres (or rather the older ones) were shown,
                    one in each hand of the fine bronze effigy of Edward III. in Westminster Abbey,
                    but as a rule royal effigies were represented with only one
                    sceptre.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> (4) a small gold jewelled
                    sceptre for the queen consort. Nos. (1) and (2) are both studded with diamonds.
                    In addition to these four, there is a gold-mounted ivory sceptre, which was made
                    for the queen of James II.; it is tipped with a gold dove and is studded with
                    jewels. A sixth gold sceptre is that which was made for the queen at the
                    coronation of William and Mary.</p>
                <p>Among the Scottish regalia at Edinburgh a fine 15th-century gold sceptre still
                    exists; and others of the same or earlier date are preserved among the royal
                    insignia of several European countries.</p>
