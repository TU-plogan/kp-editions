                    c. 1420; he was really born about thirty years later, and is mentioned by A.
                    Durer as being a young apprentice in 1470. His portrait in the Munich Pinakothek
                    is now known to be a copy by Burgkmair, painted after 1510, from an original of
                    1483,—not 1453 as has been supposed. The date of Schongauer’s death, 1499,
                    written on the back of the panel by Burgkmair is obviously a blunder; see
                    Hensler in <hi rend="italic">Naurnann's Archiv,</hi> 1867, p. 129, and Wurzbach,
                    <hi rend="italic">M. Schongauer,</hi> Vienna, 1880. These contradict the view of

                    engraving, out of which grew the “little masters” of the succeeding generation,
                    and a large group of Nuremberg artists. As a painter, Schongauer was a pupil of
                    the Flemish Roger Van der Weyden the Elder, and his rare existing pictures
                    closely resemble, both in splendour of colour and exquisite minuteness of
                    execution, the best works of contemporary art in Flanders. Among the very few
                    paintings which can with certainty be attributed to him, the chief is a
                    magnificent altarpiece in the church of St Martin, at Colmar, representing the
                    Virgin and Child, crowned by Angels, with a background of roses—a work of the
                    highest beauty, and large in scale, the figures being nearly life size. The
                    Colmar Museum possesses eleven panels by his hand, and a small panel of David
                    with Goliath’s Head in the Munich Gallery is attributed to him. The miniature
                    painting of the Death of the Virgin in the English National Gallery is probably
                    the work of some pupil.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Another painting of the same subject in the Doria Palace in Rome (usually
                    attributed to Dürer) is given to Schongauer by Crowe and Cavalcaselle, <hi

                    not equal to Schongauer’s wonderful touch.</p></note> In 1488 Schongauer died at
                    Colmar, according to the register of St Martin’s church.</p>
                <p>The main work of Schongauer’s life was the production of a large number of most
                    highly finished and beautiful engravings, which were largely sold, not only in
                    Germany, but also in Italy and even in England. In this way his influence was
                    very widely extended. Vasari speaks of him with much enthusiasm, and says that
                    Michelangelo copied one of his engravings—the Trial of St Anthony.<note

                    Schongauer’s popularity in Italy is given by the lovely Faenza plate in the
                    British Museum, on which is painted a copy of Martin’s beautiful engraving of
                    the Death of the Virgin; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pottery,</hi> vol. xix. p.

                <p>Martino” and “Martino d’Anversa.” His subjects are always religious; more than
                    130 prints from copper by his hand are still known, and about 100 more are the
                    production of his <hi rend="italic">bottega.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    of 1877. According to a German tradition Schongauer was the inventor of printing
                    from metal plates; he certainly was one of the first who brought the art to
                    perfection. See an interesting article by Sidney Colvin in the <hi rend="italic"

                    Among the most beautiful of Schongauer’s engravings are the series of the
                    Passion and the Death and Coronation of the Virgin, and the series of the Wise
                    and Foolish Virgins; as much as £420 has been given for a fine state of the
                    Coronation plate. All are remarkable for their miniature-like treatment, their
                    brilliant touch, and their chromatic force. Some, such as the Death of the
                    Virgin and the Adoration of the Magi, are richly-filled compositions of many
                    figures, treated with much largeness of style in spite of their minute scale.
                    Though not free from the mannerism of his age and country, Schongauer possessed
                    a rare feeling for beauty and for dignity of pose; and in technical power over
                    his graver and copper plate he has never been surpassed.</p>
                <p>The British Museum possesses a fine collection of Schongauer’s prints. Fine
                    facsimiles of his engravings have been produced by Amand-Durand with text by
                    Duplessis, Paris, 1881.</p>
