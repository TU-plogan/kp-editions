                    direct distance from its source to its mouth in the Bristol Channel is about 80

                    precipitous bed. At Llanidloes, where the valley widens to a breadth of one or
                    two miles and assumes a more fertile appearance, it bends towards the
                    north-east, passing Newtown and Welshpool. On the borders of Shropshire it
                    receives the Vyrnwy, and then turning in a south-easterly direction enters the
                    broad rich plain of Shrewsbury, after which it bends southward past Ironbridge
                    and Bridgnorth to Bewdley in Worcestershire. In Shropshire it receives a number
                    of tributaries (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Shropshire).</hi> Still continuing its
                    southerly course through Worcestershire it passes Stourport, where it receives
                    the Stour (left), and Worcester, shortly after which it receives the Teme
                    (right). It enters Gloucestershire at Tewkesbury, where it receives the Avon
                    (left), after which, bending in a south-westerly direction, it passes the town
                    of Gloucester, 18 miles below which the estuary widens out into the Bristol
                    Channel, at the point where it receives from the left the Lower Avon or Bristol
                    river, and from the right the Wye.</p>
                <p>From Newtown its fall is 465 feet, the average fall per mile being about 2 feet 3
                    inches, but from Ironbridge to Gloucester, a distance of about 70 miles, the
                    fall is only about 103 feet. Between Stourport and Gloucester the breadth is 150
                    feet, but below that town the breadth rapidly increases and the banks become
                    bolder and more picturesque. Owing to the gradual decrease in the width and
                    depth of the Bristol Channel the tide enters with great force, forming a tidal
                    wave or bore about 9 feet in height, which at certain times causes great
                    destruction, among the more serious inundations being those of 1606, 1687, 1703,
                    and 1883. The total area drained by the Severn is about 4500 square miles. Its
                    navigation extends to about 150 miles above its mouth; barges can ascend as far
                    as Stourport, and large vessels to Gloucester. Owing to the difficulties of the
                    navigation the Gloucester and Berkeley Ship Canal, 18 miles in length, was
                    constructed, admitting vessels of 350 tons to Gloucester, the river only
                    admitting vessels of 150 tons. The only other important port is Bristol, but
                    there are a few smaller ports and fishing towns, while by means of canals the
                    Severn has connexion with some of the principal towns of England. With the
                    Thames it is connected by the Stroudwater and Thames and Severn Canals; by
                    various canals it has communication with the Trent and the rivers of the north;
                    and the Hereford and Gloucester Canal connects those two cities. The Severn is a
                    good salmon river, and is specially famous for its lampreys.</p>
