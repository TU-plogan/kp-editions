                <p><label type="entry">SACRIFICE</label>. The Latin word <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacrificium,</hi> from which we have the English “sacrifice,” properly means an
                    action within the sphere of things sacred to the gods, so that “sacrificial” and
                    “hierurgic” are synonymous, and, strictly speaking, cover the whole field of
                    sacred ritual. By the Romans, as by all ancient or primitive nations, the gods
                    were habitually approached with gifts, and the presentation of the gift, being
                    the central feature in every ordinary act of worship, is regarded as the
                    sacrifice proper. In all parts of the world, moreover, for reasons which will
                    appear by and by, the stated gifts by which the gods are honoured in private
                    worship or public feasts are drawn from the stores on which human life is
                    supported,—fruits, grain, wine, oil, the flesh of animals, and the like. All
                    gifts of this kind, which are not merely presented to the god but consumed in
                    his service, fall under the notion of sacrifice, while permanent votive
                    offerings of treasure, lands, temples, images, or the like, not forming part of
                    any stated ritual, are excluded. But again, where we find a practice of
                    sacrificing honorific gifts to the gods, we usually find also certain other
                    sacrifices which resemble those already characterized inasmuch as something ie
                    given up by the worshippers to be consumed in sacred ceremony, but differ from
                    them inasmuch as the sacrifice—usually a living victim— is not regarded as a
                    tribute of honour to the god, but has a special atoning or mystic significance.
                    The most familiar case of this second species of sacrifice is that which the
                    Romans distinguished from the <hi rend="italic">hostia honoraria</hi> by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">hostia piacularis.</hi> In the former case the deity
                    accepts a gift; in the latter he demands a life. The former kind of sacrifice is
                    offered by the worshipper on the basis of an established relation of friendly
                    dependence on his divine lord; the latter is directed to appease the divine
                    anger, or to conciliate the favour of a deity on whom the worshipper has no
                    right to count. The precise scope of sacrifices not merely honorific will appear
                    more clearly in the sequel; for the history of religion this second kind of
                    sacrifice has a very peculiar importance, as may be judged from the fact that
                    the ordinary metaphorical use of “sacrifice” in English answers not to the
                    notion of a “gift” but to that of “reluctant surrender.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Apart from this metaphorical use the word
                    “sacrifice” in English is often taken as synonymous with “victim,” bloodless
                    oblations being called rather by the vague word “offering.” This usage
                    corresponds to the practice of the Authorised Version which commonly renders
                    וםכחח זכת, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> “victim and cereal oblation,” by the
                    words “sacrifice and offering,” and uses the verb “to sacrifice” for the Hebrew
                    זבח, “to slaughter a victim.”</p></note><hi rend="italic">Honorific
                    Sacrifices</hi> naturally hold the chief place in all natural (as opposed to
                    positive) religions that have reached the stage in which orthodox ritual is
                    differentiated from sorcery (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Priest,</hi> vol. xix.
                    p. 724), and in which the relations between the gods and their worshippers are
                    conceived as being of a fixed and habitually friendly character, so that the
                    acts by which a continuance of divine favour can be secured are known by
                    well-established tradition and regularly practised with full confidence in their
                    efficacy. Religions of this type unite the god to a definite circle of<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n150/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0150-0133"/> worshippers forming a natural unity, so that
                    every man’s birth or political and social status determines at once what god he
                    is called upon to worship and may confidently look to for help. Religions of
                    this sort, therefore, are mainly tribal or national, and the deity is regarded
                    as a king, or, if there are several gods worshipped by the same circle, they are
                    lords and ladies and are naturally to be honoured in the same way as earthly
                    grandees. Thus among the Hebrews, whose early institutions afford a typical
                    example of a national religion, the fundamental rule is that no one is to appear
                    before Jehovah empty-handed (Exod. xxiii. 15), just as it would be indecent (and
                    in the East is still indecent) to approach a king or great man without some
                    present, however trifling. In like manner Homer teaches that gods and kings
                    alike are persuaded by gifts. A special request will naturally be accompanied by
                    a special gift proportioned to the occasion or by a vow to be fulfilled when the
                    prayer is heard; but apart from this the general goodwill whether of god or king
                    falls to be acknowledged and secured by offerings renewed from time to time by
                    way of tribute or homage. Thus in Hebrew the word <hi rend="italic">minha
                    </hi>means alike “gift,” “tribute,” and “sacrificial oblation,” especially an
                    oblation of agricultural produce. For in a simple agricultural society payments
                    in kind, whether to a divine or to a human lord, would naturally consist for the
                    most part of the fruits of the soil; and with this it agrees that not only in
                    Canaan but among the Greeks there is evidence that cereal oblations had a great
                    place in early ritual, though they afterwards became second in importance to
                    animal sacrifices, which yielded a more luxurious sacrificial banquet, and also,
                    as we shall see, derived a peculiar significance from the shedding of the
                    victim’s blood. In almost all nations we find that the chief sacrificial feasts
                    are associated with the harvest and the vintage, or, where pastoral life
                    predominates, are regulated by the time at which the flocks bear their young
                    (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Passover);</hi> at these seasons tribute of
                    firstfruits and firstlings is paid to the gods of the good things which they
                    themselves have given to the inhabitants of their land. This conception of
                    sacrifice may go with very various views of the nature of the gods and of
                    religion. It may go with the idea that the god has need of the worshipper and
                    his gifts just as the worshipper has need of the god and his help, and thus with
                    a matter-of-fact business-like people like the Romans religion may become very
                    much a sort of bargain struck with the gods. But, on the other hand, it is quite
                    possible that sacrifices may continue to be offered by men who have ceased to
                    believe that the deity has any need of what man can give, simply because such
                    gifts are in ordinary life the natural expression of respect and homage and no
                    fitter and more expressive way of giving utterance to the same feelings towards
                    the gods has been devised. Thus the Hebrews continued to offer sacrifices to
                    Jehovah long after they knew that “if He were hungry He would not tell man, for
                    the world was His and the fulness thereof.” But when this standpoint is reached
                    sacrifice becomes a merely conventional way of expressing religious feeling; the
                    ritual becomes a simple affair of tradition, which may, as in the Levitical
                    legislation, be based on an express divine command; and those who are not
                    content with the authority of tradition as a sufficient proof that the gods love
                    to be honoured in this way take refuge in some allegorical explanation of the
                    ceremonial. In general, however, we find an extraordinary persistence of the
                    notion that sacrifices do in some way afford a physical satisfaction to the
                    deity. If they do not feed him, he is at least gratified by their odour. Neither
                    the Greek philosophers nor the Jewish rabbins ever quite got rid of this
                    idea.</p>
                <p>But in fact the notion that the more ethereal elements of the sacrifice rise to
                    heaven, the seat of the gods, in the savoury smoke that ascends from the
                    sacrificial flame can in certain instances be shown to be connected with a later
                    development of sacrifice. Among the Semites, for example, sacrifices were not
                    originally burned. The god was not seated aloft, but was present at the place of
                    sacrifice, inhabiting a sacred stone (a baetylium, beth-el, or “house of god”),
                    which answered at once to the later idol and the later altar. That the god was
                    thought by the heathen Semites to inhabit the sacred stone, or in other cases a
                    sacred tree, is expressly recorded of several Arabian sanctuaries, and it cannot
                    be doubted that this was the general view wherever there was a maṣṣēba (sacred
                    cippus) or an ashera (sacred pole or tree). And in these cases the gift of the
                    worshipper was not, in the more primitive cults, consumed by fire, but the
                    sacred stone was daubed with oil or blood, libations of milk, of blood, or of
                    wine were poured forth beside it, cereal gifts were presented by being simply
                    laid on the sacred ground, and slaughtered victims were left there to be
                    devoured by wild beasts (Sprenger, <hi rend="italic">Leb. Moh.,</hi> iii. 457),
                    or even a human sacrifice was offered by burying the victim under the cippus.
                    Sacrifices of this type are found not only throughout the Semitic field but in
                    all parts of the world; they belong to the same category with the Hebrew
                    showbread and the Roman <hi rend="italic">lectisternia.</hi> In later times the
                    food spread on the tables of the god is eaten by his ministers, the priests, to
                    whom he is supposed to make over the enjoyment of the banquet; but this is a
                    refinement on the original usage. In older times the gods themselves were held
                    to partake of these gifts of food, just as the venerable dead were fed by the
                    meat and drink placed or poured out upon their tombs. In the religions of
                    savages both gods and the dead have very material needs, among which the need of
                    nourishment has the first place; and just as we learn from the story of
                    Periander and Melissa (Herod., v. 92) that among the Greeks of the 7th century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it was a new idea that the dead could make no use
                    of the gifts buried with them unless they were etherealized by fire, so also the
                    fact that among the Greeks, especially in old times, sacrifices to water-gods
                    were simply flung into the river or the sea, and sacrifices to underground gods
                    were buried, indicates that it is a secondary idea that the gods were too
                    ethereal to enjoy a sacrifice through any other sense than that of smell. Even
                    the highest antique religions show by unmistakable signs that in their origin
                    sacrifices were literally “the food of the gods.” In Israel the conception
                    against which the author of Psalm 1. protests so strongly was never eliminated
                    from the ancient technical language of the priestly ritual, in which the
                    sacrifices are called לחם אלחים , “food of the deity” (Lev. xxi. 8, 17, 21); and
                    among the Greeks we find not only such general expressions as that the gods
                    “feast on hecatombs” <hi rend="italic">(Il.,</hi> ix. 531) but even that
                    particular gods bear special surnames, such as “the goat-eater,” the
                    “ram-eater,” “Dionysus the eater of raw (human) flesh” (<hi rend="italic"
                    >αίγοϕάγος, κpιoφάyos, ώμηστης</hi>).</p>
                <p>A sacrifice, therefore, is primarily a meal offered to the deity. In some of the
                    cases already noticed, and in the case of holocausts or whole burnt-offerings,
                    the sacrificial gift is entirely made over to the god; but ordinarily the
                    sacrifice is a feast of which gods and worshippers partake together. If all
                    sacrifices are not convivial entertainments, at least the tendency is to give to
                    all feasts, nay to all meals, a sacrificial character by inviting the gods to
                    partake of them (Athenseus, v. 19). Thus the Roman family never rose from supper
                    till a portion of the food had been laid on the burning hearth as an offering to
                    the Lares (Serv., <hi rend="italic">Ad</hi> Ae <hi rend="italic">u</hi>., i.
                    730; Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Fast.,</hi> ii. 633); and a similar practice was
                    probably followed in early Greece.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See the discussion in Buchholz, <hi rend="italic">Homer.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0151-0134"/> the slaughter of an animal (which gave the meal a
                    more luxurious and festal character, animal food being not in daily use with the
                    mass of the agricultural populations of the Mediterranean lauds) seems to have
                    been always sacrificial in early Greece, and even in later times St Paul assumes
                    that the flesh sold in the shambles would often consist of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ϵίδωλόθυτα</hi>. Among the Semites sacrifice and slaughter for food are still
                    more clearly identified; the Hebrews use the same word for both, and the Arabian
                    invocation of the name of Allah over every beast killed for food is but the
                    relic of a sacrificial formula. The part of the gods in such sacrificial meals
                    was often very small, the blood alone (Arabia), or the fat and the thighs (<hi
                    rend="italic">Il</hi>., i. 460), or small parts of each joint (Od., xiv. 427),
                    or the blood, the fat, and the kidneys (Lev. iii.). When the sacrifice was
                    offered by a priest, he also naturally received a portion, which, properly
                    speaking, belonged to the deity and was surrendered by him to his minister, as
                    is brought out in the Hebrew ritual by the ceremonial act of waving it towards
                    the altar (Lev. vii. 29 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> The thigh, which in Homeric
                    sacrifice is burned on the altar, belongs in the Levitical ritual to the priest,
                    who was naturally the first to profit by the growth of a conviction that the
                    deity himself did not require to be fed by man’s food.</p>
                <p>The conception of the sacrifice as a banquet in which gods and men share together
                    may be traced also in the accessories of sacred ritual. Music, song, garlands,
                    the sweet odour of incense, accompany sacrifice because they are suitable to an
                    occasion of mirth and luxurious enjoyment. Wine, too, “which cheereth gods and
                    men” (Judges ix. 13), was seldom lacking in the vine-growing countries; but the
                    most notable case where the sacrificial feast has the use of an intoxicant (or
                    narcotic) as its chief feature is the ancient <hi rend="italic">soma</hi>
                    sacrifice of the old Aryans, where the gods are honoured by bowls of the
                    precious draught which heals the sick, inspires the poet, and makes the poor
                    believe that he is rich.</p>
                <p>The sacrificial meal, with the general features that have been described, may be
                    regarded as common to all the so-called nature-religions of the civilized races
                    of antiquity, —religions which had a predominantly joyous character, and in
                    which the relations of man to the gods were not troubled by any habitual and
                    oppressive sense of human guilt, because the divine standard of man’s duty
                    corresponded broadly with the accepted standard of civil conduct, and therefore,
                    though the god might be angry with his people for a time, or even irreconcilably
                    wroth with individuals, the idea was hardly conceivable that he could be
                    permanently alienated from the whole circle of his worshippers,—that is, from
                    all who participated in a certain local (tribal or national) cult. But when this
                    type of religion began to break down the sacrificial ritual underwent
                    corresponding modifications. Thus we find a decline of faith in the old gods
                    accompanied, not only by a growing neglect of the temples and their service, but
                    also by a disposition to attenuate the gifts that were still offered, or to take
                    every opportunity to cheat the gods out of part of their due,—a disposition of
                    which Arabia before Mohammed affords a classical example. But, again, the
                    decline of faith itself was not a mere product of indifference, but was partly
                    due to a feeling that the traditional ritual involved too material a conception
                    of the gods, and this cause, too, tended to produce modifications in sacrificial
                    service. The Persians, for example (Herod., i. 132; Strabo, xv. p. 732),
                    consecrated their sacrifices with liturgical prayers, but gave no part of the
                    victim to the deity, who “desired nothing but the life (or soul) of the victim.”
                    This, indeed, is the Roman formula of piacular as distinct from honorific
                    offerings (Macrob., iii. 5, 1), and might be taken as implying that the Persians
                    had ceased to look on sacrifices as gifts of homage; but such an explanation can
                    hardly be extended to the parallel case of the Arab sacrifices, in which the
                    share of the deity was the blood of the victim, which according to antique
                    belief contained the life. For among the Arabs blood was a recognized article of
                    food, and the polemic of Ps. 1. 13 is expressly directed against the idea that
                    the deity “drinks the blood of goats.” And the details given in Strabo make it
                    tolerably clear that Persian sacrifice is simply an example of the way in which
                    the material gift offered to the deity is first attenuated and then allegorized
                    away as the conception of the godhead becomes less crassly material. But on the
                    other hand it is undoubtedly true that under certain conditions the notion of
                    piacular sacrifice shows much greater vitality than that of sacrificial gifts of
                    homage. When a national religion is not left to slow decay, but shares the
                    catastrophe of the nation itself, as was the case with the religions of the
                    small western Asiatic states in the period of Assyrian conquest, the old joyous
                    confidence in the gods gives way to a sombre sense of divine wrath, and the acts
                    by which this wrath can be conjured become much more important than the ordinary
                    traditional gifts of homage. To this point we must return by and by.</p>
                <p>It appears, then, that in the old national nature-religions the ordinary
                    exercises of worship take the form of meals offered to the gods, and usually of
                    banquets at which gods and worshippers sit down together, so that the natural
                    bond of unity between the deity and his subjects or children is cemented by the
                    bond of “bread and salt ”— salt is a standing feature in the sacrifices of many
                    races (comp. Lev. ii. 13)—to which ancient and unsophisticated peoples attach so
                    much importance. That the god is habitually willing to partake of the banquet
                    offered to him is taken for granted; but, if anything has occurred to alienate
                    his favour, he will show it by his conduct at the feast, by certain signs known
                    to experts, that indicate his refusal of the offered gift. Hence the custom of
                    inspecting the <hi rend="italic">exta</hi> of the victim, watching the behaviour
                    of the sacrificial flame, or otherwise seeking an omen which proves that the
                    sacrifice is accepted, and so that the deity may be expected to favour the
                    requests with which the gift is associated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hence in Roman ritual there is no inspection of the <hi
                    rend="italic">exta</hi> where the sacrifice is piacular, and so does not involve
                    a meal offered to the deity.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the religions which we have been characterizing all the ordinary functions of
                    worship are summed up in these sacrificial meals; the stated and normal
                    intercourse between gods and men has no other form. God and worshippers make up
                    together a society of <hi rend="italic">commensals,</hi> and every other point
                    in their reciprocal relations is included in what this involves. Now, with this
                    we must take the no less certain fact that throughout the sphere of the purely
                    sacrificial religions the circle of common worship is also the circle of social
                    duty and reciprocal moral obligations. And thus the origin of sacrificial
                    worship must be sought in a stage of society when the circle of commensals and
                    the circle of persons united to each other by sacred social bonds were
                    identical. But all social bonds are certainly developed out of the bond of
                    kindred, and it will be generally admitted that all national religions are
                    developments or combinations of the worship of particular kins. It would seem,
                    therefore, that the world-wide prevalence of sacrificial worship points to a
                    time when the kindred group and the group of commensals were identical, and
                    when, conversely, people of different kins did not eat and drink together.</p>
                <p>At first sight it might appear that this amounts to the<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0152-0135"/> proposition that all religious and civil
                    societies of antiquity have the family as their type, and that the type of
                    sacrifice is such a family meal as is found among the Romans. And this view
                    would seem to be favoured by the frequent occurrence among ancient peoples of
                    the conception that the deity is the father (progenitor and lord) of his
                    worshippers, who in turn owe filial obedience to him and brotherly duty to one
                    another. But in the present stage of research into the history of early society
                    it is by no means legitimate to assume that the family, with a father at its
                    head, is the original type of the circle of commensals. It is impossible to
                    separate the idea of commensality from the fact so constantly observed in
                    primitive nations, that each kindred has certain rules about forbidden food
                    which mark it off from all other kindreds. And in a very large proportion of
                    cases kindred obligations, religion, and laws of forbidden food combine to
                    divide a child from his father’s and unite him to his mother’s kin, so that
                    father and sons are not commensals. It is noteworthy that family meals are by no
                    means so universal an institution as might be imagined <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori.</hi> At Sparta, for example, men took their regular meals not with their
                    wives and children but in <hi rend="italic">syssitia</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pheiditia ·,</hi> and a similar organization of nations in groups of commensals
                    which are not family groups is found in other places (Crete, Carthage, &amp;c.).
                    The marked and fundamental similarity between sacrificial worships in all parts
                    of the globe makes it very difficult to doubt that they are all to be traced
                    back to one type of society, common to primitive man as a whole. But the nearest
                    approximation to a primitive type of society yet known is that based not on the
                    family but on the system of totem stocks; and as this system not only fulfils
                    all the conditions for the formation of a sacrificial worship, but presents the
                    conception of the god and his worshippers as a circle of commensals in its
                    simplest and most intelligible form, it seems reasonable to look to it for
                    additional light on the whole subject. In totemism and in no other system laws
                    of forbidden food have a direct religious interpretation and form the principal
                    criterion by which the members of one stock and religion are marked off from all
                    their neighbours. For the totem is usually an animal (less often a, plant); the
                    kindred is of the stock of its totem; and to kill or eat the sacred animal is an
                    impiety of the same kind with that of killing and eating a tribesman. To eat the
                    totem of a strange stock, on the other hand, is legitimate, and for one totem
                    group to feast on the carcase of a hostile totem is to express their social and
                    religious particularism in the most effective and laudable way, to honour their
                    own totem and to cast scorn on that of the enemy. The importance attached to the
                    religious feast of those who have the same laws about food, and are therefore
                    habitual commensals, is more intelligible on this system than on any other.</p>
                <p>Though the subject has not been completely worked out, there is a good deal of
                    evidence, both from social and from religious phenomena, that the civilized
                    nations of antiquity once passed through the totem stage (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Family</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Mythology)</hi>; it is at
                    least not doubtful that even in the historical period sacred animals and laws of
                    forbidden food based on the sacredness of animals, in a way quite analogous to
                    what is found in totemism, were known among all these nations. Among the
                    Egyptians the whole organization of the local populations ran on totem lines,
                    the different villages or districts being kept permanently apart by the fact
                    that each had its own sacred animal or herb, and that one group worshipped what
                    another ate. And the sacrificial feast on the carcase of a hostile totem
                    persisted down to a late date, as we know from Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Is.
                    et Osir.,</hi> p. 380; comp. Alex. Polyh., ap. Eus., <hi rend="italic">Praep.
                    Ev.,</hi> lx. p. 432;</p>
                <p>Diod. Sic., i. 89). Among the Semites there are many relics of totem religion;
                    and, as regards the Greeks, so acute an observer as Herodotus could hardly have
                    imagined that a great part of Hellenic religion was borrowed from Egypt if the
                    visible features of the popular worship in the two countries had really belonged
                    to entirely different types. To suppose that the numerous associations between
                    particular deities and corresponding sacred animals which are found in Greece
                    and other advanced countries are merely symbolical is a most unscientific
                    assumption; especially as the symbolic interpretation could not fail to be
                    introduced as a harmonizing expedient where, through the fusion of older deities
                    under a common name (in connexion with the political union of kindreds), one god
                    came to have several sacred animals. But originally even in Greece each kin had
                    its own god or in later language its hero; so in Attica the Crioeis have their
                    hero Crius (Ram), the Butadae have Butas (Bullman), the Aegidea have AEgeus
                    (Goat), and the Cynidae Cynus (Dog). Such heroes are real totem ancestors;
                    Lycus, for example, had his statue in wolf form at the Lyceum. The feuds of
                    clans are represented as contests between rival totems: Lycus the wolf flees the
                    country before AEgeus the goat, and at Argos, where the wolf-god (Apollo Lycius)
                    was introduced by Danaus, the struggle by which the sovereignty of the Danaids
                    was established was set forth in legend and picture as following on the victory
                    of a wolf (representing Danaus) over a bull (representing the older sovereignty
                    of Gelanor); see Paus., ii. 19, 3 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> That Apollo’s
                    sacrifices were bulls and rams is therefore natural enough; at the sanctuary of
                    the wolf-Apollo at Sicyon indeed legend preserved the memory of a time when
                    flesh was actually set forth for the wolves, as totem-worshippers habitually set
                    forth food for their sacred animals,—though by a touch of the later rationalism
                    which changed the wolf-god into Apollo the wolf-slayer (Lycoctonus) the flesh
                    was said to have been poisoned by Apollo’s direction in a way that even
                    theological experts did not understand (Paus., ii. 9, 7). Such clear traces of
                    the oldest form of sacrifice are necessarily rare, but the general facts that
                    certain animals might not be sacrificed to certain gods, while on the other hand
                    each deity demanded particular victims, which the ancients themselves explained
                    in certain cases to be hostile animals, find their natural explanation in such a
                    stage of religion as has just been characterized. The details are difficult to
                    follow out, partly because most worships of which we know much were
                    syncretistic, partly because the animals which the gods loved and protected were
                    in later times often confused with the victims they desired, and partly because
                    piacular and mystical sacrifices were on principle (as we shall see by and by)
                    chosen from the class of victims that might not be used for the feasts of the
                    gods. A single example, therefore, must here suffice to close this part of the
                    subject. At Athens the goat might not be offered to the Athena on the Acropolis.
                    Now according to legend Athena’s worship was made Panathenaic by the AEgidae or
                    goat clan, and Athena herself was represented clad in the aegis or goat-skin, an
                    attribute which denotes that she too was of the goat kin or rather had been
                    taken into that kin when her worship was introduced among them.<note

                    the same symbolism occurs. So too Pausanias (x. 31, 10) describes a
                    representation of the bear-heroine Callisto reclining on a bear-skin
                    couch.</p></note></p>
                <p>Generally speaking, then, the original principle on which a sacrificial meal is
                    chosen is that men may not eat what cannot be offered to their god (generalized
                    in later syncretism to the rule that men may not eat things that can be offered
                    to no god; Julian, <hi rend="italic">Orat.,</hi> v. p. 176 C.); and that,<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0153-0136"/> conversely, acceptable offerings are the things
                    which are eaten by predilection by that divine animal which in later times
                    became the sacred symbol of the anthropomorphic god, or else victims are to be
                    chosen which are sacred among a hostile tribe. The two principles may often
                    coincide. Fierce mountain tribes who live mainly by harrying their neighbours in
                    the plain will be wolves, lions, bears, while their enemies will naturally
                    worship bulls, sheep, goats, like the Troglodytes on the Red Sea, who “gave the
                    name of parent to no human being but to the bull and the cow, the ram and the
                    ewe, because from them they had their daily nourishment” (Strabo, xvi. 4); and
                    thus in cases like that of Argos the ultimate shape of the ritual may throw
                    important light on the character of the early population. When by conquest or
                    otherwise two such originally hostile nations are fused the opposing animal
                    symbols will ultimately be found in friendly association: <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> Artemis (in her various forms) is associated both with carnivora and
                    with stags or domestic animals. The former is the original conception, as her
                    sacrifices show. She is therefore, like the wolf-Apollo, originally the deity of
                    a wild hunting tribe, or rather various carnivorous deities of such tribes have
                    coalesced in her.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Human Sacrifices.—</hi> From these observations the transition
                    is easy to those human sacrifices which are not piacular. It is perfectly clear
                    in many cases that such sacrifices are associated with cannibalism, a practice
                    which always means eating the flesh of men of alien and hostile kin. The human
                    wolves would no more eat a brother than they would eat a wolf; but to eat an
                    enemy is another matter. Naturally enough traces of cannibalism persist in
                    religion after they have disappeared from ordinary life, and especially in the
                    religion of carnivorous gods.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the Roman empire human sacrifice was practised at not a

                    the wolf-Zeus (Lycaeus) in Arcadia were originally cannibal feasts of a wolf
                    tribe. The first participants in the rite were according to later legend changed
                    into wolves (Lycaon and his sons); and in later times, as appears by comparing
                    Plato <hi rend="italic">(Rep.·,</hi> viii. 15) with Pausanias (viii. 2), at
                    least one fragment of the human flesh was placed among the sacrificial portions
                    derived from other victims, and the man who ate it was believed to become a
                    were-wolf. All human sacrifices where the victim is a captive or other foreigner
                    may be presumed to be derived from cannibal feasts; but a quite different
                    explanation is required for the cases, which are by far more numerous among
                    people no longer mere savages, in which a father sacrifices his child or a tribe
                    its fellow-tribesman. This case belongs to the head of piacular sacrifices.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Piacular Sacrifices.—</hi> Among all primitive peoples there
                    are certain offences against piety (especially bloodshed within the kin) which
                    are regarded as properly inexpiable; the offender must die or become an outlaw.
                    Where the god of the kin appears as vindicator of this law he demands the life
                    of the culprit; if the kinsmen refuse this they share the guilt. Thus the
                    execution of a criminal assumes the character of a religious action. If now it
                    appears in any way that the god is offended and refuses to help his people, it
                    is concluded that a crime has been committed and not expiated. This neglect must
                    be repaired, and, if the true culprit cannot be found or cannot be spared, the
                    worshippers as a whole bear the guilt until they or the guilty man himself find
                    a substitute. The idea of substitution is widespread through all early
                    religions, and is found in honorific as well as in piacular rites; the Romans,
                    for example, substituted models in wax or dough for victims that could not be
                    procured according to the ritual, or else feigned that a sheep was a stag <hi
                    rend="italic">(cervaria avis')</hi> and the like. In all such cases the idea is
                    that the substitute shall imitate as closely as is possible or convenient the
                    victim whose place it supplies; and so in piacular ceremonies the god may indeed
                    accept one life for another, or certain select lives to atone for the guilt of a
                    whole community, but these lives ought to be of the guilty kin, just as in
                    blood-revenge the death of any kinsman of the manslayer satisfies justice. Hence
                    such rites as the Semitic sacrifices of children by their fathers (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Moloch),</hi> the sacrifice of Iphigeneia and similar cases
                    among the Greeks, or the offering up of boys to the goddess Mania at Rome <hi
                    rend="italic">pro familianum sospitate</hi> (Macrob., i. 7, 34). In the oldest
                    Semitic cases it is only under extreme manifestations of divine wrath that such
                    offerings are made (comp. Porph., <hi rend="italic">Pe Abst.,</hi> ii. 56), and
                    so it was probably among other races also; but under the. pressure of
                    long-continued calamity, or other circumstances which made men doubtful of the
                    steady favour of the gods, piacular offerings might easily become more frequent
                    and ultimately assume a stated character, and be made at regular intervals by
                    way of precaution without waiting for an actual outbreak of divine anger. Thus
                    the Carthaginians, as Theophrastus relates, annually sprinkled their altars with
                    “a tribesman’s blood” (Porph., <hi rend="italic">De Abst.,</hi> ii. 28). But in
                    advanced societies the tendency is to modify the horrors of the ritual either by
                    accepting an effusion of blood without actually slaying the victim, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the flagellation of the Spartan lads at the altar of
                    Artemis Orthia (Paus., iii. 16, 7; comp. Eurip., <hi rend="italic">Iph.
                    Taur.,</hi> 1470 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; 1 Kings xviii. 28), or by a further
                    extension of the doctrine of substitution; the Romans, for example, substituted
                    puppets for the human sacrifices to Mania, and cast rush dolls into the Tiber at
                    the yearly atoning sacrifice on the Sublician bridge. More usually, however, the
                    life of an animal is accepted by the god in place of a human life. This
                    explanation of the origin of piacular animal sacrifices has often been disputed,
                    mainly on dogmatic grounds and in connexion with the Hebrew sin-offerings; but
                    it is quite clearly brought out wherever we have an ancient account of the
                    origin of such a rite <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> for the Hebrews, Gen. xxii.
                    13; the Phoenicians, Porph., <hi rend="italic">Pe Abst.,</hi> iv. 15; the Greeks
                    and many others, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> ii. 54 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi>; the Romans, Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Fasti,</hi> vi. 162). Among the
                    Egyptians the victim was marked with a seal bearing the image of a man bound,
                    and kneeling with a sword at his throat (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Is. et
                    Os.,</hi> chap, xxxi.) And often we find a ceremonial laying of the sin to be
                    expiated on the head of the victim (Herod., ii. 39; Lev. iv. 4 compared with
                    xiv. 21).</p>
                <p>In such piacular rites the god demands only the life of the victim, which is
                    sometimes indicated by a special ritual with the blood (as among the Hebrews the
                    blood of the sin-offering was applied to the horns of the altar, or to the
                    mercy-seat within the vail), and there is no sacrificial meal. Thus among the
                    Greeks the carcase of the victim was buried or cast into the sea, and among the
                    Hebrews the most important sin-offerings were burnt not on the altar but outside
                    the camp (city), as was also the case with the children sacrificed to “Moloch.”
                    Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is a holocaust on the altar (2 Kings iii. 27),
                    or the flesh is consumed by the priests. The latter was the case with certain
                    Roman piacula, and with those Hebrew sin-offerings in which the blood was not
                    brought within the vail (Lev. vi. 25 <hi rend="italic">sq.}.</hi> Here the
                    sacrificial flesh is seemingly a gift accepted by the deity and assigned by him
                    to the priests, so that the distinction between a honorific and a piacular
                    sacrifice is partly obliterated. But this is not hard to understand; for just as
                    a blood-rite takes the place of blood-revenge in human justice, so an<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0154-0137"/> offence against the gods may in certain cases be
                    redeemed by a fine <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Herod., ii.. 65) or a
                    sacrificial gift. This seems to be the original meaning of the Hebrew <hi
                    rend="italic">āshām</hi> (trespass-offering), which was a kind of atonement made
                    partly in money (Lev. v. 15 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> but accompanied (at
                    least in later times) by a sacrifice which differed from the sin-offering,
                    inasmuch as the ritual did not involve any exceptional use of the blood. The
                    ordinary sin-offerings in which the priests ate the flesh may be a compound of
                    the <hi rend="italic">āshām</hi> and the properly piacular substitution of life
                    for life. The two kinds of atonement are mixed up also in Micah vi. 6 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and ultimately all bloody sacrifices, especially the
                    whole burnt-offering (which in early times was very rare but is prominent in the
                    ritual of the second temple), are held to have an atoning efficacy (Lev. i. 4,
                    xvii. 11). There is, however, another and mystical sense sometimes associated
                    with the eating of sin-offerings, as we shall see presently.</p>
                <p>The most curious developments of piacular sacrifice take place in the worship of
                    deities of totem type. Here the natural substitute for the death of a criminal
                    of the tribe is an animal of the kind with which the worshippers and their god
                    alike count kindred; an animal, that is, which must not be offered in a
                    sacrificial feast, and which indeed it is impious to kill. Thus Hecate was
                    invoked as a dog (Porph., <hi rend="italic">De Abst.,</hi> iii. 17), and dogs
                    were her piacular sacrifices (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Qu. Rom.,</hi> iii.). And
                    in like manner in Egypt the piacular sacrifice of the cow-goddess Isis-Hathor
                    was a bull, and the sacrifice was accompanied by lamentations as at the funeral
                    of a kinsman (Herod., ii. 39, 40). This lamentation at a piacular sacrifice is
                    met with in other cases, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> at the Argean festival at
                    Rome (Marquardt, <hi rend="italic">Röm. Staatsverw.,</hi> iii. 192), and is
                    parallel to the marks of indignation which in various atoning rituals it is
                    proper to display towards the priest who performs the sacrifice. At Tenedos, for
                    example, the priest was attacked with stones who sacrificed to Bacchus a
                    bull-calf, the affinity of which with man was indicated by the mother-cow being
                    treated like a woman in childbed and the victim itself wearing the cothurnus. As
                    the cothurnus was proper to Bacchus, who also was often addressed in worship and
                    represented in images as a bull, the victim here is of the same race with the
                    god (Ael., <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xii. 34; Plut., <hi rend="italic">Qu.
                    Gr.,</hi> xxxv.) as well as with the worshippers. In such rites a double meaning
                    was suggested: the victim was an animal kindred to the sacrificers, so that his
                    death was strictly speaking a murder, for which, in the Attic Diipolia, the
                    sacrificial axe cast away by the priest was tried and condemned (Paus., i. 24,
                    4), but it was also a sacred animal sharing the nature of the god, who thus in a
                    sense died for his people. The last point comes out clearly in the annual
                    sacrifice at Thebes, where a ram was slain and the ram-god Amen clothed in his
                    skin. The worshippers then bewailed the ram and buried him in a sacred coffin
                    (Herod., ii. 42). Thus the piacular sacrifice in such cases is merged in the
                    class of offerings which may be called sacramental or mystical.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mystical or Sacramental Sacrifices.—</hi> That the mysteries of
                    races like the Greeks and Egyptians are sprung from the same circle of ideas
                    with the totem mysteries of savage tribes has been suggested in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">MyTHOlogy,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 151, with which the reader may
                    compare Mr Lang’s book on <hi rend="italic">Custom and Myth;</hi> and examples
                    of sacramental sacrifices have been adduced in the same article (p. 150) and in
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mexico,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 212. In Mexico the worshippers
                    ate sacramentally paste idols of the god, or slew and feasted on a human victim
                    who was feigned to be a representative of the deity. The Mexican gods are
                    unquestionably developed out of totems, and these sacraments are on one line
                    with the totem mysteries of the ruder Indian tribes in which once a year the
                    sacred animal is eaten, body and blood. Now according to Julian <hi
                    rend="italic">(Orat., v.</hi> p. 175) the mystical sacrifices of the cities of
                    the Roman empire were in like manner offered once or twice a year and consisted
                    of such victims as the dog of Hecate, which might not be ordinarily eaten or
                    used to furnish forth the tables of the gods. The general agreement with the
                    American mysteries is therefore complete, and in many cases the resemblance
                    extends to details which leave no doubt of the totem origin of the ritual. The
                    mystic sacrifices seem always to have had an atoning efficacy; their special
                    feature is that the victim is not simply slain and burned or cast away but that
                    the worshippers partake of the body and blood of the sacred animal, and that so
                    his life passes as it were into their lives and knits them to the deity in
                    living communion. Thus in the orgiastic cult of the bull-Bacchus the worshippers
                    tore the bull to pieces and devoured the raw-flesh. These orgies-are connected
                    on the one hand with older practices, in which the victim was human (Orpheus
                    legend, Dionysus Ώ <hi rend="italic">μηστής</hi>), and on the other hand with
                    the myth of the murder of the god by his kinsmen the Titans, who made a meal of
                    his flesh (Clem. Al., <hi rend="italic">Coh. ad Gentes,</hi> p. 12). Similar
                    legends of fratricide occur in connexion with other orgies (the Corybantes; see
                    Clement, <hi rend="italic">ut supra);</hi> and all these various elements can
                    only be reduced to unity by referring their origin to those totem habits of
                    thought in which the god has not yet been differentiated from the plurality of
                    sacred animals and the tribesmen are of one kin with their totem, so that the
                    sacrifice of a fellow-tribesman and the sacrifice of the totem animal are
                    equally fratricides, and the death of the animal is the death of the mysterious
                    protector of the totem kin. In the Diipolia at Athens we have seen that the
                    slaughter of the sacred bull was viewed as a murder, but “the dead was raised
                    again in the same sacrifice,” as the mystic text had it: the skin was sewed up
                    and stuffed and all tasted the sacrificial flesh, so that the life of the victim
                    was renewed in the lives of those who ate of it<note anchored="true"

                    that the victim was eaten with the blood. This feature reappears elsewhere, as
                    in the piacular swine-offerings of the Fratres Arvales at Rome, and possesses a
                    special significance inasmuch as common blood means in antiquity a share in
                    common life. In the Old Testament the heathen mysteries seem to appear as
                    ceremonies of initiation by which a man was introduced into a new worship, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> primarily made of one blood with a new religious
                    kinship, and they therefore come into prominence just at the time when in the
                    7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> political convulsions had shaken
                    men’s faith in their old gods and led them to seek on all sides for new and
                    stronger protectors. The Greek mysteries too create a close bond between the <hi
                    rend="italic">mystae,</hi> and the chief ethical significance of the Eleusinia
                    was that they were open to all Hellenes and so represented a brotherhood wider
                    than the political limits of individual states. But originally the initiation
                    must have been introduction into a particular social community; Theophrastus’s
                    legend of the origin of the Diipolia is expressly connected with the adoption of
                    the house of Sopatrus into the position of Athenian citizens. From this point of
                    view the sacramental rites of mystical sacrifice are a form of blood-covenant,
                    and serve the same purpose<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n155/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0155-0138"/> as the mixing of blood or tasting of each other’s
                    blood by which in ancient times two men or two clans created a sacred covenant
                    bond. In all the forms of blood-covenant, whether a sacrifice is offered or the
                    veins of the parties opened and their own blood used, the idea is the same: the
                    bond created is a bond of kindred, because one blood is now in the veins of all
                    who have shared the ceremony. The details in which this kind of symbolism may be
                    carried out are of course very various, but where there is a covenant sacrifice
                    wo usually find that the parties eat and drink together (Gen. xxxi. 54), and
                    that the sacrificial blood, if not actually tasted, is at least touched by both
                    parties (Xen., <hi rend="italic">Anab.,</hi> ii. 2, 9), or sprinkled on both and
                    on the altar or image of the deity who presides over the contract (Exod., xxiv.
                    6, 7).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Greek ritual
                    the identity of the covenant sacrifice with mysticopiacular rites is clearly
                    brought out by the animals chosen and by other features in the ritual. See
                    Schoemann, <hi rend="italic">Or. Alt.,</hi> p. 248 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi></p></note> A peculiar form which meets us in various places is to cut
                    the animal in twain and make those who swear pass between the parts (Gen. xiii.
                    9 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Jer. xxxiv. 18 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Plut.,
                    <hi rend="italic">Qu. Rom.,</hi> iii., &amp;c.). This is generally taken as a
                    formula of imprecation, as if the parties prayed that he who proved unfaithful
                    might be similarly cut in twain; but, as the case cited from Plutarch shows that
                    the victim chosen was a mystic one, it is more likely that the original sense
                    was that the worshippers were taken within the mystic life.</p>
                <p>Even the highest forms of sacrificial worship present much that is repulsive to
                    modern ideas, and in particular it requires an effort to reconcile our
                    imagination to the bloody ritual which is prominent in almost every religion
                    which has a strong sense of sin. But we must not forget that from the beginning
                    this ritual expressed, however crudely, certain ideas which lie at the very root
                    of true religion, the fellowship of the worshippers with one another in their
                    fellowship with the deity, and the consecration of the bonds of kinship as the
                    type of all right ethical relation between man and man. And the piacular forms,
                    though these were particularly liable to distortions disgraceful to man and
                    dishonouring to the godhead, yet contained from the first germs of eternal
                    truths, not only expressing the idea of divine justice, but mingling it with a
                    feeling of divine and human pity. The dreadful sacrifice is performed not with
                    savage joy but with awful sorrow, and in the mystic sacrifices the deity himself
                    suffers with and for the sins of his people and lives again in their new life.
                    (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">r. s.</hi>)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Idea of Sacrifice in the Christian Church.</hi></p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the idea of sacrifice occupied an important place in
                    early Christianity. It had been a fundamental element of both Jewish and Gentile
                    religions, and Christianity tended rather to absorb and modify such elements
                    than to abolish them. To a great extent the idea had been modified already.
                    Among the Jews the preaching of the prophets had been a constant protest against
                    the grosser forms of sacrifice, and there are indications that when Christianity
                    arose bloody sacrifices were already beginning to fall into disuse; a saying
                    which was attributed by the Ebionites to our Lord repeats this protest in a
                    strong form, “I have come to abolish the sacrifices; and if ye do not cease from
                    sacrificing the wrath of God will not cease from you” (Epiph., xxx. 16). Among
                    the Greeks the philosophers had come to use both argument and ridicule against
                    the idea that the offering of material things could be needed by or acceptable
                    to the Maker of them all. Among both Jews and Greeks the earlier forms of the
                    idea had been rationalized into the belief that the most appropriate offering to
                    God is that of a pure and penitent heart, and among them both was the idea that
                    the vocal expression of contrition in prayer or of gratitude in praise is also
                    acceptable. The best instances of these ideas in the Old Testament are in Psalms
                    1. and li., and in Greek literature the striking words which Porphyry quotes
                    from an earlier writer, “We ought, then, having been united and made like to
                    God, to offer our own conduct as a holy sacrifice to Him, the same being also a
                    hymn and our salvation in passionless excellence of soul” (Euseb., <hi
                    rend="italic">Dem. Ev.,</hi> 3). The ideas are also found both in the New
                    Testament and in early Christian literature: “Let us offer up a sacrifice of
                    praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to
                    His name” (Heb. xiii. 15); “That prayers and thanksgivings, made by worthy
                    persons, are the only perfect and acceptable sacrifices I also admit” (Just.
                    Mart., <hi rend="italic">Trypho,</hi> c. 117); “We honour God in prayer, and
                    offer this as the best and holiest sacrifice with righteousness to the righteous
                    Word” (Clem. Alex., <hi rend="italic">Strom.,</hi> vii. 6).</p>
                <p>But among the Jews two other forms of the idea expressed themselves in usages
                    which have been perpetuated in Christianity, and one of which has had a singular
                    importance for the Christian world. The one form, which probably arose from the
                    conception of Jehovah as in an especial sense the protector of the poor, was
                    that gifts to God may properly be bestowod on the needy, and that consequently
                    alms have the virtue of a sacrifice. Biblical instances of this idea are—“He who
                    doeth alms is offering a sacrifice of praise” (Ecclus. xxxii. 2); “To do good
                    and to communicate forget not, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased”
                    (Heb. xiii. 16); so the offerings sent by the Philippians to Paul when a
                    prisoner at Rome are “an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well
                    pleasing to God” (Phil. iv. 18). The other form, which was probably a relic of
                    the conception of Jehovah as the author of natural fertility, was that part of
                    the fruits of the earth should be offered to God in acknowledgment of His
                    bounty, and that what was so offered was especially blessed and brought a
                    blessing upon both those who offered it and those who afterwards partook of it.
                    The persistence of this form of the idea of sacrifice constitutes so marked a
                    feature of the history of Christianity as to require a detailed account of
                    it.</p>
                <p>In the first instance it is probable that among Christians, as among Jews, every
                    meal, and especially every social meal, was regarded as being in some sense a
                    thank-offering. Thanksgiving, blessing, and offering were co-ordinate terms.
                    Hence the Talmudic rule, “A man shall not taste anything before blessing it” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Tosephta Berachoth,</hi> c. 4), and hence St Paul’s words, “He
                    that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks” (Rom. xiv. 6; comp.
                    1 Tim. iv. 4). But the most important offering was the solemn oblation in the
                    assembly on the Lord’s day. A precedent for making such oblations elsewhere than
                    in the temple had been afforded by the Essenes, who had endeavoured in that way
                    to avoid the contact with unclean persons and things which a resort to the
                    temple might have involved (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Antiq.,</hi> xviii. 1, 5),
                    and a justification for it was found in the prophecy of Malachi, “In every place
                    incense is offered unto My name and a pure offering; for My name is great among
                    the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts” (Mal. i. 11, repeatedly quoted in early
                    Christian writings, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Teaching of the Twelve
                    Apostles,</hi> c. 14; Just. Mart., <hi rend="italic">Trypho,</hi> c. 28, 41,
                    116; Irenaeus, iv. 17, 5).</p>
                <p>The points in relation to this offering which are clearly demonstrable from the
                    Christian writers of the first two centuries, but which subsequent theories have
                    tended to confuse, are these. (1) It was regarded as a true offering or
                    sacrifice; for in the <hi rend="italic">Teaching of the Twelve Apostles,</hi> in
                    Justin Martyr, and in Irenaeus it is designated by each of the terms which are
                    used to designate sacrifices in the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n156/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0156-0139"/> Old Testament. (2) It was primarily an offering
                    of the fruits of the earth to the Creator; this is clear from both Justin Martyr
                    and Irenseus, the latter of whom not only explicitly states that such oblations
                    are continued among Christians but also meets the current objection to them by
                    arguing that they are offered to God not as though He needed anything but to
                    show the gratitude of the offerer (Iren., iv. 17, 18). (3) It was offered as a
                    thanksgiving partly for creation and preservation and partly for redemption: the
                    latter is the special purpose mentioned (<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>) in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Teaching of the Twelve Apostles;</hi> the former is that upon
                    which Irenseus chiefly dwells; both are mentioned together in Justin Martyr <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trypho,</hi> c. 41). (4)</p>
                <p>Those who offered it were required to be not only baptized Christians but also
                    “in love and charity one with another there is an indication of this latter
                    requirement in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. v. 23, 24, where the word
                    translated “gift” is the usual LXX. word for a sacrificial offering, and is so
                    used elsewhere in the same Gospel, viz., Matt. viii. 4, xxiii. 19), and still
                    more explicitly in the <hi rend="italic">Teaching,</hi> c. 14, “Let not any one
                    who has a dispute with his fellow come together with you <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> on the Lord’s day) until they have been reconciled, that your
                    sacrifice be not defiled.” This brotherly unity was symbolized by the kiss of
                    peace. (5) It was offered in the assembly by the hands of the president; this is
                    stated by Justin Martyr <hi rend="italic">(Apol.,</hi> i. 65, 67), and implied
                    by Clement of Rome <hi rend="italic">(Ep.,</hi> i. 44, 4).</p>
                <p>Combined with this sacrifice of the fruits of the earth to the Creator in memory
                    of creation and redemption, and probably always immediately following it, was
                    the sacred meal at which part of the offerings was eaten. Such a sacred meal had
                    always, or almost always, formed part of the rites of sacrifice. There was the
                    idea that what had been solemnly offered to God was especially hallowed by Him,
                    and that the partaking of it united the partakers in a special bond both to Him
                    and to one another. In the case of the bread and wine of the Christian
                    sacrifice, it was believed that, after having been offered and blessed, they
                    became to those who partook of them the body and blood of Christ. This
                    “communion of the body and blood of Christ,” which in early writings is clearly
                    distinguished from the thank-offering which preceded it, and which furnished the
                    materials for it, gradually came to supersede the thank-offering in importance,
                    and to exercise a reflex influence upon it. In the time of Cyprian, though not
                    before, we begin to find the idea that the body and blood of Christ were not
                    merely partaken of by the worshippers but also offered in sacrifice, and that
                    the Eucharist was not so much a thank-offering for creation and redemption as a
                    repetition or a showing forth anew of the self-sacrifice of Christ. This idea is
                    repeated in Ambrose and Augustine, and has since been a dominant idea of both
                    Eastern and Western Christendom. But, though dominant, it has not been
                    universal; nor did it become dominant until several centuries after its first
                    promulgation. The history of it has yet to be written. For, in spite of the
                    important controversies to which it has given birth, no one has been at the
                    pains to distinguish between (i.) the theories which have been from time to time
                    put forth by eminent writers, and which, though they have in some cases
                    ultimately won a general acceptance, have for a long period remained as merely
                    individual opinions, and (ii.) the current beliefs of the great body of
                    Christians which are expressed in recognized formularies. A catena of opinions
                    may be produced in favour of almost any theory; but formularies express the
                    collective or average belief of any given period, and changes in them are a sure
                    indication that there has been a general change in ideas.</p>
                <p>It is clear from the evidence of the early Western liturgies that, for at least
                    six centuries, the primitive conception of the nature of the Christian sacrifice
                    remained. There is a clear distinction between the sacrifice and the communion
                    which followed it, and that which is offered consists of the fruits of the earth
                    and not of the body and blood of Christ. Other ideas no doubt attached
                    themselves to the primitive conception, of which there is no certain evidence in
                    primitive times, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the idea of the propitiatory
                    character of the offering, but these ideas rather confirm than disprove the
                    persistence of those primitive conceptions themselves.</p>
                <p>All Eastern liturgies, in their present form, are of later date than the
                    surviving fragments of the earlier Western liturgies, and cannot form the basis
                    of so sure an induction; but they entirely confirm the conclusions to which the
                    Western liturgies lead. The main points in which the pre-mediaeval formularies
                    of both the Eastern and the Western Churches agree in relation to the Christian
                    sacrifice are the following. (1) It was an offering of the fruits of the earth
                    to the Creator, in the belief that a special blessing would descend upon the
                    offerers, and sometimes also in the belief that God would be propitiated by the
                    offerings. The bread and wine are designated by all the names by which
                    sacrifices are designated <hi rend="italic">(sacrificia, hostiae, libamina,</hi>
                    and at least once <hi rend="italic">sacrificium placationis</hi>) <hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> and the act of offering them by the ordinary term for
                    offering a sacrifice <hi rend="italic">(immolatio}.</hi> (2) The offering of
                    bread and wine was originally brought to the altar by the person who offered it,
                    and placed by him in the hands of the presiding officer. In course of time there
                    were two important changes in this respect: <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> the
                    offerings of bread and wine were commuted for money, with which bread and wine
                    were purchased by the church-officers <hi rend="italic">; (b)</hi> the offerings
                    were sometimes handed to the deacons and by them taken to the bishop at the
                    altar, and sometimes, as at Rome, the bishop and deacons went round the church
                    to collect them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of this
                    proceeding an elaborate account exists in the very interesting document printed
                    by Mabillon in his <hi rend="smallcaps">Museum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Italicum,</hi> as “Ordo Romanus I.”; the small phials of wine which were
                    brought were emptied into a large bowl, and the loaves of bread were collected
                    in a bag.</p></note> (3) In offering the bread and wine the offerer offered, as
                    in the ancient sacrifices, primarily for himself, but inasmuch as the offering
                    was regarded as having a general propitiatory value he mentioned also the names
                    of others in whom he was interested, and especially the departed, that they
                    might rest in peace. Hence, after all the offerings had been collected, and
                    before they were solemnly offered to God, it became a custom to recite the names
                    both of the offerers and of those for whom they offered, the names being
                    arranged in two lists, which were known as diptychs. Almost all the old rituals
                    have prayers to be said “before the names,” “after the names.” It was a further
                    and perhaps much later development of the same idea that the good works of those
                    who had previously enjoyed the favour of God were invoked to give additional
                    weight to the prayer of the offerer. In the later series of Western rituals,
                    beginning with that which is known as the <hi rend="italic">Leonine
                    Sacramentary,</hi> this practice is almost universal. (4) The placing of the
                    bread and wine upon the altar was followed by the kiss of peace. (5) Then
                    followed the actual offering of the gifts to God <hi rend="italic">(immolatio
                    missae).</hi> It was an act of adoration or thanksgiving, much longer in Eastern
                    than in Western rituals, but in both classes of rituals beginning with the form
                    “Lift up your hearts,” and ending with the Ter Sanctus or Trisagion.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The elements of the form are
                    preserved exactly in the liturgy of the Church of England.</p></note> The early
                    MSS. of Western rituals indicate the importance which was attached to this part
                    of the liturgy by the fact of its being written in a much more ornate way than
                    the other parts, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in gold uncial letters<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n157/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0157-0140"/> upon a purple ground, as distinguished from the
                    vermilion cursive letters of the rest of the MS. With this the sacrifice proper
                    was concluded. (6) But, since the divine injunction had been “Do this in
                    remembrance of Me,” the sacrifice was immediately followed by a commemoration of
                    the passion of Christ, and that again by an invocation of the Holy Spirit <hi
                    rend="italic">(epiclesis)</hi> that He would make the bread and wine to become
                    the body and blood of Christ. Of this invocation, which is constant in all
                    Eastern rituals, there are few, though sufficient, surviving traces in Western
                    rituals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is found,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the second of Mone’s masses from the Reichenau

                    Then after a prayer for sanctification, or for worthy reception, followed the
                    Lord’s Prayer, and after the Lord’s Prayer the communion.</p>
                <p>In the course of the 8th and 9th centuries, by the operation of causes which have
                    not yet been fully investigated, the theory which is first found in Cyprian
                    became the dominant belief of Western Christendom. The central point of the
                    sacrificial idea was shifted from the offering of the fruits of the earth to the
                    offering of the body and blood of Christ. The change is marked in the rituals by
                    the duplication of the liturgical forms. The prayers of intercession and
                    oblation, which in earlier times are found only in connexion with the former
                    offering, are repeated in the course of the same service in connexion with the
                    latter. The designations and epithets which are in earlier times applied to the
                    fruits of the earth are applied to the body and blood. From that time until the
                    Reformation the Christian sacrifice was all but universally regarded as the
                    offering of the body and blood of Christ. The innumerable theories which were
                    framed as to the precise nature of the offering and as to the precise change in
                    the elements all implied that conception of it. It still remains as the accepted
                    doctrine of the Church of Rome. For, although the council of Trent recognized
                    fully the distinction which has been mentioned above between the Eucharist and
                    the sacrifice of the mass, and treated of them in separate sessions (the former
                    in Session xiii., the latter in Session xxii.), it continued the mediaeval
                    theory of the nature of the latter. The reaction against the mediaeval theory at
                    the time of the Reformation took the form of a return to what had no doubt been
                    an early belief, —the idea that the Christian sacrifice consists in the offering
                    of a pure heart and of vocal thanksgiving. Luther at one period (in his treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De Captivitate Babylonica)</hi> maintained, though not on
                    historical grounds, that the offering of the oblations of the people was the
                    real origin of the conception of the sacrifice of the mass; but he directed all
                    the force of his vehement polemic against the idea that any other sacrifice
                    could be efficacious besides the sacrifice of Christ. In the majority of
                    Protestant communities the idea of a sacrifice has almost lapsed. That which
                    among Catholics is most commonly regarded in its aspect as an offering and
                    spoken of as the “mass” is usually regarded in its aspect as a participation in
                    the symbols of Christ’s death and spoken of as the “communion.” But it may be
                    inferred from the considerable progress of the Anglo-Catholic revival in most
                    English-speaking countries that the idea of sacrifice has not yet ceased to be
                    an important element in the general conception of religion. <hi rend="smallcaps"
