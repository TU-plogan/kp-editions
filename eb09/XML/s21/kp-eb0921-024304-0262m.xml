                    first ô in <hi rend="italic">Shômerôn</hi> can hardly represent the old
                    pronunciation. In 1 Kings xvi. 24, the name of the city is derived from that of
                    Shemer, from whom Omri bought the site, and here LXX. seems to have originally
                    had Σαμάρων or (Cod. Vat. Σαεμηρων ), afterwards corrected to Σαμορων (as in
                    Lagarde’s edition of Lucian’s text) from the Hebrew tradition (compare Field’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Hexapla</hi> on the passage). The Assyrian monuments have <hi
                    rend="italic">Samirina.</hi></p></note>), the capital of Northern Israel from
                    the time of Omri to the fall of the kingdom, which was consummated in the long
                    siege of the royal city by Shalmaneser (2 Kings xvii. 5) and its capture by his
                    successor Sargon (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 721 B.C.). The choice of Samaria as
                    his capital by the warlike and energetic prince to whom the kingdom of Ephraim
                    mainly owed its greatness is easily understood. It stands in the very centre of
                    Palestine and of the country of the dominating tribe of Joseph, and, built on a
                    steep and almost isolated hill, with a long and spacious plateau for its summit,
                    was naturally a position of much strength, commanding two of the most important
                    roads—the great north and south road which passes immediately under the eastern
                    wall, and the road from Shechem to the maritime plain which runs a little to the
                    west of Omri’s capital. The hill of Samaria is separated from the surrounding
                    mountains (Amos iii. 9) by a rich and well-watered plain, from which it rises in
                    successive terraces of fertile soil to a height of 400 or 500 feet. Only on the
                    east a narrow saddle, some 200 feet beneath the plateau, runs across the plain
                    towards the mountains; it is at this point that the traveller coming from
                    Shechem now ascends the hill to the village of Sebastiya (now pronounced
                    Sebastíya), which occupies only the extreme east of a terrace beneath the hill
                    top, behind the crusading church of John the Baptist, which is the first thing
                    that draws the eye as one approaches the town. The hill-top, the longer axis of
                    which runs westward from the village, rises 1450 feet above the sea, and
                    commands a superb view towards the Mediterranean, the mountains of Shechem, and
                    Mount Hermon. The situation as a whole is far more beautiful than that of
                    Jerusalem, though not so grand and wild. The line of the ancient walls has not
                    been determined, the chief visible ruins being of the time of Herod; but, if
                    they followed the natural lines of defence, the city may have been almost a mile
                    in length from east to west.</p>
                <p>The foundation of the new capital was speedily followed by the wars with
                    Damascus, in which repeated ineffectual sieges by the Syrians proved the value
                    of the stronghold; and even the Assyrians, as has been mentioned, reduced the
                    place with difficulty. During part of the struggle with Damascus the kings of
                    Israel often resided at Jezreel, which was nearer the seat of war; but Omri’s
                    city never lost its pre-eminence. While it stood, Samaria and not Jerusalem was
                    the centre of Hebrew life, and the prophets sometimes speak of it as also the
                    centre of corrupt Jehovah-worship and idolatry (Hos. viii. 5, Mic. i. 5, Isa. x.
                    10). The<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n263/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0263-0244"/><hi rend="italic">ashera</hi> of Samaria, which
                    was not removed by the house of Jehu, is mentioned in 2 Kings xiii. 6; and Hos.
                    viii. 5 seems to speak of calf-idols there, unless the prophet is already using
                    the name of Samaria for tho kingdom as a whole, as later writers often do.
                    Ultimately, in the Greek period, the name of Samaria or Samaritis was applied to
                    the whole tract of which it is the centre—the region between Judaea and Galilee,
                    the country of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Samaritans (q.v);</hi> and the New
                    Testament uses Samaria in this sense. The city of Samaria was Hellenized by
                    Alexander, who settled Macedonian colonists in it It became a fortress and was
                    twice taken by siege in the wars of the Diadochi (by Ptolemy I. in 312 and by
                    Demetrius Poliorcetes about 296). Under the Ptolemies Samaria was the head of a
                    separate province, and it continued to be a strong city till John Hyrcanus took
                    and utterly destroyed it after a year’s siege (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 110 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi>.; see Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xiii. 10, 2
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> Taken from the Jews by Pompey, Samaria was one of
                    the ruined cities which Gabinius ordered to be restored (Jos., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ant.,</hi> xiv. 5, 3); then given by Augustus to Herod the Great, it was
                    refounded by him on a splendid scale probably in 27 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> the autumn of which year, according to Schürer’s calculations, is
                    the probable epoch of the new city of Sebaste, as it was now called in honour of
                    Augustus. Many remains of Herod's buildings, described by Josephus <hi
                    rend="italic">{Ant.,</hi> xv. 8, 5; <hi rend="italic">B. J.,</hi> i. 21, 2),
                    still remain; the most notable belong to a long colonnade just above the line of
                    Herod’s wall and those of the great temple of Caesar. The tombs of John the
                    Baptist, Elisha, and obadiah were visited at Samaria in the time of Jerome (see
                    O <hi rend="smallcaps">badiah),</hi> and that of St John must have been shown
                    there still earlier, for it was violated by Julian. The old crusading church,
                    now a mosque, was built over the tomb of the Baptist, who is reverenced as a
                    prophet by the Moslems. A view and plan of the church, with details, are given
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Survey of W. Pah (Memoirs,</hi> vol. ii. p. 211 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.),</hi> where also there is a plan of the city. (W. R. S.)</p>
