                    city of Palestine. Eleven hours from Jerusalem on the great north road the
                    traveller finds himself in the broad upland plain of Makhna (1500 feet above the
                    sea), with Mount Gerizim on his left, and, skirting the base of the mountain,
                    reaches the traditional well of Jacob (John iv. 5, 6; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi>
                    Gen. xxxiii. 19), a deep cistern with the ruins of an old church beside it. Here
                    the road divides: the caravan route to Damascus continues northward by the
                    village of 'Asker (Sychar of John iv. 5? <hi rend="italic">),</hi> and so to
                    Beisán (Beth-shan) and Tiberias; but the way to Samaria turns westward into a
                    fertile and well-watered side valley between Gerizim (2849 feet) on the south
                    and Ebal (3077 feet) on the north. This is the Vale of Shechem or Nábulus; it is
                    in fact an easy pass between the Mediterranean and Jordan basins, and at the
                    watershed (1870 feet), where the city stands, 1 1/4 miles from Jacob’s Well, is
                    not more than 100 yards wide. Thus Shechem commands both branches of the great
                    north road, and several routes from the coast also converge here and connect
                    with the ancient road from Shechem eastward to Keráwá (Archelais) and Al-Salt,
                    the capital of the Belká. The name of Shechem (shoulder, back) accords with the
                    position of the town on the watershed, and the native name in Josephus’s time
                    (Mabortha, <hi rend="italic">B. J.,</hi> iv. 8. 1; Pliny has Mamortha) means
                    simply “the pass.” The situation of Shechem at the crossing of so many great
                    roads must have given it importance at a very early date, and it is still a busy
                    town of 20,000 inhabitants, with soap manufactures and considerable trade. On
                    the other hand, the position is equally favourable for brigandage, to which,
                    under weak governments, the Shechemites were addicted of old (Judges ix. 25;
                    Hosea vi. 9, where "for consent” read “to Shechem ”), and the district is still
                    a lawless one.</p>
                <p>The ancient inhabitants of Shechem were the Bne Hamor, a Canaanite clan, who were
                    not expelled on the first conquest of Canaan but remained in possession till the
                    events recorded in Judges ix. From the narrative of Gen. xxxiv., which has been
                    spoken of in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Levi,</hi> it would seem that they
                    entered into friendly relations with the invaders, and that an attack made on
                    them by Simeon and Levi was repudiated by Israel and led to the dispersion of
                    these two tribes. In Judges ix. the “freemen of Shechem” (∏3jj&gt; 'Sj□) appear
                    as a turbulent but cowardly race, who, in spite of their numbers and wealth, had
                    become vassals of Gideon for the sake of protection against the Midianites, and
                    would have continued to serve his sons but for the enterprise of Abimelech,
                    whose mother was of their race. With the aid of mercenaries hired with the
                    treasure of the sanctuary of Baal-Berith or El-Berith, the god of the town,
                    Abimelech destroyed the sons of Gideon, was crowned king of Shechem, and for
                    three years held sway also over the surrounding Israelites. A revolt was led by
                    Gaal, an Israelite who scorned to be subject to the creature of the despised
                    Canaanites,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Judges

                    is Abimelech or who are the Shechemites (his supporters) that we should be his
                    slaves? By all means let the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul his officer enslave the
                    men of Hamor father of Shechem; but why should we (Hebrews) be his slaves?”
                    These words cannot have been spoken after the Shechemites had renounced
                    Abimelech; vv. 29, 30 ought to stand immediately after ver. 22. See W. R. Smith,

                    their practice of brigandage, Gaal made a dash at the city in the absence of the
                    king, and the fickle inhabitants received him with open arms. Abimelech,
                    however, with his mercenaries proved too strong for his adversaries, and
                    Canaanite Shechem was utterly destroyed. Its place was taken by a Hebrew city,
                    and the Canaanite sanctuary of El-Berith was transformed into a Hebrew holy
                    place of El the God of Israel, of which the foundation was afterwards referred
                    to Jacob (Gen. xxxiii. 20) or even to Abraham (Gen. xii. 7). The great stone
                    under the famous sacred tree at the sanctuary (the “tree of the revealer” or
                    “tree of the soothsayers,” E. V. “plain of Moreh” or “of Meonenim”; Gen: xii. 6,

                    this indicates that Shechem was once the chief sanctuary of Joseph, and so we
                    understand why Rehoboam went to Shechem to be crowned king of Northern Israel
                    and why Jeroboam at first made it his residence (1 Kings xii. 25). Politically
                    Shechem was soon supplanted by Tirzah and Samaria, but it appears to have been
                    still a sanctuary in the time of Hosea. It survived the fall of Ephraim (Jer.
                    xli. 5) and ultimately became the religious centre of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Samaritans</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> The Greek name Neapolis, known to
                    Josephus, indicates the building of a new town, which, according to Eusebius and
                    Jerome, was a little way from the old Shechem, or at least did not include the
                    traditional holy sites. The coins give the form Flavia Neapolis. Neapolis was
                    the birthplace of Justin Martyr, and became the seat of a bishopric. Five
                    Christian churches destroyed by the Samaritans in the time of Anastasius were
                    rebuilt by Justinian (Procop., <hi rend="italic">De Aed.,</hi> v. 7). Remains of
                    one of these seem still to exist in the crusaders’ church of the Passion and
                    Resurrection (1167), now the great mosque. Neapolis had much to suffer in the
                    crusades; it was finally lost to the Christians soon after Saladin’s great
                    victory at Hittín.</p>
