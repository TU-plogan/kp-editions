                <p><label type="entry">SEMIRYETCHENSK</label>, a province of Russian Turkestan,
                    including the steppes south of Lake Balkash and parts of the Tian-Shan Mountains
                    around Lake Issik-kul. It has an area of 155,300 square miles and is bounded by
                    Semipalatinsk on the N., by China (Jugutchak, Kuldja, Aksu, and Kashgaria) on
                    the E. and S., and by the Russian provinces of Ferganah, Syr-Daria, and
                    Akmolinsk on the W. It owes its name <hi rend="italic">(Jity-su, Semi-ryetchie,
                        i.e., “</hi> Seven Rivers ”) to the rivers which flow from the south-east
                    into Lake Balkash. The Jungarian Ala-tau, which separates it from north-western
                    Kuldja, penetrates into its central portions, extending south-west towards the
                    river Ili, with an average height of 6000 feet above the sea, several isolated
                    snow-clad peaks reaching about 12,000 feet. In the south Semiryetchensk embraces
                    the intricate systems of the Transili Ala-tau and the Tian-Shan (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Turkestan). Two</hi> ranges of the former, connected about
                    their middle by a single mountain-mass, extend east-north-eastwards along the
                    northern shore of Lake Issik-kul, both ranging from 10,000 to about 15,000 feet
                    and both partially snow-clad. To the south of the lake two immense ranges of the
                    Tian-Shan, separated by the valley of the Naryn, stretch in the same direction,
                    raising their icy peaks to above 15,000 and 16,000 feet; while westwards from
                    the lake the vast walls of the Alexandrovskiy ridge, 9000 to 10,000 feet high,
                    with peaks rising some 2000 feet higher, extend to the province of Syr-Daria.
                    Another mountain complex of much lower elevation runs north-westwards from the
                    Trans-Ilian Ala-tau towards the southern extremity of Lake Balkash. In the
                    north, λvhere the province borders Semipalatinsk, it includes the western parts
                    of the Tarbagatai range, the summits of which (10,000 feet) do not reach the
                    limit of perpetual snow. The remainder of the province consists of a rich steppe
                    in the north-east (Serghiopol), and vast uninhabitable sand-steppes on the
                    south-east of Lake Balkash. Southwards from the last-named, however, at the foot
                    of the mountains and at the entrance to the valleys, there are rich areas of
                    fertile land, which are rapidly being colonized by Russian immigrants, who have
                    also spread into the Tian-Shan, to the east of Lake Issik-kul. The climate is
                    relatively temperate (average yearly temperature 44° Fahr. at Vyernyi, 2500 feet
                    above the sea) and the vegetation rich.</p>
                <p>The chief river is the Ili. which enters the province from Kuldja, makes its way
                    through the spurs of the Trans-Ilian Ala-tau, flows north-west in a bed varying
                    from 200 to 1000 yards in width, and waters the province for 250 miles before it
                    enters Lake Balkash by several mouths forming a wide delta. Its tributaries from
                    the left are the Naryn, the Tchilik, and the Kurtu; several others become lost
                    in the sands. The Karatal, the Aksu, and the Lepsa likewise fall into Lake
                    Balkash. The Tchu rises in the Tian-Shan Mountains and flows north-westwards to
                    Lake Saumal-kul; and the Naryn flows south-westwards along a longitudinal valley
                    of the Tian-Shan, and enters Ferganah to join the Syr-Daria. The province
                    contains several important lakes. Lake Balkash, or Denghiz, in the north (8880
                    square miles), is crescent-shaped, 400 miles long and 55 wide in its broader
                    part; but its area is much less than it formerly was, and it is rapidly drying
                    up,—notably since 1853. Lake Ala-kul, which was connected with Balkash in the
                    Post-Pliocene period, now stands some hundred feet higher, and is connected by a
                    chain of smaller lakes with Sisik-kul. Lake Issik-kul (2260 square miles) is a
                    deep mountain lake, 120 miles long and 37 wide, 5300 feet above the sea. The
                    alpine lakes Son-kul (9400 feet) and Tchatyr-kul (11,100) lie south-west of
                    Issik-kul.</p>
                <p>The population, which was estimated at 748,800 by M. Kostenko in 1880 (139,660
                    being in the Kuldja region), has since increased,<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n666/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0666-0641"/> the latest official figures (1882) giving
                    685,950 for the province, exclusive of the Kuldja region. Of these Russians
                    numbered, according to Kostenko, 44,585, 20,640 being Cossacks, who are very
                    poor as compared with the free Russian emigrants. The majority of the population
                    are Kirghiz (595,237); next come Tarantchis (36,265), Kalmucks (about 25,000),
                    Mongols and Manchurians (22,000), and Dungans (19,657), these last two mostly in
                    Kuldja; while Tatars and Sarts are each represented by some 3000 or 3500 (all
                    the foregoing figures include those for Kuldja). The province is subdivided into
                    five districts; Vyernyi (18,423 inhabitants in 1879, of whom 3586 were
                    military), the chief town of the province, formerly Almaty, is situated at the
                    foot of the Trans-Ilian Ala-tau, and has a mixed population of Russians, Tatars,
                    Sarts, Kirghiz, Kalmucks, and Jews; its trade with Kuldja and Kashgar is
                    increasing rapidly, and it has now two lyceums, for boys and girls, and several
                    other schools. The other towns—Kopal (5450 inhabitants), Serghiopol (1045),
                    Tokmak (1770), and Karakol (2780) —are merely administrative centres.</p>
