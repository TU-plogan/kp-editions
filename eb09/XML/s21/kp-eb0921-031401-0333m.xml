                <p><label type="entry">SARTHE</label>, a department of the north-west region of
                    France, formed in 1790 out of the eastern part of Maine, 29 communes of Anjou,
                    and portions of Perche. Situated between 47° 35' and 48° 30' N. lat., and
                    between 0° 25' W. and 0° 55 E. long., it is bounded N. by the department of
                    Orne, N.E. by Eure-et-Loir, E. by Loir-et-Cher, S. by Indre-et-Loire and
                    Maine-et-Loire, and W. by Mayenne. The Sarthe, a sub-tributary of the Loire,
                    flows in a southwesterly direction through the department; and the Loir, which
                    along with the Sarthe joins the Mayenne to form the Maine above Angers,
                    traverses its southern borders. The general slope of the country is from north
                    to south-west. While the highest point (on the boundary towards Orne) is 1115
                    feet, the lowest, where the Loir leaves the department, is only 65. The hills
                    that separate the streams rise as they advance north-east into Perche, or
                    north-west into what are magniloquently called the Alpes Mancelles (1080 feet
                    high). The Sarthe flows past Le Mans and Sablé, receiving the Merdereau and the
                    Vègre from the right, and the Orne and the Huisne from the left. The Loir passes
                    La Flèche, and along its chalky banks caves have been hollowed out which, like
                    those along the Cher and the Loire, serve as dwelling-houses and stores. The
                    mean annual temperature differs but slightly from that of Paris. There are in
                    the year 145 days of rain (with 12 of snow), 56 of frost, 180 of fogs, 20 of
                    hail, and 14 of storm. The rainfall is about 24 inches, or rather below the
                    average for France.</p>
                <p>Of a total surface of 1,533,760 acres, 982,635 acres in the department are
                    arable, 198,517 underwood, 190,176 in meadows and grass, 42,000 in moors, and
                    22,284 in vineyards. In 1881 the live stock comprised 61,400 horses, 6524 asses
                    or mules, 182,195 cattle, 49,373 sheep (wool-clip 83 to 84 tons), 79,737 pigs,
                    24,369 goats, 12,898 hives (76 tons of honey, 21½ tons wax). Poultry (capons,
                    geese, &amp;c.) form one of the most remunerative products of the department,
                    which sends yearly to Paris 250,000 fowls and 100,000 geese, and consumes or
                    disposes of 10,000,000 eggs. The horses are, like those of Perche <hi
                    rend="italic">(percherons),</hi> famous for speed combined with strength. There
                    are three distinct districts :—the corn lands to the north of the Sarthe and the
                    Huisne; the moorlands, partly planted with pine, between those two streams and
                    the Loir; and the wine-growing country to the south of the Loir. In 1883 the
                    grain crop yielded 2,813,387 bushels of wheat, 951,039 of meslin, 714,248 of
                    rye, 2,317,760 of barley, 1,993,049 of oats, 30,880 of maize, and 59,680 of
                    buckwheat; and there were 9,536,312 bushels of potatoes and 92,521 of beans,
                    pease, &amp;c., 81,664 tons of beetroot, 4794 tons of hemp, and 6 of flax. In
                    1884 cider was produced to the extent of 15,473,414 gallons (average quantity
                    per annum in previous years 8,628,444 gallons), and wine to 4,347,134
                    gallons</p>
                <p>(average quantity 3,883,330). Fodder was grown to the amount of 381,110 tons; and
                    there were considerable supplies of chestnuts and hazel nuts—Château du Loir
                    being the principal market for the former. From the forests, which consist
                    mainly of oaks, witch-elms, chestnut-trees, pines, and beeches, material is
                    drawn to the value of £140,000. The agriculture of the district has made great
                    progress through the opening up of roads, improvements, draining, and
                    irrigation. Besides mines of anthracite and coal (21,205 tons in 1882),
                    iron-ore, marble, freestone, slate, millstones, clay, marl, lime, tuffeau (a
                    kind of white chalky tuff), magnesia, and peat are all worked. The staple
                    industry is the weaving of hemp and flax (3395 spindles, 4400 looms, 400 being
                    power-looms). The cotton manufacture ranks next (8700 spindles, 185 looms, of
                    which 100 are power-looms), while the woollen manufacture employs only 350
                    spindles and 161 looms. In the paper-mills 569 workmen are engaged, and the
                    value of the paper and cardboard produced was £180,880 in 1881. Iron-foundries,
                    copper and bell foundries, potteries, tile-works, glass-works and stained glass
                    manufactories, currierics, engine and carriage factories, wire-gauze factories,
                    flourmills, and distilleries are also carried on; and altogether about 256
                    steam-engines with 2480 horse-power are employed in those establishments. The
                    commerce of the department is facilitated by 99 miles of navigable river (Sarthe
                    and Loir), 250 miles of national roads, 6707 miles of other roads, and 352 miles
                    of railway.</p>
                <p>With its 438,917 inhabitants (1881) Sarthe has exactly the average density of
                    population in France. From 1801 (380,821) to 1866 (465,615) the number was on
                    the increase, but since that date there has been a decline. The department forms
                    the diocese of Le Mans, has its court of appeal at Angers, and its university
                    authorities at Caen, and constitutes part of tho territory of the fourth <hi
                    rend="italic">corps d'armée</hi> with its headquarters at Le Mans. The four
                    arrondissements are named from Le Mans, the chief town; LaFlèche (9424
                    inhabitants), famous for its prytanée militaire; Mamers (6070 inhabitants); and
                    St Calais (3600). There are 33 cantons and 387 communes. Sablé (6000
                    inhabitants) contains a castle built for Colbert by Mansart; and hard by was the
                    celebrated Benedictine abbey of Solesmes.</p>
