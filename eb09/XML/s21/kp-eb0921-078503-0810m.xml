                    ground in the neighbourhood of the Pennine range, on several rivers and streams,
                    the principal of which are the Don, the Sheaf, the Porter, the Rivelin, and the
                    Loxley, and on the Midland, Great Northern, and various branch railway lines, 39
                    miles south of Leeds, 37 south-east of Manchester, 172 north of London by the
                    Midland Railway, and 162 by the Great Northern. The borough of Sheffield is
                    coextensive with the parish, and embraces a district 10 miles in length by 3 or
                    4 miles in breadth. It includes the townships of Sheffield, Brightside Bierlow,
                    Attercliffe-cum-Darnall, Nether Hallam, Heeley, Ecclesall Bierlow, and Upper
                    Hallam, the last two districts being in great part rural, but occupied also by
                    the southern and western suburbs of the borough. The older portions of the town
                    are somewhat irregularly built, and in some districts densely populated, but
                    much has been done of late years to widen and otherwise improve the streets in
                    the central districts by the operation of an Act passed in 1875, the expense
                    amounting in all to about £1,000,000. The suburbs contain a large number of
                    beautiful terraces and mansions, picturesquely situated in the neighbourhood of
                    fine natural scenery. A considerable portion of them is occupied by workmen’s
                    cottages, many of which are surrounded by well-kept gardens.</p>
                <p>Sheffield in 1845 was divided into twenty-five parochial districts, which have
                    been gradually added to in successive years, and in 1855 it was constituted a
                    deanery. The<pb break="no"

                    is the old parish church of St Peter, chiefly in the Perpendicular style,
                    originally cruciform, but by various additions now rectangular. The old Norman
                    building is supposed to have been burned down during the wars of Edward III.
                    with the barons, and the most ancient part of the present structure is the
                    tower, dating from the 14th century. The church has lately been restored at the
                    cost of about £20,000. It contains a large number of interesting mural
                    monuments.</p>
                <p>The free grammar school was founded in 1603 through a bequest of Thomas Smith, a
                    native of Sheffield, practising as an attorney at Crowland, Lincolnshire, and it
                    received the sanction of King James I. in 1604, with the title “The Free Grammar
                    School of King James of England.” The grammar school building of stone in the
                    Tudor style, erected in 1824, is now (1886) used as a technical school, the
                    grammar school trustees having purchased the collegiate school at Broomhall
                    Park. The other principal educational institutions are the free writing school
                    (1715, rebuilt in 1827), the boys’ charity school (founded 1706), the girls’
                    charity school (1786), the Roman Catholic reformatory (1861), the Church of
                    England educational institute, the Firth College, erected by Mark Firth at a
                    cost of £20,000, for lectures and classes in connexion with the extension of
                    university education, the Wesley College, associated with London University,
                    Ranmoor College, for training young men for the ministry in the Methodist New
                    Connexion, the mechanics’ institute, the school of art, and the St George’s
                    Museum, founded by Mr Ruskin, and including a picture gallery, a library, and a
                    mineral, a natural history, and a botanical collection, the special purpose of
                    the institution being the training of art students. The school board was first
                    elected in 1870, and carries on its operations with great energy and
                    success.</p>
                <p>The principal public buildings are the town-hall, including the police offices
                    and rooms for the quarter sessions and other courts, erected in 1808, enlarged
                    in 1833, and lately extensively remodelled at a cost of over £10,000; the
                    council hall and municipal buildings, originally used for the mechanics’
                    institute, but purchased by the corporation in 1864; the cutlers’ hall, built in
                    1832 at a cost of £6500, and enlarged in 1857 by the addition of a magnificent
                    banqueting hall, erected at a cost of £9000; the general post office, in the
                    Doric style, opened in 1874; the fine new corn exchange, in the Tudor style,

                    volunteer artillery drill hall, erected at a cost of £9000. The literary and
                    social institutions include the Athenaeum, established in 1847, with a newsroom
                    and library; the literary and philosophical society, 1822; the Sheffield club,
                    1862; the Sheffield library, commenced in 1777, and containing 80,000 volumes;
                    and the free library, founded in 1856, with various branches opened in
                    subsequent years. Among the medical or benevolent institutions may be mentioned
                    the general infirmary, opened in 1797, and successively enlarged and improved as
                    requirements demanded; the public hospital, erected in 1858 (in connexion with
                    the Sheffield medical school established in 1792) and extended in 1869; the

                <p>The public monuments are neither numerous nor important, the principal being the
                    Montgomery statue, erected to James Montgomery the poet in 1861, chiefly by the
                    Sunday school teachers of the town, the Ebenezer Elliot monument, erected in the
                    market-place in 1854, and removed to Weston Park in 1875, the column to Godfrey

                    War.</p>
                <p>The town is comparatively well supplied with parks and public gardens. In three
                    of the more populous districts the duke of Norfolk, lord of the manor, presented
                    plots of ground amounting in all to 26 acres, to be used as recreation grounds.

                    mansion house of Weston Hall, which the town council purchased in 1873. The
                    grounds are about 13 acres in extent, and the museum includes—in addition to the
                    Mappin Art Gallery, now (1886) being erected from the bequest of John Newton
                    Mappin—a picture gallery, a natural history collection, and an extensive
                    collection of British antiquities. The Firth Park, on the north-east of the
                    town, 36 acres in extent, was purchased by Mark Firth, and presented to the
                    town, the opening ceremony by the prince and princess of Wales taking place 16th
                    August 1875. The Norfolk Park, 60 acres in extent, is granted by the duke of
                    Norfolk for the use of the town, but remains his property. The botanical
                    gardens, 18 acres in extent, situated in the western suburbs, are the property
                    of a company, but on certain days they are open to the public at a small charge.

                <p>The prosperity of Sheffield is chiefly dependent on the manufacture of steel and
                    the application of it to its various uses. The smelting of iron in the district
                    is supposed to date from Roman times, and there is distinct proof carrying it
                    back as far as the Norman Conquest. The town had become famed for its cutlery by
                    the 14th century, as is shown by allusions in Chaucer. There was an important
                    trade carried on in knives in the reign of Elizabeth, and the Cutlers’ Company
                    was incorporated in 1624. In early times cutlery was made of blister or bar
                    steel; afterwards shear steel was introduced for the same purpose; but in 1740
                    Benjamin Huntsman of Handsworth introduced the manufacture of cast steel, and up
                    to the present time Sheffield retains its supremacy in steel manufacture,
                    notwithstanding foreign competition, especially that of Germany and the United
                    States, its trade in heavy steel having kept pace with that in the other
                    branches. It was with the aid of Sheffield capital that Henry Bessemer founded
                    his pioneer works to develop the manufacture of his invention, and a large
                    quantity of Bessemer steel is still made in Sheffield. The heavy branch of the
                    steel manufacture includes armour plates, rails, tyres, axles, large castings
                    for engines, steel shot, and steel for rifles. The cutlery trade embraces almost
                    every variety of instrument and tool,—spring and table knives, razors, scissors,
                    surgical instruments, mathematical instruments, edge tools, saws, scythes,
                    sickles, spades, shovels, engineering tools, hammers, vices, &amp;c. The
                    manufacture of engines and machinery is also largely carried on, as well as that
                    of stoves and grates. The art of silver plating was introduced by Thomas
                    Bolsover in 1742, and the manufacture is still of importance. Among the minor
                    industries of the town are tanning, confectionery, cabinetmaking,
                    bicycle-making, iron and brass founding, silver refining, and the manufacture of
                    brushes and combs and of optical instruments. On account of various outrages
                    perpetrated by artisans in workshops against persons obnoxious to them, a
                    Government commission was in 1867 appointed to make inquiries, the result being
                    the exposure and suppression of confederacies in connexion with various
                    workmen’s unions.</p>
                <p>The town trust for the administration of property belonging to the town dates
                    from the 14th century, and in 1681 the number and manner of election of the
                    “town trustees” was definitely settled by a decree of the Court of Chancery.
                    Additional powers were conferred on the trustees by an Act passed in 1874. The
                    annual income of the trust property now amounts to about £5000. Sheffield
                    obtained municipal government in 1843, and is divided into nine wards. The
                    number of aldermen is sixteen. Since 1864 the town council have had control of
                    the police, of the maintenance of the streets, and of the drainage and sanitary
                    arrangements, but the supplies of water and gas are in the hands of private
                    companies. The markets belong to the duke of Norfolk, lord of the manor. The
                    town first returned members to parliament in 1832. In 1885 the representation
                    was increased from two to five members, the parliamentary divisions being
                    Attercliffe, Brightside, Central, Ecclesall, and Hallam. The area of the
                    municipal and parliamentary borough is 19,651 acres. From 45,755 in 1801 the
                    population had increased by 1841 to 110,891, by 1871 to 239,947, and by 1881 to
                    284,508 (141,298 males, 143,210 females).</p>
                <p>Sheffield was the capital of Hallamshire from the Norman Conquest, and it is
                    supposed that the “aula” of the Saxon Lord Waltheof mentioned in Domesday was on
                    the Castle Hill. After the execution of Waltheof for a conspiracy against the
                    Conqueror in 1075 the manor for some time remained in the hands of his countess,
                    but in 1080 was possessed by Roger de Busli. Afterwards it passed to the De
                    Lovetots, barons of Huntingdonshire, one of whom had a castle at Sheffield. A
                    number of people, workers in iron, gathered round the castle and formed the
                    nucleus of the town. Through an heiress of the De Lovetots it passed in the
                    reign of Richard I. to the De Furnivals, one of whom, Thomas de Furnival,
                    strengthened and completed the castle, and obtained from Edward I. a charter
                    under the great seal for a market and annual fair. After the extinction of the
                    male line of the Furnivals in 1406, the manor passed to the Talbots, of whom
                    John, referred to in Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">Henry VI.,</hi> was created
                    earl of Shrewsbury in 1442. Cardinal Wolsey, during his disgrace, was for some
                    time placed in Sheffield Castle under the charge of George, fourth earl of
                    Shrewsbury; and Queen Mary remained a prisoner in it under the care of George,
                    sixth earl, from the autumn of 1570 to the autumn of 1584. During the Civil Wars
                    the castle was seized in 1642 by the Parliamentary party, who garrisoned it and
                    threw up entrenchments round the town, but after the capture of Rotherham in
                    April 1643 they, on the approach of the earl of Newcastle, left it in panic and
                    fled to Derbyshire. It was, however, recaptured by the party in the following
                    year, and was subsequently demolished. In 1654 the estate passed by marriage to
                    the Howards, dukes of Norfolk.</p>
