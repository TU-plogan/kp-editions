                    and after passing through Pembroke College, Oxford, retired there to realize
                    Pope’s ideal in the <hi rend="italic">Ode to Solitude,</hi> turned his paternal
                    estate into an elaborate landscape garden, and lived there till his death in
                    1763. From the time that the management of the estate fell into his own hands,
                    “he began,” Johnson says, “to point his prospects, to diversify his surface, to
                    entangle his walks, and to wind his waters,—which he did with such judgment and
                    such fancy as to make his little domain the envy of the great and the admiration
                    of the skilful.” From this it will be seen that he did not anticipate late
                    sentiment in his love of natural scenery; he was a true child of the Queen Anne
                    time in his liking for “Nature to advantage dressed.” And it would appear from
                    his letters that he was not a contented recluse, but was weakly desirous of the
                    notice of the world in his Arcadian retreat. Still there is a certain air of
                    sincerity in his references to natural beauty and grandeur. Burns wrote of him
                    in the preface to his first issue of poems as a poet “whose divine elegies do
                    honour to our language.” Shenstone practised the elegiac form assiduously, and
                    some of his elegies are not without a certain imposing pomp and dignity of
                    language, but we may safely suppose that it was the sentiments rather than the
                    expression that captivated the peasant poet. His <hi rend="italic">Pastoral
                    Ballads in Four Parts,</hi> one of his earliest compositions, is also one of his
                    best, and from its use in selections of poetry for the young is much more
                    generally known. The triple rhythm and the simplicity of the language are
                    happily suited to the pastoral fancy, and there is not too much of the
                    artificial diction and imagery of such poetry. Such lines as—</p>
                <p>Yet time may diminish the pain;</p>
                <p>The flower, and the shrub, and the tree</p>
                <p>"Which I rear’d for her pleasure in vain In time may have comfort for me—</p>
                <p>come nearer Wordsworth’s ideal of poetic diction than was common in the serious
                    poetry of Shenstone’s time. But his <hi rend="italic">Schoolmistress,</hi> in
                    the Spenserian stanza (published in 1742, and so relieved from any suspicion of
                    being an imitation of Thomson), is the poem by which he keeps a place in
                    literature.</p>
