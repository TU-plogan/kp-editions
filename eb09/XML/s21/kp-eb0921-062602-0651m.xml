                    instruments designed to measure the movement of the ground during earthquakes.
                    Recent observations have shown that, in addition to the comparatively great and
                    sudden displacements which occur in earthquakes, the ground is subject to other
                    movements. Some of these, which may be called “earth-tremors,” resemble
                    earthquakes in the rapidity with which they occur, but differ from earthquakes
                    in being imperceptible (owing to the smallness of the motion) until instrumental
                    means are used to detect them. Others, which may be called “earth-tilt-ings,”
                    show themselves by a slow bending and unbending of the surface, so that a post
                    stuck in the ground, vertical to begin with, does not remain vertical, but
                    inclines now to one side and now to another, the plane of the ground in which it
                    stands shifting relatively to the horizon. No sharp distinction can be drawn
                    between these classes<pb break="no"

                    into one another, and in almost every earthquake there is some tilting of the
                    surface. The term “seismometer” may conveniently be extended (and will here be
                    understood) to cover all instruments which are designed to measure movements of
                    the ground.</p>
                <p>Measurements of earth-movements are of two distinct types. In one type, which is
                    applicable to ordinary earthquakes and earth-tremors, the thing measured is the
                    displacement of a point in the earth’s crust. In the second type, which is
                    applicable to slow tiltings, the thing measured is any change in the plane of
                    the earth’s surface relatively to the vertical. Under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Earthquake</hi> mention is made of instruments designed by Palmieri and others
                    to register the occurrence of earthquakes, and in some cases to give a general
                    idea of their severity. While some of those instruments act well as
                    seismoscopes, none of them serve to determine with precision the character or
                    the magnitude of the motion. In this article notice will be taken only of
                    instruments intended for exact measurement.</p>
                <p>Earthquake displacements are in general vertical as well as horizontal. For the
                    purpose of measurement it is convenient to treat the vertical component
                    separately, and in some cases to resolve the horizontal motion into two
                    components at right angles to each other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inertia Method.—</hi> In the first type of measurements what
                    may be called the “inertia” method is followed. A mass is suspended with freedom
                    to move in the direction of that component of the earth’s motion which is to be
                    measured. When an impulse occurs the supports move, but the mass is prevented by
                    its inertia from accompanying them. It supplies a steady point, to be used as a
                    standard of reference in determining the extent through which the ground has
                    moved in the direction in question. But, in order that the suspended mass shall
                    not acquire motion when its supports move, one essential condition must be
                    satisfied. Its equilibrium must be neutral, or nearly so, in order that, when
                    the supports are displaced, little or no force may be brought into operation
                    tending to bring the mass into the same position relative to the supports as it
                    occupied before disturbance. This can be made plain by considering the case of a
                    common pendulum hung from a support which is rigidly fixed to the ground.</p>
                <p>When the ground moves in any horizontal direction the pendulum’s inertia causes a
                    certain point in it (the centre of percussion) to remain for the instant at
                    rest.</p>
                <p>But this contrivance does not yield a steady point, because the stability of the
                    pendulum makes the bob swing down to recover its place directly under the
                    support; and in fact, if a succession of oscillations of the ground occur, the
                    bob acquires a motion often much greater than the motion of the support itself.
                    This tendency may be corrected, and the pendulum made fit to act as a
                    seismometer, by any contrivance which (without introducing friction) will reduce
                    its stability so much as to make the equilibrium of the bob very nearly neutral.
                    In all instruments designed to furnish a steady point the suspended mass must
                    have some small stability, else it would be unmanageable; but its period of free
                    oscillation must be much greater than that of the earthquake-motions which it is
                    employed to measure. Even a simple pendulum can have its stability reduced
                    sufficiently to fit it for seismometric work by making it very long. The same
                    result is, however, much more conveniently achieved by combining a common
                    pendulum with an inverted pendulum placed just beneath it. The common pendulum
                    being stable and the inverted pendulum unstable, if the bobs are jointed so that
                    they must move together, the combination can be made as nearly astatic as may be
                    desired.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J. A. Ewing, “A

                    <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> is geared also by a ball-and-tube joint to the upper
                    bob. Its long arm carries a jointed index <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which
                    projects out and touches a smoked-glass plate <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> held on
                    a fixed shelf. Any horizontal motion of the ground acts on the lever by the
                    bracket <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and causes the index to trace a magnified
                    record on the smoked-glass plate. Fig. 1 is taken from a photograph of an
                    instrument of this kind, constructed to give a much magnified record of small
                    movements. When large earthquakes are to be recorded the multiplying lever is
                    dispensed with, and the index is attached directly to one of the bobs.
                    Observations with instruments of this class exhibit well the very complicated
                    motion which the earth’s surface undergoes during an earthquake. In small
                    earthquakes (such as are only slightly or not at all destructive) the greatest
                    amplitude of motion is often less than a millimetre, and rarely more than a
                    centimetre; the disturbance nevertheless consists of a multitude of successive
                    movements, quite irregular in amplitude, period, and direction. Fig. 3 is a
                    facsimile of the record given by a duplex pendulum seismograph during one of the
                    earthquakes which occur frequently in the plain of Yedo, Japan. The record, as
                    engraved, is three and a half times the earth’s actual motion.</p>
                <p>Instead of two pendulums, a single inverted pendulum has been used, with a spring
                    stretched between it and a fixed support above. By adjusting the spring so that
                    a proper proportion of the weight is borne by it and the remainder by the rigid
                    stem of the pendulum, an approach to neutral equilibrium can be made.<note

                    was attached to an elastic wire which tended to restore it to its normal
                    vertical position when displaced.</p>
                <p>Another group of instruments designed to furnish two degrees of freedom for the
                    purpose of recording all motions in a horizontal plane, but much less
                    satisfactory on account of their friction, is that in which a rolling sphere
                    either itself supplies inertia or forms a support for a second inertia-giving
                    mass. Probably the earliest was one used in Japan by Dr G. F. Verbeck in 1876
                    (see fig. 4). On a marble table, ground plane and carefully levelled, four balls
                    of rock-crystal were placed, carrying a massive block of hard wood. A pencil,
                    sliding in a hole in the block, registered the relative motion of the table and
                    the block on a sheet of paper fixed below. The motion registered is (or would
                    be, if there were no friction) somewhat larger than the true motion of the
                    table, for the system is kinetically equivalent to four upright pieces whose
                    centres of percussion lie in a plane nearly, but not quite, as high as the tops
                    of the balls. This forms what may be Called the steady plane; its position
                    depends on the relative masses of block and balls, and is easily calculated.
                    When the ground moves in any direction the block moves through a short distance
                    in the opposite direction, and the record is magnified in a fixed ratio. Various
                    forms of rolling-sphere seismometers have been<pb break="no"

                    form would be that of a light spherical segment rolling on a level plane base
                    and carrying a heavy bob fixed to it. To give some stability the bob should be
                    placed so as to bring the centre of gravity a little under the centre of
                    curvature. The centre of percussion, somewhat higher than this, would of course
                    be the steady point, and a multiplying pointer might take the motion either from
                    it or from any other convenient part of the rolling piece. All rolling
                    seismometers—including rolling cylinders, which have been proposed by Mr Gray as
                    single-freedom instruments, to register one component of horizontal motion—fail
                    to act well, partly because of the comparatively great frictional or
                    quasi-frictional resistance which is presented to the motion of the free mass,
                    and partly because, owing to imperfections in the construction and want of
                    perfect rigidity in the materials, the ball or cylinder takes up a position in
                    which there is an objectionably great stability as regards very small
                    displacements. These objections make the use of rolling seismometers
                    unadvisable, except perhaps for the rough measurement of violent
                    earthquakes.</p>
                <p>The seismographs which have been described draw a horizontal plan of the path
                    pursued during an earthquake by a point on the earth’s surface. They take no
                    note of the relation of the displacement to time,—an element which is required
                    if we are to form any estimate of the violence of an earthquake from the record.
                    With this view a different method of registration is also followed. The whole
                    movement is resolved into rectilinear components, and these are separately
                    recorded (by single-freedom seismometers) on a plate or drum which is kept in
                    continuous movement, so that the record of each component takes the form of an
                    undulating line, from which the number, succession, amplitude, velocity, and
                    acceleration of the component movements can be deduced and the resultant motion
                    determined. A single steady mass with two degrees of freedom may still be
                    employed to record, separately, two components of horizontal motion; but it is
                    generally preferable to provide two distinct masses, each with one degree of
                    freedom. The principal instrument of this class is the horizontal pendulum
                    seismograph,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ewing, “On
                    a New Seismograph,” in <hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc.,</hi> No. 210, 1881, or

                    which has been used to record Japanese earthquakes since 1880. It consists of
                    two horizontal pendulums, set at right angles to each other, each supplying a
                    steady point with respect to horizontal motions transverse to its own length.
                    Each pendulum is pivoted about two points, on an axis which is nearly vertical,
                    but inclined slightly forwards to give a suitable degree of stability. In some
                    forms of the instrument the pivoted frame of the pendulum is light, and the
                    inertia is practically all furnished by a second piece or bob pivoted on the
                    frame about a vertical axis through the centre of percussion of the frame. This
                    construction has the advantage of compactness and of making the position of the
                    steady point at once determinate. But a simpler construction is to attach the
                    bob rigidly to the frame. This shifts the steady point a little way outwards
                    from the position it would have if the bob were pivoted. In either construction
                    a prolongation of the pendulum beyond the bob forms a convenient multiplying
                    index. Fig.</p>
                <p>5 shows a complete horizontal pendulum seismograph (with pivoted bobs). Two
                    rectangular components of earthquake motion are recorded radially on a revolving
                    plate of smoked glass, which receives its motion through a friction roller from
                    a clock furnished with a fluid-friction centrifugal governor. The clock may
                    either be kept going continuously, in expectation of an earthquake at any
                    moment, or be started into motion by an electric seismoscope when the earliest
                    indications of an earthquake are felt. The former plan is practicable only when
                    the instrument can receive careful attendance and where earthquakes occur often.
                    It has the drawback that the circle which is drawn by each pointer as the plate
                    revolves below it gradually broadens, partly because of warping anil temperature
                    changes in the supports and partly because of actual tilting of the ground. As
                    an earthquake generally begins with comparatively insignificant movements, there
                    is not much to object to in having the plate at rest to begin with, provided a
                    sufficiently sensitive starting seismoscope be used. A suitable arrangement for
                    this purpose is one due to Palmieri: a short pendulum hangs over a cup of
                    mercury, in the centre of which a depression is formed by an iron pin, whose top
                    is a little lower than the surface of the mercury. The pendulum ends in a
                    platinum point, which stands clear in the centre of this depression, but touches
                    the edge whenever a horizontal movement of the ground takes place, thereby
                    closing the circuit of an electro-magnet, which starts the clock. In the most
                    recent form of the horizontal pendulum seismograph the bobs are fixed to the
                    pivoted frames, and the pointers are arranged to trace their records side by
                    side. Records with instruments of this class, besides giving much additional
                    information, agree with those of the duplex pendulum in show ing that earthquake
                    motion is a tangle of waves in all azi muths. This will be seen by reference to
                    fig. 6, which shows a small portion of an earthquake re gistered by a pair of
                    horizontal pendu lums. Contemporary parts of the two records are shown together,
                    the straight radial lines marking seconds of time. The phases of the two
                    components are con tinually changing, and when the two are compounded the result
                    is a path having the same characteristics as those of the diagram in fig. 3.
                    Fig. 7</p>
                <p>gives the result of compounding the records of fig. 6 during three seconds, while
                    the range of move ment was a maximum.</p>
                <p>To register the vertical com ponent of earthquake motions we require to suspend a
                    mass with vertical freedom. Most ways of doing this give too much stability, as,
                    for instance, when a weight is hung from a spiral spring or carried by a
                    horizontal bar that is fixed to a wall or table by a flexible spring joint. This
                    last is the vertical motion seis mometer which was used by the British
                    Association Committee at Comrie in 1842.</p>
                <p>Another form, mechanically equivalent to this, is a weighted horizontal bar,
                    pivoted on a fixed horizontal fulcrum, and held up by a spiral spring, stretched
                    from a point near the fulcrum to a fixed support above.</p>
                <p>This mode of suspension is still too stable, though less so than if the spring
                    were directly loaded. To make it nearly a-</p>

                    opposite effect occurs. This plan is open to the objection that the mercury is
                    disturbed by horizontal movements of the ground. A simpler plan is shown in fig.

                    so that the moment of the pull of the spring remains sensibly equal to the
                    moment of the weight,—the condition necessary to make the bar astatic. This is
                    secured when v= <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi

                    Stability is given by making <hi rend="italic">v</hi> somewhat less than this. A
                    vertical-motion seismograph, constructed on the principle which fig. 8
                    illustrates diagrammatically, is arranged to trace its record on a revolving
                    glass plate. This, along with a pair of horizontal pendulums recording on the
                    same plate, completes a three-component seismograph.</p>
                <p>An interesting mode of suspension, by which a mass is hung in neutral or nearly
                    neutral equilibrium, with one degree of horizontal freedom, is shown in fig. 9.
                    It is based on the approximate straight line linkwork of Tchebicheff. When a bar
                    is hung from fixed supports by crossed ties, at a distance below the supports
                    equal to the distance between the supports, the length of the bar being equal to
                    half that distance, its middle point moves in very nearly a straight line. By
                    fixing a weight at the centre of the bar and adding a suitable recording
                    apparatus, we have a very frictionless form of one-component horizontal
                    seismometer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ewing, “On
                    certain Methods of Astatic Suspension,” in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Seis. Sοc.
                    Jaρ.,</hi> vol. vi. p. 25.</p></note> When a displacement of the ground occurs
                    in the line of the bar, the bar is tilted through an angle which is proportional
                    to the linear displacement, and the centre of the bar consequently shares, in a
                    small and definite proportion, the motion of the ground,—a fact which is to be
                    borne in mind in estimating the degree of multiplication given by the recording
                    apparatus.</p>
                <p>The instruments which have been described afford complete and satisfactory means
                    of determining the motion which a point of the ground undergoes during any
                    disturbance which would be recognized as an earthquake. For minute
                    earth-tremors, however, a larger multiplication is necessary, and the absence of
                    friction is of even more importance than in the measurement of earthquakes
                    proper. Optical methods of magnifying the motion are accordingly resorted to. In
                    the “normal tromometer” of Bertelli, used in Italy to detect earth-tremors, the
                    bob of a pendulum, suspended by a fine wire from a fixed support, is viewed
                    through a reflecting prism and its motion in any azimuth measured by a
                    micrometer microscope. The great stability of the pendulum, which is only 1½
                    metres long, prevents it from behaving as a steady-point seismometer; and, if
                    successive earth-movements were by chance to occur with a period equal or nearly
                    equal to its own free period, its acquired swing would altogether mask the
                    legitimate indications. This kind of action has, in fact, been turned to account
                    as a means of detecting very minute earth - tremors by Rossi, who has devised a
                    micro-seismoscope, consisting of a number of pendulums of various lengths, one
                    or other of which is likely to be set swinging when the ground shakes to and fro
                    repeatedly, through even the minutest range. To <hi rend="italic">measure</hi>
                    tremors, however, the instruments of Bertelli and Rossi are inappropriate; for
                    that purpose, just as for the purpose of measuring larger motions, the suspended
                    mass must be in nearly neutral equilibrium. To find a mode of suspension which
                    is at once astatic and extremely frictionless is a matter of some difficulty;
                    the crossed - link suspension, which has been already described, is probably the
                    most satisfactory means hitherto suggested. It has been adopted in the
                    microseismometer sketched in section in fig. 10. Two bobs are separately
                    suspended, in the manner shown by fig. 9, at right angles to each other, one
                    above the other, in a cast-iron case. A microscope, fixed to the top of the case
                    and furnished with a micrometer eye-piece, is focused on a hair, which is
                    stretched transversely across a vertical tube in the upper bob <hi rend="italic"
                    >a.</hi> This serves to measure horizontal motion in the plane of the drawing.
                    Motion at right angles to this is shown by the lower bob <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> (drawn in section), which carries a similar transverse hair. A fixed
                    lens <hi rend="italic">b</hi> between the bobs gives an image of the lower hair
                    in the plane of the upper hair, so that both appear crossed in the field of the
                    microscope, thereby allowing both components of horizontal motion to be observed
                    together.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Equilibrium Method.—</hi> In observing slow earth-tiltings an
                    entirely different process is followed. The problem then is, not to measure
                    displacements by aid of the inertia of a body which tends to preserve its
                    original position, but to compare the direction of a line or plane fixed to the
                    earth with the direction of the vertical. The earliest observations of
                    earth-tiltings were made by the aid of spirit-levels. If a level be set on a
                    table fixed to the rock, its bubble, watched through a microscope, will be seen
                    to move slowly now to one side and now to another. The movements are so slow
                    that the inertia of the fluid is unimportant. Observations with pairs of levels,
                    set at right angles to each other, have been carried on systematically for some
                    years by M. P. Plantamour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    vertical was initiated in 1868 by M. A. d'Abbadie,<note anchored="true"

                    Light from a fixed source is made to fall on a reflecting basin of mercury about
                    10 metres below it. Above the basin is a large lens of long focus, which brings
                    the rays into parallelism during their passage to the mercury, and causes them
                    to converge after reflexion, so that an image of the source is formed at a
                    convenient distance from it, and in the same horizontal plane. The interval
                    between the source and the image is measured (in amount and azimuth) at least
                    twice a day by a micrometer microscope. The accuracy of the method depends on
                    the fixity of the source of light relatively to the lens and to the surface of
                    the ground, and to secure this M. d’Abbadie built a massive hollow cone of
                    concrete for the support of his apparatus. His observations have shown that the
                    earth’s surface undergoes almost incessant slow tilting through angles which, in
                    the course of a year, have been found to range over four seconds. He has also
                    noticed the occurrence of earth-tremors by the occasional blurring of the image
                    through agitation of the mercury. An improvement on his apparatus suggested by
                    M. Wolf<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Comptes Rendus,</hi> xcvii. p. 228.</p></note> is shown in fig.
                    11.</p>
                <p>The light, instead of being all reflected from the free surface of mercury (<hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>), is partly reflected from that and partly from a plane
                    mirror (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) fixed to the rock. Two images are therefore
                    formed, whose relative position measures the tilting of the surface. The
                    advantage of this is that the position of the source of light need no longer be
                    fixed, and the accuracy of the method depends only on the fixity of the mirror
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> with respect to the rock.</p>
                <p>Further, to avoid having the source and image at a great height above the
                    surface,</p>
                <p>M. Wolf allows the light to reach and leave the apparatus horizontally, in the
                    manner indicated in the sketch, by using a plane mirror inclined at 45° to the
                    horizon. Still another mode of investigating slow changes of the vertical was
                    followed (at the suggestion of Sir William Thomson) by Messrs G. H. and H.
                    Darwin, in observations made by them with the view of measuring the lunar
                    disturbance of gravity. The <hi rend="italic">Reports</hi> of the British
                    Association for 1881 and 1882 contain a full account of their apparatus, as well
                    as notices of the work of other observers and a discussion of the cause of
                    earth-tiltings. Their instrument was a short pendulum hung in a viscous fluid,
                    from a fixed support, by two wires arranged V-wise to leave the pendulum only
                    one degree of freedom. Below the bob was a small mirror hung by two threads, one
                    of which was attached to the pendulum bob and the other to a fixed support. The
                    pendulum was free to swing at right angles to the plane of the threads, and any
                    movement of this kind caused the mirror to rotate through an angle which was
                    measured in the usual way by a telescope and scale. The method is susceptible of
                    very great delicacy, but Messrs Darwin found that when the instrument was
                    adjusted to be specially sensitive its manipulation became extremely difficult.
                    Wolfs modification of D’Abbadie’s method appears to furnish, on the whole, the
                    most promising apparatus for measurements of this type. The apparatus
                    represented in fig. 10 is also applicable. The method of measurement employed in
                    the case of slow tiltings may be called the equilibrium method in
                    contradistinction to the inertia method, which is used to measure comparatively
                    sudden displacements. The<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0655-0630"/> two methods are applicable to two widely
                    different classes of movements. It is at least possible that between these
                    classes there may be other modes of motion,—displacements which are too slow for
                    the inertia method, and which give rise to too little change of slope for the
                    equilibrium method. How to measure them is, and must apparently remain, an
                    unsolved problem in seismometry.</p>
