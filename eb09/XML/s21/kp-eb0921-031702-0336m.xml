                <p><label type="entry">SÁTÁRA, or SATTARAH</label>, a British district in the
                    central division of the Bombay presidency, India, between 16° 50' and 18° 10' N.
                    lat. and 73° 45' and 75° E. long. It has an area of 4988 square miles, and is
                    bounded on the north by the river Nira and the states of Bhor and Phaltan, on
                    the east by Sholapur district, on the south by the Varna river separating it
                    from Kolhapur and Sangli states, and on the west by the Sahyádri mountains,
                    which separate it from the Concan districts of Kolabá and Ratnágiri. The Sátára
                    district contains two main systems of hills, the Sahyádri range and its
                    offshoots, and the Mahádeo range and its offshoots; the former runs through the
                    district from north to south, and the Mahádeo range starts about 10 miles north
                    of Mahabáleshwar and stretches east and south-east across the whole breadth of
                    the district. The Mahádeo Hills are bold and abrupt, presenting in many cases
                    bare scarps of black rock and looking at a distance like so many hill
                    fortresses. Within the limits of Sátára are two river systems—the Bhima system
                    in a small part of the north and north-east, and the Kistna system throughout
                    the rest of the district. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Kistna.)</hi> The hill
                    forests have a large store of timber and firewood. The whole of Sátára falls
                    within the Deccan trap area; the hills consist of trap intersected by strata of
                    basalt and topped with laterite, while, of the different soils on the plains,
                    the commonest is the black loamy clay containing carbonate of lime. This is a
                    very fertile soil, and when well watered is capable of yielding heavy crops.
                    Sátára district contains some important irrigation works,— including the Kistna
                    Canal, open for 35 miles. In some of the western parts of the district the
                    average annual rainfall exceeds 200 inches; but on the eastern side water is
                    scanty, the rainfall varying from 40 inches in Sátára town to less than 12
                    inches in some places farther east. There is no railway, but the West Deccan
                    Railway, which is in course of construction, will put the district into
                    communication with Poona and Belgaum, and will run through Sátára for about 100
                    miles. The tiger, panther, bear, and sambhar deer are found in the west near the
                    Sahyádris, and the hyaena, wolf, leopard, and smaller game in the east.</p>
                <p>According to the last census returns (1881) the population of Sátára district was
                    1,062,350 (532,525 males and 529,825 females). Hindus numbered 1,008,918,
                    Mohammedans 36,712, and Christians</p>
                <p>886. Four towns had more than 10,000 inhabitants,—Satara (see below), Wai 11,676,
                    Karad 10,778, Tasgaon 10,206. About two-thirds of the Hindus consist of Kunbis
                    and Mahrattas, who during the period of Mahratta ascendency furnished the bulk
                    of the armies; and the Mávlás, who formed Shiváji’s best soldiers, were drawn
                    from the hill tribes of Sátára district. Agriculture supports more than
                    three-fourths of the people; the soil is fertile, and joar forms the staple
                    food; rice is grown in the western valleys, and in the south and east cotton is
                    raised. In 1882-83, of 1,384,255 acres held for tillage, 270,244 were fallow or
                    under grass, while of the remaining 1,114,011 acres 39,757 were twice cropped;
                    cereals, consisting chiefly of joar and bajra, occupied 898,206 acres, pulses
                    159,211 acres, oil-seeds 42,001 acres, and miscellaneous crops the remainder.
                    Besides blankets and coarse cotton cloth the chief exports are grain, tobacco,
                    oil-seeds, chillies, molasses, and a little raw cotton; the imports are
                    piece-goods, hardware, salt, and dates. The gross revenue of the district in
                    1883-84 amounted to £268,779, of which the land contributed £228,749.</p>
                <p>O11 the overthrow of the Jadhav dynasty in 1312 the district passed to the
                    Mohammedan power, which was consolidated in the reign of the Bahmani kings. On
                    the fall of the Bahmanis towards the end of the 15th century each chief set up
                    for himself until the Bijapur kings finally asserted themselves, and under these
                    kings the Mahrattas arose, and laid the foundation of an independent kingdom
                    with Sátára as its capital. Intrigues and dissensions in the palace led to the
                    ascendency of the peshwas, who removed the capital to Poona in 1749, and
                    degraded the raja of Satara into the position of a political prisoner. The war
                    of 1817 closed the career of the peshwas, and the British then restored the
                    titular raja, and assigned to him the principality of Satara. In consequence of
                    political intrigues, he was deposed in 1839, and his brother was placed on the
                    throne. This prince dying without male heirs, the state was resumed by the
                    British Government.</p>
