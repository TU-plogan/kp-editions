                    tended by Peter Gerard, rector of the Amalfi hospital of St John, and the more
                    wealthy of the crusaders eagerly followed the example of their leader in
                    endowing so useful and so practical an institution. Many of the Christian
                    warriors sought permission to join the ranks of the fraternity. At the proposal
                    of Gerard a regularly constituted religious body was formed; the patriarch of
                    Jerusalem invested every approved candidate with a black robe bearing on the
                    breast an eight-pointed white cross and received in return a vow of poverty,
                    obedience, and chastity. In 1113 Pope Paschal II. formally sanctioned the
                    establishment of the order by a bull. Five years later Gerard was succeeded by
                    Raymond du Puy, and under his auspices the monastic knights took a fresh oath to
                    become militant defenders of the cause of the Cross. During the first century of
                    its existence the fraternity thus acquired a religious, republican, military,
                    and aristocratic character. The rules introduced by Raymond du Puy became the
                    basis of all subsequent regulations; the leading members of the hospital or
                    master’s assistants were formed into an all-powerful council, which divided the
                    order into knights of justice, chaplains, and serving brethren. There was also
                    an affiliation of religious ladies <hi rend="italic">(dames')</hi> and of <hi
                        rend="italic">donats</hi> or honorary members. The income of the body
                    corporate was derived from landed property in all parts of Europe. To facilitate
                    the collection of rents, commanderies (first called preceptories) were formed.
                    These gradually acquired the character of branch establishments where candidates
                    were received and the same observances practised as in the parent convent.
                    Raymond du Puy twice repulsed the advancing Turks; and Hugh de Payens, fired by
                    the successes of the Hospitallers, founded the sister order of the Temple. In
                    1160 Raymond du Puy died. The rule of his immediate successors was uneventful;
                    Gilbert d’Ascali greatly weakened the influence of the order by joining (1168)
                    in an ill-fated expedition to Egypt. Roger Desmoulins, the eighth master, was
                    killed fighting against Saladin before Jerusalem, while his successor, Gamier de
                    Napoli, died of the wounds he received in the decisive battle of Tiberias, which
                    led to the surrender of Jerusalem to the Moslems in 1187. The seat of the order
                    was now transferred to Margat, a town which still remained in the possession of
                    the Christians, and it becomes difficult to trace the frequent changes of the
                    mastership. The dangerous enmity which arose between the Hospitallers and the
                    Templars necessitated the energetic intervention of the pope. In 1216 Andrew,
                    king of Hungary, was received into the order. The brief occupations of Jerusalem
                    by the emperor Frederick II. (1228) and by Richard of Cornwall (1234) had little
                    appreciable effect on the waning fortunes of the Hospitallers. A savage horde
                    from the borders of the Caspian advanced against the Christians, and in the
                    final struggle with the Chorasmians the masters of both orders—united before the
                    common enemy—fell with nearly the whole of their followers (1244). William de
                    Chateauneuf, elected to the mastership by the few survivors, repaired to Acre
                    only to take part in the fruitless crusade of Louis of France. The truce between
                    the rival orders was doomed to be of short duration. In 1259 their armies met in
                    a general engagement, and victory rested with the Hospitallers. A brief period
                    of success in 1281 was powerless to avert the fall of Margat, and in 1289 Acre
                    alone remained in the hands of the Christians. John de Villiers, a man of
                    singular ability, became at this critical juncture master of the order. An
                    overwhelming force was sent from Egypt to besiege Acre, which only fell after a
                    desperate resistance. Under cover of the arrows of their archers the knights
                    sailed for Cyprus (1291). Repeated acts of prowess by sea still served to remind
                    the Moslem corsairs of the survival of their implacable foes. De Villiers died
                    three years later and was succeeded by Odon de Pins, who tried ineffectually to
                    restore the purely conventual character of the order. William de Villaret
                    (elected in 1300) shared the dangers of an expedition to Palestine and prepared
                    for the conquest of Rhodes, which was effected in 1310 by his brother and
                    successor. The revenues of the Hospitallers were now augmented from the
                    confiscated estates of their old rivals the Templars. Fulk de Villaret was
                    attacked at Rhodes by Osman, ruler of Bitliynia, but with the assistance of
                    Amadeus of Savoy he defeated the invaders. A serious difference which arose
                    between De Villaret and his subordinate knights enabled Pope John XXII. to
                    appoint his nominee John de Villanova (1319). It was at this period that the
                    order was divided into the seven <hi rend="italic">langues</hi> of France,
                    Provence, Auvergne, Italy, Germany, England, and Aragon. In 1346 De Gozon became
                    grand-master. His administration and that of his immediate successors are only
                    remarkable for a perpetual struggle for supremacy with the papal court. In 1365
                    Raymond Beranger captured Alexandria in concert with the king of Cyprus, but the
                    victors contented themselves with burning the city. Philibert de Naillac had no
                    sooner been elected grand-master than he was summoned to join the European
                    crusade against the sultan Bajazet, and took part in the disastrous battle of
                    Nicopolis. The Greek emperor unfortunately invoked the aid of Timur, who
                    overthrew Bajazet, but followed up his success by an attack on Smyrna, the
                    defence of which had been entrusted to the knights. Smyrna was taken and its
                    brave garrison put to the sword. In 1440 and 1444 De Lastic defeated two
                    expeditions sent against him from Egypt. Nine years later Constantinople fell at
                    last into the hands of the Turks. It was evident to the knights that an attack
                    on their sanctuary would follow the triumph of Islam, but it was not till 1480
                    that the long-dreaded descent on Rhodes took place. Fortunately for the order,
                    Peter d’Aubusson was grand-master, and the skilfully planned attack of the three
                    renegades was valorously repulsed. The heroic D’Aubusson recovered from his
                    wounds, restored the shattered fortifications, and survived till 1503. Nearly
                    twenty years passed away before the sultan Solyman determined to crush the
                    knights, who had just elected L’Isle d’Adam as their chief. After a glorious
                    resistance, D’Adam capitulated and withdrew with all the honours of war to
                    Candia (Crete). Charles V., when the news of the disaster reached him,
                    exclaimed, “Nothing in the world has been so well lost as Rhodes,” and five
                    years later (1530), with the approval of the pope, ceded the island of Malta and
                    the fortress of Tripoli in Africa to the homeless knights. Peter Dupont
                    succeeded D’Adam in 1534, and in the following year took a prominent part in the
                    emperor’s famous expedition against Tunis. The position in Tripoli was from the
                    first precarious, and it was surrendered to the corsair Dragut in 1551. In 1557
                    John La Valette was chosen grand-master. The construction of fresh
                    fortifications was hastened and every precaution taken against a surprise. On
                    the 18th May 1565 the Turkish fleet under the redoubtable Dragut appeared in
                    sight and one of the most celebrated sieges in history began. It was finally
                    raised on the 8th (September after the death of Dragut and 25,000 of his
                    followers. The city of Valetta afterwards rose on the scene of this desperate
                    struggle. La Valette died in 1568, and no events of importance mark the
                    grand-masterships of De Monte (1568), De la Cassiere (1572), and Verdala (1581).
                    During their terms<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n192/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0192-0175"/> of office the cathedral, the <hi
                        rend="italic">auberges,</hi> the hospital, and many remarkable edifices were
                    built. Another city gradually arose on the opposite shores of the grand harbour,
                    and the once barren island became almost imperceptibly the site of one of the
                    strongest fortresses and most flourishing commercial communities in the
                    Mediterranean. Verdala was succeeded by Martin Garces (1595), but it was
                    reserved for Alof de Vignacourt to revive for a time the military reputation of
                    the order. Vasconcellos, De Paula, and Lascaris were all aged men when, one
                    after another, they were called to the supreme power, and their election (with a
                    view to secure frequent vacancies) contributed to weaken the vitality of the
                    fraternity. Lascaris lived till the age of ninety-seven, built the
                    fortifications of Floriana, endowed Valetta with a public library, and resisted
                    the growing encroachments of the Jesuits. Martin de Redin and Raphael Cottoner
                    ruled each for three years. Nicholas Cottoner was elected in 1663, and the
                    knights of St John once again distinguished themselves in the siege of Candia.
                    The losses which the order sustained in the repulse of the allies before
                    Negropont (1689) was the indirect cause of the death of Caraffa, who was
                    succeeded by Adrian de Vignacourt (1690), Raymond Perellos (1697), Zondodari
                    (1720), De Vilhena (1722), Despuig (1736), and Pinto (1741). Emmanuel Pinto was
                    a man of no mean ability and of considerable force of character. He steadily
                    resisted all papal encroachments on his authority, expelled the Jesuits from
                    Malta, and declined to hold a chapter-general. After the brief rule of Francis
                    Ximines, Emmanuel de Rohan became grand-master (1775). He assembled a
                    chapter-general, erected the Anglo-Bavarian <hi rend="italic">langue,</hi> and
                    sent his galleys to relieve the sufferers from the great earthquake in Sicily.
                    The order never perhaps seemed to all outward appearances more prosperous than
                    when the storm of the French Revolution broke suddenly upon it. In 1792 the
                    Directory decreed the abolition of the order in France and the forfeiture of its
                    possessions. Five years afterwards De Rohan died. He had taken no pains to
                    conceal his sympathy for the losing cause in France and his court had become an
                    asylum and home for many French refugees. His successor Ferdinand Hompesch was
                    perhaps the weakest man ever elected to fill a responsible position in critical
                    times. On the 12th April 1798 the French Government resolved on the forcible
                    seizure of Malta. Warnings were sent to the grand-master in vain. Within two
                    months from that date the island was in the hands of Bonaparte, and Hompesch was
                    permitted to retire to Trieste with some of the most cherished relics of the
                    order.</p>
                <p>Subsequent to the departure of Hompesch a number of the knights who had taken
                    refuge at St Petersburg elected the emperor Paul grand-master. Notwithstanding
                    the patent illegality of the proceeding the proffered honour was eagerly
                    accepted and duly announced to all the courts of Europe (October 1798). Hompesch
                    was induced to resign in the following year. On the death of Paul an arrangement
                    was arrived at which vested the actual nomination in the pope. From 1805 to 1879
                    only lieutenants of the order were appointed, who resided first at Catania, then
                    at Ferrara, and finally at Rome. In 1879 Leo XIII. made Giovanni Battista Ceschi
                    grandmaster, and he actually rules over portions of the Italian and German <hi
                        rend="italic">langues</hi> and some other scattered groups of the ancient
                    fraternity.</p>
                <p>Two other associations also trace their origin from the same parent stock—the
                    Brandenburg branch and the English <hi rend="italic">langue.</hi> The former can
                    claim an unbroken existence since its establishment in 1160. In 1853 the king of
                    Prussia (in whom the right of nomination had been vested since 1812) restored
                    the original bailiwick of Brandenburg and the assembled commanders elected
                    Prince Charles of Prussia <hi rend="italic">Herrn Meister,</hi> who notified his
                    election to the lieutenant of the grand-master at Rome. The “Johanniter” did
                    good service in the German campaigns of 1866 and 1870. As regards the English
                        <hi rend="italic">langue,</hi> 1 Elizabeth c. 24 annexed to the crown all
                    the property of the order in England. After the restoration of the Bourbons the
                    French knights met once more in chapter-general and elected a permanent
                    capitular commission, which was officially recognized by both Louis XVIII. and
                    the pope. After certain negotiations, the three French <hi rend="italic"
                        >langues,</hi> acting in accord with those of Aragon and Castile, agreed to
                    the resuscitation of the dormant <hi rend="italic">langue</hi> of England
                    (1827-1831), and Sir Robert Peat was appointed lord prior, taking the customary
                    oath <hi rend="italic">de fideli administratione</hi> in the Court of King’s
                    Bench. During the past half century the good work done by the modern knights—now
                    (1886) once more located in St John’s Gate, Clerkenwell—can honourably compare
                    with the memorable deeds of their predecessors. The establishment of the hospice
                    at Jerusalem is due to the energy and zeal of Sir Edmund Lechmere, who has been
                    mainly instrumental in collecting at St John’s Gate the unrivalled historical
                    literature of which the order can boast.</p>
                <p>There are few subjects of study which present so rich and so varied materials as
                    the annals of the knights of St John. The archives still preserved in Malta are
                    almost unique in their value and completeness, and each grand-master patronized
                    and encouraged the industrious historiographers who sought to perpetuate the
                    fame of the order to which they belonged. The work of Giacomo Bosio is an
                    elaborate and generally trustworthy record of events from the time of Gerard
                    down to the year 1571. Bartolomeo del Pozzo treats with equal care the period
                    between 1571 and 1636. Editions of these volumes were published in Rome, Naples,
                    Verona, and Venice. The Abbé Vertot concludes his elaborate history with the
                    year 1726. His book enjoyed a considerable popularity, was published in English
                    with the original plates in 1728, but can hardly claim the confidence to which
                    Bosio and Del Pozzo are both entitled. Prom the 16th century down to the
                    appearance of the famous <hi rend="italic">Codice</hi> of De Rohan (1782) we
                    have a series of publications on the subject of the statutes of the order. A
                    fresh compilation seems generally to have followed each assembly of the
                    chapter-general. Before the time of De Rohan the best-known edition was that of
                    Borgofante (1676), but Bosio produced a translation from the Latin in 1589 when
                    residing at Rome as agent of the grand-master, and another was printed at the
                    press of the order in Malta in 1718. The <hi rend="italic">Mcmorie de’ Gran
                        Maestri</hi> by Bodoni (Parma, 1780) may also be consulted with advantage.
                    For information concerning the archaeology of the order and the antiquities of
                    Malta itself reference should be made to Abela and Ciantar’s <hi rend="italic"

                    earlier part of the information he professes to give. In English the most
