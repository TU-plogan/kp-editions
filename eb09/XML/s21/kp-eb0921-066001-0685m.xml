                    and the Ba-khoy or White River. The Ba-fing, which has a width at the confluence
                    of 1475 feet, descends from the highlands of Futa-Jallon by a northward course
                    of about 350 miles, during which it passes by a series of rapids from the
                    altitude of 2460 feet, at which it takes its rise, to that of 360 feet, and
                    receives from the right the Nunkolo and the Funkumah (with its tributary the
                    Boki). The Ba-khoy, 800 feet wide at the confluence, has been previously flowing
                    from east to west and gives that general direction to the Senegal, but its
                    source is away in the south-east behind the country of Buré. That of its
                    principal tributary, the Ba-ule (Red River), is more to the east and lies within
                    a few miles of the course of the Niger in the Mandingo plateau. Below Bafulabé
                    the Senegal, flowing north-west, passes a succession of falls—those of Guina
                    (160 feet) and of Felu (50 or 60)—and arrives at Médine, after having
                    accomplished 440 of its total course of 1000 miles. It receives only two
                    important affluents,—from the right the “marigot” of Kulu, which comes from
                    Kuniakhary, draining the slopes of the Kaarta plateau, and from the left the
                    Falemé, which rises in the Futa-Jallon between Labé and Timbo and flows
                    north-west in a permanent stream. Below Médine the Senegal presents a series of
                    great reaches, which become more and more navigable as they approach the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>From the 1st of August to the 1st of October it is open as far as Médine to
                    vessels not drawing more than 8 feet. Between Médine and Bakel (85 miles) there
                    are twenty-seven “narrows,” of which several, such as that at Kayes, are
                    difficult; it is on this account that a railway has been projected between Kayes
                    and the Niger. At Bakel below the confluence of the Falemé the river is
                    navigable till the 1st of December, from Bakel to Saldé between the 15th of July
                    and the 15th of December, and lastly from Mafu to the sea for a distance of 215
                    miles it is navigable all the year round. Outside the limits indicated
                    navigation between Mafu and Médine is often precarious even for barges drawing
                    little over a foot, and above Médine, though some reaches are deep enough,
                    troublesome transhipments are necessary between reach and reach. Between Mafu
                    and Saldé the Senegal changes its direction from north-west to west, and shortly
                    before reaching the sea to south-west. The bar at the mouth can usually be
                    crossed by vessels not drawing more than 10 feet, or at high tides a little
                    more. Below Bakel the river becomes tortuous and encloses the great island of
                    Morfil, 110 miles long, and a series of other islands, of which one is occupied
                    by St Louis. At this point the right branch of the river is only 500 feet from
                    the sea, but the dunes along the coast turn it south for other 9 miles. The
                    scantiness of its sources, the steepness of its upper course, and the rapid
                    evaporation which takes place after the short rainy season would soon dry up the
                    river-system of the Senegal, especially in the upper regions; but natural dams
                    cross the channel at intervals and the water accumulates behind them in deep
                    reaches, which thus act as reservoirs. In the rainy season the barriers are
                    submerged in succession, beginning with the farthest up, the reaches are filled,
                    and the plains of the lower Senegal are changed into immense marshes. Like Lake
                    Moeris in antiquity on the Nile and the lake of Cambodia at the present time on
                    the Me-kong, Lake Cayor on the right side of the lower Senegal and Lake Panieful
                    on the left constitute reserve basins, receiving the surplus waters of the river
                    during flood and restoring them in the dry season. For months together the
                    latter forms the only drinking pond for the wild beasts of the surrounding
                    country,—lions, elephants, leopards, panthers, ounces, cheetahs, hyaenas,
                    lynxes, giraffes, antelopes, gazelles, monkeys, jackals visiting it in crowds.
                    In the upper part of the river the reservoirs are successively emptied to the
                    level of the dams and receive no more water except from the permanent springs;
                    but they are partially protected by curtains of verdure from the effects of the
                    evaporation which makes itself so severely felt on the treeless seaboard. Owing
                    to these natural “locks,” similar to those of an artificial canal, the Senegal
                    river never discharges less than 1700 or 1800 cubic feet per second. The lower
                    Senegal forms the boundary between the dry and barren Sahara and the rich and
                    productive region of the western Sudan; the line of its inundations is an
                    ethnographic march between the nomadic Moor and the settled Negro.</p>
