                    representatives of Protestant mysticism in the 16th century, was born in 1490.
                    He was of noble descent, and acquired at Cologne and other universities an
                    education greatly superior to that possessed by most noblemen of his time. After
                    leaving the university he served in various minor courts of Silesia, finally
                    entering the service of the duke of Liegnitz, over whom his influence was great.
                    Though he was educated as a strict Catholic, the writings of Tauler and Luther
                    produced a profound impression upon him, so that in 1522 he visited Wittenberg,
                    where he made the acquaintance of Carlstadt and Thomas Münzer, spirits destined
                    to be more congenial to him than Luther himself. On his return to Liegnitz he
                    joined in an active propagation of the principles of the Reformation in the
                    principality and in Silesia. But very early Schwenkfeld uttered warnings against
                    the abuse of the doctrine of justification by faith. The Protestant controversy
                    as to the Eucharist (1524) revealed his disagreement with Luther on that
                    critical point. He sought to establish a <hi rend="italic">via media</hi>
                    between the doctrines of Luther and Zwingli, and vainly hoped to obtain for it
                    Luther’s acceptance. He as vainly sought to secure Luther’s adoption of a strict
                    rule of church discipline, after the manner of the Moravian Brethren. Meanwhile
                    the Anabaptists obtained a footing in Silesia, and suspicions of Schwenkfeld’s
                    sympathy with them were aroused. Letters and writings of his own (1527-28)
                    proved him to hold strongly anti-Lutheran heresies, and both Catholics and
                    Lutherans urged the duke of Liegnitz to dismiss him. He voluntarily left
                    Liegnitz in 1529, and took up his abode at Strasburg for five years amongst the
                    numerous Reformed clergy there. In 1533, in an important synod, he defended
                    against Bucer the principles of religious freedom as well as his own doctrine
                    and life. But the heads of the church carried the day, and, in consequence of
                    the more stringent measures adopted against dissenters, Schwenkfeld left
                    Strasburg for a time. While residing in various cities of south Germany he kept
                    up a wide correspondence with the nobility particularly, and in Würtemberg
                    propagated his views personally at their courts. In 1535 a sort of compromise
                    was brought about between himself and the Reformers, he promising not to disturb
                    the peace of the church and they not to treat him as a disturber. The compromise
                    was of only short duration. His theology took a more distinctly heterodox form,
                    and the publication (1539) of a book in proof of his most characteristic
                    doctrine—the deification of the humanity of Christ —led to the active
                    persecution of him by the Lutherans and his expulsion from the city of Ulm. The
                    next year (1540) he published a refutation of the attacks upon his doctrine with
                    a more elaborate exposition of it, under the title <hi rend="italic">Grosse
                    Confession.</hi> His book was very inconvenient to the Protestants, as it served
                    to emphasize the differences between the Lutherans and Zwinglians as regarded
                    the Eucharist at a moment when efforts were being made to reconcile them. An
                    anathema was accordingly issued from Schmalkald against Schwenkfeld (together
                    with Sebastian Franck); his books were placed on the Protestant “index”; and he
                    himself was made a religious outlaw. From that time he was hunted from place to
                    place, though his wide connexions with the nobility and the esteem in which he
                    was held by numerous followers and friends provided for him secure hiding-places
                    and for his books a large circulation. An attempt in 1543 to approach Luther
                    only increased the Reformer’s hostility and rendered Schwenkfeld’s situation
                    still more precarious. He and his followers withdrew from the Lutheran Church,
                    declined its sacraments, and formed small societies of kindred views. He and
                    they were frequently condemned by Protestant ecclesiastical and political
                    authorities, especially by the Government of Würtemberg. His personal safety was
                    thereby more and more imperilled, and he was unable to stay in any place for
                    more than a short time. At last, in his seventy-second year, he died at Ulm, on
                    10th December 1561, surrounded by attached friends and declaring undiminished
                    faith in his views.</p>
                <p>Schwenkfeld left behind him a sect (who were called subsequently by others
                    Schwenkfeldians, but who called themselves " Confessors of the Glory of Christ
                    ”) and numerous writings to perpetuate his ideas. His writings were partially
                    collected in four folio volumes, the first of which was published in the year
                    1564, containing his principal theological works. Erbkam states that his
                    unprinted writings would make more than another four folios. His adherents were
                    to be found at his death scattered throughout Germany. In Silesia they formed a
                    distinct sect, which has lasted until our own times. In the 17th century they
                    were associated with the followers of Jacob Böhme, and were undisturbed until
                    1708, when an inquiry was made as to their doctrines. In 1720 a commission of
                    Jesuits was despatched to Silesia to convert them by force. Most of them fled
                    from Silesia into Saxony, and thence to Holland, England, and North America.
                    Frederick the Great of Prussia, when he seized Silesia, extended his protection
                    to those who remained in that province. Those who had fled to Philadelphia in
                    Pennsylvania formed a small community under the name of Schwenkfeldians; and
                    Zinzendorf and Spangenberg, when they visited the United States, endeavoured,
                    but with little success, to convert them to their views. This community still
                    exists in Pennsylvania, and according to information obtained from their
                    ministers by Robert Barclay they consisted in 1875 of two congregations of 500
                    members, with three meeting-houses and six ministers. Their views appear to be
                    substantially those of the English Society of Friends. See Robert Barclay’s <hi

                <p>Schwenkfeld’s mysticism was the cause of his divergence from Protestant orthodoxy
                    and the root of his peculiar religious and<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0485-0464"/> theological position. It led him to oppose the
                    Lutheran view of the value of the outward means of grace, such as the ministry
                    of the word, baptism, the Eucharist. He regarded as essential a direct and
                    immediate participation in the grace of the glorified Christ, and looked on an
                    observance of the sacraments and religious ordinances as immaterial. He
                    distinguished between an outward word of God and an inward, the former being the
                    Scriptures and perishable, the latter the divine spirit and eternal. In his
                    Christology he departed from the Lutheran and Zwinglian doctrine of the two
                    natures by insisting on what he called the <hi rend="italic">Vergottung des
                    Fleisches Christi,</hi> the deification or the glorification of the flesh of
                    Christ. The doctrine was his protest against a separation of the human and the
                    divine in Christ, and was intimately connected with his mystical view of the
                    work of Christ. He held that, though Christ was God and man from His birth from
                    the Virgin, He only attained His complete deification and glorification by His
                    ascension, and that it is in the estate of His celestial <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vergottung</hi> or glorification that He is the dispenser of His divine life to
                    those who by faith become one with Him. This fellowship with the glorified
                    Christ rather than a less spiritual trust in His death and atonement is with him
                    the essential thing. His peculiar Christology was based upon profound
                    theological and anthropological ideas, which contain the germs of some recent
                    theological and Christological speculations.</p>
