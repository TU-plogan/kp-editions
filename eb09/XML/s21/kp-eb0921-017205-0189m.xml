                <p><label type="entry">ST JOHN</label>, capital of St John county and the largest
                    city of the province of New Brunswick, is strikingly situated at the mouth of
                    the river of the same name, in 45 14 6 ' N. lat. and 66° 3' 30" W. long (see
                    vol. xvii., plate IV.). It stands on an elevated rocky peninsula which projects
                    into the harbour for a considerable distance. The latter, which is protected by
                    batteries and never freezes, is well equipped with wharves and docks, and is
                    capable of accommodating ships of the largest size. Its. entrance is guarded by
                    Partridge Island, lying 2 miles south of the city, and containing the quarantine
                    hospital and lighthouse. About 1¼ miles north of the lighthouse is situated the
                    Beacon, and below the town east of the channel is the breakwater, 2250 feet
                    long. The St John river enters the harbour through a rocky and sharply defined
                    gorge, 100 yards wide and about 400 long, having a total fall of about 17 feet,
                    which is passable to ships for forty-five minutes during each ebb and flow of
                    the tide. The river has alternately an inward and an outward fall twice every
                    twenty-four hours, the high-water tide level immediately below the gorge being 6
                    to 8 feet higher than the average level above the gorge. The river is here
                    spanned by a stanch suspension bridge 640 feet long and 100 feet above low-water
                    level, and a cantilever railway bridge, 2260 feet long, with a river span of 825
                    feet, was opened in 1885. The city, approached from the sea, presents a bold and
                    picturesque appearance, and, next to Quebec, possesses more natural beauty than
                    any other town in Canada. There are three large public squares, and the streets
                    (lighted with gas and the electric light) are regularly laid out. The water
                    supply is derived from Little river, 5 miles distant, and brought to the city by
                    three separate mains with an aggregate capacity estimated at 10,000,000 gallons
                    daily; the present daily consumption (including that of the city of Portland) is
                    5,000,000 gallons. The works, which are owned by the city, cost $992,326. The
                    water supply of St John (West) is derived from Spruce Lake. St John (East) has
                    also an admirable sewerage system.</p>
                <p>On the 20th of June 1877 two-fifths of St John (about 200 acres) were destroyed
                    by a fire, which in nine hours burned over $27,000,000 worth of property. The
                    city was quickly rebuilt, and on a much grander scale, many brick and stone
                    edifices taking the place of the old landmarks, which were principally composed
                    of wood. The chief buildings are—the Roman Catholic cathedral, Trinity, St
                    Andrew’s, the Stone, St David’s, the Centenary, Germain Street Baptist, and
                    Leinster Street Baptist churches, the custom-house, post-office, city-hall,
                    savings bank, Wiggins’s Orphan Asylum, Victoria skating-rink, lunatic asylum,
                    Victoria and Madras schools, the Masonic and Oddfellows’ halls, the young men’s
                    Christian association building, the general public, the epidemic, and the marine
                    hospitals, the court-house, jail, police office, and mechanics’ institute (with
                    a reading-room, library, and museum). There are thirty-three places of worship
                    (Church of England 6, Roman Catholic 3, Presbyterian 7, Wesleyan Methodist 5,
                    Baptist 6, Congregationalist 1, Methodist Episcopal 1, Christian Brethren 1,
                    Disciples of Christ 2, and Christadelphians 1); the educational institutions
                    consist of a grammar-school, a Madras school, Baptist seminary, and<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0190-0173"/> several public and private schools and academies.
                    St John has also a free public library, numerous religious, charitable,
                    scientific, and literary societies, and three daily newspapers. Carleton, on the
                    opposite side of the river, and connected with the east side by ferry, is
                    included within the corporation limits, and is represented in the common
                    council. The population in 1871 was 28,805, in 1881 it was 26,127 (males 12,263,
                    females 13,864), the decrease being caused by the great fire of 1877, when many
                    persons left the city.</p>
                <p>St John is the entrepot of a large extent of country, rich in minerals,
                    agricultural produce, and timber. It is the seat of an extensive business
                    connexion, and possesses first-class means of communication both by steamships
                    and sailing vessels and by railways. Οf late years its maritime and
                    manufacturing interests have been greatly extended. The chief articles of
                    manufacture are iron-castings, steam engines and locomotives, railway cars,
                    coaches and carriages, machinery, edge-tools, nails and tacks, cotton and
                    woollen goods, furniture, wooden ware, leather, boots and shoes, soap and
                    candles, agricultural implements, lumber, sugar-boxes, paper, boats, sails,
                    &amp;c. The fisheries afford employment to about 1000 men, and shad, salmon,
                    holibut, cod, herrings, alewives, sturgeons, and haddock comprise the chief
                    varieties taken. The exports ($4,310,576 in 1884) consist of fish, lumber,
                    woollen and cotton goods, manufactured articles, &amp;c.; the imports
                    ($4,621,691 in 1884) are tobaccos, sugar and molasses, spirits and malt liquors,
                    dried fruits, coffee, tea, silks, velvets, &amp;c. The following figures
                    represent the movement of the coasting trade in 1884 :—vessels arrived 1864,
                    tonnage 117,566, men 7340; vessels departed 1941, tonnage 105,050, men 6875. The
                    number of entrances from foreign ports was 1904 (486,471 tons), of clearances
                    1961 (517,415 tons). The vessels on the registry books (31st December 1884)
                    numbered 677, with a tonnage of 251,136; 53 vessels were built in that year with
                    a tonnage of 18,989. The taxable property in 1885 was—real estate $9,122,000,
                    personal $9,153,300, income $2,833,900, total $21,109,200. The corporation
                    affairs are managed by a mayor, elected by the people annually, and a city
                    council of eighteen members. St John city and county return three members to the
                    House of Commons of Canada, and six members to the House of Assembly of New
                    Brunswick. The climate, though healthy, is changeable, the pleasantest season
                    being the autumn. The highest temperature observed since 1860 was 87° Fahr., and
                    the lowest-22° Fahr., the mean temperature for spring, summer, autumn, and
                    winter respectively being 36°·9, 58°, 45°, and 20°·6. The number of schools is
                    81, with 4171 pupils (average daily attendance 2722). Besides the libraries
                    belonging to the city and the mechanics’ institute, there are large collections
                    of books open to members of the young men’s Christian association and the Church
                    of England institute. Navigation on St John river opens on 15th April and closes
                    on 26th November.</p>
                <p>De Monts visited St John in 1604, but it was not until 1635 that a regular
                    settlement of the place was made, when Charles de la Tour founded a colony,
                    which existed under French rule, with varying fortunes, until 1758, when it
                    finally passed under British control. In 1764 the first Scottish settlers
                    arrived in New Brunswick, and in 1783 the Loyalists landed at St John and
                    established the city. It was called Parr Town, in honour of Governor Parr, until
                    1785, when it was incorporated with Conway (Carleton) under royal charter, as
                    the city of St John.</p>
