                    according to Willughby in 1676 the name given by Yorkshiremen to the bird now
                    most popularly known in England as the “Summer-Snipe,”—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tringa hypoleucos</hi> of Linnaeus and the <hi rend="italic">Totanus,
                    Actitis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tringoides hypoleucus</hi> of later
                    writers,—but probably even in Willughby’s time of much wider signification, as
                    for more than a century it has certainly been applied to nearly all the smaller
                    kinds of tho group termed by modern ornithologists <hi rend="italic"
                    >Limicolae</hi> which are not <hi rend="smallcaps">Plovers</hi> (vol. xix. p.
                    227), or <hi rend="smallcaps">Snipes</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>), but may
                    be said to be intermediate between them. Placed by most systematists in the
                    family <hi rend="italic">Scolopacidae,</hi> the birds commonly called Sandpipers
                    seem to form three sections, which have been often regarded as Subfamilies— <hi
                    rend="italic">Totaninae</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Tringinae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Phalaropodinae,</hi> the last indeed in some classifications
                    taking the higher rank of a Family— <hi rend="italic">Phalaropodidae.</hi> This
                    section comprehends three species only, known as Phalaropes or swimming
                    Sandpipers, which are at once distinguished by the membranes that fringe their
                    toes, in two of tho species forming marginal lobes,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These are <hi rend="italic">Phalarapus
                    fulicarius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P.</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Lobipes)
                    hyperborcus,</hi> and on that account were thought by some of the older writers
                    to be allied to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Coots</hi> (vol. vi. p. 341). The third
                    species is <hi rend="italic">P.</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Sttganopus)
                    wilsoni.</hi> All are natives of the higher parts of the northern hemisphere,
                    and the last is especially American, though perhaps a straggler to
                    Europe.</p></note> and by the character of their lower plumage, which is as
                    close as that of a Duck, and is obviously connected with their natatory habits.
                    The distinctions between <hi rend="italic">Potaninas</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tringinae,</hi> though believed to be real, are not so easily drawn, and space
                    is wanting here to describe them minutely. The most obvious may be said to lie
                    in the acute or blunt form of tho tip of the bill (with which is associated a
                    less or greater development of the sensitive nerves running almost if not quite
                    to its extremity, and therefore greatly influencing the mode of feeding) and in
                    the style of plumage—the <hi rend="italic">Tringinae,</hi> with blunt and
                    flexible bills, mostly assuming a summer-dress in which some tint of chestnut or
                    reddish-brown is very prevalent, while the <hi rend="italic">Totaninae,</hi>
                    with acute and stiffer bills, display no such lively colours. Furthermore, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tringinae,</hi> except when actually breeding, frequent the
                    sea-shore much more than do the <hi rend="italic">Potaninx.</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There are unfortunately no
                    English words adequate to express these two sections. By some British writers
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tringinae</hi> have been indicated ns “Stints,” a term
                    cognate with Stunt and wholly inapplicable to many of them, while recent
                    American writers restrict to them the name of “Sandpiper,” and call the <hi
                    rend="italic">Totaninae,</hi> to which that name is especially appropriate,
                    “Willets.”</p></note> To the latter belong the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Greenshank</hi> (vol. xi. p. 173) and <hi rend="smallcaps">Redshank</hi> (vol.
                    xx. p. 317), as well as the Common Sandpiper of English books, the
                    “Summer-Snipe” above-mentioned, a bird hardly exceeding a Skylark in size, and
                    of very general distribution throughout the British Islands, but chiefly
                    frequenting clear streams, especially those with a gravelly or rocky bottom, and
                    most generally breeding on the beds of sand or shingle on their banks. It
                    usually makes its appearance in May, and from thence during the summer-months
                    may be seen in pairs skimming gracefully over the water from one bend of the
                    stream to another, uttering occasionally a shrill but plaintive whistle, or
                    running nimbly along the margin, the mouse-coloured plumage of its back and
                    wings making indeed but little show, though the pure white of its lower parts
                    often renders it conspicuous. The nest, in which four eggs are laid with their
                    pointed ends meeting in its centre (as is usual among Limicoline birds), is
                    seldom far from tho water’s edge, and the eggs, as well as the newly-hatched and
                    down-covered young, so closely resemble the surrounding pebbles that it takes a
                    sharp eye to discriminate them. Later in the season family-parties may be seen
                    about the larger waters, whence, as autumn advances, they depart for their
                    winter-quarters. The Common Sandpiper is found over the greater part of the Old
                    World. In summer it is the most abundant bird of its kind in the extreme north
                    of Europe, and it extends across Asia to Japan. In winter it makes its way to
                    India, Australia, and the Cape of Good Hope. In America its place is taken by a
                    closely kindred species, which is said to have also occurred in England— <hi
                    rend="italic">P. macularius,</hi> the “Peetweet,” or Spotted Sandpiper, so
                    called from its usual cry, or from the almost circular marks which spot its
                    lower plumage. In habits it is very similar to its congener of the Old World,
                    and in winter it migrates to the Antilles and to Central and South America. Of
                    other <hi rend="italic">Totaninae,</hi> one of the most remarkable is that to
                    which the inappropriate name of Green Sandpiper has been assigned, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Totanus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Helodramas ochropus</hi> of
                    ornithologists, which most curiously differs (so far as is known) from all
                    others of the group both in its osteology<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of nidification, the hen laying her eggs in the deserted nests of other
                    birds,—Jays, Thrushes, or Pigeons,—but nearly always at some height (from 3 to
                    30 feet) from the ground <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1863, pp.
                    529-532). This species occurs in England the whole year round, and is presumed
                    to have bred here, though the fact has never been satisfactorily proved, and our
                    knowledge of its erratic habits comes from naturalists in Pomerania and Sweden;
                    yet in the breeding-season, even in England, the cock-bird has been seen to rise
                    high in air and perform a variety of evolutions on the wing, all the while
                    piping what, without any violence of language, may be called a song. This
                    Sandpiper is characterized by its dark upper plumage, which contrasts strongly
                    with the white of the lower part of the back and gives the bird as it flies away
                    from its disturber much the look of a very large House-Martin. The so-called
                    Wood-Sandpiper, <hi rend="italic">T. glareola,</hi> which, though much less
                    common, is known to have bred in England, has a considerable resemblance to the
                    species last mentioned, but can at once be distinguished, and often as it flies,
                    by the feathers of the axillary plume being white barred with greyish-black,
                    while in the Green Sandpiper they are greyish-black barred with white. It is an
                    abundant bird in most parts of northern Europe, migrating in winter very far to
                    the southward.</p>
                <p>Of the section <hi rend="italic">Tringinae</hi> the best known are the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Knot</hi> (vol. xiv. p. 129) and the Dunlin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >P. alpina.</hi> The latter, often also called Ox-bird, Plover’s-Page, Purre,
                    and Stint,— names which it shares with some other species,—not only breeds
                    commonly on many of the elevated moors of Britain, but in autumn resorts in
                    countless flocks to the shores, where indeed a few may be seen at almost any
                    time of year. In seasonal diversity of plumage it is scarcely excelled by any
                    bird of its kind, being in winter of a nearly uniform ash-grey above and white
                    beneath, while in summer the feathers of the back are black, with deep
                    rust-coloured edges, and a broad black belt occupies the breast. The<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0280-0261"/> Dunlin varies considerably in size, and to some
                    extent according to locality, examples from North America being almost always
                    recognizable from their greater bulk, while in Europe, besides the ordinary
                    form, there appears to be a smaller race which has received the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">T. schinzi,</hi> but no other difference is perceptible. In the
                    breedingseason, while performing the amatory flights in which like all
                    Sandpipers he indulges, the male Dunlin utters a most peculiar and far-sounding
                    whistle, quite impossible to syllable, and somewhat resembling the continued
                    ringing of a high-toned but yet musical bell. Next to the Dunlin and Knot the
                    commonest British <hi rend="italic">Tringinae</hi> are the Sanderding, <hi
                    rend="italic">Calidris arenaria</hi> (to be distinguished from every other bird
                    of the group by wanting a hind toe), the Purple Sandpiper, <hi rend="italic">T.
                    striata</hi> or <hi rend="italic">maritima,</hi> the Curlew-Sandpiper, <hi
                    rend="italic">T. subarquata,</hi> and the Little and Temminck’s Stints, <hi
                    rend="italic">T. minuta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. temmincki,</hi> but want
                    of space forbids more than the record of their names; and for the same reason no
                    notice can here be taken of the many other species, chiefly American,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A “Monograph of the <hi

                    (1864), and requires much modification to be put on a level with the knowledge
                    of the present day. The very rare <hi rend="italic">Tringa leucoptera</hi> of

                    however, must be mentioned. These are the Broad-billed Sandpiper, <hi

                    Snipe-like than any that are usually kept in this section, and the marvellous
