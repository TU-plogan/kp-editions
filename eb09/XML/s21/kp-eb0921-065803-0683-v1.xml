                    brilliant figure of his time, was the second son of the rhetorician Marcus
                    Annaeus Seneca, and, like him, a native of Corduba in Hispania. From his infancy
                    of a delicate constitution, he devoted himself with intense ardour to rhetorical
                    and philosophical studies and early won a reputation at the bar. Caligula
                    threatened his life, and under Claudius his political career received a sudden
                    check, for the influence of Messalina having effected the ruin of Julia, the
                    youngest daughter of Germanicus, Seneca, who was compromised by her downfall,
                    was banished to Corsica, 41 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> There eight weary
                    years of waiting were relieved by study and authorship, with occasional attempts
                    to procure his return by such gross flattery of Claudius as is found in the work
                        <hi rend="italic">Ad Polybium de Consolatione</hi> or the panegyric on
                    Messalina which he afterwards suppressed. At length the tide turned; the next
                    empress, Agrippina, had him recalled, appointed praetor, and entrusted with the
                    education of her son Nero, then (48) eleven years old. Seneca became in fact
                    Agrippina’s confidential adviser; and his pupil’s accession increased his power.
                    He was consul in 57, and during the first bright years of the new reign, the
                    incomparable <hi rend="italic">quinquennium Neronis,</hi> he shared the actual
                    administration of affairs with the worthy Burrus, the praetorian praefect. The
                    government in the hands of these men of remarkable<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0684-0659"/> insight and energy was wise and humane; their
                    influence over Nero, while it lasted, was salutary, though sometimes maintained
                    by doubtful means. When there came the inevitable rupture between mother and son
                    they sided with the latter; and Seneca, who drew up all Nero’s state papers, was
                    called upon to write a defence of matricide. We must, however, regard the
                    general tendency of his measures; to judge him as a Stoic philosopher by the
                    counsels of perfection laid down in his writings would be much the same thing as
                    to apply the standard of New Testament morality to the career of a Wolsey or
                    Mazarin. He is the type of the man of letters who as courtier and minister rises
                    into favour by talent and suppleness <hi rend="italic">(comitas honesta),</hi>
                    and is entitled as such to the rare credit of a beneficent rule. In course of
                    time Nero got to dislike him more and more; the death of Burrus in 62 gave a
                    shock to his position. In vain did he petition for permission to retire,
                    offering to Nero at the same time his enormous fortune. Even when he had sought
                    privacy on the plea of ill health he could not avert his doom; on a charge of
                    being concerned in Piso’s conspiracy he was forced to commit suicide. His manly
                    end might be held in some measure to redeem the weakness of his life but for the
                    testimony it bears to his constant study of effect and ostentatious
                    self-complacency (“conversus ad amicos, imaginem vitae suae relinquere testatur
                    ”).</p>
                <p>Seneca is at once the most eminent among the Latin writers of the Silver Age and
                    in a special sense their representative, not least because he was the originator
                    of a false style. The affected and sentimental manner which gradually grew up in
                    the first century A.D. became ingrained in him, and appears equally in
                    everything which he wrote, whether poetry or prose, as the most finished product
                    of ingenuity concentrated upon declamatory exercises, substance being sacrificed
                    to form and thought to point. Every variety of rhetorical conceit in turn
                    contributes to the dazzling effect, now tinsel and ornament, now novelty and
                    versatility of treatment, or affected simplicity and studied absence of plan.
                    But the chief weapon is the epigram <hi rend="italic">(sententia),</hi> summing
                    up in terse incisive antithesis the gist of a whole period. “Seneca is a man of
                    real genius,” writes Niebuhr, “which is after all the main thing; not to be
                    unjust to him, one must know the whole range of that literature to which he
                    belonged and realize how well he understood the art of making something even of
                    what was most absurd.” His works were upon various subjects. (1) His <hi
                        rend="italic">Orations,</hi> probably the speeches which Nero delivered, are
                    lost, as also a biography of his father, and (2) his earlier scientific works,
                    such as the monographs describing India and Egypt and one upon earthquakes <hi
                        rend="italic">(Nat. Qu.,</hi> vi. 4, 2). The seven extant books of <hi
                        rend="italic">Physical Investigations (Naturales Quaestiones)</hi> treat in
                    a popular manner of meteorology and astronomy; the work has little scientific
                    merit, yet here and there Seneca, or his authority, has a shrewd guess, <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> that there is a connexion between earthquakes and
                    volcanoes, and that comets are bodies like the planets revolving in fixed
                    orbits. (3) The <hi rend="italic">Satire on the Death</hi> (and deification) <hi
                        rend="italic">of Claudius</hi> is a specimen of the “satjra Menippea” or
                    medley of prose and verse. The writer’s spite against the dead emperor before
                    whom he had cringed servilely shows in a sorry fashion when he fastens on the
                    wise and liberal measure of conferring the franchise upon Gaul as a theme for
                    abuse. (4) The remaining prose works are of the nature of moral essays, bearing
                    various titles,—twelve so-called <hi rend="italic">Dialogues,</hi> three books
                        <hi rend="italic">On Clemency</hi> dedicated to Nero, seven <hi
                        rend="italic">On Benefits,</hi> twenty books of <hi rend="italic">Letters to
                        Lucilius.</hi> They are all alike in discussing practical questions and in
                    addressing a single reader in a tone of familiar conversation, the objections he
                    is supposed to make being occasionally cited and answered. Seneca had the wit to
                    discover that conduct, which is after all “three-fourths of life,” could furnish
                    inexhaustible topics of abiding universal interest far superior to the imaginary
                    themes set in the schools and abundantly analysed in his father’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Controversiae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Suasoriae,</hi> such
                    as poisoning cases, or tyrannicide, or even historical persons like Hannibal and
                    Sulla. The innovation took the public taste,—plain matters of urgent personal
                    concern sometimes treated casuistically, sometimes in a liberal vein with
                    serious divergence from the orthodox standards, but always with an earnestness
                    which aimed directly at the reader’s edification, progress towards virtue, and
                    general moral improvement. The essays are in fact Stoic sermons; for the creed
                    of the later Stoics had become less of a philosophical system and more of a
                    religion, especially at Rome, where moral and theological doctrines alone
                    attracted lively interest. The school is remarkable for its anticipation of
                    modern ethical conceptions, for the lofty morality of its exhorta tions to
                    forgive injuries and overcome evil with good; the obligation to universal
                    benevolence had been deduced from the cosmopolitan principle that all men are
                    brethren. In Seneca, in addition to all this, there is a distinctively religious
                    temperament, which finds expression in phrases curiously suggestive of the
                    spiritual doctrines of Christianity. Yet the verbal coincidence is sometimes a
                    mere accident, as when he uses <hi rend="italic">sacer spiritus</hi>; and in the
                    same writings he sometimes advocates what is wholly repulsive to Christian
                    feeling, as the duty and privilege of suicide.</p>
                <p>Eight of the tragedies which bear Seneca’s name are undoubtedly genuine. In them
                    the defects of his prose style are exaggerated: as specimens of pompous rant
                    they are probably unequalled; and the rhythm is unpleasant owing to the
                    monotonous structure of the iambics and the neglect of synapheia in the
                    anapaestic systems. The praetexta <hi rend="italic">Octavia,</hi> also ascribed
                    to him, contains plain allusions to Nero’s end, and must therefore be the
                    product of a later hand.</p>
                <p>Our materials for a knowledge of Seneca are ample, and are variously presented in
                    such works as Merivale’s <hi rend="italic">Romans under the Empire,</hi> cc.
                    52-54; Zeller’s <hi rend="italic">Greek Philosophy</hi> (Eng. tr. <hi
                        rend="italic">Eclecticism,</hi> pp. 202-245); and the histories of Roman
                    literature by Bemhardy, Teuffel (§§ 282-285), and Simcox (ii. pp. 1-27, London,
                    1883). His elder brother Annaeus Seneca Novatus, afterwards adopted by a Junius
                    Gallio, was the proconsul of Achaia before whom St Paul pleaded (Acts xviii.
                    12). The date of Seneca's birth must be approximately inferred from <hi
                        rend="italic">Nat. Qu.,</hi> i. 1, 3; <hi rend="italic">Ep.,</hi> 108, 22.
                    His mother’s name was Helvia; her sister brought him as a child to Rome and
                    nursed him tenderly. His teachers were Attalus, a Stoic, and Sotion, a pupil of
                    the Sextii. In his youth he was a vegetarian and a water-drinker, but his father
                    checked his indulgence in asceticism. Before his exile he had served as
                    quaestor, was married, and had two children born. Caligula said his style was
                    mere mosaic <hi rend="italic">(commissuras meras)</hi> or “sand without lime,”
                    and would have put him to death, had he not been assured that so consumptive a
                    subject could not last long (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Calig.,</hi> 63; Dio
                    Cassius, lix. 19, 7). Upon a Pompeian fresco a butterfly appears as charioteer
                    of a dragon,—Seneca and Nero. His second wife was Pompeia Paulina, of noble
                    family; she attempted to die with him. His enormous wealth was estimated at 300
                    millions of sesterces. He had 500 ivory tables inlaid with citron wood (Dio,
                    lxi. 10, lxii. 2). The judgment of Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Ann.,</hi> xiii.
                    4, 13, 42 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> xiv. 52-56, XV. 60 <hi rend="italic"
                        >sq.)</hi> is more favourable than that of Dio, who may possibly derive his
                    account from the slanders of some personal enemy like Suilius. Seneca has found
                    many champions—Lipsius (the introduction to his ed.); Diderot, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Essai sur les Règnes de Claude et de Néron</hi> (iii. 1-407, Paris, 1875);
                    Volquardsen, <hi rend="italic">Ehrenrettung</hi> (Hadersleben, 1839); Martha,
                        <hi rend="italic">Les Moralistes sous l’Empire Romain</hi> (2d ed., Paris,
                    1866). For the dates of his works, see H. Lehmann, in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philologus,</hi> viii. p. 309; F. Jonas, <hi rend="italic">De ordine

                        vita</hi> (Altona, 1871); also R. Volkmann, in Mager’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pädagog. Revue,</hi> xviii. pp. 259-276 (1857). At least eighteen prose
                    works have been lost, among them <hi rend="italic">De superstitione,</hi> an
                    attack upon the popular conceptions of the gods, and <hi rend="italic">De
                        matrimonio,</hi> which, to judge by the extant fragments, must have been
                    interest ing reading. Since Gellius (xii. 2, 3) cites a book xxii. of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Letters to Lucilius,</hi> some of these have been lost. His
                    style is elaborately criticized by Quintilian <hi rend="italic">(Inst.,</hi> X.
                    1, 125-131), also by Fronto (p. 155 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Gellius, xii. 2,
                    1). The doubt as to his authorship of the tragedies is due to a blunder of
                    Sidonius Apollinaris (ix. 229-231); against it must be set Quintilian’s
                    testimony (“ut Medea apud Senecam,” ix. 2, 8). Some of the Fathers, probably in
                    admiration of his ethics, reckoned Seneca among the Christians; this assumption
                    in its turn led to the forgery of a correspondence between St Paul and Seneca,
                    which was known to Jerome (comp. Augustin, <hi rend="italic">Ep.,</hi> 153:
                    “Seneca . . . cujus etiam ad Paulum apostolum leguntur epistolae"). This has
                    given rise to an interesting historical problem, most thoroughly discussed in
                    the commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Ep. to the Philippians</hi> by Dr
                    Lightfoot, bishop of Durham (London, new ed., 1879, pp. 270-333), who cites (p.

                    vols., 1842-45). More recently Gertz has revised the text of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Libri de beneficiis et de clementia</hi> (Berlin, 1876) and H. A. Koch that

                    has been done systematically since the notes of Lipsius and Gronovius. There is,
                    however, Ruhkopf’s ed. with Latin notes, 5 vols. (Leipsic, 1797-1811), and
                    Lemaire’s variorum ed. (Paris, 1827-32, 8 vols., prose and verse). The text of
                    the tragedies was edited by Peiper and Richter for Teubner’s series (1867), and
                    more recently by F. Leo (Berlin, 2 vols., 1878-79). Nisard, <hi rend="italic"
