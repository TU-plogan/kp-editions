                    (1767-1811), one of the most distinguished of modern travellers in the East, was
                    born the son of a yeoman, in the little lordship of Jever in German Frisia, on
                    30th January 1767. His father, who was a man of substance, sent him to the
                    university of Göttingen, where he graduated in medicine. His chief interests,
                    however, were in natural history and technology; he wrote a number of papers on
                    both these subjects which gained him some reputation, and had both in view in a
                    series of journeys which he made from time to time through various parts of
                    Holland and Germany. He also engaged practically in various small manufactures,
                    and in 1802 obtained a Government post in Jever. In 1801, however, the interest
                    which he had long felt in geographical exploration had culminated in a
                    resolution to travel by Constantinople to Syria and Arabia, and then, when
                    familiarized with Mohammedan ways, to try to penetrate into Central Africa. He
                    relied mainly on his own resources, but received a small subvention from Gotha,
                    where also he learned from Zach to make astronomical observations. In the summer
                    of 1802 he started down the Danube with a companion Jacobsen, who broke down at
                    Smyrna a year later. His journey was by Constantinople, where he stayed six
                    months, thence through Asia Minor to Smyrna, then again through the heart of
                    Asia Minor to Aleppo, where he remained from November 1803 to April 1805, and
                    made himself sufficiently at home with Arabic speech and ways to travel as a
                    native and without an interpreter. Now began the part of his travels of which a
                    full journal has been published (April 1805 to March 1809), a series of most
                    instructive journeys in eastern and western Palestine and the wilderness of
                    Sinai, and so on to Cairo and the Fayyûm. His chief exploit was a tour round the
                    Dead Sea, which he made without a companion and in the disguise of a beggar.
                    From Egypt he went by sea to Jeddah and reached Mecca as a pilgrim in October
                    1809. In Arabia he made extensive journeys, ranging from Medina to Lahak and
                    returning to Mocha, from which place his last letters to Europe were written in
                    November 1810. In September of the following year he left Mocha with the hope of
                    reaching Muscat, and was found dead two days later, having, it is believed, been
                    poisoned by the command of the imám of Sana'a. For the parts of Seetzen’s
                    journeys not covered by the published journal <hi rend="italic">(Reisen,</hi>
                    ed. Kruse, 4 vols., Berlin, 1854) the only printed records are a series of
                    letters and papers in Zach’s <hi rend="italic">Monatliche Correspondenz</hi> and
                    Hammer’s <hi rend="italic">Fundgruben.</hi> Many papers and collections were
                    lost through his death or never reached Europe. The collections that were saved
                    form the Oriental museum and the chief part of the Oriental MSS. of the ducal
                    library in Gotha.</p>
