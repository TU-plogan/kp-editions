                <p><label type="entry">SAHARA</label> is the great desert region which stretches
                    across the continent of Africa eastwards from the Atlantic for a considerable
                    distance on both sides of the Tropic of Cancer, and is generally distinguished
                    by aridity of soil, absence of running water, dryness of atmosphere, and
                    comparative scarcity of vegetable and animal life. The physical limits of this
                    region are in some directions marked with great precision, as in part of Morocco
                    and Algeria, where the southern edge of the Atlas range looks out on what has
                    almost the appearance of a boundless sea, and forms, as it were, a bold
                    coast-line, whose sheltered bays and commanding promontories are occupied by a
                    series of towns and villages—Tizgi, Figig, Lagliouat, &amp;c. In other
                    directions the boundaries are vague, conventional, and disputed. This is
                    especially the case towards the south, where the desert sometimes comes to a
                    close as suddenly as if it had been cut off with a knife, but at other times
                    merges gradually and irregularly into the well-watered and fertile lands of the
                    Sudan (Soudan). While towards the east the valley of the Nile at first sight
                    seems to afford a natural frontier, the characteristics of what is usually
                    called the Nubian or Arabian desert are so identical in most respects with those
                    of the Sahara proper that some authorities extend this designation over the
                    whole country to the shores of the Red Sea. The desert, indeed, does not end
                    -with Africa, but is prolonged eastwards through Arabia towards the desert of
                    Sind. As the Nubian region has been described under the heading <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nubia</hi> (vol. xvii. p. 610), attention will in the present
                    article be confined to the desert country west of the Nile valley. Even as thus
                    defined the Sahara is estimated to have an area of 3,565,565 square miles, or
                    nearly as much as all Europe minus the Scandinavian peninsula and Iceland; but,
                    while Europe supports a population of 327,000,000, the Sahara probably does not
                    contain more than 2,500,000,—a figure, however, which is sufficiently startling
                    to those who think of it as an uninhabitable expanse of sand. The sea-like
                    aspect of certain portions of the Sahara has given rise to much popular
                    misconception, and has even affected the ideas and phraseology of scientific
                    writers. Instead of being a boundless plain broken only by wave-like mounds of
                    sand hardly more stable and little less dangerous than the waves of ocean, the
                    Sahara is a region of the most varied surface and irregular relief, ranging in
                    altitude from 100 feet below to some 5000 or 6000 or even it may be 8000 feet
                    above the sea-level, and, besides sand-dunes and oases, containing rocky
                    plateaus, vast tracts of loose stones and pebbles, ranges of hills of the most
                    dissimilar types, and valleys through which abundant watercourses must once have
                    flowed.</p>
                <p>The culminating points of the Sahara are probably the summits of the Ahaggar
                    (Hoggar), a great mountain plateau, not inferior to the Alps in the area which
                    it covers, crossing the Tropic of Cancer about 5° and 6° E. long., almost midway
                    between the Atlantic and the valley of the Nile. In its central mass rise with
                    red steep cliffs two peaks, Watellen and Hikena, which Duveyrier believes to be
                    volcanic like those of Auvergne. The height of this country has not been
                    ascertained by direct European observation, but may be gathered from the fact
                    that according to the Tuareg the snow lies for three months of the year, from
                    December to March. To the northwest, and separated from the Atakor-’n-Ahaggar by
                    a wide plain, rises the Muydir plateau, lying nearly east and west for a
                    distance of about 200 miles. Its northeastern extremity is extended towards
                    Timassinin by the Irawen Mountains, which in their turn are separated by a
                    narrow valley from the Tasili plateau (strictly Tasili of the Asjer or Asgar).
                    This great plateau stretches southeast for 300 miles parallel with the
                    Atakor-’n-Ahaggar (from which it is separated by the Amadghor and Adamar
                    plains), and then the line of elevation is continued by low ridges to the Tummo
                    or War Mountains, and so onwards to the highland country of Tibesti or Tu, whose
                    highest point, Tusidde, is 7880 feet above the sea-level, while its
                    south-eastern eminences gradually die away in the direction of Wadai and Darfor
                    (Darfur). About midway between Tibesti and the Niger rises the isolated mountain
                    mass of Air or Asben, in which Dr Erwin von Bary<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift far
                    Erdkuiule,</hi> 1880.</p></note> discovered the distinct volcanic crater of
                    Teginjir with a vast lava-bed down its eastern side. By some this country is
                    assigned to the Sudan, as it lies within the limit of the tropical rains; but
                    the districts farther south have all the characteristics of the desert. The low
                    but extensive plateau of Adghagh lies between Air and the Niger. Away to the
                    north-east, in the country of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fezzan</hi> (<hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.</hi>), are the dark mountains of Jebel es-Soda, which are
                    continued south-east towards Kufra by the similar range of the Haruj; and in the
                    extreme south-west at no great distance from the Atlantic is the hilly country
                    of Adrar (Aderer).</p>
                <p>Nearly all the rest of the Sahara consists in the main of undulating surfaces of
                    rock (distinguished as <hi rend="italic">hammada),</hi> vast tracts of
                    water-worn pebbles (serir), and regions of sandy dunes (variously called <hi
                    rend="italic">maghter, erg</hi> or <hi rend="italic">areg, igidi</hi> and in the
                    east <hi rend="italic">rhart),</hi> which, according to M. Pomel, occupy about
                    one-ninth or one-tenth of the total area. The following is the general
                    distribution of the dunes. From the Atlantic coast to the south of Cape Blanco a
                    broad belt extends north-east for a distance of about 1300 miles, with a breadth
                    varying from 50 to 300 miles. This is usually called the Igidi or Gidi, from the
                    Berber word for dunes. Eastward it is continued to the south of Algeria and
                    Tunis by the Western Erg and the Eastern Erg, separated by a narrow belt at
                    Golea. To the south of the Eastern Erg (which extends as far north as the
                    neighbourhood of the Lesser Syrtis) the continuity of the sandy tract is
                    completely broken by the Hammada al-Homra (or Red Rock Plateau), but to the
                    south of this region lie the dunes of Edeyen, which, with slight inter-<pb

                    of the hammada of Murzuk the dunes of Murzuk stretch away south-east. Looked at
                    in its entirety, this series of tracts may be called the northern zone; it forms
                    a kind of bow, with its extremities respectively at the Atlantic and the Libyan
                    Desert and its apex in the south of Tunis. In the south are the Juf,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This name, meaning the
                    “depression,” has long been in use, but appears to be a misnomer; the lowest
                    point in Lenz’s route, which, however, only crossed the east end of the Juf, was
                    400 feet above the sea.</p></note> covering a vast area to the south-east of the
                    middle portion of the Igidi, another area between the Adghagh plateau and the
                    Tasili wan Ahaggar, and a third between Air and Tibesti. Away to the east in the
                    Libyan Desert is a vast region of dunes of unascertained limits. It must be
                    borne in mind that the sands do not entirely cover the areas assigned to them in
                    the ordinary maps, which are of too small a scale to show the interchange of
                    different kinds of surface. In the Eastern Erg especially the dunes lie in long
                    lines in a north-northwest and south-south-east direction, presenting a gradual
                    slope to windward and an abrupt descent to leeward. There they are generally
                    about 60 or 70 feet high, but in other parts of the Sahara they are said to
                    attain a height of upwards of 300 feet. The true dune sand is remarkable for the
                    uniformity of its composition and the geometrical regularity of its grains,
                    which measure less than ·03937 inch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    (from the presence of iron), they have in the mass a rich golden hue. According
                    to M. Tissandier’s examination, animal organisms, such as the microscopic shells
                    of <hi rend="italic">Rhizopoda,</hi> so abundant in sea-sand, are strikingly
                    absent. Under the influence of the wind the surface of the dunes is subject to
                    continual change, but in the mass they have attained such a state of comparative
                    equilibrium that their topographic distribution may be considered as permanent,
                    and some of them, such as Gern (Peak) al-Shúf and Gern Abd-al-Kader, to the
                    south of Golea, have names of their own. The popular stories about caravans and
                    armies being engulfed in the moving sands are quite apocryphal, but there is
                    abundant evidence against the theory of M. Vatonne as to the dunes having been
                    formed <hi rend="italic">in situ.</hi> To understand their origin it is
                    necessary to glance at the general geology of the Sahara, which, however, in
                    this aspect, is only known in detail to the south of Algeria and along the
                    routes of the Rohlfs expedition (1873-74, Dr Zittel) and that of Dr Lenz
                    (1880).</p>
                <p>Granite, which, along with gneiss and mica schists, seems to be the prevailing
                    rock in the highlands of Air (Von Bary), comes to the surface more or less
                    sporadically in the neighbourhood of Al-Eglab and in the Adrar districts in the
                    south-west. Gneiss and mica schists are probably the main materials of the
                    Ahaggar plateau. Volcanic rocks (basalt, &amp;c.) form the mountain masses of
                    Jebel es-Sóda and the Haruj; in Air they break through the granite and other
                    rocks in a very erratic fashion. Slates and quartzite (possibly Silurian,
                    according to Lenz), which play so great a part in Senegambia, appear to the
                    north of the Senegal, along the edge of the desert, and crop out again in Adrar,
                    on the eastern borders of the Juf, and to the east of Wady Sus. An immense tract
                    from Adrar north-east to the borders of Algeria seems to be occupied by Devonian
                    and Carboniferous formations, the characteristic fossils of which frequently
                    show on the surface; farther east these rocks are covered by Cretaceous and
                    Quaternary deposits, though they again appear in the Muydir and Tasili plateaus
                    (M. Roche s report<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Comptes Rendus, Acad. des Sciences.</hi></p></note>). The
                    development of the Cretaceous system is altogether one of the most striking
                    features of Saharan geology, its extreme limits being the coasts of the Atlantic
                    and the Red Sea, and the area occupied by it in the Algerian Sahara alone being
                    equal to the whole of France. In the Algerian Sahara the Cretaceous rocks are
                    covered by no later sediments, with the exception of certain Quaternary
                    deposits, but in the Libyan Desert Tertiary deposits are abundant, though,
                    according to Zittel, there is no sharp distinction between Cretaceous and
                    Tertiary, the one seeming</p>
                <p>(certain palaeological characteristics apart) to pass gradually into the other.
                    Eocene limestones, rich in nummulites and operculines, stretch south and east
                    from the oasis of Síwa and are well seen in the cliffs enclosing the depressed
                    oasal areas which sink down to the Cretaceous rocks. To the south of Farafreh
                    extends a vast tract of Nubian sandstone.</p>
                <p>In all parts of the Sahara there is evidence of denudation carried out on a scale
                    of unusual magnitude. The present surface of the desert has been exposed to the
                    protracted wear and tear of the elements. But to determine the exact method by
                    which the elements have done their work has hitherto proved beyond the power of
                    science. The superficial observer is at once tempted to accept the theory of <hi
                    rend="italic">submarine</hi> denudation: the Sahara is still the “dried bed of a
                    sea” in even such text-books as Professor Huxley’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physioyraphy</hi> and Stanford’s <hi rend="italic">Compendium of
                    Geography.</hi> The sand-dunes, the salt efflorescence and deposits, and the
                    local occurrence of certain modern marine molluscs all go to help the hypothesis
                    of a diluvial sea. But a more extensive acquaintance with Saharan
                    characteristics shows that such a sea for the Sahara as a whole is impossible.
                    The denudation must probably be explained as due to the combined action of fresh
                    water and atmospheric agencies. Even at present the Sahara is not so destitute
                    as has been supposed of fresh water. Though rain is one of the rarest phenomena
                    of the lowlands, the mountains on its northern borders and the central highlands
                    are both regions of precipitation, and discharge their surplus waters into the
                    hollows. A glance at a good physical map of the Sahara shows in fact the
                    skeleton of a regular river-system. From the north side of the
                    Atakor-’n-Aliaggar, for instance, begins Wady Igharghar, which, running
                    northwards between the Tasili plateau and the Irawen Mountains, appears to lose
                    itself in the sands of the Eastern Erg, but can be distinctly traced northwards
                    for hundreds of miles. Its bed contains rolled fragments of lava and freshwater
                    shells <hi rend="italic">(Cyrena</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Planorbis).</hi> In
                    a line almost parallel to Wady Ighargliar Wady Mya descends from the plateau of
                    Tademayt, and shows the importance of its ancient current by deep erosion of the
                    Cretaceous rocks, in which a large number of lefthand tributaries have also left
                    their mark. Away in the far east of the Libyan Desert Dr Zittel discovered
                    stalactite caves in the limestone. The question arises, What has become of the
                    abundant water-supply which filled the wadies and hollowed out the caves? Recent
                    discoveries in the Algerian Sahara suggest that part of the water circulation
                    has become subterranean. The streams from the Atlas which seem to be absorbed in
                    the sands of the desert evidently find a series of underground reservoirs or
                    basins capable of being tapped by artesian wells over very extensive areas. As
                    Olympiodorus (quoted by Photius) mentions that the inhabitants of the Sahara
                    used to make excavations from 100 to 120 feet deep, out of which jets of pure
                    water rose in columns, it is clear that this state of matters is (historically)
                    of ancient date. Since 1856 the French engineers have carried on a series of
                    borings which have resulted in the fertilizing of extensive tracts; between 1856
                    and 1879 155 wells were bored in the province of Constantine alone. In Wady
                    Rir’, which runs for 80 miles towards the south-west of the Shott Melrir (comp.
                    <hi rend="italic">infra),</hi> the water-bearing stratum is among permeable
                    sands, which are covered to a depth of 200 feet by impermeable marls, by which
                    the water is kept under pressure. The wells, varying much in their discharge and
                    “head,” give a total of 3·5 cubic metres per second at an average temperature of
                    25°T Fahr. A similar artesian zone exists between Negussa and Wargla. Connexions
                    probably exist with subterranean water-supplies in the mountains to the north.
                    That in some way the water in the artesian reservoirs is kept aerated is shown
                    by the existence below ground of fishes, crabs, and freshwater molluscs, all of
                    which were ejected by the well called Mezer in Wady Rir’. Hitherto those
                    subterranean basins have been verified only in a comparatively limited area (the
                    whole expanse of the Sahara being considered); but the same phenomena are
                    probably repeated to some extent in other regions.<note anchored="true"

                    of a steady supply of underground moisture, for vegetation under the Saharan

                <p>Everything considered, it may therefore be assumed that tho desert formerly
                    possessed a surface circulation of water capable of aiding in the processes of
                    disintegration, removal, and deposition. Since the water disappeared other
                    agencies have been at work. The surface of the rocks, heated by the sun and
                    suddenly chilled by rapid radiation over night, gets fractured and crumbled;
                    elsewhere the cliffs have been scored and the sand thus formed is at once turned
                    by the wind into an active instrument of abrasion. In many places it has planed
                    the flat rocks of the hammada as smooth as ice. Elsewhere it has scored the
                    vertical faces of the cliffs with curious imitations of glacial striation, and
                    helped to undercut the pillar-or table-like eminences which, under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">gurs</hi> or “witnesses,” are among the most familiar products
                    of Saharan erosion. The softer quartz rocks of the Quaternary and Cretaceous<pb

                    Nubian sandstone) have been made to yield the sand which, drifted and sifted by
                    the winds, has taken on the form of dunes. The slightest breeze is enough to
                    make the surface “smoke” with dust; and at times the weird singing of the sands,
                    waxing louder and louder, tells the scientific traveller that the motion is not
                    confined to the superficial particles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Lenz’s chapter on this phenomenon.</p></note> How
                    important a part the winds may play in the redistribution of the lighter
                    particles is probably shown by the clouds of red dust which were noticed by
                    Edrisi as frequently obscuring the Atlantic sky between Cape Verd and the
                    American coast, and which have recently been referred by Dr Gustav Hellemann to
                    the African Sahara, whence Professor Tacchini also derives the similar clouds of
                    dust observed in many parts of Italy (comp. Tchihatchef).</p>
                <p>But even such a river-system as that supposed combined with all conceivable
                    atmospheric agencies would only account for the minor phenomena of erosion. Dr
                    Zittel in dealing with the Libyan Desert finds it necessary to assume violent
                    freshwater floods proceeding from the south, though, as he confesses, this only
                    shifts the difficulty a stage further back, as it involves an enormous change of
                    climate. To render such a change of climate a probable hypothesis various recent
                    speculations combine; and Dr Theobald Fischer and Dr Oscar Fraas agree in
                    believing that the desiccation has markedly increased in historic times.
                    Evidence derived from ancient monuments combined with the statements of
                    Herodotus and Pliny are held to prove that the elephant, the rhinoceros, and the
                    crocodile existed in North African regions where the environment is now utterly
                    alien, and on the other hand that the camel is a late introduction. Humboldt
                    sought to attribute the desiccation of the desert region of Asia and Africa to
                    the effects of the north-east trade-wind; but Dr Lenz, who points out that in
                    North Africa the wind seldom blows from the north-east but generally from the
                    north or northwest<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comp.

                    Atlantic, in the western parts, but farther east from the European regions of
                    precipitation), argues that one of the principal causes has been the destruction
                    of the forests on the highlands. The dry winds from the Sahara are known in
                    Europe as the Scirocco and the Föhn or Fön.</p>
                <p>Botanically the Sahara is the meeting-ground of representatives of the
                    “Mediterranean” and the “Tropical” floras which have managed to accommodate
                    themselves to the peculiar climatic conditions. The line of demarcation between
                    the two floral areas, almost coinciding in the west with the Tropic of Cancer
                    and in the east dipping south towards the meridian of Lake Tchad, assigns by far
                    the greater portion of the area to “Mediterranean” influences.<note

                    spite of differences of altitude and soil, is a general characteristic of the
                    vegetation, which outside of the oases consists mainly of plants with a tufty
                    dry stiff habit of growth. The oases are the special home of the date-palm, of
                    which there are about 4,000,000 in the Algerian oases alone. In company with
                    this tree, without which life in the Sahara would be practically impossible, are
                    grown apples, peaches, oranges, citrons, figs, grapes, pomegranates, &amp;c.
                    During the months from December to March wheat, barley, and other northern grain
                    crops are successfully cultivated and in the hotter season rice, dukhn, durra,
                    and other tropical products. Altogether the oasal flora has considerable
                    variety; thirty-nine species are known from the Kufra group, forty-eight from
                    the Aujila group.</p>
                <p>Zoologically the Sahara is also a debatable territory, partly Mediterranean,
                    partly Tropical. Apart from the domestic animals (camels, asses, &amp;c., and
                    very noticeably a black breed of cattle in Adrar), the list of fifteen mammals
                    comprises the jerboa, the fennek or fox, the jackal, the sand rat <hi

                    not uncommon. Without counting migratory visitants, about eighty species of
                    birds have been registered—the ostrich, the <hi rend="italic">Certhilauda

                <p>The present population of the Sahara consists almost exclusively of Arabs,
                    Berbers, and Negro tribes. The Berbers (Tuareg or Tuarik, &amp;c.) occupy the
                    west central region almost exclusively, appear sporadically in the western, and
                    stretch northwards into Morocco and Algeria; the Negro tribes form a compact
                    block in the east central region northwards and north-eastwards from Lake</p>
                <p>Tchad; and the Arabs are in possession of all the rest of the country.
                    Politically the Sahara belongs partly to Morocco (Tafilet, &amp;c.), partly to
                    Algeria and Tunis (and thus to France), and partly to the Turkish empire
                    (Tripolis, Egypt, &amp;c.). France especially has been steadily pushing south
                    with the purpose of forming a junction ultimately with her colony on the
                    Senegal. The spirit of independence among the Mohammedan populations has been
                    crystallized and stimulated by the remarkable confraternity of Sidi Mohammed ben
                    'Ali es-Senusi, founded about 1837, and now possessing about 120 convents or
                    zawiga (mostly in the Saharan region), with its headquarters at Jerabub.<note

                    this organization the French have already come into conflict in their southward
                    progress. To establish their influence they propose the construction of a
                    trans-Saharan railway and the opening up of the region to the south of Algeria
                    and Tunis by the construction of an inland sea. According to M. Roudaire, the
                    author and protagonist of this scheme, which is familiarly but deceptively
                    styled the ‘ ‘ flooding of the Sahara,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In this connexion it is enough to mention Mr Mackenzie’s

                    create an inland sea to the south of Algeria and Tunis with an average depth of
                    78 feet and an area of 3100 square miles, or about fourteen times the size of
                    the Lake of Geneva. A Government commission decided that the excavation of the
                    necessary canal would not be difficult, and that, in spite of silting-up
                    processes, the work would at least last 1000 to 1500 years. M. de Lesseps, M.
                    Roudaire’s principal supporter, visited the district in 1883 and reported that
                    the canal would cost five years’ labour and 150,000,000 francs. The scheme,
                    which has met with persistent hostility on the part of M. Cosson and others, is
                    based on the following facts. The Gulf of Gabes is separated by a ridge 13 miles
                    across and 150 feet high from Shott al-Fejej, a depression which extends
                    south-west into the Shott Jerid, which in its turn is separated from the Shott
                    Rharsa only by a still narrower ridge. Shott Rharsa is succeeded westwards by a
                    series of smaller depressions and beyond them lies the Shott Melrir, whose
                    north-west end is not far from the town of Biskra. What we know about such
                    inland seas as the Caspian and the Aral seems to cast serious doubt on the
                    probability of any increase of the rainfall in the Sahara by the formation of
                    Roudaire’s sea.</p>
                <p>The commerce of the Sahara is not inconsiderable. Among the more important trade
                    routes are—(1) from Morocco to Cairo by Insalah and Ghadames, which is followed
                    by the pilgrims of Western Africa bound for Mecca; (2) from Kuka to Murzuk and
                    Tripolis; (3) from the Sudan to Tripolis by Air and Ghat; (4) from Timbuktu to
                    Insalah, Ghadames, and Tripolis; (5) from Timbuktu to Insalah and thence to
                    Algeria and Tunis; (6) from Timbuktu to Morocco. The two great products are
                    dates and salt. Full details of the date trade will be found in Fischer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Die Dattelpalme,</hi> 1881. The principal sources of salt are the
                    rock-salt deposits of the Juf (especially Taudeni), the lakes of Kufra, and the
                    rock-salt and brine of Kawar (Bilma).</p>
