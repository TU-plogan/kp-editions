                    wrote commentaries on Apollonius; and that he lived before Marinus—the pupil of
                    Proclus—as appears from the preface of Marinus to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Data</hi> of Euclid.” Montucla says vaguely that Serenus lived within the first
                    four centuries of the Christian era. Chasles places him about the same time as
                    Pappus. Bretschneider pointed out that Antissa was completely destroyed by the
                    Romans in 167 B.C., and inferred thence that Serenus lived <hi rend="italic"
                    >c.</hi> 220- 180 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> To this inference it has been
                    fairly objected by Cantor, after F. Blass, that the name Serenus is Latin and
                    that Antissa had been rebuilt at the time of Strabo. The statement of Halley
                    that “he lived before Marinus” has been since repeated by many writers; but
                    Heiberg has pointed out <hi rend="italic">(Rev. Crit. d'Hist. et de Litt.,</hi>
                    1881, p. 381) that the passage referred to in support of this statement is
                    faulty, and that the name of Serenus is certainly not to be found in it. Th. H.
                    Martin, in his edition of the <hi rend="italic">Astronomy</hi> of Theon of
                    Smyrna (Paris, 1849), has published a fragment which in the MS. follows the text
                    of Theon and is headed <hi rend="italic">From the Lemmas of the Philosopher
                    Serenus.</hi> This is unquestionably the same as Serenus of Antissa, to whom
                    this appellation “philosopher” is given in the titles of the two treatises
                    edited by Halley. No conclusion, however, can be drawn from this as to the date
                    of Serenus, for the extract is not given by Theon but by an anonymous scholiast.
                    M. Paul Tannery in an elaborate paper <hi rend="italic">(Bull. des Sc. Math. et
                    Astron.,</hi> 2d series, vii., 1883) has shown from the character of Serenus’s
                    writings that he lived long after the brilliant period of Greek mathematics, and
                    that he must be placed chronologically between Pappus and Hypatia, consequently
                    in the 4th century. This determination of the date of Serenus is accepted by
                    Cantor <hi rend="italic">(Zeitschrift für Math. und Phys.,</hi> August 1885, p.
                    124).</p>
                <p>In the treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Section of the Cone,</hi> which is the
                    less important of the two books, Serenus, as he tells us in the preface, was the
                    first to take up the particular branch of that subject with which he deals. In
                    it he treats of the area of a triangle formed by cutting a cone, right or
                    scalene, on a circular base by a plane through the vertex. He shows how “to cut
                    a right cone whose axis is not less than the semi-diameter of the base by a
                    plane through the vertex so that the triangle thus formed shall be equal to a
                    given triangle” (Prop. 8), or “a maximum” (Prop. 13). He then considers the case
                    of the scalene cone, solves the problem “to cut a given scalene cone by a plane
                    through the vertex so as to form an isosceles triangle” (Prop. 21), and shows
                    that, “of the triangles which are formed by cutting a scalene cone through the
                    axis, the greatest is the isosceles, the least that which is at right angles to
                    the base of the cone; of the rest, however, that which is nearer the greatest is
                    greater than one more remote” (Prop. 22). The general questions for a scalene
                    cone, corresponding to the problems for the right cone (Props. 8 and 13), and
                    which depend on solid loci for their solution, are not attempted. These have
                    been solved by Halley in his edition of Serenus, p. 68 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi></p>
                <p>In his preface to the treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Section of the
                    Cylinder,</hi> Serenus tells us that many geometers of his time supposed that
                    the transverse sections of a cylinder were different from the elliptic sections
                    of a cone, that he thought it right to refute this error and to prove that these
                    sections were of the same kind. Having established this in a series of theorems
                    ending with Prop. 18, he shows in Prop. 19 that “it is possible to exhibit a
                    cone and a cylinder cutting one another in one and the same ellipse.” He then
                    solves problems such as—“given a cone (cylinder) and an ellipse on it, to find
                    the cylinder (cone) which is cut in the same ellipse as the cone (cylinder)”
                    (Props. 20, 21); “given a cone (cylinder), to find a cylinder (cone), and to cut
                    both by one and the same plane so that the sections thus formed shall be similar
                    ellipses” (Props. 22, 23); “given a cylinder cut in an ellipse, to construct a
                    cone having the same base and altitude as the cylinder, so that the section of
                    it by the same plane is an ellipse similar to the ellipse of the cylinder”
                    (Prop. 25). In Props. 26-29 he shows how to cut a scalene cylinder or cone in an
                    infinite number of ways by two planes—which are not parallel—so as to form
                    similar ellipses (subcontrary sections). He then gives some theorems: “all the
                    straight lines drawn from the same point to touch a cylindrical surface, on both
                    sides, have their points of contact on the sides of a single parallelogram”
                    (Prop. 31); “all the straight lines drawn from the same point to touch a conical
                    surface, on both sides, have their points of contact on the sides of a single
                    triangle” (Prop. 34). This last is proved by means of Prop. 33, where we find,
                    indirectly stated, the property of an harmonic pencil.</p>
