                    and on the N.W. being determined by the Rhone and its affluents the Fier and the
                    Guier. The highest point in the Vanoise group of mountains is 12,668 feet above
                    the sea, while the Rhone leaves the department at a height of 695 feet, and the
                    Isère about 800. Some details in regard to the orography will be found under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Alps</hi> (q.v.). The Isère flows east and west through the
                    Tarentaise valley by Bourg St Maurice, Moutiers, Albertville, and Montmelian;
                    its principal tributary the Arc flows along the Maurienne valley used by the
                    Mont Cenis Railway. The lake of Bourget discharges into the Rhone by the
                    Savières canal. The climate of the department varies according to altitude and
                    exposure. At Chambéry and Aix-les-Bains the average temperature is a little
                    lower than that of Paris, but the rainfall is about 65 inches per annum, and
                    this amount goes on increasing as the higher regions are reached.</p>
                <p>With a total area of 1,423,254 acres, Savoy comprises 434,921 acres of
                    uncultivated ground, 239,700 acres of arable, 205,105 in forests, 172,980 in
                    meadows, 27,183 in vineyards. More than the half of the inhabitants (194,704 out
                    of 266,438) are engaged in agriculture. In 1881 there were in the department
                    97,487 cows, 19,328 oxen, 2570 horses, 3156 asses, 4207 mules, 98,826 sheep, (40
                    tons of wool), 19,428 pigs, 25,527 goats. About 1,870,000,000 gallons of milk
                    are produced and 2463 tons of butter and 5911 tons of cheese are manufactured,
                    of a total value of £500,000. From the 19,600 beehives were obtained in 1881 87
                    tons of honey and 16 of wax. The grape ripens up to an altitude of 2625 feet,
                    and is cultivated to an altitude of 3940. Several growths of Savoy are in great
                    repute and the vineyards were (before the invasion of the phylloxera) one of the
                    most important products of the department. Tobacco is also cultivated. In 1883
                    the crops comprised wheat, 404,665 bushels; meslin, 104,500; rye, 679,668;
                    barley, 212,883; buckwheat, 20,641; maize, 245,245; oats, 722,067; potatoes,
                    1,244,603; pulse, 54,120; chestnuts, 72,036; beetroot, 14,040 tons; tobacco, 350
                    tons; hemp, 585 tons; colza-seed, 284 tons; hempseed, 195 tons; wine, 3,895,496
                    gallons (annual average 4,128,520 gallons); cider, 137,258 gallons (average
                    69,058 gallons). Notwithstanding deplorable clearances, Savoy still possesses
                    considerable woods of pine, larch, beech, &amp;c. The chestnut, of which the
                    finest specimens are in the neighbourhood of Aix-les-Bains, grows, as do also
                    the walnut and hazel, to a height of 3600 feet, the oak to 3900, the elm and the
                    ash to 4250, the fir to 4900, and the pine to 7200. The department contains one
                    of the richest deposits of spathic iron in Europe, and the Creusot Company
                    employs 700 hands in working it. Argentiferous lead and copper have also been
                    occasionally worked. The Maurienne and the Tarcntaise are rich in anthracite,
                    and yielded in 1882 16,687 tons of fuel. Peat covers 1413 acres, with a
                    thickness varying from 8 inches to 8 feet, and there are rich beds of different
                    kinds of marble, fifty-two quarries of building stone, and quarries of
                    limestone, plaster, cement, and slate, as well as deposits of black lead, jet,
                    asbestos, talc, mica, ochre, sulphate of baryta, zinc, antimony, arsenic,
                    manganese, titanium, sulphur. The department is particularly rich in mineral
                    waters, and the most famous, those of Aix-les-Bains (hot sulphurous) were
                    frequented in the time of the Romans. The waters at Marlioz in the neighbourhood
                    are sulphurous or alkaline (iodine, bromine). Those of Challes near Chambéry
                    rank among the most powerful of the natural sulphurous waters. The Sal
                    ins-Moutiers waters in the Tarentaise are hot, saline, and rich in various
                    minerals; the hot springs of Brides-les-Bains in the same region are rich in the
                    sulphates of soda and calcium. Silk is the leading object of industry in the
                    department (31 tons of cocoons in 1883). The winding of the cocoons, the milling
                    of the silk (3500 “tavalles” and spindles), and the weaving of the silk-fabrics
                    (803 looms, 55 being hand-looms) employ more than 1700 workmen, and the goods
                    manufactured are valued at £380,000. Chambéry produces 71,000 yards of
                    high-class gauze, 3000 yards of velvet, 13,000 yards of handkerchiefs, and some
                    800,000 yards of taffetas and various other silk stuffs. Linen manufactures
                    employ 400 looms, woollen manufactures 1850 spindles. The peasants manufacture
                    about 125,000 yards of coarse woollen stuffs from their home-grown wool. The
                    blast furnaces and iron-works produced in 1881 176 tons of manufactured iron.
                    Tanneries, paper-mills, paperpulp factories, brick-works, saw-mills,
                    flour-mills, &amp;c., are all of some importance in the department, which counts
                    altogether sixty-one establishments with steam-engines of (aggregate) 271 horse
                    power. The number of inhabitants engaged in industrial pursuits is 24,482, in
                    commerce 14,016. Coal, skins, cotton, provisions are imported; cattle, cheese,
                    butter, wood, stones, and various building materials, mineral waters, silk
                    stuffs, tanned leather, and paper are exported. There are 204 miles of national
                    roads, 2518 miles of other roads, and 150 miles of railroad. The population was
                    266,438 in 1881. The department forms the three dioceses of Chambéry
                    (archbishopric), Moutiers, and St Jean-de-Maurienne; the court of appeal and
                    university academy are at Chambéry, and the headquarters of the corps d’armée to
                    which it belongs (the 14th) are at Grenoble. There are four
                    arrondissements,—Chambéry (16,000 inhabitants in the town), Albertville (5000),
                    Moutiers (2000), St Jean-de-Maurienne (3000),—29 cantons, and 328 communes.
                    Aix-les-Bains (4741), owing to its hot springs, is the most important place in
                    the department.</p>
