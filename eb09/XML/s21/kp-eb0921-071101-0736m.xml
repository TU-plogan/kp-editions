                    &amp;c., and the waste water of industrial processes; (4) surface water due to
                    rainfall. Before the use of underground conduits became general, the third and
                    fourth constituents were commonly allowed to sink into the neighbouring ground,
                    or to find their way by surface channels to a watercourse or to the sea. The
                    first and second constituents were conserved in middens or pits, either together
                    or separately, and were carried away from time to time to be applied as manure
                    to the land. In more modern times the pits in which excrement was collected took
                    the form of covered tanks called cesspools, and with this modification the
                    primitive system of conservancy, with occasional removal by carts, is still to
                    be found in many towns. Even where the plan of removing excrement by sewers has
                    teen adopted, the first kind of refuse named above is still treated by
                    collecting it in pails or bins, whose contents are removed by carts either daily
                    or at longer intervals. It therefore forms no part of the nearly liquid sewage
                    which the other constituents unite to form.</p>
                <p>The second constituent is from an agricultural point of view the most valuable,
                    and from a hygienic point of view the most dangerous, element of sewage. Even
                    healthy excreta decompose, if kept for a short time after they are produced, and
                    give rise to noxious gases; but a more serious danger proceeds from the fact
                    that in certain cases of sickness these products are charged with specific germs
                    of disease. Speedy removal or destruction of excremental sewage is therefore
                    imperative. It may be removed in an unmixed state, either in pails or tanks or
                    (with the aid of pneumatic pressure) by pipes; or it may be defecated by mixture
                    with dry earth or ashes; or, finally, it may be conveyed away in sewers by
                    gravitation, after the addition of a relatively large volume of water. This last
                    mode of disposal is termed the water-carriage system of sewerage. It is the plan
                    now usually adopted in towns which have a sufficient water supply, and it is
                    probably the mode which best meets the needs of any large community. The sewers
                    which carry the diluted excreta serve also to take slop-water, and may or may
                    not be used to remove the surface water due to rainfall. The water-carriage
                    system has the disadvantage that much of the agricultural value of sewage is
                    lost by its dilution, while the volume of foul matter to be disposed of is
                    greatly increased. But it has been found that, even when the excrement of a
                    community is kept out of the sewers, and subjected to distinct treatment, the
                    contents of the sewers are still so foul that their discharge into streams is
                    scarcely less objectionable than when the water-carriage system is adopted; and,
                    further, it appears difficult if not impossible to realize the agricultural
                    value of excrement by any process of separate treatment that is not offensive or
                    dangerous or inapplicable to towns.</p>
                <p>When, in the water-carriage system, the same sewers carry foul sewage and
                    surface-water due to rainfall, the sewerage is said to be “combined”; the
                    “separate” system, on the other hand, is that in which a distinct set of sewers
                    is provided to carry off rainfall. Each plan has its advantages. In the separate
                    system the foul-water sewers need be large enough to take only the normal flow;
                    they may thus be made self-cleansing much more readily than if their size were
                    sufficient to carry the immensely greater volume to which (on the combined plan)
                    sewage may be swollen during heavy rain. The amount of dangerously foul matter
                    is also much reduced. On the other hand, the contents of the rain-water sewers
                    are still too much tainted by the filth of the streets to render their discharge
                    into rivers or lakes desirable; and the complication of two sets of mains and
                    branches is a serious drawback. Where old sewers are giving place to new ones it
                    is not unusual to retain the old sewers for the carriage of surface-water; but
                    in new works a single system of sewers, provided with storm-overflows to relieve
                    them of part of the rainfall during exceptionally heavy showers, would probably
                    be preferred in nearly every case.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    diluted that it becomes a matter of the utmost difficulty to turn them to
                    profitable account. It has been estimated that every ton of London sewage
                    contains ingredients whose value as manure is rather more than 2d.,<note

                    the metropolis worth a million and three quarters sterling per annum. Sewage
                    farming, however, does not pay. After much costly experiment the conviction is
                    gaining ground that, neither by applying sewage directly to land, nor by any
                    process of chemical treatment that has yet been proposed, can sewage be made to
                    yield a return as manure which will cover the cost of its transport, treatment,
                    and distribution, except perhaps in a few cases where the circumstances are
                    peculiarly favourable. At the same time, sewage farming does afford one
                    satisfactory solution of the problem of how to dispose of sewage without
                    creating a nuisance—a problem in which any question of profit or loss is of
                    secondary importance. A very early instance of irrigation by sewage is that of
                    the Craigentinny Meadows, a sandy tract of 400 acres, on which part of the
                    sewage of Edinburgh has been discharged during certain seasons for nearly a
                    century. There, owing to favourable conditions, and to the fact that complete
                    purification of the sewage is not attempted, the process yields a profit; but no
                    such result could be looked for if the sea were not at hand to receive the
                    imperfectly cleansed sewage and the wholly uncleansed surplus. Germany furnishes
                    a still older example of irrigation in the sewage farm of the town of Bunzlau,
                    which has been in existence for more than three hundred years.</p>
                <p>Five methods of treating sewage may be named, of which two or more are often
                    found in combination.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Discharge into the Sea</hi> or into a large watercourse is in
                    general the least costly means by which a community can rid itself of its
                    sewage. Much care in the choice of outlets is necessary to make this plan
                    effective in avoiding nuisance. Some towns make use of tanks or outlet sowers of
                    large capacity, from which the discharge is allowed to occur only when the tide
                    is ebbing. When the volume of sewage is very large, even this precaution does
                    not wholly protect the neighbouring coast from foul deposits. A striking
                    instance is furnished by the case of London, which discharges its sewage into
                    the tidal estuary of the Thames at Barking and Crossness during only some three
                    or four hours from the time of each high tide. It is found that the discharged
                    matter is washed up and down the river with every tide, occasionally reaching as
                    far up as Teddington, and that the portion which is not deposited in the form of
                    mud banks only very slowly works its way to the sea.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Broad Irrigation.—</hi> By this is meant the use of sewage to
                    irrigate a comparatively large tract of cultivated land, in the proportion of
                    about 1 acre (or more) of land to every 120 persons in the sewage-contributing
                    population. This system is now largely and successfully used, especially where
                    the soil is a porous sandy loam. Fears that the farms would prove dangerous to
                    the health of the neighbouring district, and that the crops and vegetables grown
                    on them would be unwholesome, have proved groundless. When the farm is properly
                    laid out and carefully managed the effluent water is pure enough to be admitted
                    to a clear stream from which water-supply is drawn. Broad irrigation is
                    practised at Croydon, Cheltenham, Blackburn, and many other English towns; and
                    it has recently been applied, on a very large scale, to dispose of the sewage of
                    Berlin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Intermittent Downward Filtration.—</hi> This is another mode of
                    purifying sewage by applying it to land, which differs from broad irrigation in
                    requiring a much smaller area in proportion to the sewage dealt with. In 1870 Dr
                    Frankland<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Report of the Rivers Pollution Commissioners,</hi>
                    1870.</p></note> drew attention to the fact that if sewage were passed through
                    porous soil, not continuously but at intervals long enough to let the soil
                    become aerated, rapid purification took place through the oxidizing action of
                    the air which the soil held in its pores. He estimated that an acre of suitable
                    ground, well furnished with subsoil drains to remove the water after
                    percolation, could in this way take the sewage of 2000 persons. This estimate is
                    now considered excessive, and 1000 persons to the acre is a more recent limit.
                    Mr J. Bailey-Denton at once took up Dr Frankland’s suggestion, and in his hands
                    the system of intermittent filtration through land has been successfully applied
                    to the sewage of many towns.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>J. Bailey-Denton, <hi rend="italic">Intermittent Downward
                    Filtration, with notes on the Practice and Results of Sewage Farming,</hi> 1st
                    ed., 1880, 2nd ed. 1885. </p></note>The land which constitutes the filter is
                    used to grow vegetables and other crops. Clay soils are, as far as possible,
                    avoided, and the land is thoroughly underdrained at a depth of about 6 feet. The
                    sewage is distributed over the surface in open channels, the proper laying out
                    of which is an important item in the cost of the system, but is essential to its
                    success. When the number of persons exceeds 500 per acre it is advisable to
                    precipitate the solid matter that is held in suspension before the liquid is
                    applied to the land, in order to prevent the surface of the ground from becoming
                    clogged with sewage sludge. Mr Bailey-Denton has pointed out the advantage which
                    the system of intermittent filtration offers as a supplement to broad
                    irrigation, where that is carried out. A serious objection to the disposal of
                    sewago by irrigation is the fact that the farmer must take the sewage always,—at
                    times when it hurts the land as well as at times when the land wants it. But by
                    laying out a portion of the land as a filter bed the sewage may bo thrown on
                    that whenever its presence on the remainder would do harm rather than good. Mr
                    Denton has applied this combined system in several instances, and insists,
                    apparently with much reason, that such a combination offers a better prospect of
                    profit than any other efficient mode of purifying sewage. The system of
                    intermittent filtration through land has been recommended by the Royal
                    Commission of 1882-84 as a mode of treating Loudon sewage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Filtration through Artificial Filters</hi> of sand, gravel,
                    ashes, charcoal, coke, peat, &amp;c., though often experimented on, can scarcely
                    be described as an actual system. It is attended by the difficulty that the
                    filter becomes speedily choked by the deposit of sludge. The intermittent use of
                    a suitable artificial filter will, however, servo efficiently to oxidize and
                    therefore purify the liquid portion of sewage from which the sludge has been
                    previously precipitated and filtration through coke is used in some instances as
                    a supplement to the process which is next to be described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemical Treatment, or Precipitation.—</hi> When sewage is
                    allowed to stand, or to flow very slowly through a large tank, a gradual
                    subsidence of the solid particles takes place. The subsidence is, however, much
                    too slow to be complete before decomposition sets in. But it may be very greatly
                    accelerated by the addition of certain reagents, with the object of producing a
                    precipitate which, in falling, will carry down with it the minute particles of
                    solid matter that are suspended throughout the mass. Lime is the substance most
                    usually employed. It is introduced in the form of milk of lime, and in the
                    proportion of about one ton of lime to one million gallons of sewage. When
                    thoroughly mixed, the liquid is left at rest, and a rapid separation of the
                    sewage follows, into a comparatively clear supernatant liquid and a glutinous
                    precipitate or “sludge.” The sludge has little value as manure, for the best
                    agricultural constituents of sewage are contained in solution, and very little
                    of the soluble matter is carried down in the deposit. The sludge is dried by
                    being strained over beds of slag, pressed into blocks for transport, and got rid
                    of by being burnt or dug into the ground or thrown into the sea. It has been
                    used in the manufacture of bricks and of cement (Scott’s process), but in
                    general it can be disposed of only at a loss. The clarified effluent still
                    contains dissolved organic matter, and may be admitted into running streams only
                    when a high standard of purity is not compulsory. When, however, the volume of
                    the running water which it enters is relatively very large a quick purification
                    takes place by means of the oxygen which the water carries in solution.</p>
                <p>The lime process is practised, without further purification of the effluent
                    water, at Leeds and at Burnley. At Bradford, after precipitation by lime, the
                    effluent is filtered through beds of coke-breeze. At Birmingham the sewage of
                    600,000 people, after clarification by lime (which also serves to neutralize the
                    acid contributed by manufactories), is used to irrigate a farm of 1200
                    acres.</p>
                <p>Very many patents have been obtained for the precipitation of sewage by other
                    chemicals in place of or in addition to lime. In Hillé's process lime is the
                    chief ingredient, with tar and chloride of magnesium or calcium added. At
                    Coventry the precipitants are sulphate of alumina, protosulphate of iron, and
                    lime, and the effluent is afterwards filtered through land, in the proportion of
                    1 acre to 5000 of the population.</p>
                <p>Sillar’s “ABC” process, worked by the Native Guano Company at Aylesbury, differs
                    from others in producing a sludge which has considerable value as manure. An
                    emulsion of clay and carbon with a little blood is first mixed with the sewage;
                    a precipitating solution of alum is then added, and the mixture <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n738/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0738-0713"/> is allowed to settle. The process gives a
                    remarkably clear effluent; practically the whole of the insoluble constituents
                    of the sewage and a portion of the dissolved impurities are carried down in the
                    precipitate, which, when dried and ground along with some sulphate of magnesia,
                    is sold under the name of native guano. The ABC process has been in successful
                    use for nine years at Aylesbury, where the “guano” finds a sale at 70s. per ton.
                    In 1870 the Rivers Pollution Commissioners reported unfavourably on the process,
                    a fact which may have prevented its adoption by other towns, but it has since
                    then received the approval of many specialists. A recent protracted
                    investigation by Dr C. M. Tidy and Prof. Dewar showed that the percentage of
                    oxidizable organic matter removed by the process ranges from 75 to 86—a result,
                    in their judgment, satisfactory. At Leeds, where the process was tried for a
                    time, it was given up because the effluent was purer than the river into which
                    it ran, and the simple lime-process, which costs less but gives a less clear
                    effluent, was adopted in its place.</p>
                <p>Much difference of opinion still exists as to the relative merits of broad
                    irrigation, filtration through land, and chemical treatment, as means of
                    disposing of sewage. That either of the two first plans or a combination of them
                    both can be made to yield a satisfactory solution of the sewage problem, from a
                    hygienic point of view, seems unquestionable. That chemical treatment,
                    especially if supplemented by filtration through land, will also purify well, is
                    generally admitted. No process of effective purification is now expected to
                    yield a profit; but the question of cost, on which the choice of a system
                    principally turns, is too extensive to be touched in this article.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Conveyance of Sewage.</hi> —For small sewers,
                    circular pipes of glazed earthenware or fire-clay or of moulded cement are used,
                    from 6 inches to 18 inches and even 20 inches in diameter. The pipes are made in
                    short lengths, and are usually jointed by passing the end or spigot of one into
                    the socket or faucet of the next. Into the space between the spigot and faucet a
                    ring of gasket or tarred hemp should be forced, and the rest of the space filled
                    up with cement, not clay. The gasket prevents the cement from entering the pipe,
                    and so obstructing the flow; at the same time it forms an elastic packing which
                    serves to keep the successive lengths of pipe concentric, even if the cement
                    should fail. The pipes are laid with the spigot ends pointing in the direction
                    of the flow, with a uniform gradient, and, where practicable, in straight lines.
                    In special positions, such as under the bed of a stream, cast-iron pipes are
                    used for the conveyance of sewage. Where the capacity of an 18-inch circular
                    pipe would be insufficient, built sewers are used in place of earthenware pipes.
                    These are sometimes circular or oval, but more commonly of an egg-shaped
                    section, the invert or lower side of the sewer being a curve of shorter radius
                    than the arch or upper side. The advantage of this form lies in the fact that
                    great variations in the volume of flow must be expected, and the egg-section
                    presents for the small or dry-weather flow a narrower channel than would be
                    presented by a circular sewer of the same total capacity. Figs. 1 and 2 show two
                    common forms of egg-sections, with dimensions expressed in terms of the diameter
                    of the arch. Fig. 2 is the more modern form, and has the advantage of a sharper
                    invert. The ratio of width to height is 2 to 3.</p>
                <p>Built sewers are most commonly made of bricks, moulded to suit the curved
                    structure of which they are to form part. Separate invert blocks of glazed
                    earthenware, terra-cotta, or fire-clay are often used in combination with
                    brickwork. The bricks are laid over a templet made to the section of the sewer,
                    and are grouted with cement. An egg-shaped sewer, made with two thicknesses of
                    brick, an invert block, and a concrete setting, is illustrated in fig.</p>
                <p>3. Concrete is now very largely used in the construction of sewers, either in
                    combination with brickwork or alone.</p>
                <p>For this purpose the concrete consists of from 5 to 7 parts of sand and gravel or
                    broken stone to 1 of Portland cement. It may be used as a cradle for or as a
                    backing to a brick ring, or as the sole material of construction by running it
                    into position round a mould which is removed when the concrete is sufficiently
                    set, the inner surface of the sewer being in this case coated with a thin layer
                    of cement.</p>
                <p>In determining the dimensions of sewers, the amount of sewage proper may be taken
                    as equal to the water supply (generally about 30 gallons per head per diem), and
                    to this must be added an allowance for the surface water due to rainfall. The
                    latter, which is generally by far the larger constituent, is to be estimated
                    from the maximum rate of rainfall for the district and from the area and
                    character of the surface. In the sewerage of Berlin, for example, (one of the
                    most recent instances of the combined water-carriage system applied on a large
                    scale), the maximum rainfall allowed for is ⅞ of an inch per hour, of which
                    one-third is supposed to enter the sewers. In any estimate of the size of sewers
                    based on rainfall account must of course be taken of the relief provided by
                    storm-overflows, and also of the capacity of the sewers to become simply charged
                    with water during the short time to which very heavy showers are invariably
                    limited. Rainfall at the rate of 5 or 6 inches per hour has been known to occur
                    for a few minutes, but it is altogether unnecessary to provide (even above
                    storm-overflows) sewers capable of discharging any such amount as this; the time
                    taken by sewers of more moderate size to fill would of itself prevent the
                    discharge from them from reaching a condition of steady flow; and, apart from
                    this, the risk of damage by such an exceptional fall would not warrant so great
                    an initial expenditure. Engineers differ widely in their estimates of the
                    allowance to be made for the discharge of surface water, and no rule can be laid
                    down which would be of general application.</p>
                <p>In order that sewers should be self-cleansing, the mean velocity of flow should
                    be not less than 2 ½ feet per second. The gradient I necessary to secure this is
                    calculated on principles which have been stated in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hydkomechanics (q.v.).</hi> The velocity of flow,</p>
                <p>V, is V— <hi rend="italic">c√im,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is the
                    inclination, or ratio of vertical to horizontal distance; <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> is the “hydraulic mean depth,” or the ratio of area of section of the
                    stream to the wetted perimeter; and c is a coefficient depending on the
                    dimensions and the roughness of the channel and the depth of the stream. A table
                    of values of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> will be found in § 90 of the article
                    referred to. This velocity multiplied by the area of the stream gives the rate
                    of discharge. Tables to facilitate the determination of velocity and discharge
                    in sewers of various dimensions, forms, and gradients will be found in Mr
                    Latham’s an∣l other practical treatises.</p>
                <p>Where the contour of the ground does not admit of a sufficient gradient from the
                    gathering ground to the place of destination, the sewage must be pumped to a
                    higher level at one or more points in its course. To minimize this necessity,
                    and also for other reasons, it is frequently desirable not to gather sewage from
                    the whole area into a single main, but to collect the sewage of higher portions
                    of the town by a separate high-level or interception sewer.</p>
                <p>Sewer gas is a term applied to the air, fouled by mixture with gases which are
                    formed by the decomposition of sewage, and by the organic germs which it carries
                    in suspension, that fills the sewer in the variable space above the liquid
                    stream. It is universally recognized that sewer gas is a medium for the
                    conveyance<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n739/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0739-0714"/> of disease, and in all well-designed systems of
                    sewerage stringent precautions (which will be presently described) are taken to
                    keep it out of houses. It is equally certain that the dangerous character of
                    sewer gas is reduced, if not entirely removed, by free admixture with the oxygen
                    of fresh air. Sewers should be liberally ventilated, not only for this reason,
                    but to prevent the air within them from ever having its pressure raised (by
                    sudden influx of water) so considerably as to force the “traps” which separate
                    it from the atmosphere of dwellings. The plan of ventilation now most approved
                    is the very simple one of making openings from the sewer to the surface of the
                    street at short distances,—generally shafts built of brick and cement,—and
                    covering these with metallic gratings. Under each grating it is usual to hang a
                    box or tray to catch any stones or dirt that may fall through from the street,
                    but the passage of air to and from the sewer is left as free as possible. The
                    openings to the street are frequently made large enough to allow a man to go
                    down to examine or clean the sewers, and are then called “manholes.” Smaller
                    openings, large enough to allow a lamp to be lowered for purposes of inspection,
                    are called “lampholes,” and are often built up of vertical lengths of
                    drain-pipe.</p>
                <p>the tank accumulates so that it reaches the top of the annular siphon, and begins
                    to flow over the lip, it carries with it enough air to produce a partial vacuum
                    in the tube. The siphon then bursts into action, and a rapid discharge takes
                    place, which continues till the water level sinks to the foot of the bell-shaped
                    cover.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Domestic Sewerage.</hi> —In the water-carriage system
                    each house has its own network of drain-pipes, soil-pipes, and waste-pipes,
                    which lead from the basins, sinks, closets, and gullies within and about the
                    house to the common sewer. These must be planned to remove sewage from the house
                    and its precincts quickly and without leakage or deposit by the way; the air
                    within them must be kept out of the dwelling, by placing a water-trap at every
                    opening through which sewage is to enter the pipes, and by making all internal
                    pipes gas-tight; the pipes must be freely ventilated by a current of fresh air,
                    in order to oxidize any deposited filth and to dilute any noxious gas they may
                    contain; finally— and this is of prime importance—the air of the common sewer
                    must be rigorously shut out from all drains and pipes within the house. To
                    disconnect the pipes of each individual house from the atmosphere of the common
                    sewer is the first principle of sound domestic sanitation. When this is done the
                    house is safe from contagion from without, so far as contagion can come through
                    sewer gas; and, however faulty in other respects the internal fittings may be,
                    the house can suffer no other risk than that which arises from its own
                    sewage.</p>
                <p>Protection against the passage of gas through openings which admit of the entry
                    of water is secured by the familiar device known as the water-trap.</p>
                <p>The simplest and in many respects the best form of trap is a bent pipe or
                    inverted siphon (fig. 5) which is sealed by water lying in the bend. The amount
                    of the seal (measured by the vertical distance between the lines <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b)</hi> varies in practice from about
                    A an inch to 3 inches. If the pressure of air within the pipe, below</p>
                <p>To facilitate inspection and cleaning, sewers are, as far as possible, laid in
                    straight lines of uniform gradient, with a manhole or lamphole at each change of
                    direction or of slope and at each junction of mains with one another or with
                    branches. The sewers may advantageously be stepped here and there at manholes.
                    Sir R. Rawlinson has pointed ont that a difference of level between the entrance
                    and exit pipes tends to prevent continuous flow of sewer gas towards the higher
                    parts of the system, and makes the ventilation of each section more independent
                    and thorough. When the gradient is slight, and the dry-weather flow very small,
                    occasional flushing must be resorted to. Flap valves or sliding penstocks are
                    introduced at manholes: by closing these for a short time sewage (or clean water
                    introduced for the purpose) is dammed up behind the valve either in higher parts
                    of the sewer or in a special flushing chamber, and is then allowed to advance
                    with a rush. Many self-acting arrangements for flushing have been devised which
                    act by allowing a continuous stream of comparatively small volume to accumulate
                    in a tank that discharges itself suddenly when full. A very valuable contrivance
                    of this kind is Mr Rogers Field’s siphon flush tank, shown in fig. 4. When the
                    liquid in the trap, is greater than that of the air above the trap by an amount
                    exceeding the pressure due to a column of water equal in height to the seal, the
                    trap will be forced and air will bubble through. This is one way in which a trap
                    may fail, but this may be prevented bv sufficient ventilation of the pipe below
                    the trap. Other possibilities of failure are, however, only too numerous.</p>
                <p>If the pipe is disused for some time, the water may evaporate so considerably as
                    to break the seal. The pipe, if of lead, may bend out of shape, or it may even
                    be so badly set in the first instance as to make the trap inoperative. The seal
                    may be broken by the capillary action of a thread or strip of cloth, hang ing
                    over the lip of the trap and causing the water to drain away.</p>
                <p>A rush of water down the pipe, suddenly arrested, may pass the trap with such
                    momentum as to leave it wholly or partly empty.</p>
                <p>Another and a common cause of failure can be explained by re ference to fig. 5.
                    Let a column of water rush down the soil-pipe <hi rend="italic">c</hi> from a
                    closet or sink which discharges into it at some higher point. As the water
                    passes the junction with the branch <hi rend="italic">d</hi> it will produce a
                    partial vacuum in the branch, and so tend to suck over the contents of the trap.
                    This process, which is sometimes called the siphonage of traps, can be guarded
                    against by ventilating the branch, either by a separate ventilating pipe leading
                    to the open air or by a pipe <hi rend="italic">e</hi> (shown by dotted lines)
                    connecting the top of the branch <hi rend="italic">d</hi> with a point
                    sufficiently far up on the soil-pipe to be above the column of water which is
                    passing the junction. One more imperfection in traps may be named. The
                    experiments of Dr Fergus have shown that the water in traps will allow gases to
                    pass through by absorbing the gas on one surface and giving it off at the other.
                    It is improbable that this action occurs to such an extent as to be dangerous by
                    permitting the transfer of disease germs from one to the other side. Apart from
                    any risk of this kind, however, it is clear that a trap is open to so many
                    possibilities of failure as to form a very insufficient barrier between the air
                    of a room and the foul air of a sewer. Nevertheless the practice was until very
                    lately almost universal, and is still far from uncommon, of connecting closets,
                    sinks, and<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n740/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0740-0715"/> even bedroom basins with common sewers by a
                    continuous system of piping, in which the only safeguard against the entry of
                    sewer gas is a single trap close to each sink or basin. This means that sewer
                    gas, charged with the infection of a whole community, is brought within a few
                    inches of the atmosphere of the dwelling, ready to contaminate it whenever the
                    trap fails from any of the causes which have been named, or whenever, by a flow
                    of water through it, the seal is sufficiently disturbed to allow bubbles of gas
                    to escape into the room.</p>
                <p>The remedy for this lies in having, at any convenient point on each house-drain,
                    a disconnecting trap which separates the house system from the sewer, and so
                    establishes what may be called an outer line of defence. Any accidental leakage
                    of sewer gas through it then does no more than cause a comparatively slight
                    pollution of the air within the house-drains, and if these are well ventilated
                    the effects of this are insensible. At each individual basin or other fitting a
                    trap is still required, but its function is now merely to shut out the air of
                    the house-drains from the rooms, and, as the air of the house-drains is no
                    longer polluted by connexion with the servers, the occasional failure of this
                    function is a matter of com paratively small moment. Further, the dis connecting
                    trap on the house-drain furnishes a convenient place of access for fresh air;
                    and the ventilation is completed by carrying the highest point of each soil-pipe
                    or waste-pipe up to the level of the roof and leaving it open there. This
                    arrangement will be understood by reference to fig. 6, which shows a soil-pipe,
                    open at its upper end, discharging into a house-drain in which there is a
                    disconnecting trap provided with an open grating for the entry of air. The
                    soil-pipe is ventilated by a current of air which (usually if not always)</p>
                <p>flows upwards. This not only dilutes any gases that are produced in the pipe, but
                    quickly oxidizes any foul matter that may adhere to the sides. Care must be
                    taken to avoid having the upper end of the pipe open near windows or under
                    eaves. In the figure the branch leading to a water-closet is ventilated by a
                    pipe carried into an upper part of the soil-pipe; this is scarcely necessary if
                    the branch be short. Another construction is to carry a distinct ventilating
                    pipe up from the top of the branch to a point above the roof; and where several
                    fittings discharge into one soil-pipe, the same ventilating pipe may be made to
                    serve for all. An example of the latter arrangement is shown in fig. 10.</p>
                <p>The form of dis connecting trap shown in fig. 6</p>
                <p>is that of Mr</p>
                <p>W. P. Buchan of</p>
                <p>Glasgow, who has done excellent ser vice to the cause of sanitary re form by
                    practising and advocating the disconnexion and ventilation of house-drains and
                    soil-pipes. The same trap is shown to a larger scale in fig.</p>
                <p>7, where it appears imbedded in concrete and covered by a built manhole, which
                    gives ac cess to the trap in case of its becoming choked. The man hole may have
                    an open grating at the top; or the top may be closed by a solid plate (if a
                    grating there be for any reason inadmissible), in which case a ventilating shaft
                    is carried from the manhole to some other opening. Fig. 7 shows such a shaft
                    leading to a grating which is placed vertically in a neighbouring wall. Among
                    other good forms of disconnecting trap, more or less like Buchan’s, mention may
                    be made of Weaver’s, Potts’s, and Hellyer’s.</p>
                <p>An arrangement of double disconnecting trap is illustrated in fig. 8. Any sewer
                    gas forcing the trap next the sewer is still kept back by the upper trap and
                    will escape by a grating or open ventilating shaft which enters at A, while air
                    to ventilate the house-drain enters the upper trap from the manhole. This
                    arrangement no doubt gives more absolute protection than a single trap of the
                    kind already described, but it is probable that (except in cases where the
                    sewers are very foul and liable to frequent excess of pressure) the advantage is
                    so slight as to be more than counterbalanced by the greater liability to
                    accidental stoppage and greater complexity which this arrangement entails.</p>
                <p>The extent to which it is permissible or advisable in practice to allow several
                    fittings to discharge into a single waste-pipe or soil-pipe will vary in
                    different cases. We can recognize a broad distinction between sewage from
                    closets and urinals, liable to the most dangerous taint should disease occur
                    within the house, and the comparatively innocuous sewage that comes from basins,
                    baths, and sinks. Some sanitarians go so far as to advise that these two classes
                    of sewage should be kept absolutely apart within the house, by the use of a
                    complete double system of house drain-pipes. This, however, is an extreme
                    measure; no reasonable objection can be urged against the discharge into a
                    water-closet soil-pipe of water from a bath or washhand basin in the same room,
                    except perhaps that if the soil-pipe is of lead its corrosion is hastened by hot
                    water; and the additional flushing which the soil-pipe so receives is a distinct
                    advantage. But to connect a water-closet soil-pipe with sinks and basins in
                    other apartments is to multiply possibilities for the spread of disease within
                    the house, and it is strongly advisable to convey the waste from them by a
                    separate pipe, protected from the sewer by a disconnecting trap of its own with
                    a grating open to the air. This applies with special force to the washhand
                    basins that are often fixed in bedrooms and dressing-rooms. Nothing could be
                    more dangerous than the usage—of which many good houses still furnish
                    instances—of multiplying these conveniences without regard to the risk they
                    involve, and making this risk as great as possible by placing each in direct
                    communication through an ordinary trap with the soil-pipe, itself perhaps
                    unventilated and provided with no disconnexion from the sewer. Even when the
                    drain or soil-pipe is ventilated and disconnected from the sewer, no bedroom
                    basin should, under any circumstances, be allowed to discharge into it without
                    first passing a separate open trap. On the other hand, a bedroom basin may be
                    made perfectly safe by leading its waste - pipe (trapped under the basin in the
                    usual way) into an open-air channel which communicates with the sewer by a
                    surface-trap or gully outside the house (fig. 9). Similar treatment should be
                    adopted in the case of pantry and scullery sinks. Under most plumbing fixtures
                    it is usual to place a safe-tray to receive any water accidentally spilt. The
                    discharge pipes from these trays are sometimes, but very objectionably, led into
                    the waste-pipe or soil-pipe below the fixture. The proper method of providing
                    for the discharge of water spilt into the safe-tray is to lead a pipe from it
                    through the wall and allow it to end in the open air (fig. 10, where each of the
                    safe-tray drains is marked “waste-pipe ”); a flap valve fixed on the end will
                    serve, if need be, to keep out draught.</p>
                <p>Overflow-pipes from cisterns used for dietetic purposes should be led, in the
                    same way, into the open air and not into soil-pipes or waste-pipes (fig. 10).
                    Traps on them cannot be depended on to remain sealed, and any connexion of an
                    overflow-pipe with a soil-pipe would result in allowing foul air from the pipe
                    to diffuse itself over the surface of water in the cistern—a state of things
                    peculiarly likely to cause pollution of the water. When a cistern is used only
                    for water-closet service, its overflow-pipe may properly be led into the basin
                    of the closet.</p>
                <p>Rain-pipes, extending as they do to the roof, are sometimes used<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n741/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0741-0716"/> to serve as ventilating continuations of
                    soil-pipes and waste-pipes. The practice is open to serious objection, for it
                    discharges the drain air just under the eaves, at a place where air is generally
                    being drawn into the house. The ventilating end of a soil-pipe should be carried
                    to a higher level, as in fig. 6, clear of the lower edge of the roof. It is
                    better to restrict rain-pipes to their legitimate function of taking surface
                    water from the roof, or at most to allow them to receive slop-water from sinks
                    and basins, and to make them terminate in or over open traps from which a
                    connexion is taken to the house-drain or sewer (fig. 9).</p>
                <p>In figs. 10 and 11 the sanitary fittings of a small house are shown by diagrams,
                    which should be carefully studied as exemplifying a well-arranged system. Two
                    closets, and a bath and basin in the closet apartment, discharge into a
                    soil-pipe on the right, and the branches (except that of the basin) are
                    ventilated by pipes leading to a sepa rate air pipe, which, like the soil-pipe,
                    is carried above the roof. The overflow of a cistern which supplies bath, basin,
                    and boiler is carried out to the open air, and so are the waste-pipes of the
                    leaden safe-trays. A separate cistern supplies each water-closet, and its
                    overflow opens into the closet basin. A rain-pipe (in the middle of the
                    figure)</p>
                <p>receives a bedroom basin waste, and leads by a 4-inch drain to a ventilated
                    grease-box, into which the scullery sink and wash-tubs and another rain-pipe
                    also discharge.</p>
                <p>Finally, the whole system is protected by a Buchan trap in a built manhole, which
                    is covered with a grating.</p>
                <p>House-drains, that is to say, those parts of the domestic system of drainage
                    which extend from the soil-pipes and waste-pipes to the sewer, are made of
                    glazed fireclay pipes, generally 6 inches but sometimes only <hi rend="italic"
                    >4</hi> inches in diameter. A larger size than 6 inches is rarely if ever
                    desirable. The pipes are spigot-and-faucet-jointed, and the joints should be
                    made with cement in the manner already described for sewers. When, as is often
                    unavoidable, the house-drain has to pass under a part of the house, or to come
                    from back to front, iron pipes jointed with lead and coated with an
                    anti-corrosive compound are preferred to fireclay pipes, as giving a better
                    security against the production of leaks by the settling of the soil and other
                    causes. Soil-pipes, when carried down inside the house, are of either lead or
                    iron; when outside the house they are usually of iron. Au outside soil-pipe is
                    obviously preferable to an inside one; if the arrangement of the building makes
                    an inside soil-pipe necessary, care must be taken that it shall be easily
                    accessible for inspection at all parts of its length. The usual diameter is 4
                    inches. For the sake of good ventilation it is desirable to continue the
                    soil-pipe to a point above the roof without reduction of diameter rather than
                    apply a smaller ventilating pipe. Amongst reasons for ventilation one remains to
                    be mentioned,— that, owing to the corrosive action of sewer gas, the life of the
                    soil-pipe is greatly shortened if provision for the free circulation of air be
                    wanting or insufficient. A closed soil-pipe becomes in time pitted with holes,
                    especially in the upper parts of its length.</p>
                <p>Defective joints in soil-pipes and waste-pipes, particularly where they connect
                    with drains, closet-basins, sinks, &amp;c., are another frequent cause of
                    leakage. Any want of air-tightness in drains or soil-pipes within a dwelling
                    leads to the pollution of the air, not merely by diffusion, but by an actual
                    in-draught, for generally the air of the house has its pressure reduced by
                    chimney draughts to a value slightly lower than that of the air outside. The
                    house, in fact, ventilates itself by drawing in air from the pipe at any hole, a
                    fact which may easily be demonstrated by holding the flame of a taper near the
                    hole.</p>
                <p>Various experimental methods are used of detecting such leaks as would admit foul
                    air to the dwelling. Of these the best is the “smoke test.” It consists of
                    filling the house-drain, soil-pipes, and waste-pipes with a dense and pungent
                    smoke, any escape of which into the house is readily observed by eye and nose. A
                    quantity of cotton-waste soaked in oil is lighted, and its fumes are blown into
                    the house-drain by a revolving fan, at the ventilating cover of the
                    disconnecting trap, or at any other convenient opening. Smoke soon fills the
                    pipes, and begins to escape at the roof. The upper ends of the pipes are then
                    closed, and the house is searched for smoke.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A novel plan of making the smoke test has lately been
                    introduced, in which smoke is given off by a “smoke rocket” or cake of slowly
                    combustible compound which is lighted and placed in the drain.</p></note>
                    Another test, especially applicable to those parts of drains that are laid under
                    houses, is the hydraulic test, which consists in stopping up the lower end of
                    the pipe, filling it with water so as to produce a moderate pressure, and then
                    observing whether the level of the water falls. This test, however, is too
                    severe for any but new and very well constructed drains.</p>
                <p>Every basin, sink, or other fitting should bo separately trapped by a bend on the
                    waste-pipe or some other form of trap. A brass cap, screwed on a ferule which is
                    let into the pipe on the bend, facilitates cleaning (fig. 5). The warm
                    waste-water from pantry and scullery sinks contains much grease, and should be
                    discharged into a grease box (fig. 12) where the water becomes cool and deposits
                    its grease before overflowing into the drain. To collect surface water from
                    laundry floors, areas, court-yards, &amp;c., an open trap or gully is used. Fig.
                    9 shows a simple and good form of open trap; but if the water is liable to carry
                    down sand or earth a gully (fig. 13) is more suitable. Even in this simple
                    fitting a remarkable ingenuity of error has been displayed.</p>
                <p>Many of the forms favoured by builders are bad either because of an insecure
                    seal, a narrow outlet, or a tendency to gather filth. One in particular, the
                    well-known “Bell” trap, is an example of nearly everything a trap should not
                    be.</p>
                <p>Water-closets used to be almost invariably of the “pan” type, but wherever
                    sanitary reform has been preached to any purpose the pan closet is giving place
                    to cleaner and wholesomer patterns. The evils of the pan closet will be evident
                    from an inspection of fig.</p>
                <p>14. At each use of the closet the hinged pan <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is tilted
                    down so that it discharges its contents into the container <hi rend="italic"
                    >b.</hi> The sides of the container are inaccessible for cleaning, and their
                    upper portions are out of reach of the flushing action of the pan. They
                    gradually become coated with a foul deposit. A gust of tainted air escapes at
                    every use of the closet; and it rarely happens that the container is air-tight,
                    and that the filth it has gathered does not cause a smell even in intervals of
                    disuse. To make matters worse, many of the older pan closets are provided with
                    the kind of trap shown in the sketch, called the D trap, which is also liable to
                    become a gathering place for filth. Even with an ordinary trap, however, the pan
                    closet remains so bad that its use is to be strongly condemned.</p>
                <p>A much better closet is the valve or Bramah closet, an excellent<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n742/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0742-0717"/> example of which by Frew of Perth is shown in
                    fig. 15. The basin is kept partly full of water by a ground gun-metal valve
                    tightly pressed up against a conical seat at the basin’s foot.</p>
                <p>The chamber below is only large enough to allow the valve to turn down; it cannot
                    collect much foul matter and may be ventilated by a separate pipe. A trapped
                    overflow prevents the basin from being overfilled.</p>
                <p>The whole closet is trapped by an ordinary bend on the soil-pipe, which is not
                    shown in the figure. The volume of water in the basin is much greater than in
                    pan closets, where the height is limited by the overflow which occurs round the
                    lip of the pan. In some closets of this kind the valve is placed at the side,
                    and, when closed, lies nearly vertical. In another type of valve closet
                    (Jennings’s) the valve is a conical plug, pressed vertically down on a seat at
                    the side.</p>
                <p>Valve closets can be made fairly effective and satisfactory from a sanitary point
                    of view; but a much cheaper and certainly not less excellent type of closet is
                    the “washout,” an example of which (the “National”) is shown in fig. 16.
                    (Another washout closet, by Doulton, appears in fig. 6.) These are now made in a
                    great variety of good forms, sometimes of a single piece of white stoneware.
                    They combine cheapness and simplicity with a degree of sanitary perfection that
                    is probably not reached by the most expensive closets of the kinds already
                    named. They have no working parts; the closet is cleansed after use simply by
                    the flush of water, which sweeps everything before it. The flush must of course
                    be good: a l 1/2-inch service pipe from a cistern not less than 5 feet above the
                    closet will do well. In some recent designs the cistern is a box at the back of
                    the seat with a wide oval mouth leading from it to the flushing rim of the pan:
                    this gives a good flush although the cistern is low. A feature of construction
                    which may be strongly recommended is to leave the closet entirely open for
                    inspection and cleaning, instead of concealing it in a wooden case. The seat
                    then generally rests on iron brackets projecting from the wall, and can be
                    raised on hinges at the back, so that the pan may be used as a urinal or
                    slop-sink without the risk of fouling. Another good type of closet, sharing with
                    the washout the advantage of having no mechanical parts, is the “hopper,”
                    illustrated in fig. 17 (Dodd’s Hopper). In all these closets the horn marked V
                    is for attaching a ventilating pipe.</p>
                <p>For the supply of water to a closet a separate cistern is desirable, especially
                    when water for dietetic purposes is liable to be drawn from the main cistern
                    (instead of being taken direct from the water service pipe, which is better). It
                    would seem needless to add, were it not that such faults are common, that no
                    cistern—unless it be exclusively used for water-closet supply—should be placed
                    in the same room with or just under a water-closet, and that the room itself
                    should be well lighted, well ventilated, and well shut off from bedrooms. To
                    prevent flushing of closets from being imperfect through carelessness, many
                    plans have been devised for ensuring that once the flow of water is started it
                    will continue until a given volume has been discharged. One of the best of these
                    is the arrangement of siphon flush sketched in fig. 18: when the valve <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is opened the downrush of water starts the siphon <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> into action, and even should <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be
                    then closed the flow continues until the water-level falls to c, when air is
                    admitted and the siphon ceases to act. The air-pipe c is cut to give the desired
                    volume.</p>
                <p>As regards house-drainage generally, the points of chief importance may be
                    briefly summed up as follows :—(1) the use of one or more disconnecting traps to
                    shut off sewer gas from the whole system of house-drains and pipes; (2) the
                    thorough ventilation of house-drains, soil-pipes, and branches, by providing
                    openings through which air can enter at the foot and escape at the top; (3) the
                    discharge of all sinks, basins, &amp;c., other than water-closet fittings, and
                    especially of fixed bedroom basins, into open traps in the open air; (4) the
                    direct discharge of cistern overflows and safe-trays into the open air; (5) the
                    use of cleanly and well-designed closets, basins, &amp;c., each sealed by an
                    ordinary bent trap; (6) the use of separate service cisterns for
                    water-closets.</p>
                <p>It may seem superfluous to add that the system of pipes must provide a rapid and
                    effective carriage of all sewage to the sewer, and must be water-tight and
                    airtight. During the last five years, however, it has been proved, by
                    examination of the best houses in London, that it is no uncommon case for a
                    house to be so completely without effective connexion with the sewer that all
                    its own sewage sinks into the soil under the basement; and about 75 per cent. of
                    the houses inspected have failed to pass the “smoke test.”</p>
                <p>In this connexion mention should be made of the system of co-operative
                    house-inspection originated by the late Prof. Fleeming Jenkin. The Edinburgh
                    Sanitary Protection Association was founded by him in 1878 to carry out the idea
                    that the sanitary fittings of a house should be periodically submitted to
                    examination by an expert, and that householders should combine to secure for
                    this purpose the continuous service of an engineer able to detect flaws, to
                    advise improvements, and to superintend alterations. The Edinburgh association
                    soon justified its existence by discovering, in the houses of its members, a
                    state of things even worse than students of sanitary science had imagined
                    possible. Similar associations are now doing excellent work in London, Glasgow,
                    and many other large towns.</p>
                <p>Space admits of only a very brief mention of those systems of sewerage in which
                    excreta are not removed by the aid of water. The dry-earth system, introduced by
                    the Rev. H. Moule, takes advantage of the oxidizing effect which a porous
                    substance such as dry earth exerts by bringing any sewage with which it is mixed
                    into intimate contact with the air contained in its pores. A discharge of urine
                    and faeces is quickly and completely deodorized and absorbed when covered with a
                    small quantity of dry earth; and the same soil, if exposed to the air and
                    allowed to dry, may be used over and over again for the same purpose. Even after
                    soil has been several times used, however, its value as manure is not so great
                    as to pay for its transport to any considerable distance; and for this reason,
                    as well as from the fact that it leaves other constituents of sewage to be dealt
                    with by other means, the system is of rather limited application. So far as it
                    goes it is excellent, and where there is no general system of water-carriage
                    sewerage, or where the water-supply is small or uncertain, an earth-closet will,
                    in careful hands, give perfect satisfaction. Numerous forms of earth-closet are
                    sold in which a suitable quantity of earth is automatically thrown into the pan
                    at each time of use. Arrangements of this kind are, however, not necessary to
                    the success of the system; a box filled with dry earth and a hand scoop will
                    answer the purpose not less effectively. Ashes are sometimes substituted for or
                    mixed with the dry earth, and powdered charcoal is also used.</p>
                <p>The most primitive method of dealing systematically with excreta is to collect
                    the discharges directly in a vessel which is either itself carried to the
                    country, and its contents applied to the land, or is emptied into a more
                    portable vessel for that purpose. In Japan, for example, in spite of the
                    difficulty of transport over bad roads and by human labour, the latter plan is
                    universally followed: the land and the people have in fact performed for
                    centuries what may be called a complete cycle of operations. The agricultural
                    return is so good that farmers pay for leave to remove excrement, and
                    householders look to their discharges as a source of income. The plan, although
                    carried out in the roughest manner, appears to involve fewer sanitary drawbacks
                    than might be expected; but<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n743/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0743-0718"/> the smells from privies and carts, and, above
                    all, from the process of emptying by ladle, are a nuisance which no Western
                    community would tolerate. A simple pail system, in which the sewage is collected
                    and removed in the same vessel, has been used at Rochdale; another, with an
                    absorbent lining in the pails, at Halifax.</p>
                <p>A plan much used in Continental cities is to collect excrement in tight vaults,
                    which are emptied at intervals into a tank cart by a suction pump or injector. A
                    more recent pneumatic system is that of Liernur, applied at Amsterdam, where
                    sewage reservoirs at individual houses are permanently connected with a central
                    reservoir by pipes, through which the contents of the former are sucked by
                    exhausting air from the reservoir at the central station. A similar plan has
                    been tried at Lyons and Paris by M. Berlier.</p>
