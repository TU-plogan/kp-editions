                            Abbé de</hi></label> (1658-1743), a French writer of much ingenuity and
                    influence, who is not unfrequently confounded with the author of <hi
                        rend="italic">Paul et Virginie,</hi> was born near Barfleur on the 18th of
                    February 1658. His father was bailli of the Cotentin, and Saint-Pierre, who was
                    educated by the Jesuits, appears to have had an easy entrance to the best
                    literary and political society of the capital. He was presented to the abbacy of
                    Tours, which a century before the poet Desportes had held, and was elected to
                    the Academy in 1695. But in 1718, in consequence of the political offence given
                    by his <hi rend="italic">Polysynodie,</hi> he suffered the very rare penalty of
                    expulsion from that body. He died at Paris in 1743.</p>
                <p>Saint-Pierre’s works (collected shortly before his death in eighteen volumes aud
                    originally published chiefly in the second and third decades of the 18th
                    century) are almost entirely occupied with an acute and inventive, though
                    generally visionary, criticism of politics, law, and social institutions. They
                    had a great influence on Rousseau, who has left elaborate examinations of some
                    of them, and has reproduced not a few of their ideas in his own work. The titles
                    are almost sufficient to show their nature. The chief are <hi rend="italic"
                        >Projet de Paix Perpetuelle</hi> (appositely published at Utrecht in 1713)
                    and <hi rend="italic">Polysynodie</hi> (a severe stricture on the Government of
                    Louis XIV., with projects for the administration of France by a system of
                    councils for each department of government), together with a crowd of memorials
                    and projects for stopping duelling, for equalizing taxation, for treating
                    mendicancy, for reforming education and spelling, &amp;c. Unlike the later
                    reforming abbés of the <hi rend="italic">philosophe</hi> period, Saint-Pierre
                    was a man of very unworldly character and quite destitute of the Frondeur
                    spirit. He was also a man of not a little intellectual power, and, as in the
                    case of every such man who gives his fancy free course in the construction of
                    political Utopias, not a few of his wishes and ideas have been realized in
                    course of time. But it is difficult to give him much credit for practical grasp
                    of politics.</p>
