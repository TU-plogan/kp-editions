                    Hatfield. The abbey or cathedral church, in some respects one of the most
                    remarkable ecclesiastical buildings in England, is described below. St Michael’s
                    church to the west of the town, within the site of the ancient Verulamium, was
                    originally constructed in the 10th century partly out of the ruins of the town.
                    Considerable portions of the Norman building remain; the church contains the
                    tomb of Lord Chancellor Bacon. St Stephen’s church, dating from the same period,
                    contains some good examples of Norman architecture. St Peter’s church has been
                    in great part rebuilt, but the nave of Early Perpendicular remains. The
                    (restored) clock-house in the market-place was built by one of the abbots in the
                    reign of Henry VIII. There is an Edward VI. grammar-school. The principal modern
                    buildings are the corn exchange, the court-house, the prison, the public baths,
                    and the public library. There are a number of charities and benevolent
                    institutions, including the hospital and dispensary, and the almshouses founded
                    in 1734 by Sarah duchess of Marlborough. The principal industries are the
                    manufacture of silk and strawplaiting. There are also breweries and
                    ironfoundries. The population of the municipal borough (area, 997 acres,
                    extended in 1879) in 1881 was 10,931; the population of the same area in 1871
                    was estimated at 8239.</p>
                <p>Not only is the cathedral “a text-book of mediaeval architecture from its
                    beginning to its ending,” but it “is still in style, material, and feeling that
                    one among our great churches which most thoroughly carries us back to Old
                    English and even to earlier days” (Freeman). Shortly after the execution of
                    Britain’s protomartyr, St Alban, probably in 303, a church was built on the
                    spot. In 793 Offa of Mercia, who professed to have discovered the relics of the
                    martyr, founded in his honour a monastery for Benedictines, which became one of
                    the richest and most important houses of that order in the kingdom. The abbots
                    Ealdred and Ealiner at the close of the 10th century began to break up the ruins
                    of the old Roman city of Verulamium for materials to construct a new abbey
                    church; but on account of the unsettled character of the times its erection was
                    delayed till the time of William the Conqueror, when Paul of Caen, a relative of
                    Archbishop Lanfranc, was in 1077 appointed abbot. Canterbury as built by
                    Lanfranc was almost a reproduction of St Stephen’s, Caen; but Paul, while
                    adopting the same model for St Albans, built it on an immensely larger scale.
                    The church was consecrated in 1115, but had been finished some years before. Of
                    the original Norman church the principal portions now remaining are the eastern
                    bays of the nave, the tower, and the transepts, but the main outlines of the
                    building are still those planned by Paul. It is thus one of the most important
                    specimens of Norman architecture in England, with the special characteristic
                    that, owing to the use of the flat broad Roman tile, the Norman portions are
                    peculiarly bare and stern. The western towers were pulled down in the 13th
                    century. About 1155 Robert de Gorham repaired and beautified the early shrine
                    and rebuilt the chapterhouse and part of the cloister; but nothing of his work
                    now remains except part of a very beautiful doorway lately discovered. Abbot
                    John do Cella (1195-1214) pulled down the west front and portions of the north
                    and south aisles. He began the erection of the west front in a new and enriched
                    form, and his work was continued by his successor William de Trumpyngtone
                    (1214-35) in a plainer manner. In 1257 the eastern portion was pulled down, and
                    between the middle of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century a
                    sanctuary, ante-chapel, and lady chapel were added, all remarkably fine
                    specimens of the architecture of the period. In 1323 two great columns on the
                    south side suddenly fell, which necessitated the rebuilding of five bays of the
                    south aisle and the Norman cloisters. Various incongruous additions were made
                    during the Perpendicular period, and much damage was also done during the
                    dissolution of the abbeys to the finer work in the interior. The building within
                    recent years has undergone extensive renovation, first under the direction of
                    Sir Gilbert Scott, and latterly to a much greater extent under Sir Edmund
                    Beckett. Its extreme length outside is 550 feet, which is exceeded by Winchester
                    by 6 feet. The nave (284 feet) is the longest Gothic nave in the world and
                    exceeds that of Winchester by about 20 feet. The length of the transepts is 175
                    feet inside. The monastic buildings have all disappeared with the exception of
                    the great gateway.</p>
                <p>To the south-west of the present city of St Albans stood the ancient <hi
                    rend="italic">Verulamium,</hi> one of the oldest towns in Britain, on Watling
                    Street. It was the chief station of Cassivellaunus at the time of Caesar’s
                    invasion, and under the Romans became a <hi rend="italic">municipium.</hi> The
                    ancient town which grew up around St Albans church was completely destroyed by
                    the Saxons between 500 and 560. During Wat Tyler's insurrection the monastery
                    was besieged by the townspeople, many of whom were executed in consequence. At
                    St Albans the Lancastrians were defeated on 21st May 1455, their leader, the
                    duke of Somerset, being killed, and Henry VI. taken prisoner; there too Queen
                    Margaret defeated the earl of Warwick on 17th February 1461. During the civil
                    wars the town was garrisoned for the Parliament. On a printing press, one of the
                    earliest in the kingdom, set up in the abbey the first English translation of
                    the Bible was printed. A charter of incorporation was granted to the town by
                    Edward VI. It returned two members to parliament until 1852, when it was
                    disfranchised. It became a bishop’s see in 1877. Nicholas Breakspear, the only
                    English pope (Adrian IV.), was born near St Albans, and was elected its abbot in
                    1137.</p>
