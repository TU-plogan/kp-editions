                    legislation. But there are some considerable differences. In Roman law sale
                    originally meant nothing more than barter; but the introduction of coined money
                    converted the contribution of one of the contracting parties into price <hi
                    rend="italic">(pretium),</hi> as distinguished from article of sale <hi
                    rend="italic">(merx)</hi> contributed by the other (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Roman Law,</hi> vol. xx. pp. 700-701). Sale fell under the head of consensual
                    contracts, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> those in which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >causa</hi> or that which made the contract enforcible was consent. In all
                    contracts of this class (except <hi rend="italic">mandatum)</hi> consent really
                    denoted valuable consideration. The law in the case of movables and immovables
                    was as far as might be the same. The price must be definite. Reduction of the
                    terms to writing was optional; if a writing was used, either party was at
                    liberty to withdraw before the completion of the writing. If earnest or deposit
                    <hi rend="italic">(arrha)—</hi> often a ring, sometimes a part of the price—was
                    given, it was by the legislation of Justinian made the measure of forfeit on
                    rescission, the buyer losing what he had given as <hi rend="italic">arrha,</hi>
                    the seller restoring double its value. The seller did not warrant title; his
                    contract was not <hi rend="italic">rem dare,</hi> to give the thing, but <hi
                    rend="italic">praestare emptori rem habere licere,</hi> to<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n225/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0225-0206"/> guarantee the buyer possession; the transfer was
                    of <hi rend="italic">vacua possessio,</hi> not of property. The buyer was
                    secured by a covenant <hi rend="italic">duplae stipulatio</hi> against eviction
                    by a superior title, limited to double the price where there was no fraud by the
                    seller. There was a warranty of quality by the seller. He was bound to suffer
                    rescission or to give compensation at the option of the buyer if the thing sold
                    had undisclosed faults which hindered the free possession of it. The damages to
                    which he was liable differed according as he was guilty of bad faith <hi
                    rend="italic">(dolus)</hi> or not. If guilty he was liable for all consequential
                    damage, if innocent only for the diminution in the value of the thing sold by
                    reason of its unsoundness. Thus, if a seller knowingly sold an infected sheep
                    and the whole flock caught the disease and died, he would be liable for the
                    value of the flock; if he was ignorant of the defect, he would be liable only
                    for the difference in value between a sound and an unsound sheep. Mere
                    overpraise did not amount to <hi rend="italic">dolus;</hi> nor was inadequacy of
                    price in itself a ground of rescission. When the agreement was complete it was
                    the duty of the seller to deliver the thing sold <hi rend="italic">(rem
                    tradere).</hi> In case of a sale on credit, the delivery must be made at the
                    time appointed. Prior to delivery the seller must take due care of the thing
                    sold, the care which a reasonably prudent householder <hi rend="italic">(bonus
                    paterfamilias)</hi> was expected to exercise. Delivery did not pass property in
                    the full sense of the word, but rather <hi rend="italic">vacua possessio</hi>
                    secured by <hi rend="italic">duplae stipulatio.</hi> Risk of loss <hi
                    rend="italic">(periculum rei venditae)</hi> after agreement but before delivery
                    fell upon the buyer. On the other hand, he was entitled to any advantage
                    accruing to the thing sold between those dates. It was the duty of some one to
                    pay the price; the obligation was discharged if payment were made by the debtor
                    or by any other person, whether authorized or not by the debtor, and even
                    against his will. The duties of buyer and seller might be varied by agreement,
                    the only restriction being that the seller could not by any agreement be
                    relieved from liability for <hi rend="italic">dolus.</hi></p>
                <p>Sale in English law may be defined to be “a transfer of the absolute or general
                    property in a thing for a price in money” (Benjamin, <hi rend="italic">On
                    Sales,</hi> p. 1). The words “absolute or general” are inserted because there
                    may be both a general and a special property in certain cases, and a transfer of
                    the special property would not be a sale. The above definition, though applied
                    in the work cited only to sales of personalty, seems to be fully applicable to
                    sales of any kind of property. The rules as to legality, capacity of parties,
                    assent, and fraud depend upon the law of <hi rend="smallcaps">Contract-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> of which sale is a particular instance. Incapacity is
                    either absolute or relative, the latter being a bar only in the individual case,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the incapacity of a person in a fiduciary position
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trust</hi>). The capacity of parties tends to become
                    more extended as law advances; thus in England the Roman Catholic, the alien,
                    and the married woman have all been relieved within a comparatively recent
                    period from certain disabilities in sale and purchase which formerly attached to
                    them.</p>
                <p>In England, for historical reasons (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Real Estate</hi>),
                    there is a considerable difference in the law as it affects real and personal
                    estate. The main principles of law are perhaps the same, but the sale of real
                    estate is a matter of greater expense and intricacy than the sale of personal
                    estate, and depends to a large extent upon legislation inapplicable to the
                    latter. It appears, therefore, better to treat the two kinds of sale
                    separately.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Real Estate.—</hi> At common law it was not necessary that
                    there should be written evidence of a contract of sale. The publicity of the
                    feoffment obviated the necessity of writing, which was not essential to the
                    validity of a feoffment until the Statute of Frauds (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Feoffment).</hi> The earliest statute making a written instrument essential to
                    a sale appears to be the Statute of Enrolments (27 Hen. VIII. c. 16). The
                    bargain and sale operating under the Statute of Uses, and enrolled under the
                    Statute of Enrolments in the High Court of Justice or with the custos rotulorum
                    of the county, is no longer in use; a bargain and sale at common law is a mode
                    of conveyance sometimes used by executors exercising a power of sale. Such a
                    bargain and sale must be by deed since 8 and 9 Vict. c. 106, but need not be
                    enrolled. There was no comprehensive legislative enactment dealing with all
                    cases of sale of real estate until section 4 of the Statute of Frauds. Since
                    that date a contract for the sale of real estate must be in writing (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fraud,</hi> where the provisions of the Act are set out). Sales
                    by auction are within the statute, the auctioneer being the agent of both
                    parties (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Auction).</hi> In an ordinary case of the sale
                    of real estate the contract is formally drawn up on the basis of particulars and
                    conditions of sale, which ought fairly to represent the actual state of the
                    property. The statute, however, is satisfied by informal agreements, such as
                    letters, if they contain the means of determining the property, the parties, and
                    the price. The price must be a sum of money. If it is another estate, the
                    contract is one of exchange; if no consideration passes, it is a gift. The price
                    may be left to be determined by a third person, as by arbitration. For the way
                    in which payment of the price may be made, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Payment.</hi> The formation of a binding contract of sale is the most important
                    stage in the transfer of real estate. From the moment at which the parties are
                    bound by the contract the sale is made; the purchaser has the equitable estate
                    in the subject-matter of the contract (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Equity),</hi>
                    the vendor holding in trust for him, subject to the payment of the purchase
                    money, for which the vendor<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“Vendor” and “purchaser” are the words always used to denote the parties to
                    a contract of sale of real estate. Where the sale is of personal estate, “buyer”
                    and “seller” may be used as well.</p></note> has a lien. The price becomes
                    personal estate of the vendor and the land real estate of the purchaser. The
                    latter has the right to accidental benefits and the burden of accidental losses
                    accruing before completion of the purchase. The rights defined by the contract
                    descend to the representatives of a deceased vendor or purchaser. In most cases
                    the personal representative of a deceased vendor may convey the property under
                    44 and 45 Vict. c. 41, s. 4. After the contract it becomes the duty of the
                    vendor to deliver an abstract of title, to satisfy the purchaser’s reasonable
                    requisitions as to any question arising on the title of the purchaser, and to
                    pay a deposit, usually ten per cent. of the price fixed, within a certain time,
                    the remainder being paid on completion,—that is, the execution of the conveyance
                    and payment of the balance of the price. He also prepares the conveyance, which
                    since 8 and 9 Vict. c. 106 must be by deed. The costs of execution of the
                    conveyance are paid by the vendor. Any of these duties may be varied by special
                    agreement. The sale is not in ordinary cases avoided because the purchaser is in
                    default in payment of the purchase money on the day appointed. The purchaser
                    does not forfeit his rights if he be ready to complete within a reasonable time
                    after the day fixed for completion and to pay interest on the sum overdue. This
                    rule is an old doctrine of equity, and is generally expressed by saying that
                    time is not of the essence of the contract. As a general rule, any real estate
                    is capable of sale, unless it is altogether <hi rend="italic">extra
                    commercium,</hi> as a church or public building. There are, however, a few
                    exceptions introduced by the legislature, such as estates tail not barred,
                    estates which by Act of Parliament are inalienable (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Real Estate),</hi> and crown lands, of which all grants for more than
                    thirty-one years are in general void by 1 Anne st. 1, c. 7. Sales of pretended
                    titles to land are void by 32<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n226/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0226-0207"/> Hen. VIII. c. 9. The sale of land to be held in
                    mortmain would be void as contrary to the policy of the Mortmain Acts (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Charities, Corporation).</hi> The rights and liabilities of
                    vendors and purchasers have been considerably affected by recent legislation,
                    the principal Acts dealing with the subject being the Vendor and Purchaser Act,
                    1874, and the Conveyancing Act, 1881. A period of forty years has been
                    substituted for the period of sixty years previously necessary as the root of
                    title,—that is to say, in most cases an abstract showing title for forty years
                    is sufficient. In an abstract of title to leaseholds, the title is to commence
                    with the lease or underlease, in an abstract of title to enfranchised lands,
                    under a contract to sell the freehold, with the deed of enfranchisement.
                    Recitals twenty years old are evidence, except so far as they can be proved to
                    be inaccurate, and recitals of documents dated prior to the commencement of the
                    abstract are to be taken as correct, and their production is not to be required.
                    The expenses of evidence required in support of the abstract and not in the
                    vendor’s possession are thrown upon the purchaser. The Conveyancing Act, 1881,
                    further protects the purchaser by implying in a conveyance by a beneficial owner
                    on sale for valuable consideration covenants for right to convey, quiet
                    enjoyment, freedom from encumbrances, and further assurance. In a conveyance of
                    leaseholds a covenant for the validity of the lease is implied. These covenants
                    protect the purchaser much in the same way as the implied warranty in the sale
                    of personalty. The Act also gives the mortgagee, where the mortgage is by deed,
                    the power of sale generally inserted in mortgage deeds (see MORTGAGE).</p>
                <p>The remedies of the vendor are an action for the price or for specific
                    performance according to circumstances. There is also a remedy by mandamus
                    against public companies refusing to complete. Specific performance is a remedy
                    introduced by the Court of Chancery to enforce contracts for the sale or
                    purchase of real estate, it being considered that in such cases the common law
                    action for damages was an insufficient remedy. Strictly, it is only an exercise
                    by the court of its jurisdiction over trustees, the vendor being after the
                    contract, as has been said, a trustee for the purchaser. By the Judicature Act,
                    1873, actions of specific performance are specially assigned to the Chancery
                    Division. A county court has jurisdiction where the purchase money does not
                    exceed £500. In spite of the Statute of Frauds, specific performance may in some
                    cases be decreed where a parol contract has been followed by part performance
                    and where the position of the parties has been materially altered on the faith
                    of the contract. Actions for the price or for specific performance are subject
                    to the purchaser’s right to compensation for deficiency of quality or quantity
                    or of the vendor’s interest in the property. The question whether in a
                    particular case the purchaser is entitled to rescind the contract or only to
                    compensation is often a very difficult one. The remedies of the purchaser are an
                    action for specific performance, for rescission of the contract or for damages
                    (in case of fraud), for a return of the deposit, or for expenses. On the
                    principle of <hi rend="italic">caveat emptor,</hi> the sale is not avoided by
                    mere commendatory statements, statements of opinion, or non-disclosure of patent
                    defects. Non-disclosure of latent defects or material misrepresentation of
                    facts, on the faith of which the purchaser entered into the contract, will as a
                    rule be a ground for rescission or for damages, and this irrespective of fraud,
                    as a contract for the sale of land is a contract <hi rend="italic">uberrimae
                    fidei.</hi> Where the sale goes off or the vendor without fraud fails to make a
                    good title, the purchaser can only recover the deposit, if any, and any expenses
                    to which he may have been put; he cannot recover damages for the loss of his
                    bargain. Certain frauds by a vendor or his solicitor or agent in order to induce
                    the purchaser to accept a title render the offender guilty of a misdemeanour, as
                    well as liable to an action for damages (22 and 23 Vict. c. 35, s. 24). By the
                    Vendor and Purchaser Act, 1874, either a vendor or a purchaser of real or
                    leasehold estate in England may obtain on a summary application the decision of
                    a judge of the Chancery Division on any question connected with the contract,
                    not being a question affecting its existence or validity. (See Sugden, <hi
                    rend="italic">Vendors and Purchasers;</hi> Dart, <hi rend="italic">Vendors and
                    Purchasers;</hi> Fry, <hi rend="italic">Specific Performances</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Personal Estate.—</hi> At common law, as in the case of real
                    estate, writing was not essential to the validity of a contract of sale. The
                    common law is thus stated by Blackstone: “A contract of sale implies a bargain,
                    or mutual understanding and agreement between the parties as to terms; and the
                    law as to the transmutation of property under such contracts may be stated
                    generally as follows. If the vendor says the price of the goods is £4 and the
                    vendee says he will give £4, the bargain is struck; and, if the goods be thereon
                    delivered or tendered, or any part of the price be paid down and accepted (if it
                    be but a penny), the property in the goods is thereupon transmuted and vests
                    immediately in the bargainee; so that in the event of their being subsequently
                    damaged or destroyed he and not the vendor must stand to the loss. This supposes
                    (it will be observed) the case of a sale for ready money; but, if it be a sale
                    of goods to be delivered forthwith, but to be paid for afterwards, the property
                    passes to the vendee immediately upon the striking of the bargain without either
                    delivery on the one hand or payment on the other” (Stephen, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries,</hi> vol. ii. bk. ii. pt. ii. ch. v.). Earnest may have been
                    originally the same as the Roman <hi rend="italic">arrha</hi>; it was never,
                    however, part payment, as <hi rend="italic">arrha</hi> might have been,—in fact,
                    the Statute of Frauds specially distinguishes it from part payment. The giving
                    of earnest has now fallen into disuse. The price need not be fixed; if not
                    fixed, a reasonable price will be presumed. Though writing was in no case
                    necessary at common law, it has become so under the provisions of various Acts
                    of Parliament, prominent among which is the Statute of Frauds, ss. 4 and 17 (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Contact fraud).</hi> Section 17 of the Statute of Frauds
                    was extended to executory contracts of sale by Lord Tenterden’s Act, 9 Geo. IV.
                    c. 14. The sale of horses in market overt must be entered in a book kept by the
                    toll-keeper (2 and 3 Ph. and M. c. 7, 31 Eliz. c. 12). The sale of ships must by
                    the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, be made by bill of sale in a certain form.
                    Contracts for the sale of shares in a joint-stock banking company are void
                    unless the contract sets forth in writing the numbers of the shares on the
                    register of the company or (where the shares are not distinguished by numbers)
                    the names of the registered proprietors (29 and 30 Vict. c. 29). Bills of sale
                    of goods must be in writing in a certain form and registered under the Bills of
                    Sale Acts, 1878 and 1882.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    are in reality mortgages.</p></note> As a general rule the property in goods
                    passes by the contract of sale. This general rule is subject to the following
                    important exceptions: (1) where the vendor is to do anything to the goods for
                    the purpose of putting them into that state in which the purchaser is bound to
                    accept them, the property does not pass until performance of the necessary acts;
                    (2) the same is the case where the goods are to be weighed, tested, or measured;
                    (3) where the purchaser is bound to do anything as a condition on which the
                    passing of the property depends, the property does not pass until the condition
                    is fulfilled, even though the goods may be actually in the possession of the
                    buyer; (4) where an executory contract for the<pb break="no"

                    until appropriation of specific goods by the vendor in completion of the
                    contract; (5) where the vendor reserves to himself the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    disponendi</hi> or future power of dealing with the goods, as by making a bill
                    of lading deliverable to his order, the property does not pass until the jus <hi
                    rend="italic">disponendi</hi> is exercised in favour of the purchaser; (6) where
                    there is fraud on the part of the vendor or purchaser, the sale is voidable, not
                    void; it may be affirmed and enforced or rescinded. In sales of personalty,
                    unlike sales of real estate, time is usually of the essence of the contract. A
                    sale of goods may be accompanied by an express warranty or collateral contract
                    as to the title to or quality of the goods. No special form of words is
                    necessary to create a warranty, nor need it be in writing. An implied warranty
                    of title—that is, an affirmation that the vendor has a right to sell—exists
                    certainly in executory contracts of sale. It most probably exists in executed
                    contracts,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An executed
                    contract passes title, an executory gives a right. A purchase for ready money in
                    a shop is an executed contract, an order for a certain chattel to be made is an
                    executory contract. The consideration for such a contract is the express or
                    implied promise to pay for the chattel on completion.</p></note> the exceptions
                    to the rule having in recent times become by judicial decision more numerous
                    than the cases falling under the old rule, that there was no such warranty.
                    Warranty of quality exists either by statute or at common law. The Merchandise
                    Marks Act, 1862, implies a warranty from the existence of trade-marks on
                    chattels that the trademark is genuine, and from the existence of any statement
                    respecting number, quantity, weight, place, or country that such statement is
                    not in any material respect false. The rules as to warranty of quality at common
                    law cannot be better stated than in the language of the clear and full judgment
                    of the Court of Queen’s Bench in Jones <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Just <hi
                    rend="italic">(Law Reports,</hi> 3 Queen’s Bench, 197).</p>
                <p>“First, where goods are <hi rend="italic">in esse</hi> and may be inspected by
                    the buyer, and there is no fraud on the part of the seller, the maxim <hi
                    rend="italic">caveat emptor</hi> applies, even though the defect which exists in
                    them is latent and not discoverable on examination, at least where the seller is
                    neither the grower nor the manufacturer. The buyer in such case has the
                    opportunity of exercising his judgment upon the matter, and if the result of the
                    inspection be unsatisfactory, or if he distrusts his own judgment, he may if he
                    chooses require a warranty. In such a case it is not an implied term of the
                    contract of sale that the goods are of any particular quality or are
                    merchantable. So in the case of the sate in a market of meat which the buyer had
                    inspected, but which was in fact diseased and unfit for food, although that fact
                    was not apparent on examination and the seller was not aware of it, it was held
                    that there was no implied warranty that it was fit for food, and that the maxim
                    <hi rend="italic">caveat emptor</hi> applied. Secondly, where there is a sale of
                    a definite existing chattel specifically described, the actual condition of
                    which is capable of being ascertained by either party, there is no implied
                    warranty. Thirdly, where a known described and defined article is ordered of a
                    manufacturer, although it is stated to be required by the purchaser for a
                    particular purpose, still if the known described and defined thing he actually
                    supplied there is no warranty that it shall answer for the particular purpose
                    intended by the buyer. Fourthly, where a manufacturer or dealer contracts to
                    supply au article which he manufactures or produces, or in which he deals, to be
                    applied to a particular purpose, so that the buyer necessarily trusts to the
                    judgment or skill of the manufacturer or dealer, there is in that case an
                    implied warranty that it shall be reasonably fit for the purpose to which it is
                    to be applied. In such a case the buyer trusts to the manufacturer or dealer,
                    and relies upon his judgment and not upon his own. Fifthly, where a manufacturer
                    undertakes to supply goods manufactured by himself or in which he deals, but
                    which the vendee has not had the opportunity of inspecting, it is an implied
                    term in the contract that he shall supply a merchantable article. And this
                    doctrine has been held to apply to the sale of an existing barge by the dealer
                    which was afloat but not completely rigged and furnished; there, inasmuch as the
                    buyer had only seen it when built and not during the course of the building, he
                    was considered as having relied on the judgment and skill of the builder that
                    the barge was reasonably fit for use.”</p>
                <p>The case of sale by sample is peculiar to personalty.</p>
                <p>In such a sale the vendor warrants the quality of the bulk to be equal to that of
                    the sample. There are certain kinds of sale which are governed by special
                    legislation, chiefly on grounds of public policy. A sale contrary to the
                    provisions of any of the Acts is generally void in the same way as though it
                    were illegal at common law, on the principle of the maxim <hi rend="italic">Ex
                    turpi causa non oritur actio.</hi> The sale of certain public offices is
                    forbidden by 5 and 6 Edw. VI. c. 16, 49 Geo. III. c. 126, and other Acts dealing
                    with special offices. A sale by a tradesman in the way of his ordinary business
                    upon Sunday is illegal under 29 Car. II. c. 7. The same is the case with the
                    sale of intoxicating liquors during prohibited hours, whether on Sundays or week
                    days (31 and 38 Vict. c. 49, s. 6). No action can be brought to recover any debt
                    alleged to be due in respect of the sale of any ale, &amp;c., consumed on the
                    premises where sold (30 and 31 Vict. c. 142). The sale of game in the close
                    season or by an unlicensed person is forbidden by 1 and 2 Will. IV. c. 32. The
                    sale of spirits to a person apparently under the age of sixteen is made penal by
                    35 and 36 Vict. c. 94, s. 7. These cases are only given as examples; there are
                    numerous other enactments dealing with, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> sales
                    of anchors and chain cables, adulterated food and drugs, explosives, and
                    poisons. Every sale by weight or measure must be according to one of the
                    imperial weights or measures ascertained by the Weights and Measures Act, 1878;
                    if not so made, the sale is void (41 and 42 Vict. c. 49, s. 19).</p>
                <p>The remedies of the vendor are of two kinds, judicial against the purchaser,
                    extra-judicial against the goods. Judicial remedies are either by action for
                    non-acceptance where the property has not passed or by action for the price
                    where it has passed. The extra-judicial are (1) a lien for the price, so that,
                    in the absence of agreement to the contrary or assent to a sub-sale, the vendor
                    need not deliver the goods until the price is paid; (2) the right of stoppage
                    <hi rend="italic">in transitu.</hi> This right is universally acknowledged by
                    the commercial law of civilized nations. It arises on the insolvency of the
                    purchaser before the goods have reached his possession, and is defeasible only
                    by transfer, whether by way of sale or pledge, of the bill of lading or other
                    document of title to a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> indorsee for value. The
                    protection afforded at common law to the <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>
                    transferee has been extended by the Bills of Lading Act, 1855, and by the
                    Factors Act, 1877. There is no general right of resale by the vendor on default
                    of the purchaser. The remedies of the buyer are an action for damages for
                    non-delivery, for conversion, for breach of warranty, for misrepresentation,
                    &amp;c., according to circumstances. He has also a remedy analogous to specific
                    performance under the Mercantile Law Amendment Act, 1856. The Act gives power to
                    the court or a judge, in an action for breach of contract to deliver specific
                    goods, to order execution to issue for the delivery of the goods without giving
                    the defendant the option of retaining them upon paying the damages assessed. The
                    buyer has further a right to reject goods where they are different in kind or
                    quality from those which he had a right to expect. He is entitled to keep them
                    for a sufficient time to give them a fair trial. It should be noticed that the
                    effect of misrepresentation in the sale of real and personal property is not the
                    same. As a rule innocent misrepresentation of facts does not give a right to
                    rescind the sale, since a representation is, like an express warranty, not an
                    integral part of the contract. A representation may, however, if so intended by
                    the parties, become a condition a breach of which will avoid the sale. See
                    Story’s, Blackburn’s, and Benjamin’s treatises on the sale of personal property,
                    especially Benjamin’s, which is now the recognized textbook on the subject.<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0228-0209"/> It may be useful to recapitulate shortly the main
                    points of difference between Roman and English law. They have all been noticed
                    in the preceding part of this article. (1) <hi rend="italic">Arrha</hi> was not
                    the same as earnest. (2) Written contracts were not necessary in Roman law under
                    any circumstances. (3) There was no warranty of title in Roman law: the transfer
                    was of <hi rend="italic">vacua possessio,</hi> not of ownership; in England
                    there is a warranty of title (unless the parties otherwise intend) on sales of
                    personalty, but not on sales of real property, though the covenants for title
                    practically amount to a warranty. (4) There was a warranty of quality extending
                    to undisclosed defects in Roman law beyond anything recognized by English law.
                    (5) By Roman law the property did not pass until <hi rend="italic"
                    >traditio;</hi> even then it was only property in a modified sense; it was
                    rather <hi rend="italic">vacua possessio</hi> secured by <hi rend="italic"
                    >duplae stipulatio</hi>; by English law the property in specific ascertained
                    goods vests by the contract in the buyer. (6) A sale by a person who was not the
                    owner was not good in Roman law; it is good in certain cases in English law (see
                    below).</p>
                <p>There are certain kinds of sale which it is proposed to consider separately on
                    account of the exceptional circumstances in which they stand.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Compulsory Sale.—</hi> As a general rule sale is a matter of
                    contract between the parties, and no one can be forced to sell against his will.
                    But in this, as in other matters, the right of the state comes in. Under the
                    powers of the Lands Clauses and other Acts the state, exercising its right of
                    eminent domain, may force an owner to sell for the purpose of public
                    improvements,—such as railways. The power of compulsory sale is less common
                    where the interests of the state are not involved; an example occurs in the
                    Partition Act, 1868, under which the court may order a sale instead of a
                    division, even though some of the parties interested dissent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Judicial Sale.—</hi> Under this head may be grouped all those
                    sales which are made under the authority and by the direction of a court of
                    justice. In regard to real property the most important example is the sale by
                    order of the Chancery Division. Such a sale may be ordered either under the
                    original jurisdiction of the court or under the provisions of certain Acts of
                    Parliament, such as the Lunacy Regulation Act, 1853, the Partition Act, 1868,
                    the Settled Estates Act, 1877, or the Settled Land Act, 1882 (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Settlement</hi>). The Conveyancing Act, 1881, provides for
                    freeing any land from encumbrances on sale by the court, on payment into court
                    of a sum to meet the encumbrance. The Act also makes the order for sale
                    conclusive in favour of a purchaser in almost every case. The abstract of title
                    in a sale by the court is submitted to one of the conveyancing counsel of the
                    Chancery Division, and the particulars and conditions are settled in judges’
                    chambers. The sale is generally by public auction, the auctioneer being
                    appointed by the judge. The regulations for the conduct of sales by the court
                    will be found in the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, Ord. li. r. 1-13.</p>
                <p>The Bankruptcy Act, 1883, gives power to a trustee acting under the authority of
                    a court of bankruptcy to sell all or any part of the property of a bankrupt by
                    public auction or private contract. Similar rights are given by the Scotch
                    Bankruptcy Act, 1856. Judicial sales of the property of a debtor in Scotland are
                    regulated by 19 and 20 Vict. c. 92. The term “judicial sale” does not seem to be
                    used as a technical term in English as it is in Scotch law. In admiralty actions
                    a vessel may be sold under a commission of appraisement and sale issued by the
                    court. The practice is now regulated by Ord. li. r. 14-16. Similar powers may be
                    exercised in an action of sett in Scotland. A common instance of a judicial sale
                    is the sale by a sheriff of an execution debtor’s goods under a writ of <hi
                    rend="italic">fieri facias</hi> or <hi rend="italic">venditioni exponas.</hi>
                    Where the execution is for a sum above £20 the sale is, unless the court
                    otherwise orders, to be by public auction. Where the sheriff has seized and a
                    claim by interpleader is set up, the court may order a sale of the whole or part
                    of the goods (Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, Ord. lvii. r. 12). The same
                    rules (Ord. 1. r. 2) give a valuable power to the court or a judge of ordering a
                    sale of any goods of a perishable nature, or such as for any reason it may be
                    desirable to have sold at once.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sale by Persons not Owners.—</hi> English law in general agrees
                    with the rule in Dig. 1. 17, 54, “Nemo plus juris ad alium transferre potest
                    quam ipse haberet,” and a purchaser takes his purchase subject to informalities
                    in the title. To this rule there are several exceptions, in which title may be
                    given by persons who are limited owners or not owners at all. An example of sale
                    by a limited owner is a sale by a tenant for life under the powers given by the
                    Settled Land Act, 1882. Under the same head would fall sales by persons having a
                    qualified right of sale under particular circumstances, such as a sheriff, the
                    master of a ship in a foreign port, or a pawnee in default of payment (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pledge).</hi> Sales by persons not owners at all must as a
                    rule, in order to be valid, be made to purchasers ignorant of the defect of
                    title on the part of the vendor. In the case of real estate a <hi rend="italic"
                    >bona fide</hi> purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, actual or
                    implied, of any adverse title is protected. This is on the principle that equity
                    assists the person in possession of the legal estate. In the case of personal
                    property title may be passed by a person not owner under the Factors Acts and in
                    the case of stolen goods. The effect of the Factors Acts is to enable title to
                    be given by the vendor or vendee or any person on his behalf while he is in
                    possession of the documents of title (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Factors).</hi>
                    The law as to the sale of stolen goods will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Theft.</hi><hi rend="italic">Pre-emption.—</hi> This is a right of purchasing
                    some particular property given to some particular person in priority to the
                    public. It is conferred either by agreement between parties or by law. Thus by
                    the Lands Clauses Act, 1845, before the promoters of an undertaking dispose of
                    superfluous lands not required for the purposes of the undertaking they must
                    (with certain exceptions) first offer to sell the same to the person then
                    entitled to the lands from which the same were originally severed. In the United
                    States preemption is very important in its connexion with the homestead law (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Homestead).</hi> In international law the right is
                    exercisable by a belligerent nation over property not strictly contraband, but
                    which would still be of advantage to the enemy. The goods are not seized and
                    condemned, but purchased by the capturing nation at a reasonable compensation.
                    The right of pre-emption is given to the admiralty by 27 and 28 Vict. c. 25, s.
                    38 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Contraband).</hi> The old crown prerogative of
                    purveyance and pre-emption was a right of buying up provisions and other
                    necessaries for the royal household at a valuation even without the consent of
                    the owner, and also of impressing horses and carriages for the king’s service on
                    the public roads upon paying a settled price to the proprietor. The right was
                    relinquished by the Act abolishing the feudal tenures (12 Car. II. c. 24).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> The law of Scotland follows the Roman law more
                    closely than does English law. Thus in Scotch as in Roman law the contract of
                    sale is called a consensual contract; the sale is not complete until delivery,
                    and market overt does not afford any protection. Writing is essential to the
                    sale of heritable property, not by any statute, as in England, but by the
                    ancient unwritten law. <hi rend="italic">Rei interventus</hi> may, however, in
                    some cases, like part performance in England, supply the place of writings. The
                    vendor is bound on completion to supply a sufficient progress of titles. In
                    addition to the protection afforded to the purchaser by the progress of titles
                    the statutory form of warrandice in 31 and 32 Vict. c. 101, s. 8 implies, unless
                    specially qualified, absolute warrandice as regards the lands and writs and
                    evidents, and warrandice from fact and deed as regards the rents,—that is to
                    say, that a good title to the land has been conveyed, and that the granter has
                    not done and will not do anything contrary to the writ as regards the rents (see
                    Watson, <hi rend="italic">Law Dict.,</hi> s.v. “Warrandice”). In the case of
                    movables writing is not necessary for a good contract of sale, except where the
                    sale is of a ship, or the parties agree to reduce the terms to writing. The
                    Mercantile Law Amendment (Scotland) Act, 1856 (19 and 20 Vict. c. 60), has made
                    important changes in the law of Scotland. “The statute was passed for the
                    purpose of assimilating the law of Scotland to that of England” (Lord Watson, in
                    M'Bain <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Wallace, <hi rend="italic">Law Reports,</hi> 6
                    Appeal Cases, 588). By section 1 goods after sale but before delivery are not
                    attachable by the creditors of the seller. By section 2 the sub-purchaser may
                    demand that delivery be made to him instead of to the original purchaser,
                    without prejudice to the right of retention of the seller. By section 3 the
                    seller of goods may attach the goods while in his own possession at any time
                    prior to the date when the sale of such goods shall have been intimated to him.
                    By section 5 the English principle of <hi rend="italic">caveat emptor</hi> is
                    introduced: " where goods shall be sold the seller, if at the time of the sale
                    he was without knowledge that the same were of defective or of bad quality,
                    shall not be held to have warranted their quality or sufficiency, but the goods,
                    with all faults, shall be at the risk of the purchaser, unless the seller shall
                    have given an express warranty of the quality or sufficiency of such goods, or
                    unless the goods have been expressly sold for a specified and particular
                    purpose, in which case the seller shall be considered, without such warranty, to
                    warrant that the same are fit for such purpose.” The right of retention
                    corresponds closely to the right of lien in England, but rests upon the simpler
                    ground of undivested property (see Watson, <hi rend="italic">Law Dict.,</hi>
                    s.v. “Sale”). Criminal liability for fraud seems to be carried farther in
                    Scotland than in England (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fraud).</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >United States.—</hi> The law as to the sale of real estate agrees generally
                    with English law. It is considerably simplified by the system of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Registration</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> The covenant of
                    warranty, unknown in England, is the principal covenant for title in the United
                    States. It corresponds generally to the English covenant for quiet enjoyment.
                    The right of judicial sale of buildings under a mechanic s lien for labour and
                    materials is given by the law of many States.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0229-0210"/> The sale of public lands is regulated by Act of
                    Congress <hi rend="italic">(Revised Statutes,</hi> 2353-2379). In the law of
                    sale of personal property American law is also based upon English law. The
                    principal differences are that the law of market overt (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Theft)</hi> is not recognized by the United States, and that an unpaid vendor
                    is the agent of the vendee to resell on non-payment, and is entitled to recover
                    the difference between the contract price and the price of resale. The law of
                    Louisiana <hi rend="italic">{Civil Code,</hi> § 3194) gives the unpaid vendor a
                    still greater right in his preferential claim for the price against the
                    creditors of the purchaser, if the property still remains in the latter’s
                    possession. Warranty of title is not carried as far as in England. United States
                    decisions draw a distinction between goods in the possession and goods not in
                    the possession of the vendor at the time of sale. There is no warranty of title
                    of the latter. The Statute of Frauds has been construed in some respects
                    differently from the English decisions. The differences will be found in Mr
                    Benjamin’s work. As to unlawful sales, it has been held that a sale in a State
                    where the sale is lawful is valid in a State where it is unlawful by statute,
                    even though the goods are in the latter State. (J. W†.)</p>
