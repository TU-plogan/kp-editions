                    with the words, “Remember, monsieur le comte, that you have great things to do
                    ”; and his ancestor Charlemagne appeared to him in a dream foretelling a
                    remarkable future for him. Among his early schemes was one to unite the Atlantic
                    and the Pacific by a canal, and another to construct a canal from Madrid to the
                    sea. He took no part of any importance in the Revolution, but amassed a little
                    fortune by land speculation,—not on his own account, however, as he said, but to
                    facilitate his future projects. Accordingly, when he was nearly forty years of
                    age he went through a varied course of study and experiment, in order to enlarge
                    and clarify his view of things. One of these experiments was an unhappy
                    marriage, which, after a year’s duration, was dissolved by the mutual consent of
                    the parties. Another result of his experiments was that he found himself
                    completely impoverished, and lived in penury for the remainder of his life. The
                    first of his numerous writings, <hi rend="italic">Lettres d’un Habitant de
                    Genève,</hi> appeared in 1803; but his early writings were mostly scientific and
                    political. It was not till 1817 that he began in a treatise entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">L’Industrie</hi> to propound his socialistic views, which he
                    further developed in <hi rend="italic">L'Organisateur</hi> (1819), <hi
                    rend="italic">Du Système Industriel</hi> (1821), <hi rend="italic">Catéchisme
                    des Industriels</hi> (1823). The last and most important expression of his views
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Christianisme</hi> (1825). For many years
                    before his death in 1825 (at Paris on 19th May) Saint-Simon had been reduced to
                    the greatest straits. He was obliged to accept a laborious post for a salary of
                    £40 a year, to live on the generosity of a former valet, and finally to solicit
                    a small pension from his family. In 1823 he attempted suicide in despair. It was
                    not till very late in his career that he attached to himself a few ardent
                    disciples.</p>
                <p>As a thinker Saint-Simon was entirely deficient in system, clearness, and
                    consecutive strength. But his great influence on modern thought is undeniable,
                    both as the historic founder of French socialism and as suggesting much of what
                    was afterwards elaborated into Comtism. Apart from the details of his
                    socialistic teaching, which are vague, inconsistent, and unsystematic, we find
                    that the ideas of Saint-Simon as to the reconstruction of society are very
                    simple. His opinions were conditioned by the French Revolution and by the feudal
                    and military system still prevalent in France. In opposition to the destructive
                    liberalism of the Revolution he insisted on the necessity of a new and positive
                    reorganization of society. So far was he from advocating fresh social revolt
                    that he appealed to Louis XVIII. to inaugurate the new order of things. In
                    opposition, however, to the feudal and military system, the former aspect of
                    which had been strengthened by the restoration, he advocated an arrangement by
                    which the industrial chiefs should control society. In place of the mediaeval
                    church the spiritual direction of society should fall to the men of science.
                    What Saint-Simon desired, therefore, was an industrialist state directed by
                    modern science. In short, the men who are fitted to organize society for
                    productive labour are entitled to bear rule in it. The social aim is to produce
                    things useful to life; the final end of social activity is “the exploitation of
                    the globe by association.” The contrast between labour and capital so much
                    emphasized by later socialism is not present to Saint-Simon, but it is assumed
                    that the industrial chiefs, to whom the control of production is to be
                    committed, shall rule in the interest of society. Later on the cause of the poor
                    receives greater attention, till in his greatest work, <hi rend="italic">The New
                    Christianity,</hi> it becomes the central point of his teaching and takes the
                    form of a religion. It was this religious development of his teaching that
                    occasioned his final quarrel with Comte. Previous to the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouveau Christianisme,</hi> Saint-Simon had not concerned himself
                    with theology. Here he starts from a belief in God, and his object in the
                    treatise is to reduce Christianity to its simple and essential elements. He does
                    this by clearing it of the dogmas and other excrescences and defects which have
                    gathered round both the Catholic and Protestant forms of it, which he subjects
                    to a searching and ingenious criticism. “The new Christian organization will
                    deduce the temporal institutions as well as the spiritual from the principle
                    that all<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n217/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0217-0198"/> men should act towards one another as brethren.”
                    Expressing the same idea in modern language, Saint-Simon propounds as the
                    comprehensive formula of the new Christianity this precept—“The whole of society
                    ought to strive towards the amelioration of the moral and physical existence of
                    the poorest class; society ought to organize itself in the way best adapted for
                    attaining this end.” This principle became the watchword of the entire school of
                    Saint-Simon; for them it was alike the essence of religion and the programme of
                    social reform.</p>
                <p>During his lifetime the views of Saint-Simon had very little influence; and he
                    left only a very few devoted disciples, who continued to advocate the doctrines
                    of their master, whom they revered as a prophet. An important departure was made
                    in 1828 by Bazard, who gave a “complete exposition of the Saint-Simonian faith”
                    in a long course of lectures at Paris in the Rue Taranne. In 1830 Bazard and
                    Enfantin were acknowledged as the heads of the school; and the fermentation
                    caused by the revolution of July of the same year brought the whole movement
                    prominently before the attention of France. Early next year the school obtained
                    possession of the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> through Pierre Leroux, who had
                    joined the school, which now numbered some of the ablest and most promising
                    young men of France, many of the pupils of the École Polytechnique having caught
                    its enthusiasm. The members formed themselves into an association arranged in
                    three grades, and constituting a society or family, which lived out of a common
                    purse in the Rue Monsigny. Before long, however, dissensions began to arise in
                    the sect. Bazard, a man of logical and more solid temperament, could no longer
                    work in harmony with Enfantin, who desired to establish an arrogant and
                    fantastic sacerdotalism with lax notions as to marriage and the relation of the
                    sexes. After a time Bazard seceded and many of the strongest supporters of the
                    school followed his example. A series of extravagant entertainments given by the
                    society during the winter of 1832 reduced its financial resources and greatly
                    discredited it in character. They finally removed to Menilmontant, to a property
                    of Enfantin, where they lived in a communistic society, distinguished by a
                    peculiar dress. Shortly after the chiefs were tried and condemned for
                    proceedings prejudicial to the social order; and the sect was entirely broken up
                    (1832). Many of its members became famous as engineers, economists, and men of
                    business. The idea of constructing the Suez Canal, as carried out by Lesseps,
                    proceeded from the school.</p>
                <p>In the school of Saint-Simon we find a great advance both in the breadth and
                    firmness with which the vague and confused views of the master are developed;
                    and this progress is due chiefly to Bazard. In the philosophy of history they
                    recognize epochs of two kinds, the critical or negative and the organic or
                    constructive. The former, in which philosophy is the dominating force, is
                    characterized by war, egotism, and anarchy; the latter, which is controlled by
                    religion, is marked by the spirit of obedience, devotion, association. The two
                    spirits of antagonism and association are the two great social principles, and
                    on the degree of prevalence of the two depends the character of an epoch. The
                    spirit of association, however, tends more and more to prevail over its
                    opponent, extending from the family to the city, from the city to the nation,
                    and from the nation to the federation. This principle of association is to be
                    the keynote of the social development of the future. Hitherto the law of
                    humanity has been the “exploitation of man by man” in its three stages, slavery,
                    serfdom, the proletariat; in the future the aim must be “the exploitation of the
                    globe by man associated to man.” Under the present system the industrial chief
                    still exploits the proletariat, the members of which, though nominally free,
                    must accept his terms under pain of starvation. This state of things is
                    consolidated by the law of inheritance, whereby the instruments of production,
                    which are private property, and all the attendant social advantages are
                    transmitted without regard to personal merit. The social disadvantages being
                    also transmitted, misery becomes hereditary. The only remedy for this is the
                    abolition of the law of inheritance, and the union of all the instruments of
                    labour in a social fluid, which shall be exploited by association. Society thus
                    becomes sole proprietor, intrusting to social groups and social functionaries
                    the management of the various properties. The right of succession is transferred
                    from the family to the state. The school of Saint-Simon insists strongly on the
                    claims of merit; they advocate a social hierarchy in which each man shall be
                    placed according to his capacity and rewarded according to his works. This is,
                    indeed, a most special and pronounced feature of the Saint-Simon socialism,
                    whose theory of government is a kind of spiritual or scientific autocracy,
                    degenerating into the fantastic sacerdotalism of Enfantin. With regard to the
                    family and the relation of the sexes the school of Saint-Simon advocated the
                    complete emancipation of woman and her entire equality with man. The “social
                    individual” is man and woman, who are associated in the exercise of the triple
                    function of religion, the state, and the family. In its official declarations
                    the school maintained the sanctity of the Christian law of marriage. On this
                    point Enfantin fell into a prurient and fantastic latitudinarianism, which made
                    the school a scandal to France, but many of the most prominent members besides
                    Bazard refused to follow him. Connected with these doctrines was their famous
                    theory of the “rehabilitation of the flesh,” deduced from the philosophic theory
                    of the school, which was a species of Pantheism, though they repudiated the
                    name. On this theory they rejected the dualism so much emphasized by Catholic
                    Christianity in its penances and mortifications, and held that the body should
                    be restored to its due place of honour. It is a vague principle of which the
                    ethical character depends on the interpretation; and it was variously
                    interpreted in the school of Saint-Simon. It was certainly immoral as held by
                    Enfantin, by whom it was developed into a kind of sensual mysticism, a system of
                    free love with a religious sanction.</p>
