                    his works were published under that name, was born at Amboise of a poor but
                    noble family, on the 18th January 1743. By his father’s desire he tried first
                    law and then the army as a profession. While in garrison at Bordeaux, he came

                    drawn from cabbalistic sources, and endeavoured to found thereon a secret cult
                    with magical or theurgical rites. In 1771 Saint-Martin left the army in order to
                    become a social preacher of mysticism. His conversational powers made him
                    welcome in the most aristocratic and polished Parisian salons; but his
                    missionary zeal led him to England, Italy, and Switzerland, as well as to the
                    chief towns of France. At Strasburg in 1788 he met Charlotte de Boecklin, who
                    initiated him in the writings of Jacob Boehme, and at the same time inspired in
                    his breast a semi-romantic attachment. His later years were devoted almost
                    entirely to the composition of his chief works and to the translation of those
                    of Boehme. He died at Aunay, near Paris, on the 23d October 1803.</p>
                <p>His chief works are— <hi rend="italic">Lettre à un ami stir la Revolution
                        Française; Éclair sur l'association humaine; De l'esprit des choses;
                        Ministère de l'homme-esprit.</hi> other treatises appeared in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Oeuvres posthumes</hi> (1807). Saint-Martin regarded the
                    French Revolution as a sermon in action, if not indeed a miniature of the last
                    judgment; its result was to be the regeneration of society by a destruction of
                    its abuses. His ideal society was “a natural and spiritual theocracy,” in which
                    God would raise up men of mark and endowment, who would regard themselves
                    strictly as " divine commissioners” to guide the people through the crises of
                    their history. This mystical dictatorship was to rest entirely upon persuasion.
                    In like manner all ecclesiastical organization was to disappear, giving place to
                    a purely spiritual Christianity, the doctrines of which constitute a species of
                    theosophy. Their philosophical basis in Saint-Martin is the assertion of a
                    faculty superior to the reason, which he calls the moral sense, and from which
                    we derive our knowledge of God. In man, and not elsewhere, is to be found the
                    key to the divine nature. God exists as an eternal personality, and the creation
                    is an overflowing of the divine love, which was unable to contain itself. The
                    human soul, the human intellect or spirit, the spirit of the universe, and the
                    elements or matter are the four stages of this divine emanation, man being the
                    immediate reflexion of God, and nature in turn a reflexion of man. Man, however,
                    has fallen from his high estate, and matter is one of the consequences of his
                    fall. But the divine love, united to humanity in Christ, will work the final
                    regeneration or restoration of all things.</p>
