                    birthplace. He came of a good plebeian family, and entered public life at a
                    comparatively early age, obtaining first the quaestorship, and then being
                    elected tribune of the people in 52 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> that year of
                    political turbulence in which Clodius was killed by Milo. Sallust was opposed to
                    Milo and to Pompey’s party and to the old aristocracy of Rome. From the first he
                    was a decided partisan of Caesar’s, and to Caesar he owed such political
                    advancement as he attained. Unless he was the victim of violent party
                    misrepresentation, he seems to have been morally worthless. In 50 B.C. the
                    censors exercised their power of removing him from the senate on the ground of
                    gross immorality. A few years afterwards, however, no doubt through Caesar’s
                    influence, he was restored to his position, and in 46, in which year Caesar was
                    for the third time consul, he was praetor, and was with Caesar in his African
                    campaign, which ended in the decisive victory of Thapsus over the remains of the
                    Pompeian party and in the suicide of Cato. Sallust remained for a time in Africa
                    as governor of the province of Numidia, which, it would seem, Caesar gave him as
                    a reward for good service. It was said that he enriched himself at the expense
                    of the provincials, but the charge, as far as we know, was never substantiated,
                    though it was rendered highly probable by the fact that he returned to Rome the
                    following year a very rich man, able to purchase and lay out in great splendour
                    those famous gardens on the Quirinal known as the “horti Sallustiani,” -which
                    became subsequently an imperial residence. He now retired from public life and
                    devoted his leisure to letters, for which he had always had a taste, and
                    certainly considerable ability. The fruits of his industry have come down to us
                    in the shape of a history of the famous Catiline conspiracy, of an account of
                    the war with Jugurtha, and of some fragments of a larger work— “histories,” as
                    the Romans called them, “memoirs,” as we should style them. His history of the
                    Catiline conspiracy was his first published work; it is the history of the
                    memorable year 63, when Cicero as consul baffled and confounded Catiline by
                    making all men believe that he was an arch-conspirator against the liberties of
                    his country, who, under specious pretexts of relieving poverty and distress, was
                    really aiming at making himself a tyrant and a despot. Sallust adopts the view
                    which was no doubt the usually accepted one, and he writes accordingly as a
                    political partisan, without giving us a clear insight into the causes and
                    circumstances which gave Catiline a considerable following, and led many to
                    think that his schemes were more respectable than those of a mere wild
                    revolutionist. He does not explain to us at all adequately what Catiline’s plans
                    and views were, but simply paints the man as the deliberate foe of all law,
                    order, and morality. Catiline, it must be remembered, had been of Sulla’s party,
                    to which Sallust was opposed. There may be truth in Mommsen’s suggestion that he
                    was particularly anxious to clear his patron Caesar of all complicity in the
                    conspiracy. Anyhow, the subject was quite one to his taste, as it gave him the
                    opportunity of showing off his rhetoric at the expense of the old Roman
                    aristocracy, whose degeneracy he delighted to paint in the blackest colours. His
                    history, again, of the war with Jugurtha, though a valuable and interesting
                    monograph, is not a satisfactory performance. We may assume that he had
                    collected materials and put together notes for it during his governorship of
                    Numidia. Here too we find him dwelling on the feebleness of the senate and of
                    the aristocracy, and dropping too often into a tiresome moralizing and
                    philosophizing vein, his besetting weakness, but altogether failing us in those
                    really important details of geography and even chronology which we naturally
                    look for in the historians of military operations and campaigns. In all this
                    Sallust is no better than Livy. Of his <hi rend="italic">Histories,</hi> said to
                    have been in five books, and to have commenced with the year 78 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (the year of Sulla’s death), and to have concluded
                    with the year 66, we have but fragments, which are, however, enough to show the
                    political partisan, who took a keen pleasure in describing the reaction which
                    followed on the dictator’s death against his policy and legislation. It is
                    unfortunate that the work has not come down to us entire, as it must have thrown
                    much light on a very eventful period, embracing the war against Sertorius, the
                    campaigns of Lucullus against Mithradates of Pontus, and the victories of the
                    great Pompey in the East. A few fragments of his works were published for the
                    first time from a manuscript in the Vatican early in the present century. We
                    have also two letters <hi rend="italic">(Duae epistolae de Republica
                    ordinando)</hi> addressed to Caesar, letters of political counsel and advice,
                    which have been commonly attributed to Sallust, but as to the authenticity of
                    which we must suspend our judgment.</p>
                <p>The verdict of antiquity was on the whole favourable to Sallust as an historian
                    and as a man of letters. In certain quarters he was decried; his brevity was
                    said to be obscurity, and his fondness for old words and phrases, in which he is
                    said to have imitated his contemporary Cato, was ridiculed as an affectation.
                    Tacitus, however, speaks highly of him <hi rend="italic">{Ann.,</hi> iii. 30);
                    and, to do him justice, we must remember that he struck out for himself almost a
                    new line in literature, as up to his time nothing of much value had been done
                    for Roman history, and his predecessors had been little better than chroniclers
                    and annalists of the “dry-as-dust” type. Sallust aimed at being something like a
                    Roman Thucydides, and, though he falls far short of the great Greek historian,
                    and drifts now and again into mere rhetoric and pedantry, we may at least
                    congratulate ourselves on the possession of his <hi rend="italic">Catiline</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Jugurtha,</hi> and we must feel that fortune has been
                    unkind in depriving us of his larger work, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histories.</hi></p>
