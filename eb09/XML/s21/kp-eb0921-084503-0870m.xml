                    English, but has been largely extended so as to apply in general to all birds of

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Willughby, Rae,
                    and Charleton, it was in their day called in many parts of England "Wierangle”
                    (Germ. <hi rend="italic">Würgengel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Würger,</hi> the
                    Strangler); but it is hard to see how a bird which few people in England could
                    know by sight should have a popular name, though Chaucer had used it in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Assemblye of Foules.</hi></p></note> commonly known as the Greater
                    Butcher-bird, Ash-coloured or Great Grey Shrike,—a bird which visits the British
                    Islands pretty regularly, though not numerously, in autumn or winter,
                    occasionally prolonging its stay into the next summer; but it has never been
                    ascertained to breed there, though often asserted to have done so. This is the
                    more remarkable since it breeds more or less commonly on the Continent from the
                    north of France to within the Arctic Circle. Exceeding a Song-Thrush in linear
                    measurements, it is a much less bulky bird, of a pearly grey above with a
                    well-defined black band passing from the forehead to the ear-coverts; beneath it
                    is nearly white, or— and this is particularly observable in Eastern
                    examples—barred with dusky. The quill-feathers of the wings, and of the
                    elongated tail, are variegated with black and white, but are mostly of the
                    former, though what there is of the latter shows very conspicuously, especially
                    at the base of the remiges, where it forms either a single or a double
                    patch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On this character
                    great store has been laid by some recent writers, who maintain that the birds
                    presenting only a single patch, with some other minor distinctions, as the
                    barred breast above mentioned, come from the far East and deserve specific
                    recognition as the <hi rend="italic">Lanius major</hi> of Pallas. But it is
                    admitted that every intermediate form occurs, and Prof. Collett has now shown
                    <hi rend="italic">(ibis,</hi> 1886, pp. 30-40) that the typical <hi
                    rend="italic">L. excubitor</hi> and typical <hi rend="italic">L. major</hi> may
                    be found in one and the same brood, and also that this occasional divergence is
                    due neither to age nor sex. That it does depend to some extent on locality is
                    allowed; for, though examples with the single patch <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,L.
                    major)</hi> occasionally reach Great Britain, it is asserted that nearly all the
                    specimens from Eastern Siberia are so marked. But it is also found that by
                    almost insensible degrees other (and sometimes more important) distinctions are
                    manifested, and the extreme terms of the several series have been exalted to the
                    rank of "species"—or at least local races. These are too many to be here
                    enumerated, but it may be mentioned that the Great Grey Shrike of North America,
                    which ordinarily has the lower plumage strongly barred, and is usually known as
                    <hi rend="italic">L. borealis,</hi> seems to be only one of these divergent
                    forms, though perhaps the most divergent, as might be expected from the wholly
                    distinct area it occupies. Yet occasionally examples occur in the Old World,
                    which there is no reason to suppose have an American origin, indistinguishable
                    from the typical <hi rend="italic">L. borealis,</hi> and an uninterrupted series
                    from one extreme to the other can be found. The differences when compared with
                    those observable in other animals are, as a whole, too slight to justify the
                    epithet “polymorphic” to <hi rend="italic">L. excubitor</hi> as a species; but
                    enough has been said to show that it indicates a tendency in that
                    direction.</p></note> Much smaller than this is the Red-backed Shrike, <hi
                    rend="italic">L. collurio,</hi> the best-known species in Great Britain, where
                    it is a summer visitor, and, though its distribution is rather local, it may be
                    seen in many parts of England and occasionally reaches Scotland. The cock is a
                    sightly bird with his grey head and neck, black cheek-band, chestnut back, and
                    pale red breast, while the hen is ordinarily of a dull brown, barred on the
                    lower plumage. A more highly coloured species is called the Woodchat, <hi
                    rend="italic">L. auriculatus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rutilus,</hi> with a
                    bright bay crown and nape, and the rest of its plumage black, grey, and white.
                    This is an accidental visitor to England, but breeds commonly throughout Europe.
                    All these birds, with many others included in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lanius,</hi> which there is no room here to specify, have, according to their
                    respective power, the very remarkable habit (whence they have earned their
                    opprobrious name) of catching insects, frogs, lizards, or small birds and
                    mammals, and of spitting them on a thorn or of fixing them in a forked branch,
                    the more conveniently to tear them in pieces and eat them.</p>
                <p>The limits of the Family <hi rend="italic">Laniidae</hi> have been very variously
                    regarded, and agreement between almost any two systematists on this point seems
                    at present out of the question. The latest synopsis is that by Dr Gadow <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cat. B. Brit. Museum,</hi> viii. pp. 88-321), who frankly states
                    that it is “quite impossible to give a concise diagnosis of what we are to
                    understand by” the Family. For his purpose he makes it to include about 250
                    species and divides it into five sub-families :— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnorhininae, Mala-conotinae, Pachycephalinae, Laniinae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Vireoninae.</hi> Of these doubts may be entertained as to the
                    affinity of the first and especially of the last. He, but for the crude plan to
                    which he was compelled to conform, would not have separated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Strepera</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Gymnorhina;</hi> but the former had been
                    already included, to the exclusion of the latter, among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corvidae,</hi> and even placed among the normal <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corvinae.</hi> The need of exercising reserve on this matter has been before
                    stated <hi rend="smallcaps">(Crow,</hi> vol. vi. p. 617); but the number of
                    ornithologists who think that these two genera should be placed in different
                    Families must be small. The view taken by Prof. Parker seems to be the most
                    reasonable: these genera—with others doubtless and most of them Australian—are
                    morphologically inferior to the <hi rend="italic">Corvidae,</hi> and perhaps
                    deserve some such designation as that of “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Noto-Coracomorphae”</hi> suggested by him <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Zool.
                    Society,</hi> ix. p. 327). At the same time their relationship to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Laniidae</hi> appears to be evident, and they may perhaps be best
                    regarded as the less-altered descendants of an old type, whence both the true
                    Crows and the true Shrikes have sprung, each to develop into higher
                    morphological rank, and by the way to throw out numerous other branches. As to
                    the Vireos it would seem almost certain that they have little or no connexion
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Laniidae.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
