                    isthmus was again, after a long period of disuse opened up by the Romans. But it
                    is probable rather that Leucas was then as now separated from the mainland by a
                    shallow lagoon (two feet or less). During the English occupation a canal for
                    boats of four to five feet draught was formed from Fort Santa Maura to the town,
                    but the 16-feet-deep ship canal which it was proposed (1844) to carry right
                    across the lagoon or submerged isthmus to Fort Alexander was only partially
                    excavated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As a six

                    M. Pyat, the engineer employed to report, the dredging could be done for

                    south and 5 to 8 miles in breadth, is a rugged mass of limestone and bituminous
                    shales (partly Tertiary), rising in its principal ridges to heights of 2000 and
                    3000 feet, and presenting very limited areas of level ground. The grain crop
                    suffices only for a few months’ local consumption; but olive oil of good quality
                    is produced to the extent of 30,000 to 50,000 barrels per annum; the vineyards
                    (in the west especially) yield 100,000 barrels of red wine (bought mainly by
                    Rouen, Cette, Trieste, and Venice); the currant, introduced about 1859, has
                    gradually come to be the principal source of wealth (the crop averaging
                    2,500,000 lb); and small quantities of cotton, flax, tobacco, valonia, &amp;c.,
                    are also grown. The salt trade, formerly of importance, has suffered from Greek
                    customs regulations. Though to a large extent unlettered and superstitious, the
                    inhabitants are industrious and well-behaved. The chief town (5000 inhabitants)
                    properly called Amaxikhi, but more usually Santa Maura, after the neighbouring
                    fort, is situated at the north-east end of the island opposite the lagoon. In
                    the south-west is the village of Vasiliki, where a wharf protected by a mole was
                    built in 1877-78 for shipping the currant crop. Remains of Cyclopean and
                    polygonal walls exist at Kaligoni (south of Amaxikhi), probably the site of the
                    ancient acropolis of Neritus (or Nericus), and of the later and lower Corinthian
                    settlement of Leucas. From this point a Roman bridge seems to have crossed to
                    the mainland. Between the town and Fort Santa Maura extends a remarkably fine
                    Turkish aqueduct partly destroyed along with the town by the earthquake of 1825.
                    Forts Alexander and Constantine commanding the bridge are relics of the Russian
                    occupation; the other forts are of Turko-Venetian origin. The magnificent cliff,
                    some 2000 feet high, which forms the southern termination of the modern island
                    still bears the substructions of the temple of Apollo Leucatas (hence the modern
                    name Capo Ducato). At the annual festival of Apollo a criminal was obliged to
                    plunge from the summit into the sea, where, however, an effort was made to pick
                    him up; and it was by the same heroic leap that Sappho and Artemisia, daughter
                    of Lygdamis, are said to have ended their lives.</p>
