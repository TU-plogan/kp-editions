                    <hi rend="italic">Ispalis,</hi> Arabic <hi rend="italic">Ishbíliya),</hi>
                    capital of the above province and the seat of an archbishopric, with a
                    population of 133,938 in 1877, is situated in 37° 22' N. lat. and</p>
                <p>5° 58' W. long., 62 miles</p>
                <p>(95 by rail) north-north-east of Cadiz and 355 miles south-</p>
                <p>south-west of Madrid, on the left bank of the Guadalquivir, which here flows
                    through a level country as productive as a garden. The river is navigable up to
                    the city, which is highly pictur esque in its combination of ancient buildings
                    with busy commerce. From the earliest times the port has been a chief outlet for
                    the wealth of</p>
                <p>Spain. Under the Romans the city was made the capital of Baetica, and became a
                    favourite resort for wealthy</p>
                <p>Romans. The emperors</p>
                <p>Hadrian, Trajan, and Theo dosius were born in the neighbourhood at Italica</p>
                <p>(now Santiponce) where are the remains of a considerable amphitheatre. The chief
                    existing monument of the</p>
                <p>Romans in Seville itself is the aqueduct, on four hundred and ten arches, by
                    which the water from Alcala do Gua-</p>
                <p>daira continued until recently to be supplied to the town.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the 5th century the Silingi Vandals made Seville the seat of
                    their empire, until it passed in 531</p>
                <p>under the Goths, who chose</p>
                <p>Toledo for their capital.</p>
                <p>After the defeat of Don</p>
                <p>Roderick at Guadalete in</p>
                <p>712 the Arabs took posses sion of the city after a siege of some months. Under
                    the</p>
                <p>Arabs Seville continued to flourish. Edrisi speaks in particular of its great
                    export trade in the oil of Aljarafe.</p>
                <p>The district was in great part occupied by Syrian</p>
                <p>Arabs from Emesa, part of the troops that entered Spain with Balj in 741 at the
                    time of the revolt of the Berbers. It was a scion of one of these Emesan
                    families, Abú ’l-Kásim Mohammed, cadi of Seville, who on the fall of the Spanish
                    caliphate headed the revolt of his townsmen against their Berber masters (1023)
                    and became the founder of the Abbádid dynasty, of which Seville was capital, and
                    which lasted under his son Mo'tadid (1042-1069) and grandson Mo'tamid
                    (1069-1091) till the city was taken by the</p>
                <p>Almoravids. The later years of the Almoravid rule were very oppressive to the
                    Moslems of Spain; in 1133 the people of Seville were prepared to welcome the
                    victorious arms of Alphonso VII., and eleven years later Andalusia broke out in
                    general rebellion. Almohade troops now passed over into Spain and took Seville
                    in 1147. Under the Almohades Seville was the seat of government and enjoyed
                    great prosperity; the great mosque was commenced by Yusuf I. and completed by
                    his son the famous Almanzor. In the decline of the dynasty between 1228</p>
                <p>and 1248 Seville underwent various revolutions, and ultimately acknowledged the
                    Hafsite prince, who, however, was unable to save the city from Ferdinand III.,
                    who restored it to Christendom in 1248. The aspect of the town even now is
                    essentially Moorish, with its narrow tortuous streets and fine inner court-yards
                    to the houses. Many of these date from before the Christian conquest, and the
                    walls and towers which until recently encircled the city for a length of 5 miles
                    have a similar origin. The victory of<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0734-0709"/> Ferdinand brought temporary ruin on the city, for
                    it is said that 400,000 of the inhabitants went into voluntary exile, and some
                    time elapsed before Seville recovered from the loss. But its position was too
                    favourable for trade for it to fall into permanent decay, and by the 15th
                    century it was again in a position to derive full benefit from the discovery of
                    America. After the reign of Philip II. its prosperity gradually waned with that
                    of the rest of the Peninsula; yet even in 1700 its silk factories gave
                    employment to thousands of workpeople; their numbers, however, by the end of the
                    18th century had fallen to four hundred. In 1800 an outbreak of yellow fever
                    carried off 30,000 of the inhabitants, and in 1810 the city suffered severely
                    from the French under Soult, who plundered to the extent of six millions
                    sterling. Since that time it has gradually recovered prosperity, and is now one
                    of the most busy and active centres of trade in the peninsula. Politically
                    Seville has always had the reputation of peculiar loyalty to the throne from the
                    time when, on the death of Ferdinand III., it was the only city which remained
                    faithful to his son Alphonso the Wise. It was consequently much favoured by the
                    monarchs, and frequently a seat of the court. In 1729 the treaty between
                    England, France, and Spain was signed in the city; in 1808 the central junta was
                    formed here and removed in 1810 to Cadiz; in 1823 the cortes brought the king
                    with them from Madrid; and in 1848 Seville combined with Malaga and Granada
                    against Espartero, who bombarded the city but fled on the return of Queen Maria
                    Christina to Madrid.</p>
                <p>Seville contains treasures of art and architecture which make it one of the most
                    interesting cities in Europe. The cathedral, dedicated to Santa Maria de la
                    Sede, ranks in size only after St Peter’s at Rome, being 415 feet long, 298 feet
                    wide, and 150 feet high to the roof of the nave. The west front is approached by
                    a high flight of steps, and the platform on which the cathedral stands is
                    surrounded by a hundred shafts of columns from the mosque which formerly
                    occupied the site. The work of building began in 1403 and was finished in 1519,
                    so that the one style of Spanish Pointed Gothic is fairly preserved throughout
                    the interior, however much the exterior is spoiled by later additions.
                    Unfortunately the west front remained unfinished until 1827, when the central
                    doorway was completed in a very inferior manner; but this has now been renewed
                    in a purer style. At the east end are two fine Gothic doorways with good
                    sculpture in the tympana; and on the north side the Puerta del Perdon, as it is
                    called, has some very exquisite detail over the horse-shoe arch, and a pair of
                    fine bronze doors. The exterior of the cathedral may be disappointing, but the
                    interior leaves little to be desired. It forms a parallelogram containing a nave
                    and four aisles with surrounding chapels, a central dome 171 feet high inside,
                    and at the east end a royal sepulchral chapel, which was an addition of the 16th
                    century. The thirty-two immense clustered columns, the ninety-three windows,
                    mostly filled with the finest glass by Flemish artists of the 16th century, and
                    the profusion of art work of various kinds displayed on all sides produce an
                    unsurpassed effect of magnificence and grandeur. The reredos is an enormous
                    Gothic work containing forty-four panels of gilt and coloured wood carvings by
                    Dancart, dating from 1482, and a silver statue of the Virgin by Francisco Alfaro
                    of 1596. The archbishop’s throne and the choir-stalls (1475-1548) are fine
                    pieces of carving, and amongst the notable metal-work are the railings (1519) by
                    Sancho Nunoz, and the lectern by Bartolome Morel of the same period. The bronze
                    candelabrum for tenebrae, 25 feet in height, is a splendid work by Morel. In the
                    Sacristia Alta is a silver repoussé reliquary presented by Alphonso the Wise in
                    the 13th century; and in the Sacristia Mayor, which is a good plateresque
                    addition by Diego de Riaño in 1530, is a magnificent collection of church plate
                    and vestments. At the west end of the nave is the grave of Ferdinand, the son of
                    Columbus, and at the east end, in the royal chapel, lies the body of St
                    Ferdinand, which is exposed three times in the year. This chapel also contains a
                    curious life-size image of the Virgin, which was presented to the royal saint by
                    St Louis of France in the 13th century. It is in carved wood with movable arms,
                    seated on a silver throne and with hair of spun gold. The chief pictures in the
                    cathedral are the Guardian Angel and the St Anthony of Murillo, the Holy Family
                    of Tobar, the Nativity and La Genera-cion of Luis de Vargas, Valdes Leal’s
                    Marriage of the Virgin, and Guadalupe’s Descent from the Cross. In the Sacristia
                    Alta are three fine paintings by Alexo Fernandez, and in the Sala Capitular are
                    a Conception by Murillo and a St Ferdinand by Pacheco. The organ is one of the
                    largest in the world; it contains over 5300 pipes. A curious and unique ritual
                    is observed by the choir boys on the festivals of Corpus Christi and the
                    Immaculate Conception, —a solemn dance with castanets being performed by them
                    before the altar; the custom is an old one but its origin is obscure. The
                    Sagrario on the north of the cathedral is a Renaissance addition by Miguel de
                    Zumarraga, which serves as the parish church. At the north-east corner of the
                    cathedral stands the Giralda, a bell tower of Moorish origin, 275 feet in
                    height. The lower part of the tower, or about 185 feet, was built in the latter
                    half of the 12th century by Abu Yusuf Yakub; the upper part and the belfry,
                    which is surmounted by a vane formed of a bronze figure 14 feet high
                    representing The Faith, were added by Fernando Ruiz in 1568. The ascent is made
                    by a series of inclined planes. The exterior is encrusted with delicate Moorish
                    detail, and the tower is altogether the finest specimen of its kind in Europe.
                    At the base lies the Court of Oranges, of which only two sides now remain; the
                    original Moorish fountain, however, is still preserved. But the chief relic of
                    the Arab dominion in Seville is the Alcazar, a palace excelled in interest and
                    beauty only by the Alhambra of Granada. It was begun in 1181 by Jalubi during
                    the best period of the Almohades, and was surrounded by walls and towers of
                    which the Torre del Oro, a decagonal tower on the river side, is now the
                    principal survival. Pedro the Cruel made considerable alterations and additions
                    in the 14th century, and worse havoc was afterwards wrought by Charles V.
                    Restorations have been effected as far as possible, and the palace is now an
                    extremely beautiful example of Moorish work. The façade, the hall of
                    ambassadors, and the Patio de las Muñecas are the most striking portions, after
                    which may be ranked the Patio de las Doncellas and the chapel of Isabella. Among
                    other Moorish remains in Seville may be mentioned the Casa O’Shea, which is
                    somewhat spoiled by whitewash, and the Casa de las Dueñas, with eleven
                    court-yards and nine fountains. The Casa de Pilatos is in a pseudo-Moorish style
                    of the 15th century, and, in addition to its elegant court-yard surrounded by a
                    marble colonnade, contains some fine decorative work. The Casa de los Abades is
                    in the Sevillian plateresque style, which is strongly-tinged with Moorish
                    feeling. The following are the most notable churches in Seville :—Santa Maria la
                    Blanca, an old Jewish synagogue; San Marcos, badly restored, but with a
                    remarkable mudejar portal; Omnium Sanctorum, erected upon the ruins of a Roman
                    temple; San Juan de la Palma; San Julian; Santa Catalina; San Miguel; San
                    Clemente el Real; the church of La Sangre Hospital; the Gothic Parroquia of
                    Santa Ana, in the Triana suburb; and La Caridad. The last-named belongs to a
                    well-conducted almshouse founded by the Sevillian Don Juan, Miguel de Manãra. It
                    possesses six masterpieces by Murillo, and two by Valdés Leal. The other
                    churches, though generally deficient in architectural interest, are enriched by
                    the products of the brush or chisel of Pacheco, Montanes, Alonso Cano, Valdés
                    Leal, Roelas, Campana, Morales, Vargas, and Zurbaran. The museum was formerly
                    the church and convent of La Merced. It now contains priceless examples of the
                    Seville school of painting, which flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries.
                    Among the masters represented are Velazquez and Murillo (both natives of
                    Seville), Zurbaran, Roelas, Herrera the Elder, Pacheco, Juan de Castillo, Alonso
                    Cano, Cespedes, Bocanegra, Valdes Leal, Goya, and Martin de Vos. The university
                    was founded in 1502, and its present buildings were originally a convent built
                    in 1567 from designs by Herrera, but devoted to its present use in 1767 on the
                    expulsion of the Jesuits. The Casa del Ayuntamiento, in the cinquecento style,
                    was begun in 1545, and has a fine staircase and hall and handsome carved doors.
                    The Lonja, or exchange, was built by Herrera in 1585 in his severe Doric and
                    Ionic style; the brown and red marble staircase which leads to the Archivo de
                    Indias is the best part of the design. The archives contain 30,000 volumes
                    relating to the voyages of Spanish discoverers, many of which are still
                    unexamined. The archbishop’s palace dates from 1697; the most notable features
                    are the Churri-gueresque doorway and staircase. The royal cigar factory is an
                    immense building 662 feet long by 524 feet wide, and contains twentyeight
                    court-yards. Employment is given in it to 4500 hands, who work up 2,000,000
                    pounds of tobacco yearly. The palace of San Telmo, now occupied by the duke of
                    Montpensier, was formerly the seat of a naval college originally founded by the
                    son of Columbus. The immense doorway is the principal architectural feature. The
                    picture gallery is interesting and important. The chief squares in Seville are
                    the Plaza Nueva, the Plaza de la Constitucion, the Plaza del Duque, and the
                    Plaza del Triunfo. The bull-ring accommodates 18,000 spectators, and is the next
                    in size to that at Madrid. There are several beautiful promenades, the principal
                    being Las Delicias, along the river bank below the town. The city also contains
                    several theatres. Across the river, and connected with the city by a bridge, is
                    the Gipsy quarter of the Triana. The navigation of the river has been improved
                    of late years so that vessels of large draught can now ascend the stream. The
                    results are shown in a larger trade, and in<pb break="no"

                    amounted to 358,541 tons (65,324 British). The imports were valued at
                    £1,879,522, and the exports at £1,190,625. In the latter were included 3110 tuns
                    of olive oil shipped to the United Kingdom, and 1610 tons of quicksilver from
                    the Almaden mines, which had formerly sent their produce <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Lisbon. In addition to strictly local industries the chief factories
                    of the city are the tobacco factory, the cannon foundry, and the small-arms
                    factory. There are also a petroleum refinery, some soap works, iron foundries,
                    artificial ice and marmalade factories, and several potteries. The ancient
                    sources of water supply having proved insufficient, a new system of waterworks
                    was designed, and was brought to a successful completion in 1883 by a firm of
                    English engineers. (H. B. B. )</p>
