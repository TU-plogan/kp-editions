                    grandduchy and a member of the German empire. It consists of the three chief
                    detached districts of Weimar, Eisenach, and Neustadt, and twenty-four scattered
                    exclaves, of which Allstedt, Oldisleben, and Ilmenau belonging to Weimar, and
                    Ostheim belonging to Eisenach, are the chief. The first and last named of these
                    exclaves are 70 miles apart; and the most easterly of the other exclaves is 100
                    miles from the most westerly. The total area of the grand-duchy is 1387 square
                    miles (or slightly larger than Wiltshire in England), of which 678 are in
                    Weimar, 465 in Eisenach, and 244 in Neustadt.</p>
                <p>The district of Weimar, which is at once the largest division and the
                    geographical and historical kernel of the grand-duchy, is a roughly circular
                    territory, situated on the plateau to the north-east of the Thuringian Forest.
                    It is bounded on the N. and E. by Prussia, on the S. and W. by the Schwarzburg
                    Oberherrschaft and detached portions of Saxe-Altenburg, and lies 23 miles east
                    of the nearest part of Eisenach, and 7 miles north-west of the nearest part of
                    Neustadt. The exclaves of Allstedt and Oldisleben lie in Prussian territory 10
                    miles to the north and north-west respectively; Ilmenau as far to the southwest.
                    The surface is undulating and destitute of any striking natural features,
                    although the valleys of the Saale and Ilm are picturesque. The Kickelhahn (2825
                    feet) and the Hohe Tanne (2641 feet) rise in Ilmenau; but the Grosser Kalm
                    (1814) near Remda, in the extreme south, is the highest point in the main part
                    of Weimar. The broad-based Ettersburg (1519 feet), a part of which is known as
                    “Herder’s Hill” after the poet, rises on the Ilm plateau, near Ettersburg, where
                    Schiller finished his <hi rend="italic">Maria Stuart.</hi> The Saale flows
                    through the east of the district, but, although the chief river
                    hydrographically, it yields in fame to its tributary the Ilm. The Unstrut joins
                    the Saale from Oldisleben and Allstedt. The chief towns are Weimar, the capital,
                    on the Ilm; Jena, with the common university of the Thuringian states, on the
                    Saale; and Apolda, the “Manchester of Weimar,” to the west.</p>
                <p>Eisenach, the second district in size, and the first in point of natural beauty,
                    stretches in a narrow strip from north to south on the extreme western boundary
                    of Thuringia, and includes parts of the church lands of Fulda, of Hesse, and of
                    the former countship of Henneberg. It is bounded on the N. and W. by Prussia, on
                    the S. by Bavaria (which also surrounds the exclave of Ostheim), and on the E.
                    by Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Gotha. The north is occupied by the rounded hills of
                    the Thuringian Forest, while the Rhön Mountains extend into the southern part.
                    The chief summits of the former group, which is more remarkable for its fine
                    forests and picturesque scenery than for its height, are the Wartburg Hill (1355
                    feet), the north-western termination of the system, Ottowald (2103 feet),
                    Wachstein (1801 feet), Ringberg (2106 feet), Hohe Vogelheid (2378 feet), and the
                    Glöckner (2211 feet). Among the Rhön Mountains in Eisenach the loftiest summits
                    are the Elnbogen (2677 feet), Bayer-berg (2359 feet), Hohe Rain (2375), and the
                    Glaserberg (2231 feet). The chief river is the Werra, which flows across the
                    centre of the district from east to west, and then bending suddenly northwards,
                    re-enters from Prussia, and traverses the north-eastern parts in an irregular
                    course. Its chief tributaries in Eisenach are the Hörsel and the Ulster.
                    Eisenach is the only town of importance in this division of the grand-duchy.</p>
                <p>Neustadt, the third of the larger divisions, is distinguished neither by
                    picturesque scenery nor historical interest. It forms an oblong territory, about
                    24 miles long by 16 broad, and belongs rather to the hilly district of the
                    Voigtland than to Thuringia. It is bounded on the N. by Reuss (junior line) and
                    Saxe-Altenburg, on the W. by Saxe-Meiningen and a Prussian exclave, on the S. by
                    the two Reuss principalities, and on the E. by the kingdom of Saxony. The
                    Kesselberg (1310 feet) near the town of Neustadt is the chief eminence. This
                    district lies in the basin of the Saale, its chief streams being the White
                    Elster, the Weida, and the Orla. Neustadt, Auma, and</p>
                <p>Weida are the principal towns.</p>
                <p>Agriculture forms the chief occupation of the inhabitants in all parts of the
                    duchy, though in Eisenach and Ilmenau a large proportion of the area is covered
                    with forests. According to the returns for 1883, 56·3 per cent. of the entire
                    surface was occupied by arable land, 25·8 per cent. by forests, 8·8 by pasture
                    and meadow-land, and 4·1 per cent. by buildings, roads, and water, Only 5 per
                    cent. was unproductive soil or moorland. These figures indicate that
                    Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach has nearly as large a percentage of arable land as
                    Saxe-Alien burg, and, notwithstanding the extensive woods in Eisenach and
                    Ilmenau, a lower proportion of forest than any other Thuringian state. In 1883
                    the chief grain crops were oats (80,682 acres, yielding 38,271 tons), barley
                    (78,067 acres, 45,249 tons), rye (72,607 acres, 29,006 tons), and wheat (47,732
                    acres, 19,949 tons). About 50,000 acres were planted with potatoes, yielding
                    237,627 tons, or nearly 4 per cent. per acre less than the average of the five
                    years immediately preceding. All the grain crops were slightly above the average
                    of the same period. The 79,405 acres devoted to hay produced 98,910 tons. Among
                    the other crops were beetroot for sugar (8602 acres), flax (1300 acres), and
                    oil-yielding plants (4562 acres). Fruit grows in abundance, especially in the
                    neighbourhood of Jena, in the valley of the Gleisse, and on the lower Ilm; 1070
                    acres, mostly on the banks of the Saale, were occupied with vines. Of the
                    forests 38·5 per cent. are deciduous and 61·5 per cent. coniferous trees; fully
                    a half of the former are beeches. The greater part of the forests belong to the
                    Government. Cattle-raising is carried on to a considerable extent, especially in
                    Eisenach and Neustadt, while the sheepfarming centres in Weimar. The grand-ducal
                    stud-farm in Allstedt maintains the breed of horses. In 1883 the duchy contained
                    17,271 horses, 110,092 cattle, 145,442 sheep, 101,443 pigs, and 41,291 goats.
                    Although iron, copper, cobalt, and lignite are worked, the mineral wealth is
                    trifling. Salt is also worked at different places.</p>
                <p>The manufacturing industries in the grand-duchy are consider - able; they employ
                    37·3 per cent. of the population. The most important is the textile industry,
                    which centres in Apolda, and employs more than 20,000 hands throughout the
                    country. The production of woollen goods (stockings, cloth, underclothing) forms
                    the leading branch of the industry; but cotton and linen weaving and
                    yarn-spinning are also carried on. Large quantities of earthenware and crockery
                    are made, especially at Ilmenau. The microscopes of Jena, the scientific
                    instruments (thermometers, barometers, &amp;c.) of Ilmenau, and the pipes and
                    cigar-holders of Ruhla (partly in Gotha) are well known. Leather, paper, glass,
                    cork, and tobacco are among the less prominent manufactures. There are numerous
                    breweries in the duchy. The volume of trade is not very great, although some of
                    the productions (chiefly those first mentioned) are exported all over Europe,
                    and in some cases to other continents as well. The chief imports, besides<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n369/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0369-0350"/> colonial goods, are wool for the manufactures,
                    hides, coal, meerschaum (from Smyrna and Vienna), amber, horn, Ac. Eisenach and
                    Weimar are the chief seats of trade.</p>
                <p>The population in 1880 was 309,577, or 223 per square mile, of whom 297,735 were
                    Lutherans, 10,267 Roman Catholics, 327 Christians of other sects, and 1248 Jews.
                    The Thuringian and Franconian branches of the Teutonic family are both
                    represented in the duchy. According to the employment census of 1882,
                    agriculture, forestry, and fishing supported 135,200 or 44 per cent. of the
                    population; industrial pursuits, 114,835 or 87‘3 per cent.; trade, 23,939 or 7·8
                    per cent.; service, 4086 or 1·3 per cent.; official, military, and professional
                    employments, 16,066 or 5·2 per cent; while 13,597 persons or 4 4 per cent. made
                    no returns.</p>
                <p>Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach is a limited hereditary monarchy, and was the first state in
                    Germany to receive a liberal constitution. This was granted in 1816 by Charles
                    Augustus, the patron of Goethe, and was revised in 1850. The diet consists of
                    one chamber with thirty-one members, of whom one is chosen by the nobility, four
                    by owners of land worth at least £150 a year, five by those who derive as much
                    from other sources, and twenty-one by the rest of the inhabitants. The diet
                    meets every three years; the deputies are elected for six years. The franchise
                    is enjoyed by all domiciled citizens over twenty-five years of age. The
                    government is carried on by a ministry of three, holding tho portfolios of
                    finance, of home and foreign affairs, and of religion, education, and justice,
                    with which is combined the ducal household. The budget for the finance-period
                    1884-86 estimated the yearly income at £308,586 and the yearly expenditure at
                    about £1560 less. The public debt is more than covered by the active capital.
                    The ducal house receives a civil list of £46,500. The Saxe-Weimar family is the
                    oldest branch of the Ernestine line, and hence of the whole Saxon house. By
                    treaties of succession the grand-duke is the next heir to the throne of Saxony,
                    should the present Albertine line become extinct. He is entitled to the
                    predicate of “royal highness.” By a treaty with Prussia in 1867, which
                    afterwards became the model for similar treaties between Prussia and other
                    Thuringian states, the troops of the grand-duchy were incorporated with the
                    Prussian army.</p>
                <p>In early times Weimar, with the surrounding district, belonged to the counts of
                    Orlamünde, and from the end of the 10th century until 1067 it was tho seat of a
                    line of counts of its own. It afterwards fell to the landgrave of Thuringia, and
                    in 1440 passed into the possession of Frederick the Mild, elector of Saxony.
                    Involved after the convention of Wittenberg (1547) in the complicated and
                    constantly shifting succession arrangements of the Ernestine dukes of Saxony,
                    who delayed the introduction of primogeniture, Weimar does not emerge into an
                    independent historical position until 1640, when the brothers William, Albert,
                    and Ernest the Pious founded the principalities of Weimar, Eisenach, and Gotha.
                    Eisenach fell to Weimar in 1644, and, although the principality was once more
                    temporarily split into tho lines Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Eisenach (1672-1741), and
                    Saxe-Jena (1672-1690), it was again reunited under Ernest Augustus (1728-1748),
                    who secured it against future subdivision by adopting the principle of
                    primogeniture. His son of the same name who succeeded died in 1758, two years
                    after his marriage with Anna Amalia of Brunswick. Next year the duchess Amalia,
                    although not yet twenty years old, was appointed by the emperor regent of the
                    principality and guardian of her infant son Charles Augustus (1758-1828). The
                    reign of the latter, who assumed the government in 1775, is the most brilliant
                    epoch in the history of Saxe-Weimar. A gifted and intelligent patron of
                    literature and art, Charles Augustus attracted to his court the leading authors
                    and scholars of Germany. Goethe, Schiller, and Herder were members of the
                    illustrious society of the capital, and tho university of Jena became a focus of
                    light and learning, so that the hitherto obscure little state attracted the eyes
                    of all Europe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An
                    article on Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach would hardly be complete without Goethe’s famous
                    lines :—</p><p>“Klein ist unter den Fürsten Germaniens freilich der
                    meine,</p><p>Kurz und schmal ist sein Land, mässig nur was er vermag;</p><p>Aber
                    so wende nach innen, so wende nach aussen die Kräfte Jeder, da wär* ein Fest
                    Deutscher mit Deutschen zu Bein.”</p></note> The war with France was fraught
                    with danger to tho continued existence of the principality, and after the battle
                    of Jena (October 14, 1806) it was mainly tho skilful management of the duchess
                    Louise that dissuaded Napoleon from removing her husband from among the reigning
                    princes. In 1807 Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach entered the Confederation of the Rhine,
                    and was promoted from a principality (Fürstenthum) to a duchy (Herzogthum). In
                    the following campaigns it suffered greatly; and in 1815 the congress of Vienna
                    recompensed its ruler with an addition to his territory of 660 square miles
                    (including most of Neustadt) with 77,000 inhabitants, and with the title of
                    grand-duke (Grossherzog). O11 the restoration of peace Charles Augustus redeemed
                    his promise of granting a liberal constitution (1816). Freedom of the press was
                    also granted, but after the festival of the Wartburg in 1819 it was seriously
                    curtailed. Charles Frederick (1828-1853) continued his father’s policy, but his
                    reforms were neither thorough enough nor rapid enough to avert political
                    commotion in 1848. A popular ministry received power, and numerous reforms were
                    carried through. Reaction set in under Charles Alexander, who succeeded his
                    father in 1853, and the union of the state-lands and crown-lands was repealed,
                    though both were appointed to remain under the same public management. In 1866
                    the grand-duchy joined Prussia against Austria, although its troops were then
                    garrisoning towns in the Austrian interest; later it entered the North German
                    Confederation. The press restrictions were removed in 1868 and the tendency of
                    recent legislation has been liberal. (F. MU.)</p>
