                    situated on a slightly elevated peninsula formed by a bend of the Severn, and on
                    various railway lines, 30 miles south of Chester, and 163 northwest of London by
                    the London and North-Western Railway, the distance by the Great Western being
                    171 miles. The Severn is crossed by three stone bridges,—the English bridge
                    (re-erected 1774), on the east, consisting of seven semicircular arches; the
                    Welsh bridge (re-erected 1795), of five arches, on the west; and the Kingsland
                    bridge (opened in 1882), of iron on the bow and girder principle. The streets
                    are hilly and irregular, but strikingly picturesque from their number of antique
                    timber houses, among which may be mentioned that in Butcher Row formerly the
                    town residence of the abbot of Lilleshall, and the old council-house overlooking
                    the Severn, erected in 1502 for the presidents of the council of the Welsh
                    marches. Of the town ramparts built in the reign of Henry III. the principal
                    remains are a small portion on the north side called the Roushill walls, and
                    another portion on the southwest, used as a public walk, on which stands a
                    square embattled tower. The castle built by Roger de Montgomery was dismantled
                    in the reign of James II., but there still remain the archway of the interior
                    gateway, the walls of the inner court, and two large round towers of the time of
                    Edward I. Roger de Montgomery also founded in 1083 the abbey of St Peter and St
                    Paul, which was of great extent and very richly endowed. At the dissolution it
                    was destroyed, except part of the nave and the western tower of the church,
                    which have been converted into a parish church, under the name of the church of
                    the Holy Cross. The other churches of special interest are St Mary’s, founded
                    in. the 10th century, a fine cruciform structure with a tower and spire 222 feet
                    in height, displaying examples of various styles of architecture from Early
                    Norman to Perpendicular,—the base of the tower, the nave, and the doorways being
                    Norman, the transept Early English, and the aisles 15th century, while the
                    interior is specially worthy of notice for its elaborate details, its stained
                    glass, and its ancient monuments; St Julian’s, originally built before the
                    Conquest, but rebuilt in 1748, except the tower, the older portion of which is
                    Norman and the upper part 15th century; St Alkmond’s, also dating from the 10th
                    century, but rebuilt towards the close of the 18th century, with the exception
                    of the tower and spire; and St Giles’s, dating from the time of Henry I., much
                    altered at various periods, but still retaining its ancient nave and chancel.
                    The old church of St Chad, supposed to have occupied the site of a palace of the
                    princes of Powis, was destroyed by the fall of the tower in 1788, and of the
                    ancient building the bishop’s chancel alone remains. The new church of St Chad
                    was built on another site in 1792. There are still slight remains of the abbey
                    of Greyfriars founded in 1291, and of the Augustine friary founded in 1255. The
                    old buildings completed in 1630 for the free grammar-school of Edward VI.,
                    founded in 1551, are now occupied by the county museum and free library, the
                    school having been removed in 1882 to new buildings at Kingsland. Among the
                    principal secular buildings of the town are the fine market-house in the
                    Elizabethan style (completed according to an inscription over the northern arch
                    in 1595), the shire hall (rebuilt in 1837, and again, after a fire, in 1883),
                    the music-hall buildings (1840), the general market and corn exchange (1869),
                    the working-men’s hall (1863), the drapers’ hall (an old timbered structure
                    dating from the 16th century), the theatre (1834), and the post-office (1877).
                    The principal benevolent institutions are the county infirmary (1747),
                    Millington’s hospital (1734), and the eye, ear, and throat hospital (1881). A
                    monument to Lord Clive was erected in the market-place in 1860, and a Doric
                    memorial pillar to General Lord Hill in 1816 at the top of the Abbey Foregate.
                    The town racecourse occupies a portion of the “Soldiers’ Piece,” where Charles
                    I. addressed his army in 1642. To the south-west of the town is a fine park, 23
                    acres in extent, known as the Quarry, adorned by a beautiful avenue of lime
                    trees. Formerly Shrewsbury was one of the principal marts for Welsh flannel, but
                    this trade has now in great part ceased. Glass-staining, the spinning of flax
                    and linen yarn, iron-founding, brewing, malting, the preparation of brawn, and
                    the manufacture of the well-known Shrewsbury cakes are now the principal
                    industries. The population of the municipal and parliamentary borough (area,
                    3674 acres) in 1871 was 23,406, and in 1881 it was 26,478.</p>
                <p>Shrewsbury, anciently called Pengwerne, was founded in the 5th century as a
                    defence against the inroads of the Saxons, and became the seat of the princes of
                    Powis. After its conquest by the Saxons its name was changed to Scrobbesbyrig,
                    altered gradually into Sloppesbury, Shrewsbury, and Salop. It became one of the
                    principal cities of the Saxon kingdom, and a mint was established there by
                    Athelstan about 925. After the Norman Conquest it was included in the earldom of
                    Shrewsbury bestowed by William I. on Roger de Montgomery, who erected a strong
                    castle on the site of the ancient Saxon fortress. But in 1067 it was besieged by
                    Owen Gwynedd, prince of Wales, till relieved by William, who marched specially
                    to its assistance from York. On the rebellion of Robert de Belesme, son of the
                    first earl of Shrewsbury, the castle and town were attacked by Henry I. and
                    surrendered in 1102. During the wars of the next two centuries the town was
                    frequently attacked and plundered by the Welsh, being captured by Llewelyn in
                    1215, surrendered to the English in 1221, plundered by the earl of Pembroke in
                    1223, burnt by Llewelyn ap Jorwerth in January 1234, taken by Simon de Montfort
                    in 1264, and restored to the crown in 1265. In 1267 Henry III. assembled his
                    army there, to threaten the Welsh, but peace was restored without bloodshed,
                    after which he strengthened its fortifications. Edward I. in 1277 made it the
                    seat of his government, and removed to it the Courts of Exchequer and King’s
                    Bench. In 1283 he held a parliament there for the trial of David, the last of
                    the royal princes of Wales, who was dragged through the streets of the town and
                    afterwards hanged and quartered. At a parliament held in Shrewsbury in January
                    1398 Richard II. assumed the title of Earl of Chester. Near the town was fought,
                    23d July 1403, the battle of Shrewsbury, described in Shakespeare’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Henry IV,</hi> when the king defeated the earl of Northumberland
                    with great slaughter, Hotspur, the earl’s son, being among the slain. It became
                    the headquarters of Charles I., 20th September 1642, but was taken by the
                    Parliamentarians in February 1645. The town from the reign of William I. to that
                    of James II. received no less than thirty-two charters, its first governing
                    charter being obtained from Richard I. It returned two members to parliament
                    from the reign of Edward I. until 1885, when it was allowed only one.</p>
