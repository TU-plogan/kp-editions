                    d’épargne;</hi> Germ. <hi rend="italic">Sparkassen)</hi> are institutions for
                    the purpose of receiving small deposits of money and investing them for the
                    benefit of the depositors at compound interest. They are, in general, managed by
                    benevolent persons, who seek no remuneration for their services. They originated
                    in the latter part of the 18th century—a period marked by a great advance in the
                    organization of provident habits in general (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Friendly
                    Societies).</hi> They had been, however, one of the many excellent projects
                    suggested by Daniel Defoe in 1697. The earliest institution of the kind in
                    Europe was one established at Brunswick in 1765; it was followed in 1778 by that
                    of Hamburg, which still exists, in 1786 by one at Oldenburg, in 1790 by one at
                    Loire, in 1792 by that of Basel, in 1794 by one at Geneva, which had but a short
                    existence, and in 1796 by one at Kiel in Holstein. In Great Britain, in 1797,
                    Jeremy Bentham revived Defoe’s suggestion under the name of “Frugality Banks,”
                    and in 1799 the Rev. Joseph Smith put it in action at Wendover. This was
                    followed in 1801 by the addition of a savings bank to the friendly society which
                    Mrs Priscilla Wakefield had established in 1798. Savings banks were shortly
                    after established in London, Bath, Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire, Edinburgh, Kelso,
                    Hawick, Southampton, and many other places. By 1817 they had become numerous
                    enough to claim the attention of the legislature, and Acts of Parliament were
                    passed for their management and control. Their progress in the United Kingdom
                    since that date is shown by the following statement :—</p>

                <p>From this table some interesting conclusions may be drawn as to the operations of
                    savings banks in the larger towns. These 21 banks have together more than 50 per
                    cent. of the depositors, more than 45 per cent. of the deposits, and more than
                    65 per cent. of the transactions of all the 411 savings banks of the United
                    Kingdom.</p>
                <p>The progress of savings banks and the large amount that the deposits have now
                    reached are evidence of the general fitness of the organization for its purpose.
                    So far as regards trustee savings banks, the provisions of the Acts of 1817 are
                    still to a great extent the same as those by which they are now regulated,
                    though the law has been frequently amended in matters of detail, and twice (1828
                    and 1863) consolidated. Its main feature is the requirement that the whole of
                    the funds should be invested with the Government through the Commissioners for
                    the Reduction of the National Debt. The local management of the banks has been
                    left entirely to the trustees, who are precluded from receiving any remuneration
                    for their services or making any profit. They are, however, required to furnish
                    the commissioners with periodical returns of their transactions. This blending
                    of private management with state control has had many advantages in knitting
                    together class and class, and in many places the voluntary trustees and managers
                    have been able to render real service to the depositors in various ways. A new
                    savings bank requires for its establishment the consent of the National Debt
                    Commissioners and the certificate of the registrar of friendly societies to its
                    rules; but since the opening of the post office savings banks in 1861 few have
                    been established, and many old savings banks have been closed, not being able to
                    offer to their depositors the same advantages as the new system. The savings
                    banks, which numbered 640 in 1861, have thus been reduced to 411, and their
                    capital has been maintained rather by the accumulation of interest than by fresh
                    deposits.</p>
                <p>The legislation of 1817, among other inducements to thrift, offered that of a
                    bounty to the savings bank depositor in the shape of a rate of interest in
                    excess of that given to the ordinary public creditor, or—which is the same
                    thing—in excess of that which could be earned by the investment of the deposits
                    in the purchase of Government stock. The interest offered in the first instance
                    was 3d. per day, or £4, 11s. 3d. per cent. per annum; and that rate continued to
                    be granted until the passing of the Act of 1828 (9 Geo. IV. c. 92). That Act
                    reduced the rate of interest allowed to the trustees of savings banks to 2½ d.
                    per day, or £3, 16s. 0½ d. per annum, and prohibited them from allowing more to
                    their depositors than 2 1/4 d. per day, or £3, 8s. 5 1/4 d. per annum, requiring
                    them to pay the surplus, if any, into a separate fund held by the National Debt
                    Commissioners, but bearing no interest. In 1844 the interest to trustees was
                    further reduced to 2d. per day, or £3, 5s. per cent., the maximum to be allowed
                    to depositors being fixed at £3, 0s. 10d. Finally, in 1880 the interest to
                    trustees has been reduced to £3, and that to depositors to £2, 15s.</p>
                <p>The result of the bonus on thrift offered by the earlier statutes was a loss to
                    the state, which ought to have been made good by an annual vote. Between 1817
                    and 1828 the difference between the interest credited and that earned amounted
                    to £744,363; and this led to the reduction in the rate of interest effected by
                    the Act of the latter year. The deficiency, instead of being paid off, was
                    allowed still to accumulate, and as the price of stock rose and the deposits
                    increased fresh deficiencies arose, so that by 1844 the deficiency, which would
                    have been 1½ millions by the mere accumulation of interest on the previous
                    £744,363, had become £3,179,930. The reduction of interest in 1844 was about
                    enough to make the fund self-supporting, though savings banks are always, as Mr
                    Scratchley clearly shows, liable to loss from the fact that deposits are in
                    excess when the funds are high and withdrawals when they are low; but the past
                    deficiency was still allowed to accumulate, and it was not till 1880 that the
                    plan was adopted of voting the deficiency every year. Had the accumulated
                    deficiency been then liquidated, there would have been no necessity for an
                    annual vote. The bad political economy of the legislators of 1817 has left us
                    this legacy of annual deficits. Had they provided the bounty at their own
                    expense instead of that of their descendants, there would have been little to be
                    said against it.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0348-0329"/> The offer of a bonus on thrift was of necessity
                    accompanied by provisions to guard against its being used by others than the
                    classes it was intended to encourage. This was done by limiting the amount that
                    each depositor should be permitted to pay in. In the first instance, in England
                    the limit was fixed at £100 for the first year, and £50 a year afterwards. In
                    1824 these limits were reduced to £50 for the first year, £30 a year afterwards,
                    and £200 in the whole. In 1828 the limit was adopted which still remains in
                    force of £30 a year or £150 in the whole, allowed by addition of interest to
                    increase to £200 but no further. Attempts have been frequently made to raise the
                    annual limit to £50, but have always been defeated. This is to be regretted, for
                    the limit is of doubtful utility, now that the rate of interest has been so
                    reduced as to prevent loss to the state. It is within the common experience of
                    savings banks managers that persons come to deposit an amount exceeding £30 and
                    are disappointed when they find they cannot do so. The Act of 1882, permitting
                    investment in Government stock, may diminish the mischief.</p>
                <p>With the view of showing to what extent savings banks are used by the classes for
                    which they were intended, a return was published for the year 1852, showing (as
                    nearly as could be ascertained) the number of depositors belonging to various
                    occupations, and the amount of their deposits, as follows :—</p>

                <p>Not two per cent. of the deposits, therefore, either in number or amount, are
                    made by classes whom it may be supposed it was the intention of the legislature
                    to exclude.</p>
                <p>When a person comes with his first deposit to a savings bank he is required to
                    sign a declaration, setting forth his name, address, and occupation, that he
                    desires to become a depositor on his own account, and that he has no money in
                    any other savings bank. If this declaration be not true, the deposits are liable
                    to be forfeited; but it is to be feared that few depositors take the trouble to
                    read what they are signing, or think much about the meaning of it. If the
                    depositor cannot write, the actuary of the savings bank will usually ask him a
                    few questions, such as his age, mother’s maiden name, &amp;c., which may tend to
                    identify him, or defeat any attempt to personate him for the purpose of
                    withdrawal. The enactment that deposits are to be forfeited if the declaration
                    be false was qualified in 1863 by a provision that the forfeiture should not be
                    enforced unless in the opinion of the appointed barrister (now the solicitor to
                    the treasury) the deposits had been made with a fraudulent intention.</p>
                <p>The consequence of the determination by the solicitor to the treasury that the
                    deposits have been made with the “fraudulent” intention which the Act
                    contemplates is out of all proportion to the nature of the offence committed,
                    being in fact the forfeiture of all the deposits. The prohibition of double
                    deposits arose when the state was granting a rate of interest greater than that
                    which it earned upon the investment of the money, and it has now ceased to have
                    any real reason whatever, the rate of interest being less than earned. The
                    intention to “defraud” now means merely the intention to evade a restriction
                    that has ceased to be necessary, not an intention to deprive anybody of anything
                    that belongs to him. If it be thought desirable to sanction by the infliction of
                    a penalty the law that these institutions should be used only for the savings of
                    the poorer classes, the loss of interest would be a sufficient if not an
                    extravagant penalty, without forfeiture of the principal. Indeed, the present
                    excessive penalty has, in one remarkable case, defeated itself. This was the
                    case of a depositor in an Irish savings bank, who invested in fictitious names
                    the sum of £2000. The solicitor to the treasury felt compelled to declare that
                    these deposits were made with a fraudulent intention. The registrar in Ireland
                    felt bound to act on this determination, and refused to award payment of the
                    deposits. The High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal refused to grant a
                    mandamus, for the law would not assist a wrongdoer. But parliament itself voted
                    £1000, or half the amount of the forfeiture, the legislature thus providing a
                    remedy for an injustice it had itself committed. Another curious case was that
                    of a young woman, the daughter of a postmaster, who in order that her father
                    might be provided with funds to meet business claims as they became due,
                    purloined money from him and invested it in false names in the post office
                    savings bank kept at his house. In this case, the postmaster himself not being
                    the guilty party, no forfeiture took place.</p>
                <p>Among the benefits conferred by the legislature upon depositors in savings banks
                    has been that of exemption from the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of law
                    in cases of dispute with the trustees. By the Acts of 1817 disputes were to be
                    settled by arbitration. By that of 1828 the barrister appointed to certify the
                    rules of the savings banks (then and until his death in 1870 Mr John Tidd Pratt)
                    was made umpire in case of difference of opinion between the arbitrators. By
                    that of 1844 the arbitrators were abolished, and an original and final
                    jurisdiction was conferred upon the barrister. By an Act of 1876 the functions
                    of the barrister in this respect were conferred upon the registrar of friendly
                    societies. This in effect makes no change in the law, for the offices of
                    barrister and registrar have been always held by the same persons. As early as
                    1832 it was determined in the case of Crisp <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Sir Henry
                    Bunbury that the effect of these enactments is to oust the jurisdiction of all
                    the superior courts of law and equity, and the authority of that decision has
                    never been shaken or even doubted.</p>
                <p>Since 1876 the registrar of friendly societies has made 147 awards in cases of
                    disputes with savings banks, in addition to 169 on disputes with the post office
                    savings bank. As the writer of the present article is one of the two persons in
                    whom this jurisdiction is vested for England, he hopes he may be excused for
                    expressing the opinion that its exercise has been highly beneficial to
                    depositors in savings banks. The costs of the award are limited by treasury
                    warrant to a few shillings, never exceeding £1. The procedure is simple and
                    elastic, and the results are believed to be satisfactory. The central office,
                    acting as registrar, determines law and fact, and adjusts all the equities of
                    each case. Reference to the index to the registrar’s decisions appended to the
                    chief registrar’s report for 1883, or to Mr Forbes’s useful work, will show that
                    many interesting questions of law have had to be determined with regard to so
                    small a matter as the ownership of a savings bank deposit.</p>
                <p>Questions between husband and wife as to property including deposits in savings
                    banks are now, under the Married Women’s Property Act, settled by the judges of
                    county courts. Where a depositor, as often happens, is of illegitimate birth, a
                    special provision is made by the Savings Bank Act in favour of his relatives, to
                    whom the solicitor to the treasury may award his deposits. It is open to any
                    depositor to nominate a person to whom the amount due to him at his death shall
                    be payable, provided it does not exceed £100 and the nominee is not an officer
                    or servant of the bank, unless indeed such officer or servant is related to the
                    depositor. This privilege, derived from the Provident Nominations and Small
                    Intestacies Act passed in 1883, is not yet sufficiently known to the bulk of
                    depositors, and has not been used to any large extent, but may be expected in
                    time to become very valuable. It is an extension of a privilege enjoyed by
                    members of friendly societies since 1855, and also by industrial and provident
                    societies and trade unions.</p>
                <p>A painful chapter in the history of savings banks is that occupied by the frauds
                    of actuaries, which have caused losses to depositors of not less than £150,000.
                    It too often happens that, where the only supervision is that of honorary
                    officers, a paid servant may commit frauds unchecked over a long period of time.
                    In the case of a savings bank at Rochdale, £71,715 was stolen by the actuary,
                    and £37,433 of this loss had to be borne by the depositors. In one at Dublin the
                    loss was £56,000, and in one at Tralee £36,000. These unhappy events must have
                    greatly discouraged the poor, and checked the progress of savings banks. There
                    is, however, the compensating fact that the savings made by the people of
                    Rochdale since 1849, when the savings bank there was closed, have taken the more
                    favourable direction of promoting the great co-operative enterprises of that
                    town. Savings banks, valuable and important as their benefits are, are still
                    only elementary teachers of providence, and it is well for the workman to learn
                    not merely to save money but to employ his savings to advantage. The stringent
                    legislation as to audit of 1863 has diminished frauds on savings banks, and they
                    are now rarely heard of.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In connexion with savings banks, and as auxiliaries to them, are penny banks. An

                    account of the expense of management. It seems to have occurred to Dr Chalmers
                    to supplement the work of the Edinburgh Old Savings Bank by establishing in a
                    Free Church congregation in Edinburgh a bank, managed entirely by voluntary
                    agency, in which a deposit of 1d. or 6d., or any sum not exceeding 10s., would
                    be received. When the deposit amounted to £1, the owner was requested to
                    transfer it to the savings bank, and the funds were invested with the savings
                    bank to the extent of £100 a year or £300 in the whole. Similar banks, called
                    “territorial savings banks,” were established in other congregations. An
                    organization of penny banks has existed in Glasgow for thirty years, and another
                    has been set on foot in Liverpool by the exertions of Mr T. Banner Newton, the
                    able actuary of the savings bank there. On 20th November 1885 there were 173
                    such banks open in Liverpool, with 17,492 depositors. When a deposit reaches £1
                    it is transferred to the depositor’s credit in the Liverpool Savings Bank. The
                    amounts thus transferred were £56,122, and £8432 remained to the credit of
                    depositors in the penny banks. The transactions of the year numbered 677,686 and
                    amounted to £42,194. Penny banks require no certificate from the registrar or
                    other legal organization, but if they desire to deposit more than the limit
                    above mentioned the permission of the National Debt Commissioners must first be
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>Savings banks for the army were established in 1842, and are now regulated by
                    Acts of Parliament—22 and 23 Vict. c. 20 (1859), 26 and 27 Vict. c. 12 (1863),
                    for the Royal Navy and Marines by 29 and 30 Vict. c. 43 (1866), and for seamen
                    generally by 17 and 18 Vict c. 104, § 180 (1854), 18 and 19 Vict. c. 91, § 817
                    (1855), and 19 and 20 Vict. c. 41 (1856). Into these, or indeed into any trustee
                    or post office savings bank, seamen’s wages may be paid under allotment notes by
                    43 and 44 Vict. c. 16, § 3 and sch. 1 (1880). The amounts in the hands of the
                    National Debt Commissioners belonging to depositors in savings banks of these

                <p>Voluntary savings banks, unconnected with the Government, have also been
                    established, the most important of which are the Yorkshire Penny Bank and the
                    National Penny Bank. The depositors in these rely solely on the character of the
                    persons by whom they are managed, and in some institutions of the kind have met
                    with severe disappointment in consequence. As they are under no responsibility
                    to the state, these institutions make no returns to parliament, and no
                    trustworthy information as to the extent of their operations can be given.</p>
                <p>The railway companies, which are private corporations empowered by special Acts
                    of Parliament, have in several cases availed themselves of these Acts to take
                    power for establishing savings banks for the benefit of their servants. The
                    Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Savings Bank has been
                    established 25 years, and has 2443 depositors, whose accounts amounted on 31st
                    March 1885 to £249,282; its transactions for the year were —£66,702 deposits,
                    £33,756 withdrawals, in number 26,596. Six other railway companies have
                    submitted the rules of their savings banks to the registrar of friendly
                    societies in pursuance of their private Acts, and the aggregate of their annual
                    returns for the year 1884-5 is as follows :—</p>
                <p>Deposits during the year £171,246</p>
                <p>Balance due to depositors £661,177</p>
                <p>Number of depositors 8,729</p>
                <p>Increase during the year 749</p>
                <p>Number of transactions (estimated) 61,621</p>
                <p>Interest credited £24,033</p>
                <p>In addition, five other banks had been established by railway companies without
                    reference to the registrar, and these in 1876 received £72,505 deposits and had
                    4120 depositors. The total deposits in railway savings banks may therefore be
                    estimated at a million sterling.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">British Colonies.—</hi> The thirteen savings banks in the
                    colony of Victoria had on the 3d December 1882 a capital of £1,970,855. In the
                    following year, however, the withdrawals exceeded the deposits, reducing the
                    deposits to £1,785,990. The number of depositors, however, has steadily
                    increased from 24,187 in 1873 to 70,354 in 1883. Of these 39,404 were males and
                    30,950 females; 1618 depositors had balances over £200, amounting to £407,932.
                    The transactions of the year 1883 were—deposits, £1,357,678; withdrawals,
                    £1,610,576. The deposits in the post office savings banks of Victoria also
                    reached their highest amount in 1882, when they were £1,150,391, falling in 1883
                    to £1,032,132. In them also the number of depositors has steadily increased from
                    34,360</p>
                <p>in 1873 to 65,735 in 1883. Their transactions for the year 1883 were—deposits,
                    £724,028; withdrawals, £842,288. Taking the two classes of savings banks
                    together, the number of depositors on 31st December 1883 was 136,089, the amount
                    of capital £2,818,122, and the average for each depositor £20, 14s. The number
                    of depositors per cent. of the population was 15. The rate of interest given to
                    depositors is 4 per cent. The savings bank of Melbourne alone had, on the 30th
                    June 1885, deposits amounting to £1,225,753, belonging to 58,129 depositors. The
                    transactions averaged 1073 per diem.</p>

                    interest being 4 per cent. in the post office savings bank and 5 and 6 per cent.
                    in other banks.</p>
                <p>ln Queensland the depositors were 26,642 or 10 per cent. of the population, and
                    the deposits £1,086,685 or £41 per depositor, the rates of interest being 4 and

                <p>In South Australia the depositors were 46,388 or nearly 16 per cent. of the
                    population, and the deposits £1,500,-249 or £32 per depositor, the rate of

                <p>In Tasmania the depositors in June 1883 were 17,231 or 14 per cent. of the

                <p>In the Dominion of Canada, according to a paper read at the Montreal meeting of
                    the British Association by Mr J. C. Stewart, the old established savings banks
                    in the cities of Montreal and Quebec have £2,000,000 sterling, belonging to
                    42,297 depositors; the post office savings banks established in 1868 have
                    £2,650,000, belonging to 66,682 depositors; and the chartered banks also receive
                    deposits on the savings bank system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> According to the report for 1884 of Mr
                    Henry W. Cannon, comptroller of the currency, there were on the 30th November
                    1882 in the United States of America forty-two savings banks, with capital
                    amounting to £800,000 ($5 = £1) and having £8,700,000 deposits, and 625 savings
                    banks without capital having £192,000,000 deposits. In the six years 1876-82 the
                    number of savings banks with capital had increased from twenty-six to forty-two,
                    but their capital had diminished 20 per cent., while their deposits had
                    increased 16 per cent. On the other hand, the number of savings banks without
                    capital had diminished from 691 to 625, but their deposits had increased 14 per
                    cent. Of the aggregate deposits, the 422 savings banks in the New England States
                    held £87,500,000, the 179 in the Middle States £98,500,000, the 9 in the
                    Southern States £660,000, and the 57 in the Western States and Territories
                    £14,000,000. In the latter two groups the banks with and without capital are
                    nearly equal in number and in the amount of deposits; in the former two groups
                    banks with capital are the exception, being only one in sixty of the whole.</p>
                <p>Savings banks in the United States differ from those in the United Kingdom in the
                    manner in which their funds are invested, not being limited to Government
                    securities. Thus, of the 200 millions sterling of deposits only 46 millions was
                    invested in United States bonds, viz., New England, £6,900,000; Middle States,
                    £35,800,000; Western States, £400,000; Pacific States and Territories,
                    £2,900,000.</p>
                <p>A statement of the aggregate resources and liabilities of 636 savings banks in
                    1884 (£236,000,000) is furnished, showing :—</p>

                <p>According to the report of the comptroller for 1885 (which has reached us since
                    the above was written) the deposits have in creased during the year to

                <p>In New England the depositors number 36 in every 100 of the population, and the
                    average amount of each account is £66, or £24 for each individual if distributed
                    over the entire population. In New York State the deposits would give £17 per

                <p><hi rend="italic">Brazil.—</hi> The savings banks of the empire of Brazil have
                    been made instruments in the gradual extinction of slavery in that country.
                    Since 1871 each slave is allowed certain hours a week to labour for his own
                    benefit, and when his earnings deposited in the savings bank amount to a given
                    sum the remainder of the price of his emancipation is provided by the state out
                    of public funds. The children of slave mothers, who since 1871 have been born
                    free, are also encouraged to place their earnings in school savings banks. By a
                    law passed on the 14th August 1885, immediate enfranchisement at the cost of the
                    state is conferred upon slaves employed in agricultural establishments, upon
                    condition of their remaining with the master at fixed wages for five years and
                    paying half the wages into the savings bank towards repayment of the price paid
                    for their freedom.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Continent of Europe.—</hi> In several of the countries of
                    Europe savings banks have been established and are flourishing. In Prussia the
                    first savings bank was founded by the municipality of Berlin in 1828. In 1838
                    they were taken under the supervision of the Government. Their formation has
                    been much aided by an association called the “Central Union” for the good of the
                    industrious classes. A great variety of investments is permitted. In 1874 there
                    were 979 banks, having 2,059,000 depositors and £49,315,000 of deposits, being a
                    little over <hi rend="italic">£2</hi> per head of the population. Besides
                    savings banks, there are the credit banks established by the late Herr
                    Schultz-Delitzsch, which perform a similar function.</p>
                <p>In France 79 per cent. of the deposits are invested in the public debt, on which
                    interest at the rate of 4 per cent. is guaranteed, but the savings banks are
                    private institutions; 19 per cent. are invested in mortgages and 2 per cent. on
                    municipal securities. Post office savings banks also exist. The average amount
                    of each deposit account is smaller than in England, 79 per cent. of the deposits
                    being under £20 as against 63 per cent. The following statement shows the
                    progress of savings banks in France since their first regulation by law in 1835

                <p>The depositors now number nearly five millions. Savings banks were greatly
                    affected by the Revolution of 1848 and by the Franco-German War. Previous to the
                    former event, the deposits had risen on 31st December 1845 to £15,822,164,
                    falling on 31st December 1849 as low as £2,965,802. In the early part of 1870
                    they had risen to £28,800,000 or 15s. for every individual of the population.
                    The separation of Alsace and Lorraine reduced the deposits. Postal savings banks
                    were established in 1875, but only as auxiliaries of the ordinary savings banks;
                    school savings banks, mainly through the enlightened exertions of M. de Malarce,
                    were commenced in 1874. These are now established in 23,222 schools, have
                    488,674 depositors and £451,402 deposits. - A national postal savings bank was
                    instituted on 9th April 1881, and was extended to Corsica on 1st March 1882 and
                    to Algeria and Tunis from 1st April 1884. On 31st December 1883 it had already
                    374,970 depositors and £3,097,200 deposits. The Paris savings bank had on 31st
                    December 1882 440,728 depositors and £3,513,433 deposits.</p>
                <p>In Italy, at the end of 1872, 282 savings banks were in existence, of which 142
                    were principal banks and the rest branches. With two exceptions, all are managed
                    without profit to the promoters or guarantors. In 1825 there were 11 savings
                    banks in which £108,000 had been deposited; in 1850 the deposits amounted to
                    £1,600,000, and in 1872 to £17,860,000, belonging to 676,327 depositors. Of
                    these funds, 21 per cent. was invested on mortgage, 10 per cent. only in the
                    public debt, 11 per cent. in obligations of local authorities, 12 per cent. in
                    shares and bonds of companies, 16 per cent. in bills of exchange, 15 per cent.
                    in loans on public funds and commercial securities, 11 per cent. in current
                    accounts, and 4 per cent. otherwise. The average rate of interest allowed to
                    depositors is 4½ per cent. The transactions of the year were—deposits
                    £7,911,000, withdrawals £6,514,000. The system of school savings banks has been
                    adopted in many communes. In addition, deposits are made in popular banks and
                    other establishments of credit, and post office savings banks have also been
                    established.</p>
                <p>In Denmark savings banks are private institutions, but must not be managed for
                    profit, nor invest in foreign securities; and they are required to make annual
                    returns to Government. In 1860 the amount of deposits was £3,221,000; by 1871 it
                    had increased to £6,651,031, and by 31st March 1881 to £12,707,521. The savings
                    banks have increased in number during the ten years from 188 to 446, and the
                    depositors from 285,991 to 492,296. Twenty-six banks have more than £100,000
                    deposits. The oldest and largest is that of Copenhagen, established 1st May
                    1820, having £2,320,892 deposited, which has increased from £832,874 in the ten
                    years. The number of depositors has increased from one in six to one in four of
                    the population, and the deposits from £3, 14s. 8d. to £6, 9s. per head of the
                    population. The transactions of the year ending 31st March 1881 were—deposits
                    £8,141,627; withdrawals £6,702,470. Of the deposit accounts, 74 per cent. are
                    under £23 and 15 per cent. above £23 and under £43. One half of the funds are
                    invested on mortgage. The reserve funds of the banks had increased in ten years
                    from £226,329 to £665,597.</p>

                <p>M. de Malarce has obtained for the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire des
                    Finances</hi> some more recent statistics, the details of which have not yet
                    reached us, but from information he has been so good as to communicate we infer
                    an increase in deposits during the last 10 years in twelve European states of
                    £123,000,000,—making the aggregate of savings bank deposits for all countries,
                    as far as ascertained, £725,000,000. (E. W. B.)</p>
