                    (1810-1856), musical critic and composer, was born at Zwickau, Saxony, on 8th
                    June 1810. In deference to his mother’s wish, he made a pretence of studying for
                    the law, until he had completed his twentieth year; but in reality he took so
                    little pains to acquaint himself with the mysteries of jurisprudence and so much
                    to master the technical difficulties of the pianoforte that when the day of
                    examination drew near it was evident that he could not hope to pass with credit.
                    His mother therefore wisely gave up her cherished project, and in the summer of
                    1830 permitted him to settle for a time in Leipsic that he might receive regular
                    instruction from Friedrich Wieck, the most accomplished and successful teacher
                    of the pianoforte then living in North Germany. Under Wieck’s superintendence
                    Schumann would doubtlessly have become a pianist of the highest order had he not
                    endeavoured to strengthen the third finger of his right hand by some mechanical
                    contrivance the secret of which he never clearly explained. But the process
                    failed most signally, and the hand became so hopelessly crippled that the young
                    artist was compelled to give up all thought of success as a performer and to
                    devote himself thenceforward to the study of composition, which he cultivated
                    diligently under the guidance of Heinrich Dorn.</p>
                <p>This change of purpose led him to direct his attention to subjects connected with
                    the higher branches of art which he had previously very much neglected.
                    Moreover, it gave him time and opportunity for the development of a peculiar
                    talent which he soon succeeded in turning to excellent account,—the talent for
                    musical criticism. His first essays in this direction appeared in the form of
                    contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung</hi>; but
                    in 1834 he started a journal of his own, entitled <hi rend="italic">Die Neue
                    Zeitschrift für Musik,</hi> and to this from time to time he contributed
                    critiques of the most profound character, sometimes openly written under his own
                    name, sometimes ostensibly emanating from an imaginary brotherhood called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Davidsbund,</hi> the members of which were living men and
                    women, Schumann’s most intimate friends, though the society itself existed only
                    in his own fertile imagination. His time was now fully occupied. He composed
                    with inexhaustible ardour, and by the exercise of his extraordinary critical
                    faculty struck out for himself new paths, which he fearlessly trod without a
                    thought of the reception his works were likely to meet with from the public. The
                    habit of passing a just judgment upon the works of others led him to judge his
                    own productions with relentless severity; and it may be safely said that he was
                    harder upon himself than upon any candidate for public favour whose attempts he
                    was called upon to criticize.</p>
                <p>Schumann’s first great orchestral work was his <hi rend="italic">Symphony in
                    Bb,</hi> produced in 1841,—the year after his marriage with Clara Wieck, now so
                    well known to the world as Madame Clara Schumann, the accomplished pianiste, to
                    whose faultless interpretation of her husband’s works we are indebted for our
                    fullest appreciation of their inherent beauty. Another symphony, in D minor, and
                    an orchestral overture, scherzo, and finale, appeared in the same year; and from
                    this time forward works on an equally grand scale appeared in rapid succession,
                    culminating with his first and only opera, <hi rend="italic">Genoveva,</hi>
                    which, though completed in 1848, was not produced until 1850. In 1843 Schumann
                    was appointed professor of composition in Mendelssohn’s newly founded
                    conservatory of music at Leipsic. Two years after Mendelssohn’s death he
                    endeavoured to obtain the appoint-<pb break="no"

                    was rejected in favour of J. Rietz. In 1850 he was invited to Düsseldorf as
                    musical director—a post in which Mendelssohn had greatly distinguished himself
                    many years previously. Schumann retained this until 1853, when his mental powers
                    began to decline rapidly through a disease of the brain from which he had long
                    suffered, and of which he died at Endenich, near Bonn, 29th July 1856.</p>
                <p>Schumann’s position in the history of German music is very important and marks
                    the last stage hut one of its progress towards its present condition. His style
                    was very advanced and strikingly original. His published works include one
                    opera, four symphonies, five overtures, a series of scenes from <hi
                    rend="italic">Faust,</hi> and other choral and orchestral works written on a
                    very extensive scale, and a large quantity of songs, pianoforte pieces, and
                    other smaller works of the highest excellence and beauty.</p>
