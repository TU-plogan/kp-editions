                <p>The colony is ruled by a governor, sends a deputy to the French legislature, and
                    elects a general council of sixteen members, ten for the electoral district of
                    St Louis, four for that of Gorée-Dakar, and two for that of Rufisque. The three
                    communes just named have each its municipal council. The population of those
                    French possessions was in 1884 197,644,—46,364 urban, 143,200 rural, 8080
                    “floating.” In the whole number there were only 1474 Europeans, of whom 1461
                    were French. The population of the protected countries cannot be ascertained.
                    The most important places in the colony are St Louis (18,924 inhabitants in
                    1883), Dagana (5375), Rufisque (4244), Médine (3000), Joal (2372), Corée and
                    Dakar (each 2000). The colony has only a single true port, that of Dakar to the
                    east of the peninsula of Cape Verd, since 1885 connected with St Louis by a
                    railroad, 163 miles long, and visited by Atlantic steamers on their way from
                    France to South America. Rufisque and Gorée have open roadsteads, where vessels
                    anchor at some distance from the shore. The port of St Louis in the Senegal is
                    difficult of access owing to the bar, but it is the only place where vessels can
                    repair serious damages. The principal commercial centres are St Louis (imports
                    and exports), Gorée (exports), and Rufisque (exports). The upper Senegal sends
                    ground-nuts (known as Galam nuts), gum, millet, leather, and receives in
                    exchange blue calico (guinée) from India, England, and Belgium, various other
                    cotton stuffs, cotton yarn, guns and ammunition, tobacco, crushed rice, sugar
                    (raw and refined), molasses, biscuits, tinsmiths’ wares, &amp;c. The colony also
                    imports Swedish iron, which is manufactured by the native blacksmiths into
                    agricultural implements, knives, daggers, and spearheads. Cayor sells its
                    ground-nuts for money. The rivers of the south district export ground-nuts, palm
                    kernels, india-rubber, leather, coffee, in return for English and Belgian blue
                    calico, Hamburg brandy, English gunpowder, English and Belgian guns, and
                    American tobacco. An English firm has twenty-three factories on the Rio Nunez,
                    and others on the Rio Pongo and the Mellacorée. The total value of the exports
                    and imports of the colony was £1,325,711 in 1879, £1,774,089 in 1880, and
                    £1,888,657 in 1883, the imports slightly preponderating over· the exports. The
                    value of the ground-nuts exported in 1883 was £700,000, that of the gums only
                    £120,000; and the ground-nut trade is still rapidly developing. The imports
                    comprise French<pb break="no"

                    £120,000 German, £80,000 American articles. In 1882 946 vessels entered and 960
                    cleared. The budget for the colony in 1884 was £100,320, for the communal
                    expenses £14,560, and for the expenses of the capital £250,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The navigators of Dieppe are said to have
                    discovered the Senegal about 1360. The Portuguese had some establishments on its
                    banks in the 15th century; and the first French settlements were probably formed
                    in the latter part of the 16th or beginning of the 17th century. Between 1664,
                    when these French settlements were assigned to Colbert’s West India Company, and
                    1758, when the colony was seized by the English, Senegal had passed under the
                    administration of no fewer than seven different companies, none of which
                    attained any great success, though from 1694 to 1724 affairs were conducted by a
                    really able governor, André Brue. In 1677 the French captured from the Dutch
                    Rufisque, Portudal, Joal, and Corée, and they were confirmed in possession of
                    these places by the treaty of Nimeguen (1678). In 1717 they acquired Portendic
                    and in 1724 Arguin on the coast of the Sahara, which still belong to the colony.
                    Gorée and the district of Cape Verd were surrendered by the English to the
                    French in 1763, and by the treaty of peace in 1783 the whole of the Senegal was
                    also restored; but the English again captured the colony in the wars of the
                    first empire (Gorée 1800, St Louis 1809), and, though the treaty of Paris
                    authorized a complete restitution, the French authorities did not enter into
                    possession till 1817. Between that date and 1854 little was effected by the
                    thirty-seven governors who succeeded each other at St Louis; but in this year
                    the appointment of General Faidherbe proved the turning-point in the history of
                    Senegal. He at once set about subduing the Moorish (Berber) tribes of the
                    Trarzas, Braknas, and Duaish, whose “kings,” especially the king of the Trarzas,
                    had subjected the French settlers and traders to the most grievous and arbitrary
                    exactions; and he bound them by treaty to confine their authority to the north
                    bank of the Senegal. In 1855 he annexed the country of Walo and erected the fort
                    of Médine in the country of Khasso. This last was a bold stroke for the purpose
                    of stemming the advancing tide of Moslem invasion, which under Omar al-Hadji
                    (Alegui) threatened the safety of the colony. In 1857 Médine was brilliantly
                    defended by the mulatto Paul Holle against Omar, who with his army of 20,000 men
                    had to retire before the advance of General Faidherbe and turn his attention to
                    the conquest of the native states of the Sudan. By treaty of 1860 Omar
                    recognized the French claim to half of Bambuk, half of Khasso, Bondu, Kamera,
                    Guoy, Guidimakha, Damga, Futa-Toro, Dimar, &amp;c. Since then annexations and
                    protectorates have followed in rapid succession under the governorships of
                    Jauréguiberry, Faidherbe, and Brière de l'Isle. It is sufficient to mention the
                    treaties of 1881 and 1885 by which the confederation of Futa-Jallon and Buré
                    respectively recognized a French protectorate.</p>
