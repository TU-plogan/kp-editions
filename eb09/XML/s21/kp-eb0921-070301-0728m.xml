                    all languages, was born at Paris on February 6, 1626, and died at the chateau of
                    Grignan (Drôme), on April 18, 1696. The family of Rabutin (if not so illustrious
                    as Bussy, Madame de Sévigné’s notorious cousin, affected to consider it) was one
                    of great age and distinction in Burgundy. It was traceable in documents to the
                    12th century, and the castle which gave it name still existed, though in ruins,
                    in Madame de Sévigné’s time. The family had been “gens d’épée” for the most
                    part, though François de Rabutin, the author of valuable memoirs on the sixth
                    decade of the 16th century, undoubtedly belonged to it. It is said that Bussy’s
                    silly vanity led him to exclude this Francois from the genealogy of his house
                    because he had not occupied any high position. Marie’s father, Celse Bénigne de
                    Rabutin, Baron de Chantal, was the son of the celebrated “Sainte” Chantal,
                    friend and disciple of St Francis of Sales; her mother was Marie de Coulanges.
                    Celse de Rabutin shared to the full the mania for duelling which was the curse
                    of the gentlemen of France during the first half of the 17th century, and was
                    frequently in danger both directly from his adversaries and indirectly from the
                    law. He died, however, in a more legitimate manner, being killed during the
                    English descent on the Isle of Rhé in July 1627. His wife did not survive him
                    many years, and Marie was left an orphan at the age of seven years and a few
                    months. She then passed into the care of her grandparents on the mother’s side;
                    but they were both aged, and the survivor of them, Philippe de Coulanges, died
                    in 1636, Marie being then ten years old. According to French custom a family
                    council was held to select a guardian of the young heiress, for such she was to
                    some extent. Her uncle Christophe de Coulanges, Abbé de Livry, was chosen. He
                    was somewhat young for the guardianship of a girl, being only twenty-nine, but
                    readers of his niece’s letters know how well “Le Bien Bon ”—for such is his name
                    in Madame de Sévigné’s little language—acquitted himself of the trust. He lived
                    till within ten years of his ward’s death, and long after his nominal functions
                    were ended he was in all matters of business the good angel of the family, while
                    for half a century his abbacy of Livry was the favourite residence, both of his
                    niece and her daughter. Coulanges was much more of a man of business than of a
                    man of letters, but either choice or the fashion of the time induced him to make
                    of his niece a learned lady. Chapelain and Ménage are specially mentioned as her
                    tutors, and Ménage at least fell in love with her, in which point he resembled
                    the rest of the world, and was constant to his own habits in regard to his
                    pupils. Tallemant des Réaux gives more than one instance of the cool and
                    good-humoured raillery with which she received his passion, and the earliest
                    letters of hers that we possess are addressed to Ménage. Another literary friend
                    of her youth was the poet Saint-Pavin. Among her own sex she was intimate with
                    all the coterie of the Hôtel Rambouillet, and her special ally was Mademoiselle
                    de la Vergne, afterwards Madame de la Fayette. In person she was extremely
                    attractive, though the minute critics of the time (which was the palmy day of
                    portraits in words) objected to her divers deviations from strictly regular
                    beauty, such as eyes of different colours and sizes, a “square-ended” nose, and
                    a somewhat heavy jaw. Her beautiful hair and complexion, however, were admitted
                    even by these censors, as well as the extraordinary spirit and liveliness of her
                    expression. Her long minority, under so careful a guardian as Coulanges, had
                    also raised her fortune to the amount of 100,000 crowns—a large sum for the
                    time, and one which with her birth and beauty might have allowed her to expect a
                    very brilliant marriage. That which she finally made was certainly one of
                    affection on her side rather than of interest. There had been some talk of her
                    cousin Bussy, but very fortunately for her this came to nothing. She actually
                    married Henri, Marquis de Sévigné, a Breton gentleman of a good family, and
                    allied to the oldest houses of that province, but of no great estate. The
                    marriage took place on August 4, 1644, and the pair went almost immediately to
                    Sévigné’s manor-house of Les Rochers, near Vitré, a place which Madame de
                    Sévigné was in future years to immortalize. It was an unfortified chateau of no
                    very great size, but picturesque enough, with the peaked turrets common in
                    French architecture, and surrounded by a park and grounds of no large extent,
                    but thickly wooded and communicating with other woods. The abundance of trees
                    gave it the repute of being damp and somewhat gloomy. Fond, however, as Madame
                    de Sévigné was of society, it may be suspected that the happiest days of her
                    brief married life were spent there. For there at any rate her husband had less
                    opportunity than in Paris of neglecting her, and of wasting her money and his
                    own. Very little good is said of Henri de Sévigné by any of his contemporaries.
                    He was one of the innumerable lovers of Ninon de l'Enclos, and made himself even
                    more conspicuous with a certain Madame de Gondran, known in the nickname slang
                    of the time as “La Belle Lolo.” He was wildly extravagant. That his wife loved
                    him and that he did not love her was generally admitted, and the frank if
                    somewhat coxcomb-like accounts which Bussy Rabutin gives of his own attempt and
                    failure to persuade her to retaliate on her husband are decisive as to her
                    virtue. At last Sévigné’s pleasant vices came home to him. He quarrelled with
                    the Chevalier d’Albret about Madame de Gondran, fought with him and was mortally
                    wounded on the 4th of February 1651; he died two days afterwards. There is no
                    reasonable doubt that his wife regretted him a great deal more than he deserved.
                    On two different occasions she is said to have fainted in public at the sight
                    once of his adversary and once of his second in the fatal duel; and whatever
                    Madame de Sévigné was (and she had several faults) she was certainly not a
                    hypocrite. Her husband had when living accused her of coldness,—the common
                    excuse of libertine husbands, —but even he seems to have found fault only with
                    her temperament, not with her heart. To close this part of the subject it may be
                    said that though only six and twenty, and more beautiful than ever, she never
                    married again despite frequent offers, and that no aspersion was<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0729-0704"/> ever thrown save in one instance on her fame. For
                    the rest of her life, which was long, she gave herself up to her children. These
                    were two in number, and they divided their mother’s affections by no means
                    equally. The eldest was a daughter, Françoise Marguerite de Sévigné, who was
                    born on October 10, 1646, whether at Les Rochers or in Paris is not absolutely
                    certain. The second, a son, Charles de Sévigné, was born at Les Rochers in the
                    spring of 1648. To him Madame de Sévigné was an indulgent, a generous (though
                    not altogether just), and in a way an affectionate mother. Her daughter, the
                    future Madame de Grignan, she worshipped with an almost insane affection, which
                    only its charming literary results and the delightful qualities which
                    accompanied it in the worshipper, though not in the worshipped, save from being
                    ludicrous if not revolting. As it is, not one in a hundred of Madame de
                    Sévigné’s readers can find in his heart to be angry with her for her devotion to
                    a very undivine divinity.</p>
                <p>After her husband’s death Madame de Sévigné passed the greater part of the year
                    1651 in retirement at Les Rochers. She had, however, no intention of renouncing
                    the world, and she returned to Paris in November of that year, her affairs
                    having been put in such order as Sévigné’s extravagance permitted by the
                    faithful Coulanges. For nearly ten years little of importance occurred in her
                    life, which was passed at Paris in a house she occupied in the Place Royale (not
                    as yet in the famous Hôtel Carnavalet), at Les Rochers, at Livry, or at her own
                    estate of Bourbilly in the Mâconnais. She had, however, in 1658 a quarrel with
                    her cousin Bussy, which had not unimportant results, and at the end of the time
                    mentioned above she narrowly escaped being compromised in reputation, though not
                    politically, at Fouquet’s downfall. Notwithstanding Bussy’s unamiable character
                    and the early affair of the proposed marriage, and notwithstanding also his
                    libertine conduct towards her, the cousins had always been friends; and the most
                    amusing and characteristic part of Madame de Sévigné’s correspondence, before
                    the date of her daughter’s marriage, is addressed to him. She had a very strong
                    belief in family ties; she recognized in Bussy a kindred spirit, and she excused
                    his faults as <hi rend="italic">Rabutinades</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rabutinages—</hi> the terms she uses in alluding to the rather excitable and
                    humorist temper of the house. But in 1658 a misunderstanding about money brought
                    about a quarrel, which in its turn had a long sequel, and results not
                    unimportant in literature. Bussy and his cousin had jointly come in for a
                    considerable legacy, and he asked her for a loan. If this was not positively
                    refused, there was a difficulty made about it, and Bussy was deeply offended. A
                    year later, at the escapade of Roissy (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rabutin),</hi>
                    according to his own account, he improvised (according to probability he had
                    long before written it) the famous portrait of Madame de Sévigné which appears
                    in his notorious <hi rend="italic">Histoire Amoureuse,</hi> and which is a
                    triumph of malice. Circulated at first in manuscript and afterwards in print,
                    this caused Madame de Sévigné the deepest pain and indignation, and the quarrel
                    between the cousins was not fully made up for years, if indeed it was ever fully
                    made up. This portrait, however, was more wounding to self-love than in any way
                    really dangerous, for, read between the lines, it is in effect a testimonial of
                    character. The Fouquet matter was more serious. The superintendent was a famous
                    lady-killer, but Madame de Sévigné, though he was her friend, and though she had
                    been ardently courted by him as by others (one quarrel in her presence between
                    the Duke de Rohan and the Marquis de Tonquedec had become notorious), had
                    hitherto escaped scandal. At Fouquet’s downfall in 1651 it was announced on
                    indubitable authority that communications from her had been found in the coffer
                    where Fouquet kept his love letters. She protested that the notes in question
                    were of friendship merely, and Bussy (one of the not very numerous good actions
                    of his life) obtained from Le Tellier, who as minister had examined the letters,
                    a corroboration of the protest. But the letters were never published, and there
                    have always been those who held that Madame de Sévigné regarded Fouquet with at
                    least a very warm kind of friendship. It is certain that her letters to Pomponne
                    describing his trial are among her masterpieces of unaffected, vivid, and
                    sympathetic narration.</p>
                <p>During these earlier years, besides the circumstances already mentioned, Madame
                    de Sévigné conceived, like most of the better and more thoughtful among
                    Frenchmen and Frenchwomen, a great affection for the establishment of Port
                    Royal, which was not without its effect on her literary work. That work, however
                    (if writing than which certainly none was ever less carried out in a spirit of
                    mere workmanship can be so called), dates in its bulk and really important part
                    almost entirely from the last thirty years of her life. Her letters before the
                    marriage of her daughter, though by themselves they would suffice to give her a
                    very high rank among letter-writers, would not do more than fill one
                    moderate-sized volume. Those after that marriage fill nearly ten large volumes
                    in the latest and best edition. We do not hear very much of Mademoiselle de
                    Sévigné’s early youth. For a short time, at a rather uncertain date, she was
                    placed at school with the nuns of St Marie at Nantes. But for the most part her
                    mother brought her up herself, assisted by the Abbé de la Mousse, a faithful
                    friend, and for a time one of her most constant companions. La Mousse was a
                    great Cartesian, and he made Mademoiselle de Sévigné also a devotee of the bold
                    soldier of Touraine to a degree which even in that century of blue stockings
                    excited surprise and some ridicule. But Mademoiselle de Sévigné was bent on more
                    mundane triumphs than philosophy had to offer. Her beauty is all the more
                    incontestable that she was by no means generally liked. Bussy, a critical and
                    not too benevolent judge, called her “la plus jolie fille de France,’’ and it
                    seems to be agreed that she resembled her mother, with the advantage of more
                    regular features. She was introduced at court early, and as she danced well she
                    figured frequently in the ballets which were the chief amusement of the court of
                    Louis XIV. in its early days. If, however, she was more regularly beautiful than
                    her mother she had little or nothing of her attraction, and like many other
                    beauties who have entered society with similar expectations she did not
                    immediately find a husband. Various projected alliances fell through for one
                    reason or another, and it was not till the end of 1668 that her destiny was
                    settled. On January 29 in the next year she married François Adhémar, Comte de
                    Grignan, a Provençal, of one of the noblest families of France, and a man of
                    amiable and honourable character, but neither young nor handsome, nor in reality
                    rich. He had been twice married and his great estates were heavily encumbered.
                    Neither did the large dowry (300,000 livres) which Madame de Sévigné, somewhat
                    unfairly to her son, bestowed upon her daughter, suffice to clear encumbrances,
                    which were constantly increased in the sequel by the extravagance of Madame de
                    Grignan as well as of her husband.</p>
                <p>Charles de Sévigné was by this time twenty years old, but he had no doubt already
                    learnt that he was not the person of chief importance in the family. He never,
                    throughout his life, appears to have resented his mother’s preference of his
                    sister; but, though thoroughly amiable, he was not (at any rate in his youth) a
                    model character. Nothing is known of his education, but just before his sister’s
                    marriage he volunteered for a rather hairbrained<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0730-0705"/> expedition to Crete against the Turks, and served
                    with credit. Then his mother bought him the commission of <hi rend="italic"
                    >guidon</hi> (a kind of sub-cornet) in the Gendarmes Dauphin, in which regiment
                    he served for some years, and after long complaining of the slowness of
                    promotion rather rapidly rose to the rank of captain, when he sold out. But
                    though he always fought well he was not an enthusiastic soldier, and was
                    constantly and not often fortunately in love. He followed his father into the
                    nets of Ninon de l’Enclos, and was Racine’s rival with Mademoiselle Champmeslé.
                    The way in which his mother was made confidante of these discreditable and not
                    very successful loves is characteristic both of the time and of the country. In
                    1669 M. de Grignan, who had previously been lieutenant-governor of Languedoc,
                    was transferred to Provence. The governor-in-chief was the young duke of
                    Vendôme. But at this time he was a boy, and he never really took up the
                    government, so that Grignan for more than forty years was in effect viceroy of
                    this important province. His wife rejoiced greatly in the part of vice-queen;
                    but their peculiar situation threw on them the expenses without the emoluments
                    of the office, and those expenses were increased by the extravagance of both, so
                    that the Grignan money affairs hold a larger place in Madame de Sévigné’s
                    letters than might perhaps be wished.</p>
                <p>In 1671 Madame de Sévigné with her son paid a visit to Les Rochers, which is
                    memorable in her history and in literature. The states of Brittany were convoked
                    that year at Vitré. This town being in the immediate neighbourhood of Les
                    Rochers, Madame de Sévigné’s usually quiet life at her country house was
                    diversified by the necessity of entertaining the governor, the Duc de Chaulnes,
                    of appearing at his receptions, and so forth. All these matters are duly
                    consigned to record in her letters, together with much good-natured raillery (it
                    must be admitted that it is sometimes almost on the verge of being ill-natured,
                    though never quite over it) on the country ladies of the neighbourhood and their
                    ways. She remained at Les Rochers during the whole summer and autumn of 1671,
                    and did not return to Paris till late in November. The country news is then
                    succeeded by news of the court. At the end of the next year, 1672, one great
                    wish of her heart was gratified by paying a visit to her daughter in her
                    vice-royalty of Provence. Madame de Grignan does not seem to have been very
                    anxious for this visit,—perhaps because, as the letters show in many cases, the
                    exacting affection of her mother was somewhat too strong for her own colder
                    nature, perhaps because she feared such a witness of the ruinous extravagance
                    which characterized the Grignan household. But her mother remained with her for
                    nearly a year, and did not return to Paris till the end of 1673. During this
                    time we have (as is usually the case during these Provençal visits and the
                    visits of Madame de Grignan to Paris) some letters addressed to Madame de
                    Sévigné, but comparatively few from her. A visit of the second class was the
                    chief event of 1674, and the references to this, such as they are, is the chief
                    evidence that mother and daughter were on the whole better apart. 1675 brought
                    with it the death of Turenne (of which Madame de Sévigné has given a very
                    noteworthy account, characteristic of her more ambitious but not perhaps her
                    more successful manner), and also serious disturbances in Brittany.
                    Notwithstanding these it was necessary for Madame de Sévigné to make her
                    periodical visit to Les Rochers. She reached the house in safety, and the
                    friendship of Chaulnes protected her both from violence and from the exactions
                    which the miserable province underwent as a punishment for its resistance to
                    excessive and unconstitutional taxation. No small part of her letters is
                    occupied by these affairs.</p>
                <p>The year 1676 saw several things important in Madame de Sévigné’s life. For the
                    first time she was seriously ill, —it would appear with rheumatic fever,—and she
                    did not thoroughly recover till she had visited Vichy. Her letters from this
                    place are among her very best, and picture life at a 17th-century watering-place
                    with unsurpassed vividness. In this year, too, took place the trial and
                    execution of Madame de Brinvilliers. This event figures in the letters, and the
                    references to it are among those which have given occasion to unfavourable
                    comments on Madame de Sévigné’s character—comments which, with others of the
                    kind, will be more conveniently treated together. In the next year, 1677, she
                    moved into the Hôtel Carnavalet, a house which still remains and is inseparably
                    connected with her memory, and she had the pleasure of welcoming the whole
                    Grignan family to it. They remained there a long time; indeed nearly two years
                    seem to have been spent by Madame de Grignan partly in Paris and partly at
                    Livry. The return to Provence took place in October 1678, and next year Madame
                    de Sévigné had the grief of losing La Rochefoucauld, the most eminent and one of
                    the most intimate of her close personal friends and constant associates. In 1680
                    she again visited Brittany, but the close of that year saw her back in Paris to
                    receive another and even longer visit from her daughter, who remained in Paris
                    for four years. Before the end of the last year of this stay (in February 1684)
                    Charles de Sévigné, after all his wandering loves, and after more than one
                    talked-of alliance, was married to a young Breton lady, Jeanne Marguerite de
                    Mauron, who had a considerable fortune. In the arrangements for this marriage
                    Madame de Sévigné practically divided all her fortune between her children
                    (Madame de Grignan of course receiving an unduly large share), and reserved only
                    part of the life interest. The greed of Madame de Grignan nearly broke her
                    brother’s marriage, but it was finally concluded and proved a very happy one in
                    a somewhat singular fashion. Both Sévigné and his wife became deeply religious,
                    and at first Madame de Sévigné found their household (for she gave up Les
                    Rochers to them) not at all lively. But by degrees she grew fond of her
                    daughter-in-law. During this year she spent a considerable time in Brittany,
                    first on business, afterwards on a visit to her son, and partly it would appear
                    for motives of economy. But Madame de Grignan still continued with only short
                    absences to inhabit Paris, and the mother and daughter were practically in each
                    other’s company until 1688. The proportion of letters therefore that we have for
                    the decade 1677-1687 is much smaller than that which represents the decade
                    preceding it; indeed the earlier period contains the great bulk of the whole
                    correspondence. In 1687 the Abbé de Coulanges, Madame de Sévigné’s uncle and
                    good angel, died, and in the following year the whole family were greatly
                    excited by the first campaign of the young Marquis de Grignan, Madame de
                    Grignan’s only son, who was sent splendidly equipped to the siege of
                    Philippsbourg. In the same year Madame de Sévigné was present at the St Cyr
                    performance of <hi rend="italic">Esther,</hi> and some of her most amusing
                    descriptions of court ceremonies and experiences date from this time. 1689 and
                    1690 were almost entirely spent by her at Les Rochers with her son; and on
                    leaving him she went across France to Provence. There was some excitement during
                    her Breton stay, owing to the rumour of an English descent, on which occasion
                    the Breton militia was called out, and Charles de Sévigné appeared for the last
                    time as a soldier; but it came to nothing. 1691 was passed at Grignan and other
                    places in the south, but at the end of it Madame de Sévigné returned to Paris,
                    bringing the Grignans with her; and her daughter stayed with her till 1694.
                    The<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n731/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0731-0706"/> year 1693 saw the loss of two of her oldest
                    friends,—Bussy Rabutin, her faithless and troublesome but in his own way
                    affectionate cousin, and Madame de la Fayette, her lifelong companion, and on
                    the whole perhaps her best and wisest friend. Another friend almost as intimate,
                    Madame de Lavardin, followed in 1694. Madame de Sévigné spent but a few months
                    of this latter year alone, and followed her daughter to Provence. She never
                    revisited Brittany after 1691. Two important marriages with their preparations
                    occupied most of her thoughts during 1694-1695. The young Marquis de Grignan
                    married the daughter of Saint-Amant, an immensely rich financier; but his
                    mother’s pride, ill-nature, and bad taste (she is said to have remarked in full
                    court that it was necessary now and then to “manure the best lands,” referring
                    to Saint-Amant’s wealth, low birth, and the Grignan’s nobility) made the
                    marriage not a very happy one. His sister Pauline, who, in the impossibility of
                    dowering her richly, had a narrow escape of the cloister, made a marriage of
                    affection with M. de Simiane, and eventually became the sole representative and
                    continuator of the families of Grignan and Sévigné.</p>
                <p>Madame de Sévigné survived these alliances but a very short time. During an
                    illness of her daughter she herself was attacked by smallpox in April 1696, and
                    she died on the 17th of that month at Grignan, and was buried there. Her
                    idolized daughter was not present during any time of her illness; it has been
                    charitably hoped that she was too ill herself. Her known attention to her own
                    good looks, and the terror of the smallpox which then prevailed, supply perhaps
                    a less charitable but sufficient explanation. But in her will Madame de Sévigné
                    still showed her preference for this not too grateful child, and Charles de
                    Sévigné accepted his mother’s wishes in a letter showing the goodnature which he
                    had never lacked, and the good sense which, after his early follies, and even in
                    a way during them, he had also shown. But the two families were, except as has
                    been said for Madame de Simiane and her posterity, to be rapidly broken up.
                    Charles de Sévigné and his wife had no children, and he himself, after occupying
                    some public posts (he was king’s lieutenant in Brittany in 1697), went with his
                    wife into religious retirement at Paris in 1703, and after a time sequestered
                    himself still more in the seminary of Sainte-Magloire, where he died on March
                    26, 1713. His widow survived him twenty years. Madame de Grignan had died on
                    August 16, 1705, at a country house near Marseilles, of the very disease which
                    she had tried to escape by not visiting her dying mother. Her son, who had
                    fought at Blenheim, had died of the same malady at Thionville the year before.
                    Marie Blanche, her eldest daughter, was in a convent, and, as all the Comte de
                    Grignan’s brothers had either entered the church or died unmarried, the family,
                    already bankrupt in fortune, was extinguished in the male line by Grignan’s own
                    death in 1714, at a very great age. Madame de Simiane, whose connexion with the
                    history of the letters is important, died in 1737.</p>
                <p>The chief subjects of public interest and the principal family events of
                    importance which are noticed in the letters of Madame de Sévigné have been
                    indicated already. But, as will readily be understood, neither the whole nor
                    even the chief interest of her correspondence is confined to such things. In the
                    . latest edition the letters extend to sixteen or seventeen hundred, of which,
                    however, a considerable number (perhaps a third) are replies of other persons or
                    letters addressed to her, or letters of her family and friends having more or
                    less connexion with the subjects of her correspondence. As a rule her own
                    letters, especially those to her daughter, are of great length. Writing as she
                    did in a time when newspapers were not, or at least were scanty and jejune,
                    gossip of all sorts appears among her subjects, and some of her most famous
                    letters are pure <hi rend="italic">reportage</hi> (to use a modern French slang
                    term), while others deal with strictly private subjects. Thus one of her best
                    known pieces has for subject the famous suicide of the great cook Vatel owing to
                    a misunderstanding as to the provision of fish for an entertainment given to the
                    king by Condé at Chantilly. Another (one of the most characteristic of all)
                    deals with the projected marriage of Lauzun and Mademoiselle de Montpensier;
                    another with the refusal of one of her own footmen to turn haymaker when it was
                    important to get the crop in at Les Rochers; another with the fire which burnt
                    out her neighbour’s house in Faris. At one moment she tells how a forward lady
                    of honour was disconcerted in offering certain services at Mademoiselle’s levée;
                    at another how ill a courtier’s clothes became him. She enters, as has been
                    said, at great length into the pecuniary difficulties of her daughter; she tells
                    the most extraordinary stories of the fashion in which Charles de Sévigné sowed
                    his wild oats; she takes an almost ferocious interest and side in her daughter’s
                    quarrels with rival beauties or great officials in Provence who throw
                    difficulties in the way of government.</p>
                <p>Almost all writers of literary letters since Madame de Sévigné’s days, or rather
                    since the publication of her correspondence, have imitated her more or less
                    directly, more or less consciously, and it is therefore only by applying that
                    historic estimate upon which all true criticism rests that her full value can be
                    discerned. The charm of her work is, however, so irresistible that, read even
                    without any historical knowledge and in the comparatively adulterated editions
                    in which it is generally met with, that charm can hardly be missed. Madame de
                    Sévigné was a member of the strong and original group of writers—Retz, La
                    Rochefoucauld, Corneille, Pascal, St Evremond, Descartes, and the rest—who
                    escaped the finical and weakening reforms of the later 17th century, while for
                    the most part they had profited by those earlier reforms which succeeded the
                    classicizing of the Pléiade and the imitation of Spanish and Italian which
                    marred some early work of Louis XIII.'s time. According to the strictest
                    standard of the Academy her phraseology is sometimes incorrect, and it
                    occasionally shows traces of the quaint and affected style of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Précieuses</hi>; but these things only add to its savour and
                    piquancy. In lively narration few writers have excelled her, and in the natural
                    expression of domestic affection and maternal affection none. She had an
                    all-observant eye for trifles and the keenest possible appreciation of the
                    ludicrous, together with a hearty relish for all sorts of amusements, pageants,
                    and diversions, and a deep though not voluble or over-sensitive sense of the
                    beauties of nature. But with all this she had an understanding as solid as her
                    temper was gay. Unlike her daughter she was not a professed blue-stocking or
                    philosophess. But she had a strong affection for theology, in which she inclined
                    (like the great majority of the religious and intelligent laity of her time in
                    France) to the Jansenist side. Her favourite author in this class was Nicole.
                    She has been reproached with her fondness for the romances of Mlle. de Scudéry
                    and the rest of her school. But probably many persons who make that reproach
                    have themselves never read the works they despise, and are ignorant how much
                    merit there is in books whose chief faults are that they are written in a
                    strongly marked and now obsolete fashion, and that their length (which, however,
                    scarcely if at all exceeds that of <hi rend="italic">Clarissa)</hi> is
                    preposterous. In purely literary criticism Madame de Sévigné, few as were the
                    airs she gave herself, was no mean expert. Her preference for Corneille over
                    Racine has much more in it than the fact that the elder poet had been her
                    favourite before the younger began to write; and her remarks on La Fontaine and
                    some other authors are both judicious and independent. Nor is she wanting in
                    original reflexions of no ordinary merit. All these things, added to her
                    abundance of amusing matter and the charm of her bright and ceaselessly flowing
                    style, fully account for the unchanged and undiminished delight which half a
                    dozen generations have taken in her work. But it cannot bo repeated too often
                    that to enjoy that work in its most enjoyable point—the combination of fluent
                    and easy style with quaint archaisms and tricks of phrase—it must be read as she
                    wrote it, and not in the trimmed and corrected version of Perrin and Madame de
                    Simiane.</p>
                <p>There can, moreover, be no one, however wedded he may be to the plan of
                    criticizing literature as literature, who will not admit that great part of the
                    interest and value of these remarkable works lies in the picture of character
                    which they present. Indeed, great part of their purely literary merit lies in
                    the extraordinary vividness of this very presentation. Madame de Sévigné’s
                    character, however, has not united quite such a unanimity of suffrage as her
                    ability in writing. In her own time there were not wanting enemies (indeed her
                    unsparing partisanship on her daughter’s side could not fail to provoke such)
                    who maintained that her letters were written for effect, and that her affection
                    for her daughter was ostentatious and unreal. But few modern critics have
                    followed these detractors, and it may be said confidently that no competent
                    judge of character, after patiently reading the letters, can for a moment admit
                    their view. But this kind of enemy has been followed by another, who, not
                    overshooting his mark so conspicuously, has been somewhat more successful in
                    persuading spectators that he has hit it. Her excessive affection for Madame de
                    Grignan (the almost importunate character of which seems to<pb break="no"

                    if not of quarrel when they were together); her unhesitating blindness to
                    anything but her daughter’s interest (manifested especially in the part she took
                    in most unjustifiable attempts of Madame de Grignan to secure her stepdaughters’
                    dowries and to force themselves into a convent); her culpable tolerance of her
                    son’s youthful follies on the one hand and the uneven balance which she held in
                    money matters between him and his sister on the other; the apparent levity with
                    which she speaks of the sufferings of Madame de Brinvilliers, of galley slaves,
                    of the peasantry, &amp;c.; and the freedom of language which she uses herself
                    and tolerates from others, —have all been cast up against her. Here the
                    before-mentioned historic estimate sufficiently disposes of some of the
                    objections, a little common sense of others, and a very little charity of the
                    rest. If too much love felt by a mother towards a daughter be a fault, then
                    certainly Madame de Sévigné was one of the most offending souls that ever lived;
                    but it will hardly, even with the injustice which like all excessive affection
                    it brought in its traiu, be held damning. Indeed, the guilty lady was evidently
                    quite aware of her weakness in this respect, and it is one of the most
                    noteworthy things of her literary capacity that, excessive as the weakness is,
                    it does not disgust or weary the reader. The singular confidences which Madame
                    de Sévigné received from her son and transmitted to her daughter would even at
                    the present day be less surprising in France than in England. They are only an
                    instance, adjusted to the manners of the time, of the system of sacrificing
                    everything to the maintenance of confidence between mother and son, to which the
                    almost invariable, and to foreigners sometimes rather ludicrous, but certainly
                    not unamiable, adoration of Frenchmen for their mothers is due. Here too, as
                    well as in reference to the immediately kindred charge of crudity of language,
                    and to that of want of sympathy with suffering, especially with the sufferings
                    of the people, it is especially necessary to remember of what generation Madame
                    de Sévigné was and what were her circumstances. That generation was the
                    generation which Madame de Rambouillet endeavoured with some success to polish
                    and humanize, but which had barely recovered the hardening influences of the
                    religious and civil wars when it was plunged into the Fronde. It was the
                    generation to which belong the almost incredible yet trustworthy <hi
                    rend="italic">Historiettes</hi> of Tallemaut, and in which, when she herself had
                    already reached middle life, Bussy Rabutin’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    Amoureuse</hi> exposed him indeed to powerful resentments but did not make him
                    lose all caste as a gentleman and man of honour. It is absurd to expect at such
                    a time and in private letters the delicacy proper to quite different times and
                    circumstances. Moreover, as to the charge of inhumanity not only do these
                    considerations apply but there is more to be pleaded than mere extenuating
                    circumstances. It is not true that Madame de Sévigné shows no sympathy with the
                    oppression of the Bretons; it is very far from true, though her incurable habit
                    of humorous expression—of <hi rend="italic">Rabutinage,</hi> as she says—makes
                    her occasionally use light phrases about the matter. But it is in fact as
                    unreasonable to expect modern political views from her (and it is from certain
                    modern political standpoints that the charge is usually made) as it is to expect
                    her to observe the canons of a 19th-century propriety. On the whole she may be
                    as fairly and confidently acquitted of any moral fault, save the one peccadillo
                    of loving her daughter too exclusively and blindly, as she may be acquitted of
                    all literary faults whatsoever. Her letters are wholly, what her son-in-law said
                    well of her after her death, <hi rend="italic">compagnons délicieux</hi>; and,
                    far from faultless as Madame de Grignan was, none of her faults is more felt by
                    the reader than her long visits to her mother, during which the letters
                    ceased.</p>
                <p>The bibliographic history of Madame de Sévigné’s letters is of considerable
                    interest in itself, and is moreover typical of much other contemporary literary
                    history. The 17th century was <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> the century
                    of privately circulated literature, and from Madame de Sévigné herself we know
                    that her own letters were copied and handed about, sometimes under specified
                    titles, as early as 1673. None of them, however, were published until her
                    correspondence with Bussy Rabutin appeared, in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs and
                    Correspondence,</hi> partly in the year of her death, partly next year. The
                    remainder were not printed in any form for thirty years. Then between 1725 and
                    1728 appeared no less than seven unauthorized editions, containing more or fewer
                    additions from the copies which had been circulated privately. The bibliography
                    of these is complicated and curious, and must be sought in special works (see
                    especially the <hi rend="italic">Grands Écrivains</hi> edition, vol. xi.). They
                    have, however, abiding interest chiefly because they stirred up Madame de
                    Simiane, the writer’s only living representative, to give an authorized version.
                    This appeared under the care of the Chevalier de Perrin in 6 vols. (Paris,
                    1734-37). It contained only the letters to Madame de Grignan, and these were
                    subjected to editing rather careful than conscientious, the results of which
                    were never thoroughly removed until quite recently. In the first place, Madame
                    de Simiane, who possessed her mother’s replies, is said to have burnt the whole
                    of these from religious motives; this phrase is explained by Madame de Grignan’s
                    Cartesianism, which is supposed to have led her to expressions alarming to
                    orthodoxy. In the second, scruples partly having to do with the susceptibilities
                    of living persons, partly concerning Jansenist and other prejudices, made her
                    insist on numerous omissions. Thirdly, and most unfortunately, the change of
                    taste seems to have required still more numerous alterations of style and
                    language, such as the substitution of “Ma Fille” for Madame de Sévigné’s usual
                    and charming “Ma Bonne,” and many others. Perrin followed this edition up in
                    1751 with a volume of supplementary letters not addressed to Madame de Grignan,
                    and in 1754 published his last edition of the whole, which was long the standard
                    (8 vols., Paris). During the last half of the 18th century numerous. editions of
                    the whole or parts appeared with important additions, such as that of 1756,
                    giving for the first time the letters to Pomponne on the Fouquet trial; that of
                    1773, giving letters to Moulceau; that of 1775, giving for the first time the
                    Bussy letters separate from his memoirs, &amp;c. An important collected edition
                    of all these fragments, by the Abbé de Vauxcelles, appeared in 1801 (Paris, An
                    IX. ) in 10 vols.; five years later Gouvelle (Paris, 1806, 8 vols.) introduced
                    the improvement of chronological order; this was reprinted in 12 vols. (Paris,
                    1819) with some more unpublished letters which had separately appeared
                    meanwhile. In the same year appeared the first edition of M. de Monmerqué. From
                    that date continual additions of unpublished letters were made, in great part by
                    the same editor, and at last the whole was remodelled on manuscript copies (the
                    originals unfortunately are available for but few) in the edition called Des
                    Grands Écrivains, which M. de Monmerqué began, but which owing to his death had
                    to be finished by MM. Regnier, Paul Mesnard, and Sommer (Paris, 1862-1868).
                    This, which entirely supersedes all others (even a handsome edition published
                    during its appearance by M. Silvestre de Sacy), consists of twelve volumes of
                    text, notes, &amp;c., two volumes of lexicon, and an album of plates. It
                    contains all the published letters to and from Madame de Sévigné, with the
                    replies where they exist, with all those letters to and from Madame de Simiane
                    (many of which had been added to the main body) that contain any interest. The
                    sole fault to be found with this excellent edition is the omission to add to
                    each volume a table of contents giving each letter as it comes with a brief
                    abstract of its contents. To it, however, must be added two volumes (printed
                    uniformly) of <hi rend="italic">Lettres Inédites,</hi> published by M. Ch.
                    Capmas in 1876 and containing numerous variants and additions from a MS. copy
                    discovered in an old curiosity shop at Dijon. Of less elaborate and costly
                    editions that in the collection Didot (6 vols., Paris, v.d. ) is by far the
                    best, though, in common with all others except the <hi rend="italic">Grands
                    Écrivains</hi> edition, it contains an adulterated text.</p>
                <p>Works on Madame de Sévigné are innumerable. The biography by Paul Mesnard is
                    nearly exhaustive, but the most elaborate biographical book is that of
                    Walckenaer (3d ed., Paris, 1856, 5 vols.), to which should be added the
                    remarkable <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Mme. de Sévigné</hi> of Aubenas (Paris
                    and St Petersburg, 1842). In English an excellent little book by Miss Thackeray
                    (Mrs Ritchie), Edinburgh and London, 1881, may be recommended. Most of the
                    editions have portraits more or fewer. (G. SA.)</p>
