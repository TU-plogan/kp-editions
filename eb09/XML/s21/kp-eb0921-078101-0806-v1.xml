                <p><label type="entry">SHAWL</label>, a square or oblong article of dress worn in
                    various ways dependent from the shoulders. The term is of Persian origin <hi
                        rend="italic">(shál),</hi> and the article itself is most characteristic and
                    important in the dress of the natives of north-western India and Central Asia;
                    but in various forms, and under different names, essentially the same piece of
                    clothing is found in most parts of the world. The shawls made in Kashmir occupy
                    a pre-eminent place among textile products; and it is to them and to their
                    imitations from Western looms that specific importance attaches. The Kashmir
                    shawl is characterized by the great elaboration and minute detail of its design,
                    in which the “cone” pattern is a prominent feature, and by the glowing harmony,
                    brilliance, depth, and enduring qualities of its colours. The basis of these
                    excellences is found in the raw material of the shawl manufacture, which
                    consists of the very fine, soft, short, flossy under-wool, called pashm or
                    pashmina, found on the shawl-goat, a variety of <hi rend="italic">Capra
                        hircus</hi> inhabiting the elevated regions of Tibet. There are several
                    varieties of pashm, according to the districts in which it is produced, but the
                    finest is a strict monopoly of the maharaja of Kashmir, through whose territory
                    it comes. Inferior pashm and Kirman wool—a fine soft Persian sheep’s wool—are
                    used for shawl weaving at Amritsar and other places in the Punjab, where
                    colonies of Kashmiri weavers are established; but just in proportion to the
                    quality of the pashm used are the beauty and value of the resulting shawl. In
                    Kashmir the shawl wool is sorted with patient care by hand, and spun into a fine
                    thread, a work of so much delicacy, owing to the shortness of the fibre, that a
                    pound of undyed thread may be worth <hi rend="italic">£2,</hi> 10s. The various
                    colours, costly and permanent, are dyed in the yarn. The subsequent weaving or
                    embroidering is a work of great labour, and a fine shawl will occupy the whole
                    labour of three men not less than a year. Thus a first-rate shawl weighing about
                    7 lb may cost at the place of its production £300, made up thus :— material £30,
                    labour £150, duty £70, miscellaneous expenses, £50. In shawl cloth many
                    varieties of dress articles are made; but of shawls themselves, apart from shape
                    and pattern, there are only two principal classes :— (1) loom-woven shawls
                    called tiliwalla, tilikár or káni kâr,—sometimes woven in one piece, but more
                    often in small segments which are sewn together with such precision and neatness
                    that the sewing is quite imperceptible (such loom-woven shawls have borders of
                    silk, the weight and stiffness of which serve to stretch the shawl and make it
                    set properly); and (2) embroidered shawls— amlikâr,—in which over a ground of
                    plain pashmina is worked by needle a minute and elaborate pattern. A large
                    proportion of the inhabitants of Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, are engaged
                    in the shawl industry; and there are numerous colonies of Kashmiri weavers
                    settled at Amritsar, Ludianah, Nurpur, and other towns in the Punjab. Amritsar
                    is now the principal entrepôt of the shawl trade between India and Europe.
                    Imitation Kashmir shawls are made at Lyons, Nîmes, Norwich, and Paisley, and
                    some of the products of these localities are little inferior in beauty and
                    elaboration to Oriental shawls; but owing to the fluctuations of fashion there
                    has been little demand for the finer products of European looms for many years.
