                    of western France, formed in 1790 mainly of the districts of Thouars, Gâtinais,
                    and Niortais, which constituted about one-fourth of Poitou, and to a small
                    extent of a portion of Basse-Saintonge and Angoumois, and a very small fragment
                    of Aunis. It derives its name from the ’ Sèvre of Niort, which flows across the
                    south of the department from east to west, and the Sèvre of Nantes, which drains
                    the north-west. Lying between 45° 58' and 47° 7' N. lat. and between 0° 56' W.
                    and 0° 13' E. long., it is bounded (for the most part conventionally) N. by
                    Maine-et-Loire, E. by Vienne, S.E. by Charente, S. by Lower Charente, and W. by
                    La Vendée. Part belongs to the basin of the Loire, part to that of the Sèvres of
                    Niort, and part to that of the Charente. There are three regions,—the Gâtine,
                    the “Plain,” and the “Marsh,”—distinguished by their geological character and
                    their general physical appearance. The Gâtine, formed of primitive rocks
                    (granite and schists), is the continuation of the “Bocage” of La Vendee and
                    Maine-et-Loire. It is a poor district with an irregular surface, covered with
                    hedges and clumps of wood or forests. The Plain, resting on Oolitic limestone or
                    the “white rock” <hi rend="italic">(pierre blanche),</hi> is a fertile grain
                    country. The Marsh, occupying only a small part of the department to the
                    south-west, consists of alluvial clays which also are extremely productive when
                    properly drained. The highest point in the department (892 feet above the sea)
                    is to the east of Parthenay; the lowest lies only 10 feet above sea-level. The
                    climate is mild, the annual temperature at Niort being 54° Fahr., and the
                    rainfall a little more than 24 inches. The winters are colder in the Gâtine, the
                    summers warmer in the Plain; and the Marsh is the moistest and mildest of the
                    three districts.</p>
                <p>With a total area of 1,482,655 acres, the department contains 1,043,752 acres of
                    arable ground, 125,534 acres of meadows, 49,129 of vineyards, 106,222 of
                    forests, 20,429 of heath. The live stock in 1880 comprised 36,150 horses, 12,800
                    mules, 2012 asses, 217,935 cattle, 18,405 sheep (wool clip 102 tons) 78,930
                    pigs, 50,321 goats, 18,845 beehives (55 tons of honey). The horses are a strong
                    breed, and the department raises mules for Spain, the Alps, Auvergne, and
                    Provence. In 1883 there were produced—wheat, 3,909,260 bushels; meslin, 466,909;
                    rye, 673,920; and in 1880 barley produced 1,293,600 bushels; buckwheat, 133,650;
                    maize and millet, 508,062; oats, 2,744,500; potatoes, 4,312,000; pulse, 192,500
                    bushels; beetroot, 123,429 tons; hemp, 945 tons; flax, 245 tons; colza seed,
                    75,900 bushels (640 tuns of oil). The wine and cider amounted in 1882 to
                    2,859,912 and 210,914 gallons respectively. Vegetables (artichokes, asparagus,
                    cabbage, pease, onions) are largely cultivated. Oaks, chestnuts, and beeches are
                    the most important trees. The apple-trees of the Gâtine and the walnut-trees of
                    the Plain are also of considerable value. Coal (200 miners, and 21,487 tons in
                    1882) and peat are worked; iron-ore, argentiferous lead, and antimony exist but
                    are not worked; and freestone, both hard and soft, is very extensively quarried.
                    There are several sulphurous mineral waters in the department. The most
                    important industry is the manufacture of cloth—serges, druggets, linen,
                    handkerchiefs, flannels, swan-skins, and knitted goods. Wool and
                    cotton-spinning, tanning, and currying, glove, brush, and hat making,
                    distilling, brewing, flour-milling, and oil-refining are also carried on. In 740
                    establishments water-power is used to the extent of 3000 horse power; and 301
                    stationary and 165 movable steam-engines represent respectively 1895 and 677
                    horse-power. The commerce of the department, which supplies mules, cattle, and
                    provisions for Γaris and the neighbouring great towns, is facilitated by 21
                    miles of waterway (the Sèvre and its left-hand tributary the Mignon), 289 miles
                    of national roads, 3535 of other roads, and 232 miles of railway. In density of
                    population (350,103 in 1881) the department is below the average of France. It
                    contains 38,000 Protestants, especially in the south-east, there being only
                    three French departments—Gard, Ardèche, and Drôme—which surpass it in this
                    respect. The four arrondissements are Niort, Bressuire (3549 inhabitants in the
                    town), Melle (2433), and Parthenay (4842); the cantons number 31, and the
                    communes 356. It is part of the diocese of Poitiers, where also is the court of
                    appeal; its military headquarters are at Tours. St Maixent (4790) has an
                    infantry school.</p>
