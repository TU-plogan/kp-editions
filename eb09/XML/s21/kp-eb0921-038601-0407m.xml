                    clergyman. It was not till his sixteenth year that any enthusiasm was aroused in
                    him for the language and literature of his race. At this time an essay of
                    Jungmann’s fell into his hands, and at once gave a direction to his studies. His
                    first production was a volume of poems in Bohemian entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Muse of Tatra with a Slavonic Lyre,</hi> published at Levocza in 1814.
                    After this we find him collecting Slovak songs. In 1815 he began a course of
                    study at the university of Jena, and while there translated into Czech the <hi
                    rend="italic">Clouds</hi> of Aristophanes and the <hi rend="italic">Maria
                    Stuart</hi> of Schiller. In 1817 he came to Prague and joined the literary
                    circle of which Dobrovsky, Jungmann, and Hanka were members. In 1819 he was
                    appointed headmaster of the high school at Neusatz (Novi Sad) in the south of
                    Hungary; he remained occupied with the duties of this office till 1833. But
                    besides his educational functions he busied himself with the study of Servian
                    literature and antiquities, and acquired many rare books and manuscripts. In
                    1826 his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Slawischen Sprache und Literatur nach
                    allen Mundarten</hi> appeared at Pesth. This may truly be called an epoch-making
                    book in the history of Slavonic studies. It was the first attempt to give
                    anything like a systematic account of the Slavonic languages, the knowledge of
                    which was at that time in such a rudimentary state that even Schafarik is not
                    able to classify properly the Bulgarian language, but has grouped it with
                    Servian. In 1833 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Serbische Lesekörner oder
                    historisch-kritische Beleuchtung der Serbischen Mundart,</hi> and in 1837 bis
                    great work <hi rend="italic">Slovanské Starozitnosti</hi> (“Slavonic Antiquities
                    ”), by which he is at the present time best known. The “Antiquities” have been
                    translated into Polish, Russian, and German, and we are promised an English
                    version shortly from the pen of Mrs Alexander Kerr. This valuable work was
                    enlarged and improved in the second edition, which appeared among the collected
                    works of Schafarik, edited by Jirecek after the author’s death. In 1840 he
                    published in conjunction with Palacký <hi rend="italic">Die ältesten Denkmäler
                    der Böhmischen Sprache,</hi> in which he defended the authenticity of those
                    Bohemian documents which have been declared spurious by some scholars. In the
                    year 1837 poverty compelled him to accept the uncongenial office of censor of
                    Czech publications, which he abandoned in 1847 on becoming custodian of the</p>
                <p>Prague public library. In 1842 he published his valuable work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Slovanský Národopis,</hi> which gives a complete account of Slavonic ethnology.
                    In 1848 he was made professor of Slavonic philology in the university of Prague,
                    but resigned it in the following year, probably from causes in some way
                    connected with the political troubles of that period, of which Prague was one of
                    the centres. He was then made keeper of the university library, in which office
                    he continued till his death in 1861. He had long been in broken health,—his
                    pains of body being augmented by brain disease, which had been brought on by his
                    severe literary labours and also by family anxieties. His latter days were
                    devoted to philology, one of the chief subjects treated of by him being the
                    antiquity of the Glagolitic alphabet, about which he held very different
                    opinions at various periods of his life. He was also for some time conductor of
                    the “Journal” of the Bohemian Museum, and edited the first volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vybor,</hi> or selections from old Czech writers, which appeared
                    under the auspices of the literary society in 1845. To this he prefixed a
                    grammar of the Old Bohemian language. His correspondence with Pogodin has been
                    published by Prof. Nil Popoff of Moscow among the letters of that eminent
                    scholar.</p>
                <p>Schafarik was a man of the purely literary type,—an indefatigable worker, an
                    enthusiast, and a sincere patriot. The study of Slavonic philology and ethnology
                    has advanced since his time, but the greater part of his work is permanent and
                    monumental. Besides his collected writings <hi rend="italic">(Sebrané
                    Spisy),</hi> which were reprinted at Prague after his death during the years
                    1862-1865, a posthumous work by him also made its appearance, edited by J.
                    Jireček, <hi rend="italic">Geschickte der Südslawischen Literatur.</hi></p>
