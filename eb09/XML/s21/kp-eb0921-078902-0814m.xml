                <p><label type="entry">SHELLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Percy Bysshe</hi></label>
                    (1792-1822), was born on</p>
                <p>4th August 1792, at Field Place, near Horsham, Sussex. He was the eldest child of
                    Timothy Shelley, M.P. for Shoreham, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Charles
                    Pilfold, of Effingham, Surrey. Mr Timothy Shelley became in 1815 Sir Timothy
                    Shelley, Bart., upon the decease of his father Bysshe, who was created a baronet
                    in 1806. This Bysshe Shelley was born in Christ Church, Newark, North America,
                    and married two heiresses, the former, the mother of Timothy, being Mary
                    Catherine, heiress of the Rev. Theobald Michell, of Horsham. He was a handsome
                    man of enterprising and remarkable character, accumulated a vast fortune, built
                    Castle Goring, and lived in sullen and penurious retirement in his closing
                    years. None of his talent seems to have descended to Timothy, who, except for
                    being of a rather oddly self-assertive character, was undistinguishable from the
                    ordinary run of commonplace country squires. The mother of the poet is described
                    as beautiful, and a woman of good abilities, but not with any literary turn; she
                    was an agreeable letter-writer. The branch of the Shelley family to which the
                    poet Percy Bysshe belonged traces its pedigree to Henry Shelley, of
                    Worminghurst, Sussex, who died in 1623. Beyond that point the genealogical
                    record is not clear; yet no substantial doubt exists that these Worminghurst or
                    Castle Goring Shelleys are of the same stock as the Michelgrove Shelleys, who
                    trace up to Sir William Shelley, judge of the common pleas under Henry VΠ.,
                    thence to a member of parliament in 1415, and to the reign of Edward I., or even
                    to the epoch of the Norman Conquest. The Worminghurst branch was a family of
                    credit, but not of distinction, until its fortunes culminated under the
                    above-named Sir Bysshe.</p>
                <p>In the character of Percy Bysshe Shelley three qualities become early manifest,
                    and may be regarded as innate: impressionableness or extreme susceptibility to
                    external and internal impulses of feeling; a lively imagination or erratic
                    fancy, blurring a sound estimate of solid facts; and a resolute repudiation of
                    outer authority or the despotism of custom. These qualities were highly
                    developed in his earliest manhood, were active in his boyhood, and no doubt made
                    some show even on the borderland between childhood and infancy. At the age of
                    six he was sent to a day school at Warnham, kept by the Rev. Mr Edwards; at ten
                    to Sion House School, Brentford, of which the principal was Dr Greenlaw, while
                    the pupils were mostly sons of local tradesmen; at twelve (or immediately before
                    that age, 29th July 1804) to Eton. The headmaster of Eton, up to nearly the
                    close of Shelley’s sojourn in the school, was Dr Goodall, a mild disciplinarian;
                    it is therefore a mistake to suppose that Percy (unless during his very brief
                    stay in the lower school) was frequently flagellated by the formidable Dr Keate,
                    who only became headmaster after Goodall. Shelley was a shy, sensitive, mopish
                    sort of boy from one point of view,—from another a very unruly one, having his
                    own notions of justice, independence, and mental freedom; by nature gentle,
                    kindly, and retiring,—under provocation dangerously violent. He resisted the
                    odious fagging system, exerted himself little in the routine of school-learning,
                    and was known both as “Mad Shelley” and as “Shelley the Atheist.’’ Some writers
                    try to show that an Eton boy would be termed atheist without exhibiting any
                    propensity to atheism, but solely on the ground of his being mutinous. However,
                    as Shelley was a declared atheist a good while before attaining his majority, a
                    shrewd suspicion arises that, if Etonians dubbed him atheist, they had some
                    relevant reason for doing so.</p>
                <p>Shelley entered University College, Oxford, in April 1810, returned thence to
                    Eton, and finally quitted the school at midsummer, and commenced residence in
                    Oxford<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n815/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0815-0790"/> in October. Here be met a young Durham man,
                    Thomas Jefferson Hogg, who had preceded him in the university by a couple of
                    months; the two youths at once struck up a warm and intimate friendship. Shelley
                    had at this time a love for chemical experiment, as well as for poetry,
                    philosophy, and classical study, and was in all his tastes and bearing an
                    enthusiast. Hogg was not in the least an enthusiast, rather a cynic, but he also
                    was a steady and well-read classical student. In religious matters both were
                    sceptics, or indeed decided anti-Christians; whether Hogg, as the senior and
                    more informed disputant, pioneered Shelley into strict atheism, or whether
                    Shelley, as the more impassioned and unflinching speculator, outran the
                    easy-going jeering Hogg, is a moot point; we incline to the latter opinion.
                    Certain it is that each egged on the other by perpetual disquisition on abstruse
                    subjects, conducted partly for the sake of truth and partly for that of mental
                    exercitation, without on either side any disposition to bow to authority or stop
                    short of extreme conclusions. The upshot of this habit was that Shelley and
                    Hogg, at the close of some five months of happy and uneventful academic life,
                    got expelled from the university. Shelley—for he alone figures as the writer of
                    the “little syllabus,” although there can be no doubt that Hogg was his
                    confidant and coadjutor throughout—published anonymously a pamphlet or flysheet
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The Necessity of Atheism,</hi> which he sent round,
                    or intended to send round, to all sorts of people as an invitation or challenge
                    to discussion. It amounted to saying that neither reason nor testimony is
                    adequate to establish the existence of a deity, and that nothing short of a
                    personal individual selfrevelation of the deity would be sufficient. The college
                    authorities heard of the pamphlet, somehow identified Shelley as its author, and
                    summoned him before them— “our master, and two or three of the fellows.” The
                    pamphlet was produced, and Shelley was required to say whether he had written it
                    or not. The youth declined to answer the question, and was expelled by a written
                    sentence, ready drawn up. Hogg was next summoned, with a result practically the
                    same. The precise details of this transaction have been much controverted; the
                    best evidence is that which appears on the college records, showing that both
                    Hogg and Shelley (Hogg is there named first) were expelled for “contumaciously
                    refusing to answer questions,” and for “repeatedly declining to disavow” the
                    authorship. Thus they were dismissed as being mutineers against academic
                    authority, in a case pregnant with the suspicion—not the proof—of atheism; but
                    how the authorities could know beforehand that the two undergraduates would be
                    contumacious and stiff against disavowal, so as to give warrant for written
                    sentences ready drawn up, is nowhere explained. Possibly the sentences were
                    worded without ground assigned, and would only have been produced <hi
                    rend="italic">in terrorem</hi> had the young men proved more malleable. The date
                    of this incident was 25th March 1811.</p>
                <p>Shelley and Hogg came up to London, where Shelley was soon left alone, as his
                    friend went to York to study conveyancing. Percy and his incensed father did not
                    at once come to terms, and for a while he had no resource beyond pocket-money
                    saved up by his sisters (four in number altogether) and sent round to him,
                    sometimes by the hand of a singularly pretty school-fellow, Miss Harriet
                    Westbrook, daughter of a retired and moderately opulent hotel-keeper. Shelley,
                    especially in early youth, had a somewhat “priggish” turn for moralizing and
                    argumentation, and a decided mania for proselytizing; his schoolgirl sisters,
                    and their little Methodist friend Miss Westbrook, aged between fifteen and
                    sixteen, must all be enlightened and converted to anti-Christianity. He there
                    fore cultivated the society of Harriet, calling at the house of her father, and
                    being encouraged in his assiduity by her much older sister Eliza. Harriet not
                    unnaturally fell in love with him; and he, though not it would seem at any time
                    ardently in love with her, dallied along the flowery pathway which leads to
                    sentiment and a definite courtship. This was not his first love-affair; for he
                    had but a very few months before been courting his cousin Miss Harriet Grove,
                    who, alarmed at his heterodoxies, finally broke off with him—to his no small
                    grief and perturbation at the time. It is averred, and seemingly with truth,
                    that Shelley never indulged in any sensual or dissipated amour; and, as he
                    advances in life, it becomes apparent that, though capable of the passion of
                    love, and unusually prone to regard with much effusion of sentiment women who
                    interested his mind and heart, the mere attraction of a pretty face or an
                    alluring figure left him unenthralled. After a while Percy was reconciled to his
                    father, revisited his family in Sussex, and then stayed with a cousin in Wales.
                    Hence he was recalled to London by Miss Harriet Westbrook, who wrote complaining
                    of her father’s resolve to send her back to her school, in which she was now
                    regarded with repulsion as having become too apt a pupil of the atheist Shelley.
                    He replied counselling resistance. “She wrote to say” (these are the words of
                    Shelley in a letter to Hogg, dating towards the end of July 1811) “that
                    resistance was useless, but that she would fly with me, and threw herself upon
                    my protection.” Shelley therefore returned to London, where he found Harriet
                    agitated and wavering; finally they agreed to elope, travelled in haste to
                    Edinburgh, and there, according to the law of Scotland, became husband and wife
                    on 28th August. Shelley, it should be understood, had by this time openly
                    broken, not only with the dogmas and conventions of Christian religion, but with
                    many of the institutions of Christian polity, and in especial with such as
                    enforce and regulate marriage; he held—with William Godwin and some other
                    theorists—that marriage ought to be simply a voluntary relation between a man
                    aud a woman, to be assumed at joint option and terminated at the after-option of
                    either party. If therefore he had acted upon his personal conviction of the
                    right, he would never have wedded Harriet, whether by Scotch, English, or any
                    other law; but he waived his own theory in favour of the consideration that in
                    such an experiment the woman’s stake, and the disadvantages accruing to her, are
                    out of all comparison with the man’s. His conduct therefore was so far entirely
                    honourable; and, if it derogated from a principle of his own (a principle which,
                    however contrary to the morality of other people, was and always remained matter
                    of genuine conviction on his individual part), this was only in deference to a
                    higher and more imperious standard of right.</p>
                <p>Harriet Shelley was not only beautiful; she was amiable, accommodating,
                    adequately well educated and well bred. She liked reading, and her reading was
                    not strictly frivolous. But she could not (as Shelley said at a later date)
                    “feel poetry and understand philosophy.” Her. attractions were all on the
                    surface; there was (to use a common phrase) “nothing particular in her.” For
                    nearly three years Shelley and she led a shifting sort of life upon an income of
                    £400 a year, one-half of which was allowed (after his first severe indignation
                    at the <hi rend="italic">mesalliance</hi> was past) by Mr Timothy Shelley, and
                    the other half by Mr Westbrook. The spouses left Edinburgh for York and the
                    society of Hogg; broke with him upon a charge made by Harriet, and evidently
                    fully believed by Shelley at the time, that, during a temporary absence of his
                    upon business in Sussex, Hogg had tried to seduce her (this quarrel was entirely
                    made up at the end of about a year); moved off<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n816/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0816-0791"/> to Keswick in Cumberland, coupled with the
                    company of Southey, and some hospitality from the duke of Norfolk, who, as chief
                    magnate in the Shoreham region of Sussex, was at pains to reconcile the father
                    and his too unfilial heir; sailed thence to Dublin, where Shelley was eager, and
                    in some degree prominent, in the good cause of Catholic emancipation, conjoined
                    with repeal of the union; crossed to Wales, and lived at Nant-Gwillt, near
                    Rhayader, then at Lynmouth in Devonshire, then at Tanyrallt in Carnarvonshire.
                    All this was between September 1811 and February 1813. At Lynmouth an Irish
                    servant of Shelley’s was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for distributing
                    and posting up printed papers, bearing no printer’s name, of an inflammatory or
                    seditious tendency —being a <hi rend="italic">Declaration of Rights</hi>
                    composed by the youthful reformer, and some verses of his named <hi
                    rend="italic">The Devil's Walk.</hi> At Tanyrallt Shelley was (to trust his own
                    and Harriet’s account, confirmed by the evidence of Miss Westbrook, the elder
                    sister, who continued an inmate in most of their homes) attacked on the night of
                    26th February by an assassin who fired three pistol-shots. The motive of the
                    attack was undefined; the fact of its occurrence was generally disbelieved, both
                    at the time and by subsequent inquirers. To analyse the possibilities and
                    probabilities of the case would lead us too far; we can only say that we rank
                    with the decided sceptics. Shelley was full of wild unpractical notions; he
                    dosed himself with laudanum as a palliative to spasmodic pains; he was given to
                    strange assertions and romancing narratives (several of which might properly be
                    specified here but for want of space), and was not incapable of conscious
                    fibbing. His mind no doubt oscillated at times along the line which divides
                    sanity from insane delusion. It is difficult to suppose that he simply invented
                    such a monstrous story to serve a purpose. The very enormity of the story tends
                    to dissuade us from thinking so, and the purpose alleged seems
                    disproportionately small—that of decamping from Tanyrallt ere creditors should
                    become too pressing. Indeed, we decisively reject this supposed motive. On the
                    other hand, nothing could be traced to corroborate Shelley’s assertion. This was
                    at any rate the break-up of the residence at Tanyrallt; the Shelleys revisited
                    Ireland, and then settled for a while in London. Here, in June 1813, Harriet
                    gave birth to her daughter Ianthe Eliza (she married a Mr Esdaile, and died in
                    1876). Here also Shelley brought out his first poem of any importance, <hi
                    rend="italic">Queen Mab;</hi> it was privately printed, as its exceedingly
                    aggressive tone in matters of religion and morals would not allow of
                    publication.</p>
                <p>The speculative sage whom Shelley especially reverenced was William Godwin, the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Political Justice</hi> and of the romance <hi
                    rend="italic">Caleb Williams</hi>; in 1796 he had married Mary Wollstonecraft,
                    authoress of <hi rend="italic">The Rights of Woman,</hi> who died shortly after
                    giving birth, on 30th August 1797, to a daughter Mary. With Godwin Shelley had
                    opened a volunteered correspondence late in 1811, and he had known him
                    personally since the winter which closed 1812. Godwin was then a bookseller,
                    living with his second wife, who had been a Mrs Clairmont; there were four other
                    inmates of the household, two of whom call for some mention here—Fanny
                    Wollstonecraft, the daughter of the authoress and Mr Imlay, and Claire, the
                    daughter of Mrs Clairmont. Fanny committed suicide in October 1816, being,
                    according to some accounts which remain unverified, hopelessly in love with
                    Shelley; Claire was closely associated with all his subsequent career. It was
                    towards May 1814 that Shelley first saw Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin as a grown-up
                    girl (she was well on towards seventeen); he instantly fell in love with her,
                    and she with him. Just before this, 24th March, Shelley had remarried Harriet in
                    London, though with no obviously cogent motive for doing so; but, on becoming
                    enamoured of Mary, he seems to have rapidly made up his mind that Harriet should
                    not stand in the way. She was at Bath while he was in London, and for a while
                    she heard nothing of him. They had, however, met again in London and come to
                    some sort of understanding before the final crisis arrived,— Harriet
                    remonstrating and indignant, but incapable of effective resistance,—Shelley sick
                    of her companionship, and bent upon gratifying his own wishes, which as we have
                    already seen were not at odds with his avowed principles of conduct. For some
                    months past there had been bickerings and misunderstandings between him and
                    Harriet, aggravated by the now detested presence of Miss Westbrook in the house;
                    more than this cannot be said, for no more is at present known. It is certain,
                    however, that evidence exists which, while not plainly proving any grave
                    wrongdoing on Harriet’s part, exculpates Shelley from the charge of having
                    separated from her without what appeared to himself sufficient cause. The upshot
                    came on 28th July, when Shelley aided Mary to elope from her father’s house,
                    Claire Clairmont deciding to accompany them. They crossed to Calais, and
                    proceeded across France into Switzerland. Godwin and his wife were greatly
                    incensed. Though he and Mary Wollstonecraft had entertained and avowed bold
                    opinions regarding the marriage-bond, similar to Shelley’s own, and had in their
                    time acted upon these opinions, it is not clearly made out that Mary Godwin had
                    ever been encouraged by paternal influence to think or do the like. Shelley and
                    she chose to act upon their own likings and responsibility,—he disregarding any
                    claim which Harriet had upon him, and Mary setting at nought her father’s
                    authority. Both were prepared to ignore the law of the land and the rules of
                    society.</p>
                <p>The three young people returned to London in September. In the following January
                    Sir Bysshe Shelley died, and Percy became the immediate heir to the entailed
                    property inherited by his father Sir Timothy. This entailed property seems to
                    have been worth £6000 per annum, or little less. There was another very much
                    larger property which Percy might shortly before have secured to himself,
                    contingently upon his father’s death, if he would have consented to put it upon
                    the same footing of entail; but this he resolutely refused to do, on the
                    professed ground of his being opposed upon principle to the system of entail;
                    therefore, on his grandfather’s death the larger property passed wholly away
                    from any interest which Percy might have had in it, in use or in expectancy. He
                    now came to an understanding with his father as to the remaining entailed
                    property; and, giving up certain future advantages, he received henceforth a
                    regular income of £1000 a year. Out of this he assigned £200 a year to Harriet,
                    who had given birth in November to a son, Charles Bysshe (he died in 1826).
                    Shelley, and Mary as well, were on moderately good terms with Harriet, seeing
                    her from time to time. His peculiar views as to the relations of the sexes
                    appear markedly again in his having (so it is alleged) invited Harriet to return
                    to his and Mary’s house as a domicile; of course this curious arrangement did
                    not take effect. Shelley and Mary (who was naturally always called Mrs Shelley)
                    now settled at Bishopgate, near Windsor Forest; here he produced his first
                    excellent poem, <hi rend="italic">Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude,</hi> which
                    was published soon afterwards along with a few others. In May 1816 the pair left
                    England for Switzerland, together with Miss Clairmont, and their own infant son
                    William. They went straight to Sécheron, near Geneva; Lord Byron, whose
                    separation from his wife had just then taken place, arrived there immediately
                    afterwards. A great deal of controversy has lately arisen; as to the motives and
                    incidents of this foreign sojourn.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n817/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0817-0792"/> The clear fact is that Miss Clairmont, who had a
                    fine voice and some inclination for the stage, had seen Byron, as connected with
                    the management of Drury Lane theatre, early in the year, and an amorous intrigue
                    had begun between them in London. <hi rend="italic">Prima facie</hi> it seems
                    quite reasonable to suppose that she had explained the facts to Shelley or to
                    Mary, or to both, and had induced them to convoy her to the society of Byron
                    abroad; were this finally established as the fact, it would show no
                    inconsistency of conduct, or breach of his own code of sexual morals, on
                    Shelley’s part. On the other hand it is asserted that documentary evidence of an
                    irrefragable kind exists showing that Shelley and Mary were totally ignorant of
                    the amour shortly before they went abroad. Whether or not they knew of it while
                    they and Claire were in daily intercourse with Byron, and housed close by him on
                    the shore of the Lake of Geneva, may be left unargued. The three returned to
                    London in September 1816, Byron remaining abroad; and in January 1817 Miss
                    Clairmont gave birth to his daughter named Allegra. The return of the Shelleys
                    was closely followed by two suicides,—first that of Fanny Wollstonecraft
                    (already referred to), and second that of Harriet Shelley, who on 9th November
                    drowned herself in the Serpentine. The latest stages of the lovely and
                    ill-starred Harriet’s career have never been very explicitly recorded. It seems
                    that she formed a connexion with some gentleman from whom circumstances or
                    desertion separated her, that her habits became intemperate, and that she was
                    treated with contumelious harshness by her sister during an illness of their
                    father. She had always had a propensity (often laughed at in earlier and happier
                    days) to the idea of suicide, and she now carried it out in act—possibly without
                    anything which could be regarded as an extremely cogent predisposing motive,
                    although the total weight of her distresses, accumulating within the past two
                    years and a half, was beyond question heavy to bear. Shelley, then at Bath,
                    hurried up to London when he heard of Harriet’s death, giving manifest signs of
                    the shock which so terrible a catastrophe had produced on him. Some
                    self-reproach must no doubt have mingled with his affliction and dismay; yet he
                    does not appear to have considered himself gravely in the wrong at any stage in
                    the transaction, and it is established that in the train of quite recent events
                    which immediately led up to Harriet’s suicide he had borne no part.</p>
                <p>This was the time when Shelley began to see a great deal of Leigh Hunt, the poet
                    and essayist, editor of <hi rend="italic">The Examiner</hi>; they were close
                    friends, and Hunt did something (hardly perhaps so much as might have been
                    anticipated) to uphold the reputation of Shelley as a poet— which, we may here
                    say once for all, scarcely obtained any public acceptance or solidity during his
                    brief lifetime. The death of Harriet having removed the only obstacle to a
                    marriage with Mary Godwin, the wedding ensued on 30th December 1816, and the
                    married couple settled down at Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire. Their
                    tranquillity was shortly disturbed by a Chancery suit set in motion by Mr
                    Westbrook, who asked for the custody of his two grandchildren, on the ground
                    that Shelley had deserted his wife and intended to bring up his offspring in his
                    own atheistic and anti-social opinions. Lord Chancellor Eldon delivered judgment
                    towards 26th March 1817. He held that Shelley, having avowed condemnable
                    principles of conduct, and having fashioned his own conduct to correspond, and
                    being likely to inculcate the same principles upon his children, was unfit to
                    have the charge of them. He therefore assigned this charge to Mr and Miss
                    Westbrook, and appointed as their immediate curator Dr Hume, an orthodox
                    army-physician, who was Shelley’s own nominee. The poet had to pay for the
                    maintenance of the children a sum which stood eventually at £120 per annum; if
                    it was at first (as generally stated) £200, that was no more than what he had
                    previously allowed to Harriet. This is the last incident of marked importance in
                    the perturbed career of Shelley; the rest relates to the history of his mind,
                    the poems which he produced and published, and his changes of locality in
                    travelling. In March 1818, after an illness which he regarded (rightly or
                    wrongly) as a dangerous pulmonary attack, Shelley, with his wife, their two
                    infants William and Clara, and Miss Clairmont and her baby Allegra, went off to
                    Italy, in which country the whole short remainder of his life was passed.
                    Allegra was soon sent on to Venice, to her father Byron, who, ever since parting
                    from Miss Clairmont in Switzerland, showed a callous and unfeeling determination
                    to see and know no more about her. In 1818 the Shelleys— mostly, not always,
                    with Miss Clairmont in their company —were in Milan, Leghorn, the Bagni di
                    Lucca, Venice and its neighbourhood, Rome, and Naples; in 1819 in Rome, the
                    vicinity of Leghorn, and Florence (both their infants were now dead, but a third
                    was born late in 1819, the present baronet, Sir Percy Florence Shelley); in 1820
                    in Pisa, the Bagni di Pisa (or di San Giuliano), and Leghorn; in 1821 in Pisa
                    and with Byron in Ravenna; in 1822 in Pisa and on the Bay of Spezia, between
                    Lerici and San Terenzio. The incidents of this period are but few, and of no
                    great importance apart from their bearing upon the poet’s writings. In Leghorn
                    he knew Mr and Mrs Gisborne, the latter a once intimate friend of Godwin; she
                    taught Shelley Spanish, and he was eager to promote a project for a steamer to
                    be built by her son by a former marriage, the young engineer Henry Reveley; it
                    would have been the first steamer to navigate the Gulf of Lyons. In Pisa he
                    formed a sentimental intimacy with the Contessina Emilia Viviani, a girl who was
                    pining in a convent pending her father’s choice of a husband for her; this
                    impassioned but vague and fanciful attachment— which soon came to an end, as
                    Emilia’s character developed less favourably in the eyes of her Platonic adorer—
                    produced the transcendental love-poem of <hi rend="italic">Epipsychidion</hi> in
                    1821. In Ravenna the scheme of the quarterly magazine <hi rend="italic">The
                    Liberal</hi> was concerted by Byron and Shelley, the latter being principally
                    interested in it with a view to benefiting Leigh Hunt by such an association
                    with Byron. In Pisa Byron and Shelley were very constantly together, having in
                    their company at one time or another Captain Medwin (cousin and schoolfellow of
                    Shelley, and one of his biographers), Lieutenant and Mrs Williams, to both of
                    whom our poet was very warmly attached, and Captain Trelawny, the adventurous
                    and romantic-natured seaman who has left important and interesting reminiscences
                    of this period. Byron admired very highly the generous, unworldly, and
                    enthusiastic character of Shelley, and set some value on his writings; Shelley
                    half-worshipped Byron as a poet, and was anxious, but in some conjunctures by no
                    means able, to respect him as a man. In Pisa he knew also Prince Alexander
                    Mavrocordato, one of the pioneers of Grecian insurrection and freedom; the
                    glorious cause fired Shelley, and he wrote the drama of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hellas</hi> (1821).</p>
                <p>The last residence of Shelley was the Casa Magni, a bare and exposed dwelling on
                    the Gulf of Spezia. He and his wife, with the Williamses, went there at the end
                    of April 1822, to spend the summer, which proved an arid and scorching one.
                    Shelley and Williams, both of them insatiably fond of boating, had a small
                    schooner named the “Don Juan” built at Genoa after a design which Williams had
                    procured from a naval friend, and which was the reverse of safe. They received
                    her on 12th May, found her rapid and alert, and on 1st July started in her to<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n818/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0818-0793"/> Leghorn, to meet Leigh Hunt, whose arrival in
                    Italy had just been notified. After doing his best to set things going
                    comfortably between Byron and Hunt, Shelley returned on board with Williams on
                    8th July. It was a day of dark, louring, stifling heat. Trelawny took leave of
                    his two friends, and about half-past six in the evening found himself startled
                    from a doze by a frightful turmoil of storm. The “Don Juan” had by this time
                    made Via Reggio; she was not to be seen, though other vessels which had sailed
                    about the same time were still discernible. Shelley, Williams, and their only
                    companion, a sailor-boy, perished in the squall. The exact nature of the
                    catastrophe was from the first regarded as somewhat disputable, but it is only
                    of late years (1875) that it has been keenly debated. The condition of the “Don
                    Juan” when recovered did not favour any assumption that she had capsized in a
                    heavy sea—rather that she had been run down by some other vessel, a felucca or
                    fishing-smack. In the absence of any counter-evidence this would be supposed to
                    have occurred by accident; but a rumour, not strictly verified and certainly not
                    refuted, exists that an aged Italian seaman on his deathbed confessed that he
                    had been one of the crew of the fatal felucca, and that the collision was
                    intentional, as the men had plotted to steal a sum of money supposed to be on
                    the “Don Juan,” in charge of Lord Byron. In fact there was a moderate sum there,
                    but Byron had neither embarked nor intended to embark. This may perhaps be the
                    true account of the tragedy; at any rate Trelawny, the best possible authority
                    on the subject, accepted it as true. He it was who laboriously tracked out the
                    shore-washed corpses of Shelley and Williams, and who undertook the burning of
                    them, after the ancient Greek fashion, on the shore near Via Reggio, on the 15th
                    and 16th of August. The great poet’s ashes were then collected, and buried in
                    the new Protestant cemetery in Rome. He was, at the time of his untimely death,
                    within a month of completing the thirtieth year of his age—a surprising example
                    of rich poetic achievement for so young a man.</p>
                <p>The character of Shelley can be considered according to two different standards
                    of estimation. We can estimate the original motive forces in his character; or
                    we can form an opinion of his actions, and thence put a certain construction
                    upon his personal qualities. We will first try the latter method. It cannot be
                    denied by his admirers and eulogists, and is abundantly clear to his censors,
                    that his actions were in some considerable degree abnormal, dangerous to the
                    settled basis of society, and marked by headstrong and undutiful presumption.
                    But it is remarkable that, even among the censors of his conduct, many persons
                    are none the less impressed by the beauty of his character; and this leads us
                    back to our first point—the original motive forces in that. Here we find
                    enthusiasm, fervour, courage (moral and physical), an unbounded readiness to act
                    upon what he considered right principle, however inconvenient or disastrous the
                    consequences to himself, sweetness and indulgence towards others, extreme
                    generosity, and the principle of love for humankind in abundance and
                    superabundance. He respected the truth, such as he conceived it to be, in
                    spiritual or speculative matters, and respected no construction of the truth
                    which came to him recommended by human authority. No man had more hatred or
                    contempt of custom and prescription; no one had a more authentic or vivid sense
                    of universal charity. The same radiant enthusiasm which appeared in his poetry
                    as idealism stamped his speculation with the conception of perfectibility and
                    his character with loving emotion.</p>
                <p>In person Shelley was attractive, winning, and almost beautiful, but not to be
                    called handsome. His height was nearly 5 feet 11; he was slim, agile, and
                    strong, with something of a stoop; his complexion brilliant, his hair abundant
                    and wavy, dark-brown but early beginning to grizzle; the eyes, deep-blue in
                    tint, have been termed “stag-eyes ”—large, fixed, and beaming. His voice was
                    wanting in richness and suavity—high-pitched, and tending to the screechy; his
                    general aspect, though extremely variable according as his mood of mind and his
                    expression shifted, was on the whole uncommonly juvenile.</p>
                <p>From this necessarily very slight account of the life of Shelley we pass to a
                    consideration—and this too must be equally slender —of his works in poetry. If
                    we except Goethe (and for convenience’ sake leaving out of count any living
                    writers, whose ultimate value cannot at present be assessed), we consider
                    Shelley to be the supreme poet of the new era which, beginning with the French
                    Revolution, remains continuous into our own day. Lord Byron and Victor Hugo come
                    the nearest to Shelley in poetic stature, and each of them might for certain
                    reasons be even preferred to him; Wordsworth also has his numerous champions.
                    The grounds on which we set Shelley highest of all are mainly three. He excels
                    all his competitors in ideality, he excels them in music, and he excels them in
                    importance. By importance we here mean the direct import of the work performed,
                    its controlling power over the reader’s thought and feeling, the contagious fire
                    of its white-hot intellectual passion, and the long reverberation of its appeal.
                    Shelley is emphatically the poet of the future. In his own day an alien in the
                    world of mind and invention, and in our day scarcely yet a denizen of it, he
                    appears destined to become, in the long vista of years, an informing presence in
                    the innermost shrine of human thought. Shelley appeared at the time when the
                    sublime frenzies of the French revolutionary movement had exhausted the
                    elasticity of men’s thought—at least in England—and had left them flaccid and
                    stolid; but that movement prepared another in which revolution was to assume the
                    milder guise of reform, conquering and to conquer. Shelley was its prophet. As
                    an iconoclast and an idealist he took the only position in which a poet could
                    advantageously work as a reformer. To outrage his contemporaries was the
                    condition of leading his successors to triumph and of personally triumphing in
                    their victories. Shelley had the temper of an innovator and a martyr; and in an
                    intellect wondrously poetical he united speculative keenness and humanitarian
                    zeal in a degree for which we might vainly seek his precursor. We have already
                    named ideality as one of his leading excellences. This Shelleian quality
                    combines, as its constituents, sublimity, beauty, and the abstract passion for
                    good. It should be acknowledged that, while this great quality forms the chief
                    and most admirable factor in Shelley’s poetry, the defects which go along with
                    it mar his work too often—producing at times vagueness, unreality, and a pomp of
                    glittering indistinctness, in which excess of sentiment welters amid excess of
                    words. This blemish affects the long poems much more than the pure lyrics; in
                    the latter the rapture, the music, and the emotion are in exquisite balance, and
                    the work has often as much of delicate simplicity as of fragile and flower-like
                    perfection.</p>
                <p>In the course of our biographical narrative we have mentioned a few, but only a
                    few, of Shelley’s writings; we must now give some curt account of others. Of his
                    early work prior to <hi rend="italic">Queen Mab—</hi> such romances as <hi
                    rend="italic">Zastrozzi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">St lrvyne,</hi> such verse as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Fragments of Margaret Nicholson—</hi> we can only here say
                    that they are rubbish. <hi rend="italic">Alastor</hi> was succeeded (1817) by
                    <hi rend="italic">The Revolt of Islam,</hi> a poem of no common length in the
                    Spenserian stanza, preaching bloodless revolution; it is amazingly fine in
                    parts, but as a whole somewhat long-drawn and exhausting. This transcendental
                    epic (for such it may be termed) was at first named <hi rend="italic">Laon and
                    Cythna, or the Revolution of the Golden City,</hi> and the lovers of the story
                    were then brother and sister as well as lovers—an experiment upon British
                    endurance which the publishers would not connive at. The year 1818 produced <hi
                    rend="italic">Rosalind and Helen,</hi> a comparatively weak poem, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Julian and Maddalo,</hi> a very strong one—demonstrating in
                    Shelley a singular power of seeing ordinary things with directness, and at once
                    figuring them as reality and transfiguring them into poetry. The next year,
                    1819, was his culmination, producing as it did the grand tragedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Cenci</hi> and the sublime ideal drama <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prometheus Unbound,</hi> which we have no hesitation in calling his
                    masterpiece. It embodies, in forms of surpassing imagination and beauty,
                    Shelley’s deepest and most daring conceptions. Prometheus, the human mind, has
                    invested with the powers proper to himself Jupiter the god of heaven, who
                    thereupon chains and torments Prometheus and oppresses mankind; in other words,
                    the anthropomorphic god of religion is a creation of the human mind, and both
                    the mind of man and man himself are enslaved as long as this god exercises his
                    delegated but now absolute power. Prometheus, who is from of old wedded to Asia,
                    or Nature, protests against and anathematizes the usurper enthroned by himself.
                    At last the anathema takes effect. Eternity, Demogorgon, dismisses Jupiter to
                    unending nothingness. Prometheus is at once unbound, the human mind is free; he
                    is reunited to his spouse Nature, and the world of man passes from thraldom and
                    its degradation into limitless progression, or (as the phrase goes)
                    perfectibility, moral and material. This we regard as in brief the argument of
                    <hi rend="italic">Prometheus Unbound.</hi> It is closely analogous to the
                    argument of the juvenile poem <hi rend="italic">Queen Mab,</hi> but so raised in
                    form and creative touch that, whereas to write <hi rend="italic">Queen Mab</hi>
                    was only to be an ambitious and ebullient tyro, to invent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prometheus Unbound</hi> was to be the poet of the future. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Witch of Atlas</hi> (1820) appears to us the most perfect work among all
                    Shelley’s longer poems, though it is neither the deepest nor the most
                    interesting. It may be rated as a pure exercise of roving imagination—guided,
                    however, by an intense sense of beauty, and by its author’s exceeding fineness
                    of nature.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n819/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0819-0794"/> The poem has often been decried as practically
                    unmeaning; we do not subscribe to this opinion. The “witch” of this subtle and
                    magical invention seems to represent that faculty which we term “the fancy”;
                    using this assumption as a clue, we find plenty of meaning in the poem, but
                    necessarily it is fanciful or volatile meaning. The elegy on Keats, <hi
                    rend="italic">Adonais,</hi> followed in 1821; the <hi rend="italic">Triumph of
                    Life,</hi> a mystical and most impressive allegory, constructed upon lines
                    marked out by Dante and by Petrarch, was occupying the poet up to the time of
                    his death. The stately fragment which remains is probably but a small portion of
                    the projected whole. The translations—chiefly from Homer, Euripides, Calderon,
                    and Goethe—date from 1819 to 1822, and testify to the poetic endowment of
                    Shelley not less absolutely than his own original compositions. From this list
                    it will be readily seen that Shelley was not only a prolific but also a
                    versatile poet. Works so various in faculty and in form as <hi rend="italic">The
                    Revolt of Islam, Julian and Maddalo, The Cenci, Prometheus Unbound,
                    Eρipsychidion,</hi> and the grotesque effusions of which <hi rend="italic">Peter
                    Bell the Third</hi> is the prime example, added to the consummate array of
                    lyrics, have seldom to be credited to a single writer—one, moreover, who died
                    before he was thirty years of age. In prose Shelley could be as admirable as in
                    poetry; of late years it has even been pretended—but we regard this proposition
                    as worthy of summary rejection—that his best and most enduring work is in the
                    prose form. His letters to Thomas Love Peacock and others, and his uncompleted
                    <hi rend="italic">Defence of Poetry,</hi> are the chief monuments of his mastery
                    in prose; and certainly no more beautiful prose—having much of the spirit and
                    the aroma of poetry, yet without being distorted out of its proper essence—is to
                    be found in the English language.</p>
                <p>The chief original authorities for the life of Shelley (apart from his own
                    writings, which contain a good deal of autobiography, if heedfully sifted and
                    collated) are—(1) the notices by Mrs Shelley interspersed in her edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>; (2) Hogg's amusing, discerning, and authentic,
                    although in some respects exaggerated, book; (3) Trelawny'β <hi rend="italic"
                    >Records;</hi> (4) the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> by Medwin; and (5) the
                    articles written by Peacock. Some other writers, especially Leigh Hunt, might be
                    mentioned, but they come less close to the facts. Among biographical works
                    produced since Shelley’s death, by authors who did not know him personally, much
                    the largest is <hi rend="italic">The Real Shelley,</hi> by J. C. Jeaffrcson
                    (1885); it is controversial in method und decidedly hostile in tendency, and
                    tries a man of genius by tests far from well adapted (in our opinion) to bring
                    out a right result; it contains, however, an ample share of solid information
                    and sharp disquisition. The memoir by W. M. Rossetti, prefixed to an edition of
                    Shelley’s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> in two forms of publication, 1870 and
                    1878, was an endeavour to formulate in brief space, out of the then confused and
                    conflicting records, an accurate account of Shelley—admiring, but not uncandidly
                    one-sided. There is valuable material in Lady Shelley's <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shelley Memorials,</hi> and in Dr Garnett’s <hi rend="italic">Relics of
                    Shelley</hi>; and the memoir written by Mr Symonds, in the scries <hi
                    rend="italic">English Men of Letters,</hi> is very agreeably and skilfully done.
                    While we write (November 1885) Prof. Dowden is engaged upon a life of Shelley,
                    which may be expected to distance all its predecessors in authority and
                    completeness. (W. M. R.)</p>
