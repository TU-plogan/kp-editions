                    Scrofula may be either inherited or acquired. Heredity is of all causes the most
                    potent, and naturally operates with greater certainty where both parents possess
                    the taint. As in all hereditary diseases, however, the liability may be scarcely
                    perceptible for one or two generations, but may then reappear. Other causes
                    referable to parentage may readily produce this constitutional state in
                    children, as weakness or ill health in one or both parents, and, as seems
                    probable, marriages of consanguinity. But, apart altogether from hereditary or
                    congenital influences, the scrofulous habit is frequently developed, especially
                    in the young, by such unfavourable hygienic conditions as result from
                    overcrowded, cold, and dark dwellings, insufficient and improper food, exposure,
                    and debauchery. Even among the old in such circumstances the evidences of
                    scrofula may be seen to present themselves where before they had been
                    absent.</p>
                <p>There are two well-marked types of the scrofulous constitution to be often
                    observed, especially among the young. In the one the chief features are a fair
                    complexion with delicate thin skin, blue eyes, dilated pupils, long eyelashes,
                    soft muscles, and activity of the circulatory and nervous system; while in the
                    other the skin is dark, the features heavy, the figure stunted, and all the
                    functions, physical and mental, inactive. In many instances, however, it will be
                    found that both types are more or less mixed together in one individual. The
                    manifestations of scrofula generally appear in early life, and are often
                    exhibited in young children during the first dentition by inflammatory skin
                    eruptions of obstinate character on the face and other parts; later on in youth
                    there appear glandular swellings either externally, as on the neck, or affecting
                    the gland structures of the chest or abdomen, while at the same time mucous
                    membranes and bones may become implicated. The distinctive features of the
                    scrofulous inflammatory affections are their tendency to chronicity and to
                    suppurative and degenerative changes, the affected parts either healing slowly
                    with resulting disfigurement, as on the neck, or continuing to retain traces of
                    the products of the diseased action, which may set up serious disturbance of the
                    health at some future time. Further, the scrofulous constitution always
                    influences the duration and progress of any disease from which the individual
                    may suffer, as well as its results. Thus in pneumonia, to which the scrofulous
                    would seem to be specially liable, the products of the inflammation are not
                    readily absorbed as in previously healthy persons, but, remaining in the
                    lung-tissues, are apt to undergo caseous degenerative changes, which may issue
                    in phthisis (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pneumonia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Phthisis).</hi> The connexion of scrofula with tubercle is pointed out in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pathology</hi><hi rend="italic">(loc.
                    cit.).</hi></p>
                <p>Scrofula may under favourable circumstances tend to improvement as age advances,
                    and it occasionally happens that persons who in early life showed unmistakable
                    evidences of this condition appear ultimately to outgrow it, and become in all
                    respects healthy and vigorous. The treatment is essentially similar to that
                    described for rickets or phthisis, and is partly preventive and partly curative.
                    It consists mainly in hygienic measures to promote the health and nutrition of
                    the young, and of suitable diet, tonics, &amp;c., where evidences of the disease
                    have declared themselves. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Rickets, Phthisis.</hi></p>
