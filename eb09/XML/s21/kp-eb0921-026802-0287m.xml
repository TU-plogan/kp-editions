                    >Salvador</hi></label><hi rend="italic">(República del Salvador),</hi> the
                    smallest but most densely peopled of the republics of Central America, has a
                    coast-line of 160 miles along the Pacific from the mouth of Rio de la Paz to
                    that of the Goascoran in the Gulf of Fonseca, and is bounded inland by Guatemala
                    on the west and Honduras on the north and east. Its length from east to west is
                    140 miles, and its average breadth about 60 miles. Its area is estimated at 7225
                    square miles, and in 1883 it contained 613,273 inhabitants (290,870 males,
                    322,403 females). With the exception of a comparatively narrow seaboard of low
                    alluvial plains, the country consists mainly of a plateau about 2000 feet above
                    the sea, broken by a large number of volcanic cones, geologically of more recent
                    origin than the main chain of the Cordillera which lies farther to the north.
                    The principal river of the republic is the Rio Lempa, which, rising near
                    Esquipulas in Guatemala and crossing a corner of Honduras, enters Salvador north
                    of Citalá. After receiving from the right the surplus waters of the Laguna de
                    Cuija, a vast lake belonging partly to Guatemala and partly to Salvador, it
                    flows for nearly a degree of longitude eastward through a magnificent and
                    luxuriant valley between the plateau and the Cordillera, and then turning
                    somewhat abruptly south skirts the base of the volcano of Siguatepeque and
                    reaches the Pacific in 88 40 W. long. Among its numerous tributaries are the Rio
                    Santa Ana, rising near the city of that name, the Asalguate, which passes the
                    capital San Salvador, the Sumpul, which forces its way like the Lempa itself
                    athwart the mountains from Honduras, and the Torola, draining the north-eastern
                    corner of Salvador and part of Honduras. The Lempa is even in the dry season a
                    considerable river with a rapid current, and for two-thirds of its course it
                    could easily be made navigable for steamers. The Rio San Miguel drains the
                    country between the Gulf of Fonseca and the basin of the Lempa. The volcanic
                    mountains do not form a chain but a series of clusters :—the Izalco group in the
                    west—including Izalco (formed in 1770), Marcelino, Santa Ana, Naranjos, Aguila,
                    San Juan de Dios, Apaneca, Tamajaso, and Lagunita; the San Salvador group, about
                    30 miles to the east; Cojutepeque to the north-east and the San Vicente group to
                    the east of the great volcanic lake of Ilopango; the Siguatepeque summits to the
                    north-east of San Vicente; and the great south-eastern or San Miguel group—San
                    Miguel, Chinameca, Buenapa, Usulatan, Tecapa, Taburete. Cacaguateque and
                    Sociedad volcanoes in the north-east belong to the inland Cordillera.</p>
                <p>The volcanic forces in Salvador have not as yet spent themselves. The Izalco vent
                    still acts as a safety valve, and the neighbourhood of the capital is so subject
                    to tremblings and rockings of the earth as to have acquired the name of the
                    swinging mat or hammock. The city itself has been destroyed by earthquake in
                    1594, 1658, in 1719, and in 1854. San Miguel is described as one of the most
                    treacherous burning mountains in America, sometimes several years in complete
                    repose and then all at once bursting out with terrific fury (Scherzer). In
                    1879-1880 the Lake of Ilopango was the scene of a remarkable series of
                    phenomena. With a length of 5½ miles and a breadth of 4½ , it forms a rough
                    parallelogram with deeply indented sides, and is surrounded in all directions by
                    steep mountains except at the points where the villages of Asino and Apulo
                    occupy little patches of level ground. Between 31st December 1879 and 11th
                    January 1880 the lake rose four feet above its level. The Jiboa, which flows out
                    at the south-east corner, became, instead of a very shallow stream 20 feet
                    broad, a raging torrent which soon scooped out for itself in the volcanic rocks
                    a channel 30 to 35 feet deep. A rapid subsidence of the lake was thus produced,
                    and by the 6th of March the level was 34 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> feet below its maximum. Towards the centre of the lake
                    a volcanic centre about 500 feet in diameter rose 150 feet above the water,
                    surrounded by a number of small islands. A number of villages were ruined by the
                    accompanying earthquakes. The lake, originally stocked by the early Spanish
                    settlers, had become the great fish-pond of the republic. Οn the outbreak of the
                    volcanic forces, the fish fled towards the sides, and on the receding of the
                    waters their dead bodies were left behind in such quantities that at Asino
                    several hundred men were employed for days burying them to avoid a
                    pestilence.</p>
                <p>It is less to these natural catastrophes than to political instability that the
                    comparative backwardness of Salvador to develop its resources of soil and
                    minerals must be ascribed; and considerable progress has in many respects been
                    made since the middle of the century. Coffee is now the principal export (to the
                    value of $1,056,000 in 1873, $3,416,104 in 1883). Indigo, for a long time the
                    staple of the country and exported to the annual value of $20,000,000, is still
                    extensively cultivated (exports in 1883 $1,812,594). As this indigo is generally
                    quoted in the market as Guatemalan, so another valuable product of Salvador is
                    always designated Balsam of Peru (see vol. iii. p. 293), though the tree from
                    which it is obtained grows naturally nowhere else in the world except in a
                    limited part of the Salvadorian seaboard known as the Balsam coast. It was
                    exported in 1883 to the value of $53,612. other productions of less importance
                    are tobacco, sarsaparilla, india-rubber, and sugar. The silver mines have been
                    and may again be of some account; and coal has been discovered inland. Οn the
                    whole the trade of the country has greatly increased: the imports and exports,
                    $1,306,378 and $1,991,650 respectively in 1859, were $2,401,463 and $5,861,053
                    in 1883. At the time of Dr Scherzer’s visit, there was not a bridge in the
                    country; there are now a considerable number of good iron bridges on the new’
                    roads between the principal cities. The first railway, that from Acajutla to
                    Sonsonate (15 miles) was opened in 1882, and has since been continued in the
                    direction of Santa Ana, the chief commercial town. Telegraphic communication has
                    been established between the more important towns, and in July 1882 the Central
                    and North American Company landed its cable at La Libertad. Acajutla, La
                    Libertad, and La Union or San Carlos de la Union (in the Gulf of Fonseca) are
                    the principal harbours. Besides the capital San Salvador, with 14,059
                    inhabitants, there were in 1878, according to the census, 68 places in the
                    republic with over 2000 each—Santa Ana (29,908), Nahuizalco (9988), San Vicente
                    (9957), San Miguel (9842), Metapan (9782), Chalchuapa (8171), Ahuachapan (7930),
                    Nuevo San Salvador (7337), &amp;c. There are three universities—San Salvador,
                    Santa Ana, and San Miguel, with funds partly provided by a quarter of the
                    customs,— a girls’ college at Santa Ana, and a fair number of secondary and
                    primary schools. Salvador received this name from Pedro Alvaredo, who, when he
                    conquered it for Spain in 1525-26, found it a rich and populous country. Its
                    independence of the Spanish<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0288-0269"/> crown dates from 1842; in 1853 it obtained the
                    constitution under which (in a modified form) it now exists as a sovereign
                    state. General Barrios, having in 1858 obliged the president Santin del Castillo
                    to abdicate, secured his own permanent appointment to the office in 1860; but in
                    1863-4 he failed in his endeavour to defend his capital against the Guatemalans,
                    and when he returned in 1864 to attack Duenas, the Guatemalan protégé, he was
                    defeated and put to death. “Pronunciamientos” have since been the too general
                    preliminaries of presidential elections; but there has been no serious war, and
                    the finances of the republic have usually a balance on the right side.</p>
