                    present; thus Tertullian (<hi rend="italic">Ad Mart.,</hi> 3) writes, “We were
                    called to the warfare of the living God in our very response to the sacramental
                    words [in baptism] ”; but the main import of the word has entirely changed, it
                    being used simply as the equivalent of the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >μυστήριον</hi>. Thus even in the Vulgate we still have the “sacrament of
                    godliness” (1 Tim. iii. 16), “of the seven stars” (Rev. i. 20), “of the woman
                    and the beast” (Rev. xvii. 7); but in earlier Latin versions the word also
                    occurred in numerous other places where “mysterium” is now found <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Rom. xvi. 25; 1 Cor. xiii. 2). In addition to its
                    general sense the word <hi rend="italic">μυστηριον</hi> not unnaturally soon
                    came to have for Christians a more special meaning as denoting those external
                    rites of their religion, solemn, instructive, and more or less secret, which had
                    most analogy with the MYSTERIES (<hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> of paganism. No
                    attempt, however, was at first made to enumerate or to define these. Tertullian
                    speaks of the sacrament of baptism and the Eucharist, Cyprian of “either
                    sacrament,” meaning baptism and confirmation, and many others, following Eph. v.
                    22 (see Vulgate), of the sacrament of marriage, but all with the utmost
                    vagueness. Augustine’s definition of the word was little more explicit, but for
                    centuries it was all the Western Church had, and for even a longer period it
                    continued to be a sufficiently adequate expression of the Oriental view also.
                    According to him a sacrament is “the visible form of invisible grace,” or “a
                    sign of a sacred thing.” The sacraments he principally has in view are those of
                    baptism and the Lord’s Supper, but 'with so wide a definition there was nothing
                    to prevent him from using the word (as he freely does) in many other
                    applications. The old Sacramentaries or liturgical books, which can in some
                    cases be carried back as far as to the 8th century, in like manner contain
                    prayers and benedictions, not only for the administration of the Eucharist and
                    of baptism, but also for a variety of other rites, such as the blessing of holy
                    water and the dedication of churches. In the <hi rend="italic">De socramentis
                    Christianae fidei</hi> of Hugh of St<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n149/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0149-0132"/> Victor (d. 1141), no fewer than thirty sacraments
                    are enumerated, divided into three classes, baptism and the Lord’s Supper
                    occupying a first place. What proved to be an important new departure was taken
                    by Peter Lombard (d. 1164), in the 4th book of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sentences,</hi> which treats “of sacraments and sacramental signs.” There for
                    the first time are enumerated the seven sacraments (baptism, confirmation, the
                    Eucharist, penance, extreme unction, order, matrimony), which were afterwards
                    formally recognized by the Church of Rome at the councils of Florence (1439) and
                    of Trent; and there also for the first time it was expressly recognized that not
                    all signs of sacred things can be regarded as sacraments, but only those which
                    are the form of invisible grace in such a sense as to represent it and bring it
                    about (“ut ipsius imaginent gerat et causa existat”). This “differentia” of the
                    sacrament, properly so called, became the basis of all subsequent scholastic
                    discussion and authoritative decree in the Western church, and even, though of
                    course indirectly, in the Eastern also. The main points in the Tridentine
                    doctrine are these: the sacraments have the power of conferring grace <hi
                    rend="italic">ex opere operato</hi> on the recipients who do not resist it (“non
                    ponentibus obicem”); for their validity, however, there must be in the minister
                    the intention of doing that which the church does. Though all are in a sense
                    necessary, they are not so with equal directness for each individual, nor are
                    they alike in dignity. The two principal sacraments are baptism and the Lord’s
                    Supper. All were instituted by Christ. Three of them (baptism, confirmation,
                    order) impart an indelible “character,” and therefore cannot be repeated. For
                    the teaching of the Greek Church compare vol. xi. pp. 158, 159. Tho churches of
                    the Reformation, while retaining the current doctrine that sacraments were
                    “effectual signs of grace and God’s good will” “ordained by Christ,” reduced
                    their number to two, the remaining five being excluded partly because direct
                    evidence of their institution by Christ was wanting, and partly because “they
                    have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.” For further details on
                    the individual sacraments the reader is referred to the separate articles <hi
