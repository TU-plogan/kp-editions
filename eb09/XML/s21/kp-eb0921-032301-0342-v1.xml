                    (1682-1739), mathematician, was born at Thurlstone, Yorkshire, in January 1682.
                    When about a year old he lost his sight through smallpox; but this did not
                    prevent him from acquiring, by the help of kind friends, a good knowledge of
                    Latin and Greek, and pursuing with assiduity and success the study of
                    mathematics. In his twenty-fifth year he commenced lecturing in Cambridge on the
                    principles of the Newtonian philosophy, and, though he was not a member of any
                    of the colleges, the university authorities placed no impediment in his way. In
                    November 1711 he was selected to succeed Whiston, the Lucasian professor of
                    mathematics in Cambridge, after having had the degree of master of arts
                    conferred upon him to render him eligible for the appointment. He was created
                    doctor of laws in 1728 by command of George IL, and in 1736 was admitted a
                    member of the Royal Society. He died of scurvy on the 19th of April 1739.</p>
                <p>Saunderson possessed the friendship of many of the eminent mathematicians of the
                    time, such as Newton, Halley, De Moivre, Cotes, and for the first of these he
                    entertained a profound veneration. Whether from an inflexible love of truth, or
                    from a motive less exalted, he was accustomed to speak his sentiments regarding
                    persons very freely, and friends as well as enemies were criticized without
                    reserve. As is frequently the case with the blind, his senses of hearing and
                    touch were extraordinarily acute, and he could carry on mentally long and
                    intricate arithmetical or algebraical calculations. He devised for his own use a
                    palpable arithmetic, an account of which is given in his elaborate <hi
                        rend="italic">Elements of Algebra</hi> (2 vols. 4 to, Cambridge, 1740),
                    which he did not live to publish. Of his other writings, prepared for the use of
                    his pupils, the only one which has been published is <hi rend="italic">The
                        Method of Fluxions</hi> (1 vol. 8vo, London, 1756). At the end of this
