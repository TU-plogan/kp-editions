                    of several surviving links between the firs and the cypresses. The two species
                    usually placed in this group are evergreen trees of large size, indigenous to
                    the west coast of North America. Both bear their round or ovoid male catkins at
                    the ends of the slender terminal branchlets; the ovoid cones, either terminal or
                    on short lateral twigs, have thick woody scales dilated at the extremity, with a
                    broad disk depressed in the centre and usually furnished with a short spine; at
                    the base of the scales are from three to seven ovules, which become reversed or
                    partially so by compression, ripening into small angular seeds with a narrow
                    wing-like expansion.</p>
                <p>The redwood of the Californian woodsmen, <hi rend="italic">S</hi>. <hi
                    rend="italic">sempervirens,</hi> which may be regarded as the typical form,
                    abounds on the Coast Range from the southern borders of the State northwards
                    into Oregon, and, according to De Candolle, as far as Nootka Sound. It grows to
                    a gigantic size: a trunk has been recorded 270 feet in length, and a greater
                    height is said to be occasionally reached, while a diameter of from 12 to 15
                    feet is sometimes attained at the base. In old age the huge columnar trunk rises
                    to a great height bare of boughs, while on the upper part the branches are short
                    and irregular. The bark is red, like that of the Scotch fir, deeply furrowed,
                    with the ridges often much curved and twisted. When young the tree is one of the
                    most graceful of the conifers: the stem rises straight and tapering, with
                    somewhat irregular whorls of drooping branches, the lower ones sweeping the
                    ground,—giving an elegant conical outline. The twigs are densely clothed with
                    flat spreading linear leaves of a fine glossy green above and glaucous beneath;
                    in the old trees they become shorter and more rigid and partly lose their
                    distichous habit. The globular brown catkins appear early in June; the cones,
                    from 1 to 2 inches long, are at first of a bluish green colour, but when mature
                    change to a reddish brown; the scales are very small at the base, dilating into
                    a broad thick head, with a short curved spine below the deep transverse
                    depression. The redwood forms woods of large extent on the seaward slope of the
                    Coast Range and occurs in isolated groups farther inland. From the great size of
                    the trunk and the even grain of the red cedar-like wood it is a valuable tree to
                    the farmer and carpenter: it splits readily and evenly, and planes and polishes
                    well; cut radially, the medullary plates give the wood a fine satiny-lustre; it
                    is strong and durable, but not so elastic as many of the western pines and firs.
                    In England the tree grows well in warm situations, but suffers much in severe
                    winters, —its graceful form rendering it ornamental in the park or garden, where
                    it sometimes grows 30 or 40 feet in height; its success as a timber tree would
                    be doubtful. In the eastern parts of the United States it does not flourish.
                    Discovered by Menzies in the end of the 18th century, it has long been known in
                    British nurseries under the name of <hi rend="italic">Taxodium
                    sempervirens.</hi></p>
                <p>The only other member of the genus is the giant tree of the Sierra Nevada, <hi
                    rend="italic">S. gigantea,</hi> the largest of known conifers; it is confined to
                    the western portion of the great Californian range, occurring chiefly in
                    detached groups<pb break="no"

                    4000 to 5000 feet above the sea. The leaves of this species are awl-shaped,
                    short and rigid, with pointed apex; closely adpressed, they completely cover the
                    branchlets. The male catkins are small, solitary, and are borne at the ends of
                    the twigs; the cones are from 1 1/2 to 3 inches long, ovoid, with scales thicker
                    at the base than those of the redwood, and bearing below the depression a
                    slender prickle. The young tree is more formal and rigid in growth than <hi
                    rend="italic">S. sempervirens,</hi> but when old the outline of the head becomes
                    cylindrical, with short branches sparsely clad with foliage sprays. The bark, of
                    nearly the same tint as that of the redwood, is extremely thick and is
                    channelled towards the base with vertical furrows; at the root the ridges often
                    stand out in buttress-like projections. Some of these vast vegetable columns are
                    upwards of 30 feet in diameter and a few have attained a height of 400 feet or
                    more.</p>
                <p>The famous group known as the Mammoth Grove of Calaveras in California,
                    containing above ninety large trees, stands in 38° N. lat., about 4370 feet
                    above the sea, between the San Antonio and Stanislaus rivers. According to
                    Vischer, it was discovered by a hunter in pursuit of a bear in 1852, but had
                    apparently been visited before, as the date 1850 is cut on one of the trees. The
                    bark of one of the finest trunks was foolishly stripped off to the height of 116
                    feet, and exhibited in New York and London; it now stands in the Crystal Palace,
                    Sydenham. The tree, known as the “mother of the forest,” soon died; at the base
                    it measured 90 feet in girth, and the dead tree was 321 feet high; a prostrate
                    trunk in the neighbourhood is 18 feet in diameter 300 feet from the base. Some
                    trees in the Mariposa grove rival these in size: one measures 101 feet round the
                    root, and a cut stump is 31 feet in diameter. Gigantic as these trees are and
                    imposing from their vast columnar trunks, they have little beauty, owing to the
                    scanty foliage of the short rounded boughs; some of the trees stand very close
                    together; they are said to be about 400 in number. Some are of vast age, perhaps
                    3000 years or more; they appear to bo the remains of extensive woods belonging
                    to a past epoch, and probably have been in distant time much injured by forest
                    fires. The growth of the “mammoth tree” is fast when young, but old trees
                    increase with extreme slowness. The timber is not of great value, but the
                    heartwood is dense and of deeper colour than that of <hi rend="italic">S.
                    sempervirens,</hi> varying from brownish red to very deep brown; oiled and
                    varnished, it has been used in cabinet work. <hi rend="italic">S. gigantea</hi>
                    was brought to England by Lobb in 1853, and received from Dr Lindley the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Wellingtonia,</hi> by which it is still popularly known,
                    though its affinity to the redwood is too marked to admit of generic
                    distinction. In America it is sometimes called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Washing-tonia.</hi> In the Atlantic States it does not succeed; and, though
                    nearly hardy in Great Britain, it is planted only as an ornament of the lawn or
                    paddock. It is never likely to acquire any economic importance in Europe. (C. P.
