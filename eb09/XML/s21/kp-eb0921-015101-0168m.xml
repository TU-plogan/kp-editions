                    and 30° 21' N. lat., and between 77° 9' and 78° 15' E. long., and is bounded on
                    the N. by the Siwálik Hills, separating it from the district of Dehra Dún, on
                    the S. by the district of Muzaffarnagar, on the E. by the Ganges, and on the W.
                    by the Jumna. Saháranpur forms the most northerly portion of the Doáb, or
                    alluvial tableland, which stretches between the valleys of the Ganges and the
                    Jumna. The Siwálik Hills rise precipitously on its northern frontier; at their
                    base stretches a wild submontane tract, with much forest and jungle. Cultivation
                    generally in this part is backward, the surface of the country being broken by
                    wild and magnificent ravines. South of this tract, flanked on the east and west
                    by broad alluvial plains, lies the Doáb, with fertile soil and good natural
                    water-supply. This portion of the country is divided into parallel tracts<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n169/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0169-0152"/> by numerous streams from the Siwáliks, while the
                    Eastern Jumna and the Ganges Canals, which traverse the district from north to
                    south and issue from its north-west and north-east corners, cover the district
                    with a network of irrigation channels. The only large rivers are the Ganges,
                    which enters Saháranpur 180 miles from its source, by a well-marked gorge formed
                    in the rock at Hardwár; and the Jumna, which debouches into the plain about 123
                    miles from its source, at a place called Khára. The district has abundant means
                    of communication: the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway traverses it for a
                    distance of 42 miles, with stations at Deoband, Saháranpur, and Sarsáwa; and it
                    has numerous roads, both metalled and unmetalled. The climate of Saháranpur is
                    that of the North-Western Provinces in general; at one season it is tropical, at
                    another partially European. Its average annual rainfall is about 37 inches. Wild
                    animals are plentiful, including the tiger, leopard, wild cat, lynx, hyaena, and
                    wolf.</p>
                <p>By the census of 1881 the population of Saháranpur numbered 979,544 (530,427
                    males and 449,117 females). By religion there were 653,272 Hindus, 317,535
                    Mohammedans, and 1793 Christians. Five towns had populations exceeding 10,000
                    each, namely, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sahár-anpur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.),</hi> Hardwár Union (28,106), Deoband (22,116), Rurki (12,818), and
                    Gangoh (12,089). Rurki (Roorkee) is a town of considerable importance, situated
                    in 29° 52' 25" N. lat. and 77° 55' 40" E. long. It is the headquarters of the
                    Ganges Canal workshops and iron-foundry, with the Thomason Civil Engineering
                    College, for the instruction of natives and others in practical engineering; it
                    contains also an excellent meteorological observatory. Hardwar municipality,
                    which lies 39 miles north-east of Saháranpur town, on the right bank of the
                    Ganges, is the most frequented of all Hindu places of pilgrimage, and is largely
                    used for the bathing festivals. Every twelfth year, when Jupiter is in Aquarius,
                    a great fair or <hi rend="italic">kumbh-mela</hi> is held, which attracts an
                    immense number of people; as many as 3,000,000 attended in 1882.</p>
                <p>Of a total area of 2221 square miles 1256 are cultivated and 331 are cultivable
                    waste. Cereals form the principal products. The chief spring crops are wheat,
                    barley, pulses, and oil-seeds, and the staples of the rain crops arc rice, joar,
                    bajra, and vegetables; the cultivation of cotton and indigo is also carried on,
                    the latter in much greater quantities since the introduction of canal irrigation
                    has rendered its out-turn less precarious than formerly. The commercial
                    importance of the district depends mostly on its raw materials. It manufactures
                    broad-cloth, jewellery, and sweetmeats; among the articles produced at the Rurki
                    workshops are steam-engines, pumps, printing presses, lathes, and mathematical
                    instruments. The gross revenue of Saharanpur in 1883-84 amounted to £172,960, of
                    which the land-tax contributed £118,067.</p>
                <p>During the later years of the Mogul empire Saharanpur was the scene of much
                    strife and suffering on account of the perpetual raids of the Sikhs, but in 1785
                    the district under Ghulam Kádir enjoyed comparative tranquillity. On his death
                    the country fell into the hands of the Mahrattas, but it was for a time occupied
                    by the adventurer George Thomas, until his death in 1802. It was afterwards
                    overrun by Sikhs and Mahrattas, remaining practically in the hands of the former
                    until their final defeat in November 1804, when it passed under British rule.
                    Several disturbances subsequently took place among the native chiefs; but from
                    1824 to 1857 nothing occurred to disturb the peace of the district. The mutiny
                    in this part was soon quelled.</p>
