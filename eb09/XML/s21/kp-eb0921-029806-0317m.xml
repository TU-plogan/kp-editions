                    elevated heights of Cuesta del Prado, 115 miles east of Valparaiso by rail. In
                    the centre of the city rises the rocky hill of Santa Lucia, with its two
                    fortresses,—recently converted into a pleasureground, with theatres,
                    restaurants, and monuments; and immediately to the north-north-west and
                    north-east are those known as Colina, Renca, and San Cristóbal. The snow-clad
                    range of the Andes, in which the summits of La Chapa and Los Amarillos are
                    conspicuous, is visible from Santiago. A turbid mountain stream, the Mapocho,
                    flows west through the heart of the city to join the Colina and ultimately the
                    Maipú or Maipo; its floods were sometimes, as in 1609 and 1783, the cause of
                    great damage till the construction of a solid embankment was undertaken<pb

                    now crossed by several handsome bridges, the oldest of which, a structure of
                    eleven arches, dates from 1767-1779. From the very first Santiago was laid out
                    with great regularity in parallelograms; but owing to the frequency of
                    earthquakes the dwelling-houses are seldom built of more than a single story in
                    height. The cathedral, situated in the Plaza de la Independencia, is the oldest
                    of the churches. Originally erected by Pedro Valdivia and rebuilt by Garcia
                    Hurtado de Mendoza, it was destroyed by the earthquake of 1647 and rebuilt on a
                    new plan subsequent to 1748. It is 351 feet long by 92 feet wide, but has no
                    very striking features. Among the other ecclesiastical buildings are the church
                    of San Agustin, erected in 1595 by Cristóbal de Vera and in modern times adorned
                    with a pillared portico; the churches of San Francisco, La Merced, and Santo
                    Domingo, dating from the 18th century; the Augustine nunnery founded by Bishop
                    Medellin in 1576; the Carmen Alto, or church of the Carmelite nunnery, an
                    elegant little Gothic building; the stately church of the Reformed Dominicans,
                    rich in marble monolithic columns; and the chapel erected in 1852 to the memory
                    of Pedro Valdivia next to the house in which he is reputed to have lived. The
                    public cemetery, recently secularized, has a large number of marble and bronze
                    monuments,—mostly from Italy. Among the secular buildings the more noteworthy
                    are the palace of the intendency, the old presidential palace (popularly Las
                    Cajas), the congress buildings, the mint, the palace of justice, the municipal
                    theatre. The present university of Santiago dates from 1842,—the older
                    Universidad de San Felipe, which had been established in 1747, having been
                    closed in 1839. It occupies a fine building in the Alameda, and alongside stands
                    the great National Institute of Secondary Education. In 1882 the university was
                    attended by 920 students and the institute by 1059. The city also contains a
                    school of arts and trades (1849), a musical conservatorio (1849), a national
                    museum, a military school established in 1842 and enlarged on the abolition of
                    the naval military school at Valparaiso in 1872 (now re-established), and a
                    school of agriculture founded by the Agricultural Society chartered in 1869. The
                    National Library is a noble collection of books dating from 1813, especially
                    rich in works relating to America; there is also a good library in the National
                    Institute. Besides the official journal, Santiago has four daily papers, as well
                    as various reviews and other serials. Besides the Alameda, a great tree-planted
                    avenue decorated with statues (the Abbé Molina, Generals San Martin, Carrera,
                    O’Higgins, and Freire, &amp;c.), the principal open spaces in Santiago are the
                    Plaza de la Independencia, the Canadilla, a broad tree-bordered avenue, the
                    Alameda de Yungay, the Campo de Marte (where are the Penitentiary, a prison
                    built and administered according to the most approved modern principles, and the
                    large Artillery Park), the Quinta Normal de Agricultura, which comprises
                    zoological and botanical gardens, and the large area in which the International
                    Exhibition of 1875 was held. As the Mapocho was unfit for drinking, water was
                    introduced about 1865 by an aqueduct 5 miles long. The prevailing winds at
                    Santiago are from the south and south-west. On an average rain falls for 216
                    hours in the course of the year, mostly between May and September. Snow and hail
                    are both extremely rare. Earthquakes are so frequent that as many as
                    twenty-seven or thirty shocks are sometimes registered in a year. Those which
                    have proved really disastrous are the earthquakes of 17th March 1575, 13th May
                    1647, 8th July 1730, 19th November 1822, and 20th February 1835. The population
                    of Santiago, which was returned in 1865 as 168,553 (79,920 males and 88,633
                    females), had increased to 200,000 in 1883.</p>
                <p>It was in February 1511 that Pedro de Valdivia, one of Pizarro’s captains,
                    founded the city of Santiago del Nuevo Estremo in accordance with a vow he had
                    made at Cuzco. The place has all along held an important position in Chilian
                    history, but perhaps none of the events with which it is associated sent such a
                    sensation through the world as the burning of the Jesuit church with the loss of
                    more than two thousand lives in the flames (8th December 1863).</p>
