                    together with Judges, are made up of a series of extracts and abstracts from
                    various sources worked over from time to time by successive editors, and freely
                    handled by copyists down to a comparatively late date, as the variations between
                    the Hebrew text and the Septuagint show. The main redaction of Judges and Kings
                    has plainly been made under the influence of the ideas of the book of
                    Deuteronomy, and it was in connexion with this redaction that the history from
                    the accession of Solomon onwards was marked off as a separate book (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Kings).</hi> In Samuel the Deuteronomistic hand is much less
                    prominent, but in 1 Sam. vii. 2-4, and in the speech of Samuel, ch. xii., its
                    characteristic pragmatism is clearly recognizable; the nature of the old
                    narrative did not invite frequent insertions of this kind throughout the story.
                    So, too, the chronological system which runs through Judges and Kings is not
                    completely carried out in Samuel, though its influence can be traced (1 Sam. iv.
                    18, vii. 2, xiii. 1 <hi rend="italic">sq</hi>., xxvii. 7, 2 Sam. ii 10 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> v. 4 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> In 1 Sam. xiii. 1, in
                    the note “Saul was——years old when he became king and reigned [two] years over
                    Israel” (lacking in LXX.), one of the numbers has been left blank and the other
                    has been falsely filled up by a mere error of the text; the similar note in 2
                    Sam. ii. 10 seems also to have been filled up at random; it contradicts and
                    disturbs the context. But, though the book of Samuel has been much less
                    systematically edited than Kings, unsystematic additions to and modifications of
                    the oldest narratives were made from time to time on a very considerable scale,
                    and<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n272/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0272-0253"/> in this book, as in Judges, we not seldom find
                    two accounts of the same events which not only differ in detail but plainly are
                    of very different date.</p>
                <p>The book as a whole may be divided into three main sections:—(1) <hi
                    rend="italic">Samuel and Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. i.-xiv.; (2) <hi rend="italic">The
                    rise and kingdom of David,</hi> 1 Sam. xv.-2 Sam. viii.; (3)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The personal history of David’s court at Jerusalem</hi> (mainly
                    from a single source, which also includes 1 Kings i., ii.), 2 Sam. ix.-xx.
                    Finally, the appendix, 2 Sam. xxi.-xxiv., must have been added after the book of
                    Kings had been separated from the context to which 1 Kings i., ii. originally
                    belonged. As the greater part of the book of Samuel is occupied with the history
                    of David, which has been discussed at length in his article, and with that of
                    Samuel and Saul, the chief points of which have been critically examined in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Israel,</hi> a very brief resume of the contents of
                    each of the main sections must here suffice.</p>
                <p>I. The story of Samuel’s birth, consecration to the service of the sanctuary at
                    Shiloh, and prophetic calling (1 Sam. i.-iii.) connects itself through the
                    prophecy of the rejection of the house of Eli (iii. 11 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi>) with the history of the disaster of Ebenezer and the capture and
                    restoration of the ark (iv. 1-vii. 1). But the second of these two sections does
                    not seem to have been originally written as the sequel to chaps, i.-iii.; in it
                    we lose sight of Samuel and his prophecy altogether. The song of Hannah (ii.
                    1-10) and the prophecy of the nameless man of God (ii. 27-36) are later
                    insertions (see Wellliausen-Bleek, <hi rend="italic">EM.,</hi> p. 207).</p>
                <p>Chap, vii., with its Deuteronomistic introduction (verses 2-4) and its account of
                    a victory at Ebenezer (the counterpart of the defeat in chap, iv.) which
                    delivered Israel from the Philistines during all the days of Samuel, is
                    inconsistent with the position of the Philistine power at the accession of Saul.
                    The chapter in its present form must be late, though hardly post-exilic, and it
                    is the necessary introduction to the later and less authentic account of the way
                    in which Saul came to the kingdom (chaps, viii., x. 17- 27, xii.). It should be
                    noted, however, that, though Samuel is taken by the late narrator to have a
                    widespread authority, inconsistent with the facts disclosed in the older
                    narrative of the choice of Saul, the sphere assigned to him in vii. 16, 17 is
                    very narrow and agrees with chap. ix.</p>
                <p>Of the beginnings of the kingship of Saul we have a twofold account, the older
                    being that in ix. 1-x. 16, xi. The relative value of the two accounts has been
                    already discussed in <hi rend="smallcaps">Israel,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 403. The
                    older history is continued in chaps, xiii., xiv., but here xiii. <hi
                    rend="italic">7b—</hi> 15—a doublette of the account of the rejection of Saul in
                    chap. xiv.—is certainly foreign to the original context. The summary of Saul’s
                    exploits in xiv. 47 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> is written by an admirer, who
                    appears to ascribe to him some of David’s victories. But this does not affect
                    the value of the preceding more detailed narrative, which is plainly based on a
                    full and authentic tradition.</p>
                <p>II. The account of the campaign against Amalek (chap, xv.) does not merely supply
                    details supplementary to xiv. 48 but puts the war with Agag in quite a different
                    light by laying the chief weight on Saul’s disobedience to Samuel and rejection
                    by the prophet. This passage is closely allied to 1 Sam. xxviii. 3-25, which,
                    however, is no part of the original story of Saul’s defeat and. death, as
                    appears by comparing the position of the two armies in xxviii. 4 and xxix. 1.
                    Chap, xv., in like manner, is probably no original part of the narrative of
                    David’s rise, to which it now forms the introduction, and both passages, though
                    relatively ancient additions, represent a type of religious thought and a view
                    of prophecy which can hardly be older than the epoch of Elisha (comp. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Prophet,</hi> vol. xix. p. 816). The anointing of David (xvi.
                    1-13) presupposes chap, xv., and is consistent with what follows only if we
                    suppose that the meaning of Samuel’s act was not understood at the time. The
                    older history repeatedly indicates that David’s kingship was predicted by a
                    divine oracle, but would hardly lead us to place the prediction so early (1 Sam.
                    xxv. 30, 2 Sam. iii. 9, v. 2 compared with 1 Sam. xvii. 28, xviii. 23).</p>
                <p>The story of David’s introduction to Saul is told in two forms (xvi. 14-23; xvii.
                    1-xviii. 5). In the former David is already a man of approved courage and parts
                    when he is attracted to the court; in the latter he is an obscure and untried
                    shepherd lad (as in chap, xvi.) when he volunteers to meet Goliath. In the
                    Hebrew text the contradiction between the two accounts is absolute, but the
                    Septuagint omits xvii. 12-31, xvii. 55-xviii. 5, which greatly lessens if it
                    does not entirely remove the difficulty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A further difficulty is caused by 2 Sam. xxi. 19, which
                    makes Elhanan the Bethlehemite slayer of Goliath.</p></note> The rise of Saul’s
                    jealousy against David (xviii. 6-30) and the open breach between them, with
                    David’s flight from the court (xix., xx.), are very confused in the Hebrew text.
                    Some serious difficulties are escaped by following the Septuagint recension, but
                    others remain, and there is a good deal of confusion also in the accounts of
                    David’s life as an outlaw (xxi.-xxvi.) and with Achish (xxvii.). For details see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">David,</hi> vol. vi. p. 838 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> The
                    narrative is largely made up of detached anecdotes, and sometimes there were two
                    divergent anecdotes based on a single incident. This is clear as regards the two
                    stories of David’s generosity to Saul (xxiv., xxvi.) and still more clear where
                    the LXX. omits one of two parallel anecdotes (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >David,</hi><hi rend="italic">ut supra},</hi> while the same account may perhaps
                    be given of the twofold narrative of David’s flight from Saul and of his
                    betaking himself to Achish. At the same time there is sufficient connexion to
                    show that the doublettes and additions are strung on an original thread of
                    continuous history—a history of David, which becomes more free from foreign
                    accretions at the point when the outlaw and refugee acquires, through the death
                    of Saul, a position of commanding importance. Saul’s defeat and death (1 Sam.
                    xxviii. 1, 2, xxx.) are related as part of the history of David, which runs on
                    from this point with little evidence of editorial additions to the close of 2
                    Sam. v. The summary account of David’s war and government in 2 Sam. viii.
                    appears to be the continuation of the same document; chaps, vi. and vii., on the
                    other hand, seem to have an independent source.</p>
                <p>III. The history of David’s court, a vivid picture of events which must be
                    referred in substance if not in form to a contemporary observer, is in its
                    origin a distinct book from the life of David that closes with 2 Sam. viii. It
                    extends over 2 Sam. ix.- 1 Kings ii. with very little appearance of
                    interpolation except the great appendix, 2 Sam. xxi.-xxiv., and is throughout
                    one of the most admirable remains of ancient history.</p>
                <p>The appendix is made up of various pieces,—chap. xxiv. appearing to attach itself
                    directly to xxi. 1-14, while xxi. 15 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> is akin in
                    subject to xxiii. 8 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; the two poems, chap. xxii.
                    (Psalm xviii.) and xxiii. 1-7, have no relation to the context, so that we can
                    only say of them that they were accepted as Davidic at the time—posterior to the
                    Deuteronomistic redaction—when the miscellaneous matter of the appendix was
                    incorporated with our book.</p>
                <p>In this rapid sketch it has not been attempted to notice all the minor marks of
                    editorial retouching found in one or both of the two great recensions of the
                    text, For all details the reader must refer principally to Wellhausen’s repeated
                    studies of the hook, first in his <hi rend="italic">Text der Bucher
                    Samuelis,</hi> 1871, then in the fourth edition of Bleek's <hi rend="italic"
                    >Einleitung,</hi> 1878, and finally in his <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena to the
                    History of Israel</hi> (Eng. tr., 1885). Of earlier works on the subject the
                    relative parts of Ewald's <hi rend="italic">Geschichte</hi> are the most
                    important. The commentaries of Thenius (1st ed. 1842, 2d ed. 18G4) and Keil
                    (1864, Eng. tr. 1866) are not very satisfactory. In English Prof. Kirkpatrick’s
                    short commentary (in the Cambridge Bible for Schools) will be found useful. See
                    also F. H. Woods in <hi rend="italic">Studia Biblica,</hi> Oxford, 1885.</p>
