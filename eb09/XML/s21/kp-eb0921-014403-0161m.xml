                <p><label type="entry">SAFES</label>. A safe is any repository in which valuable
                    property is guarded against risk of loss by fire or from the attacks of thieves.
                    The protection of valuable documents and possessions was only imperfectly
                    effected in the charter-rooms of old mansions and in the iron-bound oaken chests
                    and iron coffers of the Middle Ages; but these in their day represented the
                    strong rooms and safes of modern times. The vast increase in realized wealth and
                    the complication of financial and banking operations necessitate in our days the
                    greatest attention to the safeguarding of securities and property. The ingenuity
                    of inventors has, within practicable limits, effected much in safe-making; but
                    the cunning of thieves has increased in proportion to the obstacles to be
                    overcome and to the value of the booty at which they aim. No safe can be held to
                    be invulnerable; for, whatever human ingenuity can put together and close, the
                    same ingenuity can tear down and open. An impregnable safe would indeed be a
                    source of greater danger than of security to its owner, for, were the key or
                    other means of access lost or rendered unworkable, the contents of the safe
                    would of necessity be irrecoverable. The efficiency of a safe, therefore, does
                    not depend on absolute impregnability, but on the nature of the obstacles it
                    presents to successful attack, and to the generally unfavourable conditions
                    under which such attacks are made. It is common to make safes both thief-and
                    fire-resisting, and the conditions necessary for the one object to a certain
                    extent conduce to the attainment of both; but for many purposes security from
                    the one danger alone is requisite.</p>
                <p>The devices for baffling thieves are numerous. The safe must in the first place
                    be made heavy and unwieldy, or otherwise it must be so fixed that it can only be
                    carried away with the utmost difficulty. Next, the greatest obstacles to
                    obtaining illegitimate access must be presented. To prevent fracturing a tough
                    metal must be used in the construction, and to resist penetration by drilling
                    metal of great hardness must be interposed. These conditions are commonly met by
                    making the outer casing of the safe of boiler plate, backed by a lining of hard
                    steel, over which is an inner lining of thin boiler plate, the three layers
                    being securely bolted together by screws from within. By some makers a layer of
                    hard metal is poured, in a fluid state, between the outer and inner casing;
                    others case-harden one surface; and there are numerous additional devices for
                    securing the combination of hardness and toughness. To prevent wrenching of
                    joints, the two sides with top and bottom of the outer shell are sometimes made
                    out of a single plate welded at the joint, and the back and front are then
                    attached to that shell by angle irons screwed from within. The frame upon which
                    the door hangs and into which the bolts shoot is made of great strength, with
                    special precautions to prevent the wrenching off of the door by means of
                    crowbars or wedges. In an ordinary safe the massive bolts, three or more in
                    number, shoot only at the front, and fixed dogs or sham bolts fit into slots at
                    the back or hinged side. This arrangement is sufficient to keep the door closed
                    independent of hinges, which are merely the pivot on which the door turns. In
                    all Chubb’s safes bolts shoot both to front and back; and in the higher quality
                    of that and of every other good maker bolts shoot on every side,—front, back,
                    top, and bottom. Ordinarily the bolts shoot straight into the slot as in an
                    ordinary lock; but, to defy wrenching, additional grip is secured by Chatwood,
                    who makes a bolt with a clutch or projection, which falls into a recess in the
                    slot and thus holds against any direct wrench. In Chubb’s finer safes the bolts
                    shoot diagonally all round, so that in each face of the door they go in two
                    different directions. Safe bolts are shot not by the key, as in an ordinary
                    lock, but by the door handle, and the key simply secures them in their position.
                    By this arrangement, patented by Mr Charles Chubb in 1835, a series of the most
                    ponderous bolts can be secured in locked position by a small key which can be
                    carried in the vest pocket. The lock of a safe must be a careful piece of
                    mechanism, not subject to derangement, unpickable, and gunpowder-proof. The
                    portion of the door on which it is fastened is generally provided with extra
                    precautions against drilling. A safe being well made and securely locked remains
                    vulnerable through the medium of the key, which may be surreptitiously obtained
                    either for direct use or to form a mould by which false keys can be cut. On this
                    account, keyless locks and time locks are coming into great favour in America.
                    In keyless permutation locks, such as those of Hall, Sargent, Yale, and Dalton,
                    the bolts can be withdrawn only after an indicator has been successively set
                    against a combination of numbers arranged before the closing of the door; and in
                    the time lock of these inventors the safe can only be opened at any hour to
                    which the time controller is set before closing. Electrical arrangements have
                    also been attached to safes by which signals are conveyed to any spot when a
                    safe so guarded is unlawfully interfered with. It is much easier to render a
                    safe fire-proof than to<pb break="no"

                    nothing more than a calculation of the intensity and duration of any fire to
                    which it is likely to be exposed, and the provision of a sufficient lining of
                    fire-resisting material. What is principally used is a mixture of some absorbent
                    medium—such as sawdust, powdered gypsum or cement, or infusorial earth—with
                    ground alum. Asbestos, silicate cotton, mica, and other non-conductors are also
                    used; and by some makers sealed tubes of alkaline salts are distributed through
                    the absorbent material. These burst when exposed to high heat and their contents
                    saturate the surrounding substance. A carefully packed shell of not less than 3½
                    inches of the fire-resisting medium should line the interior of every fire-proof
                    safe; but in many cheap safes a quantity of brick dust is the only
                    fire-resisting medium.</p>
                <p>Where an ordinary safe provides insufficient accommodation the strong room takes
                    its place. Such an apartment, being generally in the basement of a building,
                    presents no special difficulties to make it proof against fire and thieves.
                    Thickness of walls, built by preference of hard brick laid in cement, and
                    liberal use of cement within the walls, as well as at the floor and over the
                    arched roof, give strength against both fire and burglars. The interior of a
                    strong room is generally lined with boiler-plate, and, in addition to the
                    massive steel and iron door, it has an inner wrought-iron grill-door, which
                    secures the vault during business hours and permits the ventilation of the
                    apartment. Within such a strong room extra strong chambers or separate safes may
                    be placed, and in this way precautions may be indefinitely multiplied.</p>
                <p>The most complete examples of safe and strong-room arrangements are afforded by
                    the public safes or safe-deposits erected in most of the great cities of America
                    and in London. The premises of the National Safe Deposit Company in London
                    consist of a large isolated building in Queen Victoria Street. The building,
                    which is fire-proof, covers and surrounds the great safe vault or citadel, which
                    is sunk in the ground to a depth of 45 feet. The vault itself, founded on a bed
                    of concrete 20 feet in thickness, has walls, 3 feet thick, of hard blue brick
                    laid in cement, with an external lining of fire-brick, and is lined internally
                    with cast-iron plates 4½ inches thick chilled on one side, the plates having
                    embedded in them a network of strong interlaced wrought-iron bars. The vault is
                    divided into four tiers or stories with eight separate compartments in each,
                    which, after business hours, are closed with doors raised and lowered by
                    hydraulic power. These doors, which each weigh four tons, are built up, 12
                    inches thick, of combinations of hard and tough metal to resist fracture and
                    drilling, and when they are raised for business purposes the entrance to each
                    compartment is protected by a massive wrought-iron grill. Within the thirty-two
                    compartments there is space for about 20,000 safes of various sizes, which are
                    let to owners of valuables, each renter having the sole control of the safe
                    hired by him. Additional security is obtained by the patrol of armed watchmen,
                    and generally it may be said that in the institution precautions have been
                    carried almost to the pitch of perfection, if indeed they have not been pushed
                    to needless excess. (J. PA.)</p>
