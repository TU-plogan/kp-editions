                    (Lat. <hi rend="italic">Scaliger)</hi> family, the reader is referred to the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Verona.</hi> The name has also been borne by two
                    scholars of extraordinary eminence in the world of letters.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Julius Caesar Scaliger</hi> (1484-1558), so distinguished
                    by his learning and talents that, according to De Thou, no one of the ancients
                    could be placed above him and the age in which he lived could not show his
                    equal, was, according to his own account, a scion of the illustrious house of La
                    Scala, for a hundred and fifty years princes of</p>
                <p>Verona, and was born in 1484 at the castle of La Rocca on the Lago de Garda. At
                    the age of twelve he was presented to his kinsman the emperor Maximilian, and
                    placed by him among his pages. He remained for seventeen years in the service of
                    the emperor, following him in his expeditions through half Europe, and
                    distinguishing himself no less by personal bravery as a soldier than by military
                    skill as a captain. But he was unmindful neither of letters, in which he had the
                    most eminent scholars of the day as his instructors, nor of art, which he
                    studied with considerable success under Albert Dürer. In 1512 he fought at the
                    battle of Ravenina, where his father and elder brother were killed. He there
                    displayed prodigies of valour, and received the highest honours of chivalry from
                    his imperial cousin, the emperor conferring upon him with his own hands the
                    spurs, the collar, and the eagle of gold. But this was the only reward he
                    obtained for his long and faithful devotion. He left the service of Maximilian,
                    and after a brief employment by another kinsman, the duke of Ferrara, he decided
                    to quit the military life, and in 1514 entered as a student at the university of
                    Bologna. He determined to take holy orders, in the expectation that he would
                    become in due time cardinal, and then be elected pope, when he would wrest from
                    the Venetians his principality of Verona, of which the republic had despoiled
                    his ancestors. But, though he soon gave up this design, he remained at the
                    university until 1519. The next six years he passed at the castle of Vico Nuova,
                    in Piedmont, as a guest of the family of La Rovere, at first dividing his time
                    between military expeditions in the summer, in which he achieved great
                    successes, and study, chiefly of medicine and natural history, in the winter,
                    until a severe attack of rheumatic gout brought his military career to a close.
                    Henceforth his life was wholly devoted to study. In 1525 he accompanied M. A. de
                    la Rovere, bishop of Agen, to that city as his physician. Such is the outline of
                    his own account of his early life. It was not until some time after his death
                    that the enemies of his son first alleged that he was not of the family of La
                    Scala, but was the son of Benedetto Bordone. an illuminator or schoolmaster of
                    Verona; that he was educated at Padua, where he took the degree of M.D.; and
                    that his story of his life and adventures before arriving at Agen was a tissue
                    of fables. It certainly is supported by no other evidence than his own
                    statements, some of which are inconsistent with well-ascertained facts.</p>
                <p>The remaining thirty-two years of his life were passed almost wholly at Agen, in
                    the full light of contemporary history. They were without adventure, almost
                    without incident, but it was in them that he achieved so much distinction that
                    at his death in 1558 he had the highest scientific and literary reputation of
                    any man in Europe. A few days after his arrival at Agen he fell in love with a
                    charming orphan of thirteen, Andiette de la Roque Lobejac. Her friends objected
                    to her marriage with an unknown adventurer, but in 1528 he had obtained so much
                    success as a physician that the objections of her family were overcome, and at
                    forty-five he married Andiette, who was then sixteen. The marriage proved a
                    complete success; it was followed by twenty-nine years of almost uninterrupted
                    happiness, and by the birth of fifteen children.</p>
                <p>A charge of heresy in 1538, of which he was acquitted by his friendly judges, one
                    of whom was his friend Arnoul Le Ferron, was almost the only event of interest
                    during these twenty-nine years, except the publication of his books, and the
                    quarrels and criticisms to which they gave rise.</p>
                <p>In 1531 he printed his first oration against Erasmus, in defence of Cicero and
                    the Ciceronians. It is a piece of<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0383-0362"/> vigorous invective, displaying, like all his
                    subsequent writings, an astonishing knowledge and command of the Latin language,
                    and much brilliant rhetoric, but full of vulgar abuse, and completely missing
                    the point of the <hi rend="italic">Ciceronianus</hi> of Erasmus. The writer’s
                    indignation at finding it treated with silent contempt by the great scholar, who
                    thought it was the work of a personal enemy—Aleander —caused him to write a
                    second oration, more violent, more abusive, with more self-glorification, but
                    with less real merit than the first. The orations were followed by a prodigious
                    quantity of Latin verse, which appeared in successive volumes in 1533, 1534,
                    1539, 1546, and 1574; of these, a friendly critic, Mr Pattison, is obliged to
                    approve the judgment of Huet, who says: “par ses poésies brutes et informes
                    Scaliger a deshonoré le Parnasse;” yet their numerous editions show that they
                    commended themselves not only to his contemporaries but to succeeding scholars.
                    A brief tract on comic metres <hi rend="italic">(De Comicis Dimensionibus)</hi>
                    and a work <hi rend="italic">De Causis Linguae Latinae—</hi> the earliest Latin
                    grammar on scientific principles, and following a scientific method—were his
                    only other purely literary works published in his lifetime. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Poetics</hi> was left unpublished, and only appeared in 1561 after
                    his death. With many paradoxes, with many criticisms which are below contempt,
                    and many indecent displays of violent personal animosity,—especially in his
                    reference to the unfortunate Dolet, over whose death he gloated with brutal
                    malignity,—it yet contains much acute criticism, and shows that for the first
                    time a writer had appeared who had formed an adequate idea of what such a
                    treatise ought to be, and how it ought to be written.</p>
                <p>But it is as a philosopher and a man of science that J. C. Scaliger ought to be
                    judged. His tastes were for metaphysics and physics rather than for literature.
                    Classical studies he regarded as an agreeable relaxation from severer pursuits.
                    Whatever the truth or fable of the first forty years of his life, he had
                    certainly been a most close and accurate observer, and had made himself
                    acquainted with many curious and little-known phenomena, which he had stored up
                    in a most tenacious memory, and which he was able to make use of with profit.
                    His scientific writings are all in the form of commentaries, and it was not
                    until his seventieth year that (with the exception of a brief tract on the <hi
                    rend="italic">De Insomniis</hi> of Hippocrates) he felt that any of them were
                    sufficiently complete to be given to the world. In 1556 he printed his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dialogue</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">De Plantis</hi> attributed
                    to Aristotle, and in 1557 his <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes</hi> on the work
                    of Cardan, <hi rend="italic">De Subtilitate.</hi> His other scientific works,
                    <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> on Theophrastus’s <hi rend="italic">History
                    of Plants</hi> and Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">History of Animals,</hi> he
                    left in a more or less unfinished state, and they were not printed until after
                    his death. They are all marked by the same characteristics: arrogant dogmatism,
                    violence of language, irritable vanity, a constant tendency to
                    self-glorification, which we expect to find only in the charlatan and the
                    impostor, are in him combined with extensive real knowledge, with acute
                    reasoning, with an observation of facts and details almost unparalleled. He
                    displays everywhere what Naudé calls “an intellect teeming with heroic thought.”
                    But he is only the naturalist of his own time. That he anticipated in any manner
                    the inductive philosophy cannot be contended; his botanical studies did not lead
                    him, like his contemporary Gesner, to any idea of a natural system of
                    classification, and he rejected with the utmost arrogance and violence of
                    language the discoveries of Copernicus. In metaphysics and in natural history
                    Aristotle was a law to him, and in medicine Galen, but he was not a slave to the
                    text or the details of either. He has thoroughly mastered their principles, and
                    is able to see when his masters are not true to themselves. He corrects
                    Aristotle by himself. He is in that stage of learning when the attempt is made
                    to harmonize the written word with the actual facts of nature, and the result is
                    that his works have no real scientific value. Their interest is only historical.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes</hi> upon the <hi rend="italic">De
                    Subtilitate</hi> of Cardan (1557) is the book by which Scaliger is best known as
                    a philosopher. Its numerous editions bear witness to its popularity, and until
                    the final fall of Aristotle’s physics it continued a popular text-book; as late
                    as the middle of the seventeenth century an elaborate commentary upon it was
                    published by Sperling, a professor at Wittenberg. We are astonished at the
                    encyclopaedic wealth of knowledge which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exercitationes</hi> display, at the vigour of the author’s style, at the
                    accuracy of his observations, but are obliged to agree with Naudé that he has
                    committed more faults than he has discovered in Cardan, and with Nisard that his
                    object seems to be to deny all that Cardan affirms and to affirm all that Cardan
                    denies. Yet it is no light praise that writers like Leibnitz and Sir William
                    Hamilton recognize J. C. Scaliger as the best modern exponent of the physics and
                    metaphysics of Aristotle. He died at Agen 21st October 1558.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph</hi> JUSTUS <hi rend="smallcaps">Scaliger</hi>
                    (1540-1609), the greatest scholar of modern times, was the tenth child and third
                    son of Julius Caesar Scaliger and Andiette de la Roque Lobejac (see above). Born
                    at Agen in 1540, he was sent when twelve years of age, with two younger
                    brothers, to the college of Guienne at Bordeaux, then under the direction of
                    Jean Gelida. An outbreak of the plague in 1555 caused the boys to return home,
                    and for the next few years Joseph was his father’s constant companion and
                    amanuensis. The composition of Latin verse was the chief amusement of Julius in
                    his later years, and he daily dictated to his son from eighty to a hundred
                    lines, and sometimes more. Joseph was also required each day to write a Latin
                    theme or declamation, but in other respects he seems to have been left to his
                    own devices. The Latin verse of Julius, faulty as it is in all that constitutes
                    poetry, yet displays a more extensive knowledge of the Latin language, and a
                    greater command of its resources, than is to be found in the verse of any of his
                    contemporaries; and this constant practice in writing and reading or speaking
                    Latin, under the supervision of one who knew the language thoroughly, was
                    probably the foundation of Joseph’s Latin scholarship. But the companionship of
                    his father was worth more to him than any mere instruction. He learned from
                    Julius what real knowledge was, and that it did not consist in discussions on
                    words and phrases; and to his father he owed it that he was not a mere scholar,
                    but something more—an acute observer, never losing sight of the actual world,
                    and aiming not so much at correcting texts as at laying the foundation of a
                    science of historical criticism.</p>
                <p>In 1558, on the death of his father, he proceeded to Paris, and spent four years
                    at the university there. Of his life at Paris we know but little. Hitherto he
                    had not studied Greek. Now he felt that not to know Greek was to know nothing.
                    It was in the literature of Greece that he must look for the true key of
                    antiquity, and he forthwith began to attend the lectures of Turnebus. But after
                    two months he found out his mistake. He had much to learn before he could be in
                    a position to profit by the lectures of the greatest Greek scholar of the time.
                    He shut himself up in his chamber, and determined to teach himself. He read
                    Homer in twenty-one days, and then went through all the other Greek poets,
                    orators, and historians, forming a grammar for himself as he went along. From
                    Greek, at the suggestion of Postel, he proceeded to attack Hebrew, and then
                    Arabic; of both he acquired a respectable knowdedge, though not the critical
                    mastery which he<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n384/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0384-0363"/> possessed in Latin and Greek. The name of Dorat
                    then stood as high as that of Turnebus as a Greek scholar, and far higher as a
                    professor. He has left nothing to justify his reputation as a scholar; but as a
                    teacher he undoubtedly possessed the highest qualifications. He was able not
                    only to impart knowledge, but to kindle enthusiasm for his subject in the minds
                    of his hearers and pupils. It was to Dorat that Scaliger owed the home which he
                    found for the next thirty years of his life. In 1563 the professor recommended
                    him to Louis de Chastaigner, the young lord of La Roche Pozay, as a companion in
                    his travels. A close friendship sprung up between the two young men, which
                    remained unbroken till the death of Louis in 1595. The travellers first
                    proceeded to Rome. Here they found Muretus, who, when at Bordeaux and Toulouse,
                    had been a great favourite and occasional visitor of Julius Caesar at Agen.
                    Muretus soon recognized Scaliger’s merits, and devoted himself to making his
                    stay at Rome as agreeable as possible, introducing him to all the men that were
                    worth knowing. After visiting a large part of Italy, the travellers passed to
                    England and Scotland, taking as it would seem La Roche Pozay on their way, for
                    Scaliger’s preface to his first book, the <hi rend="italic">Conjectanea in
                    Varronem,</hi> is dated there in December 1564. Scaliger formed an unfavourable
                    opinion of the English. Their inhuman disposition, and inhospitable treatment of
                    foreigners, especially impressed him. He was also disappointed in finding few
                    Greek manuscripts and few learned men. It was not until a much later period that
                    he became intimate with Richard Thompson and other Englishmen. In the course of
                    his travels he had become a . Protestant. His father, though he lived and died
                    in the communion of the Church of Rome, had been suspected of heresy, and it is
                    probable that Joseph’s sympathies were early enlisted on the side of
                    Protestantism. On his return to France he spent three years with the
                    Chastaigners, accompanying them to their different chateaux in Poitou, as the
                    calls of the civil war required their presence. In 1570 he accepted the
                    invitation of Cujas, and proceeded to Valence to study jurisprudence under the
                    greatest living jurist. Here he remained three years, profiting not only by the
                    lectures but even more by the library of Cujas, which filled no less than seven
                    or eight rooms and included five hundred manuscripts.</p>
                <p>The massacre of St Bartholomew—occurring as he was about to accompany the bishop
                    of Valence on an embassy to Poland—induced him with other Huguenots to retire to
                    Geneva, where he was received with open arms, and was appointed a professor in
                    the academy; He lectured on the <hi rend="italic">Organon</hi> of Aristotle and
                    the <hi rend="italic">De Finibus</hi> of Cicero with much satisfaction to the
                    students but with little to himself. He hated lecturing, and was bored to death
                    with the importunities of the fanatical preachers; and in 1574 he returned to
                    France, and made his home for the next twenty years in the chateaux of his
                    friend the lord of La Roche Pozay. Of his life during this period we have for
                    the first time interesting details and notices in the <hi rend="italic">Lettres

                    (Agen, 1881), a volume which adds much to our knowledge of Scaliger’s life.
                    Constantly moving from chateau to chateau through Poitou and the Limousin, as
                    the exigencies of the civil war required, occasionally taking his turn as a
                    guard when the chateau was attacked, at least on one occasion trailing a pike on
                    an expedition against the Leaguers, with no access to libraries, and frequently
                    separated even from his own books, his life during this period seems in one
                    aspect most unsuited to study. He had, however, what so few contemporary
                    scholars possessed—leisure, and freedom from pecuniary cares. In general he
                    could devote his whole time to study; and it was during this period of his life
                    that he composed and published the books which showed how far he was in advance
                    of all his contemporaries as a scholar and a critic, and that with him a new
                    school of historical criticism had arisen. His editions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalecta</hi> (1574), of Festus (1576), of Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius
                    (1577), are the work of a man who writes not only books of instruction for
                    learners, but who is determined himself to discover and communicate to others
                    the real meaning and force of his author. Discarding the trivial remarks and
                    groundless suggestions which we find in the editions of nearly all his
                    contemporaries and predecessors, he first laid down and applied sound rules of
                    criticism and emendation, and changed textual criticism, from a series of
                    haphazard and frequently baseless guesses, into a “rational procedure subject to
                    fixed laws” (Pattison). But these works, while proving Scaliger’s right to the
                    foremost place among his contemporaries as far as Latin scholarship and
                    criticism were concerned, did not go beyond mere scholarship. It was reserved
                    for his edition of Manilius (1579), and his <hi rend="italic">De Emendatione
                    Temporum</hi> (1583), to revolutionize all the received ideas of the chronology
                    of ancient history,—to show for the first time that ancient chronology was of
                    the highest importance as a corrector as well as a supplement to historical
                    narrative, that ancient history is not confined to that of the Greeks and
                    Romans, but also comprises that of the Persians, the Babylonians, and the
                    Egyptians, hitherto neglected as absolutely worthless, and that of the Jews,
                    hitherto treated as a thing apart and too sacred to be mixed up with the others,
                    and that the historical narratives and fragments of each of these, and their
                    several systems of chronology, must be carefully and critically compared
                    together, if any true and general conclusions on ancient history are to be
                    arrived at. It is this which constitutes his true glory, and which places
                    Scaliger on so immeasurably higher an eminence than any of his contemporaries.
                    Yet, while the scholars of his time admitted his pre-eminence, neither they nor
                    those who immediately followed seem to have appreciated his real merit, but to
                    have considered his emendatory criticism, and his skill in Greek, as
                    constituting his claim to special greatness. “Scaliger’s great works in
                    historical criticism had overstepped any power of appreciation which the
                    succeeding age possessed” (Pattison). His commentary on Manilius is really a
                    treatise on the astronomy of the ancients, and it forms an introduction to the
                    <hi rend="italic">De Emendatione Temporum,</hi> in which he examines by the
                    light of modern and Copernican science the ancient system as applied to epochs,
                    calendars, and computations of time, showing upon what principles they were
                    based.</p>
                <p>In the remaining twenty-four years of his life he at once corrected and enlarged
                    the basis which he had laid in the <hi rend="italic">De Emendatione.</hi> With
                    incredible patience, sometimes with a happy audacity of conjecture which itself
                    is almost genius, he succeeded in reconstructing the lost <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle</hi> of Eusebius—one of the most precious remains of antiquity, and
                    of the highest value for ancient chronology. This he printed in 1606 in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Thesaurus Temporum,</hi> in which he collected, restored, and
                    arranged every chronological relic extant in Greek or Latin. In 1590 Lipsius
                    retired from Leyden, where for twelve years he had been professor of Roman
                    history and antiquities. The university and its protectors, the states-general
                    of Holland and the prince of Orange, resolved to obtain Scaliger as his
                    successor. He declined their offer. He hated the thought of lecturing, and there
                    were those among his friends who erroneously believed that with the success of
                    Henry IV. learning would flourish, and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n385/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0385-0364"/> Protestantism be no bar to distinction and
                    advancement. The invitation was renewed in the most gratifying and flattering
                    manner a year later. Scaliger would not be required to lecture. The university
                    only wished for his presence. He would be in all respects the master of his
                    time. This offer Scaliger provisionally accepted. About the middle of 1593 he
                    started for Holland, where he passed the remaining thirteen years of his life,
                    never returning to France. His reception at Leyden was all that he could wish. A
                    handsome income was assured to him. He was treated with the highest
                    consideration. His rank as a prince of Verona was recognized. Placed midway
                    between The Hague and Amsterdam, he was able to obtain, besides the learned
                    circle of Leyden, the advantages of the best society of both these capitals. For
                    Scaliger was no hermit buried among his books; he was fond of social intercourse
                    with persons of merit and intelligence, and was himself a good talker.</p>
                <p>For the first seven years of his residence at Leyden his reputation was at its
                    highest point. His literary dictatorship was unquestioned. It was greater in
                    kind and in extent than that of any man since the revival of letters— greater
                    even than that of Erasmus had been. From his throne at Leyden he ruled the
                    learned world, and a word from him could make or mar a rising reputation. The
                    electric force of his genius drew to him all the rising talent of the republic.
                    He was surrounded by young men eager to listen to and profit by his
                    conversation, and he enjoyed nothing better than to discuss with them the books
                    they were reading, and the men who wrote them, and to open up by his suggestive
                    remarks the true methods and objects of philological and historical study. He
                    encouraged Grotius when only a youth of sixteen to edit Capella; the early death
                    of the younger Douza he wept as that of a beloved son; Daniel Heinsius, from
                    being his favourite pupil, became his most intimate friend. But Scaliger had
                    made numerous enemies. He hated ignorance, but he hated still more half
                    learning, and most of all dishonesty in argument or in quotation. Himself the
                    soul of honour and truthfulness, with a single aim in all his writings, namely,
                    to arrive at the truth, he had no toleration for the disingenuous arguments, and
                    the misstatements of facts, of those who wrote to support a theory or to defend
                    an unsound cause. Neither in his conversation nor in his writings did he conceal
                    his contempt for the ignorant and the dishonest. His pungent sarcasms were soon
                    carried to the ears of the persons of whom they were uttered, and his pen was
                    not less bitter than his tongue. He resembles his father in his arrogant tone
                    towards those whom he despises and those whom he hates, and he despises and
                    hates all who differ from him. He is conscious of his power as a literary
                    dictator, and not always sufficiently cautious or sufficiently gentle in its
                    exercise. Nor, it must be admitted, was Scaliger always right. He trusted much
                    to his memory, which was occasionally treacherous. His emendations, if
                    frequently happy, were sometimes absurd. In laying the foundations of a science
                    of ancient chronology, he relied sometimes upon groundless, sometimes even upon
                    absurd hypotheses, frequently upon an imperfect induction of facts. Sometimes he
                    misunderstood the astronomical science of the ancients, sometimes that of
                    Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. And he was no mathematician. But his enemies were
                    not merely those whose errors he had exposed, and whose hostility he had excited
                    by the violence of his language. The results of his system of historical
                    criticism had been adverse to the Catholic controversialists, and to the
                    authenticity of many of the documents upon which they had been accustomed to
                    rely. The Jesuits, who aspired to be the expounders of antiquity, the source of
                    all scholarship and criticism, perceived that the writings and authority of
                    Scaliger were the most formidable barrier to their claims. It was the day of
                    conversions. Muretus in the latter part of his life professed the strictest
                    orthodoxy; Lipsius had been reconciled to the Church of Rome; Casaubon was
                    supposed to be wavering; but Scaliger was known to be hopeless, and as long as
                    his supremacy was unquestioned the Protestants had the victory in learning and
                    scholarship. A determined attempt must be made, if not to answer his criticisms,
                    or to disprove his statements, yet to attack him as a man, and to destroy his
                    reputation. This was no easy task, for his moral character was absolutely
                    spotless.</p>
                <p>After several scurrilous attacks by the Jesuit party, in which coarseness and
                    violence were more conspicuous than ability, in 1607 a new and more successful
                    attempt was made. Scaliger’s weak point was his pride. Brought up by his father,
                    whom he greatly reverenced, in the belief that he was a prince of Verona, he
                    never forgot this himself, nor suffered it to be forgotten by others. Naturally
                    truthful, honourable, and virtuous in every respect, he conceived himself
                    especially bound to be so on account of his illustrious ancestry. In 1594, in an
                    evil hour for his happiness and his reputation, he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistola de Vetustate et Splendore Gentis Scaligerae et J. C.
                    Scaligeri Vita.</hi> In 1607 Gaspar Scioppius, then in the service of the
                    Jesuits, whom he afterwards so bitterly libelled, published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Scaliger Hypobolimaeus</hi> (“The Supposititious Scaliger”), a
                    quarto volume of more than four hundred pages, written with consummate ability,
                    in an admirable and incisive style, with the entire disregard for truth which
                    Scioppius always displayed, and with all the power of that sarcasm in which he
                    was an accomplished master. Every piece of gossip or scandal which could be
                    raked together respecting Scaliger or his family is to be found there. The
                    author professes to point out five hundred lies in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistola de Vetustate</hi> of Scaliger, but the main argument of the book is to
                    show the falsity of his pretensions to be of the family of La Scala, and of the
                    narrative of his father’s early life, and to hold up both father and son to
                    contempt and ridicule as impudent impostors. “No stronger proof,” says Mr
                    Pattison, “can be given of the impressions produced by this powerful philippic,
                    dedicated to the defamation of an individual, than that it has been the source
                    from which the biography of Scaliger, as it now stands in our biographical
                    collections, has mainly flowed.” To Scaliger the blow was crushing. Whatever the
                    case as to Julius, Joseph had undoubtedly believed himself a prince of Verona,
                    and in his <hi rend="italic">Epistola</hi> had put forth with the most perfect
                    good faith, and without inquiry, all that he had heard from his father as to his
                    family and the early life of Julius. It was this good faith that laid the way
                    for his humiliation. His <hi rend="italic">Epistola</hi> is full of blunders and
                    mistakes of fact, and, relying partly on his own memory partly on his father’s
                    good faith, he has not verified one of the statements of Julius, most of which,
                    to speak most favourably, are characterized byrhodomontade, exaggeration, or
                    inaccuracy. He immediately wrote a reply to Scioppius, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Confutatio Fabulae Burdonum.</hi> It is written, for Scaliger,
                    with unusual moderation and good taste, but perhaps for that very reason had not
                    the success which its author wished and even expected. In the opinion of the
                    highest and most competent authority, Mr Pattison, “as a refutation of Scioppius
                    it is most complete”; but there are certainly grounds for dissenting, though
                    with diffidence, from this judgment. Scaliger undoubtedly shows that Scioppius
                    has committed more blunders than he has corrected, that his book literally
                    bristles with pure lies and baseless calumnies; but he does not succeed in<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n386/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0386-0365"/> adducing a single proof either of his father’s
                    descent from the La Scala family, or of any single event narrated by Julius as
                    happening to himself or any member of his family prior to his arrival at Agen.
                    Nor does he even attempt a refutation of what seems really to be the crucial
                    point in the whole controversy, and which Scioppius had proved, as far as a
                    negative can be proved,—namely, that William, the last prince of Verona, had no
                    son Nicholas, the alleged grandfather of Julius, nor indeed any son who could
                    have been such grandfather. But whether complete or not, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confutatio</hi> had no success; the attack of the Jesuits was successful, far
                    more so than they could possibly have hoped. Scioppius was wont to boast that
                    his book had killed Scaliger. It certainly embittered the few remaining months
                    of his life, and it is not improbable that the mortification which he suffered
                    may have shortened his days. The <hi rend="italic">Confutatio</hi> was his last
                    work. Five months after it appeared, “on the 21st of January, 1609, at four in
                    the morning, he fell asleep in Heinsius’s arms. The aspiring spirit ascended
                    before the Infinite. The most richly stored intellect which had ever spent
                    itself in acquiring knowledge was in the presence of the Omniscient”
                    (Pattison).</p>
                <p>Of Joseph Scaliger the only biography in any way adequate is that of Jacob
                    Bernays (Berlin, 1855). It was reviewed by the late Mark Pattison in an
                    excellent article in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> vol. cviii.
                    (1860). Mr Pattison had made many MS. collections for a life of Joseph Scaliger
                    on a much more extensive scale, which it is greatly to be regretted he left
                    unfinished, and in too fragmentary a state to be published. The present writer
                    has had access to and made much use of these MSS., which include a life of
                    Julius Caesar Scaliger written some years since. For the life of Joseph, besides
                    the recently published letters above referred to, the two old collections of
                    Latin and French letters and the two <hi rend="italic">Scaligerana</hi> are the
                    most important sources of information. For the life of Julius Caesar the letters
                    edited by his son, those subsequently published in 1620 by the President de
                    Maussac, the <hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi> and his own writings, which are
                    full of autobiographical matter, are the chief authorities. M. De Bourousse de
                    Laffore’s <hi rend="italic">Étude sur Jules César de Lescale</hi> (Agen, 1860)
                    and M. Magen’s <hi rend="italic">Documents sur Julius Caesar Scaliger et sa
                    famille</hi> (Agen, 1873) add important details for the lives of both father and
                    son. The lives by M. Charles Nisard—that of Julius in <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Gladiateurs de la République des Lettres,</hi> and that of Joseph in <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Triumvirat Littéraire au seizième siècle—</hi> are equally
                    unworthy of their author and their subjects. Julius is simply held up to
                    ridicule, while the life of Joseph is almost wholly based on the book of
                    Scioppius and the <hi rend="italic">Scaligerana.</hi> A complete list of the
                    works of Joseph will be found in his life by Bernays. (R. C. C.)</p>
