                            Seventh Earl of</hi></label> (1801-1885), was the son of Cropley, sixth
                    earl, and Anne, daughter of the third duke of Marlborough, and was born 28th
                    April 1801. He was educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford, where he
                    obtained a first class in classics in 1822, and graduated M.A. in 1832. In 1841
                    he received from his university the degree of D.C.L. He entered parliament as
                    member for the pocket borough of Woodstock in 1826; in 1830 he was returned for
                    Dorchester; from 1831 till February 1846 he represented the county of Dorset;
                    and he was member for Bath from 1847 till (having previously borne the courtesy
                    title Lord Ashley) he succeeded his father as earl in 1851. Although giving a
                    general support to the Conservatives, his parliamentary conduct was greatly
                    modified by his intense interest in the improvement of the social condition of
                    the working classes, his efforts in behalf of whom have made his name a
                    household word. He opposed the Reform Bill of 1832, but was a supporter of
                    Catholic emancipation, and his objection to the continuance of resistance to the
                    abolition of the Corn Laws led him to resign his seat for Dorset in 1846. In
                    parliament his name, more than any other, is associated with the factory
                    legislation (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Factory Acts,</hi> vol. viii. p. 845). He
                    was a lord of the admiralty under Sir Robert Peel (1834-35), but on being
                    invited to join Peel’s administration in 1841 refused, having been unable to
                    obtain Peel’s support for the Ten Hours’ Bill. Chiefly by his persistent efforts
                    a Ten Hours’ Bill was carried in 1847, but its operation was impeded by legal
                    difficulties, which were only removed by successive Acts, instigated chiefly by
                    him, until legislation reached a final stage in the Factory Act of 1874. The
                    part which he took in the legislation bearing on coal mines was equally
                    prominent. It is worthy of notice that his efforts in behalf of the practical
                    welfare of the working classes were guided by his own personal knowledge of
                    their circumstances and wants. Thus in 1846 he took advantage of his leisure
                    after the resignation of his seat for Dorset to explore the slums of the
                    metropolis, and by the information he obtained not only gave a new impulse to
                    the movement for the establishment of ragged schools, but was able to make it
                    more widely beneficial. For over forty years he was president of the Ragged
                    School Union. He was also one of the principal founders of reformatory and
                    refuge unions, young men’s Christian associations, and working men’s institutes.
                    He took an active interest in foreign missions, and was president of several of
                    the most important philanthropic and religious societies of London. He died 1st
                    October 1885. By his marriage to Lady Emily, daughter of the fifth Earl Cowper,
                    he left a large family, and was succeeded by his eldest son Anthony, who
                    committed suicide shortly afterwards.</p>
