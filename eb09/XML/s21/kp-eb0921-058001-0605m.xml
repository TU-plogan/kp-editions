                <p><label type="entry">SEAL</label>. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> (vol. xv. p. 442) will be found a general account of the
                    distinguishing characteristics of the animals constituting the sub-order <hi
                    rend="italic">Pinnipedia</hi> of the order <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> and
                    their divisions into families and genera. It only remains to give some further
                    details respecting those members of the group to which the term “seal” is
                    properly restricted (the sub-family <hi rend="italic">Phocinae),</hi> especially
                    those which inhabit the British coasts.</p>
                <p>Although seals swim and dive with the greatest ease, often remaining as much as a
                    quarter of an hour or more below the surface, and are dependent for their
                    sustenance entirely on living prey captured in the water, all the species
                    frequently resort to sandy beaches, rocks, or icefloes, either to sleep or to
                    bask in the sun, and especially for the purpose of bringing forth their young.
                    The latter appears to be the universal habit, and, strange as it may seem, the
                    young seals—of some species at least—take to the water at first very
                    reluctantly, and have actually to be taught to swim by their parents. The number
                    of young produced is usually one annually, though occasionally two. They are at
                    first covered with a coat of very thick, soft, nearly white fur, and until it
                    falls off they do not usually enter the water. This occurs in the Greenland and
                    grey seal when from two to three weeks old, but in the common seal apparently
                    much earlier. One of this species born in the London Zoological Gardens had shed
                    its infantile woolly coat and was swimming and diving about in its pond within
                    three hours after its birth. The movements of the true seals upon the ground or
                    ice are very different from those of the <hi rend="italic">Otariae</hi> or eared
                    seals, which walk and run upon all four feet, the body being raised as in the
                    case of ordinary quadrupeds. The hinder limbs (by which mainly they propel
                    themselves though the water) are on land always perfectly passive, stretched
                    backwards, with the soles of the feet applied to each other, and often raised to
                    avoid contact with the ground. Sometimes the fore limbs are equally passive,
                    being placed close to the sides of the body, and motion is then effected by a
                    shuffling or wriggling action produced by the muscles of the trunk. When,
                    however, there is any necessity for a more rapid mode of progression, the
                    animals use the fore paws, either alternately or simultaneously, pressing the
                    palmar surface on the ground and lifting and dragging the body forwards in a
                    succession of short jumps. In this way they manage to move so fast that a man
                    has to step out beyond a walk to keep up with them; but such rapid action costs
                    considerable effort, and they very soon become heated and exhausted. These
                    various modes of progression appear to be common to all species as far as has
                    been observed.</p>
                <p>Most kinds of seals are gregarious and congregate, especially at the breeding
                    season, in immense herds. Such is the habit of the Greenland seal <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phoca groenlandica),</hi> which resorts in the spring to the
                    ice-floes of the North Sea, around Jan Mayen Island, where about 200,000 are
                    killed annually by the crews of the Scotch, Dutch, and Norwegian sealing
                    vessels. Others, like the common seal of the British islands <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phoca vitulina),</hi> though having a wide geographical range, are never met
                    with in such large numbers or far away from land. This species is stationary all
                    the year round, but some have a regular season of migration, moving south in
                    winter and north in summer. They are usually harmless, timid, inoffensive
                    animals, though, being polygamous, the old males often fight desperately with
                    each other, their skins being frequently found covered with wounds and scars.
                    They are greatly attached to their young, and remarkably docile and easily
                    trained when in captivity; indeed, although there would seem little in the
                    structure or habits of the seal to fit it by nature to be a companion of man,
                    there is perhaps no wild animal which attaches itself so readily to the person
                    who takes care of and feeds it. They appear to have much curiosity, and it is a
                    very old and apparently well-attested observation that they are strongly
                    attracted by musical sounds. Their sense of smell is very acute, and their voice
                    varies from a harsh bark or grunt to a plaintive bleat. Seals feed chiefly on
                    fish, of which they consume enormous quantities; some, however, subsist largely
                    on crustaceans, especially species of <hi rend="italic">Gammarus,</hi> which
                    swarm in the northern seas, also on molluscs, echinoderms, and even occasionally
                    sea-birds, which they seize when swimming or floating on the water.</p>
                <p>Although the true seals do not possess the beautiful under-fur (“seal-skin” of
                    the furriers) which makes the skin of the sea-bears or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Otariae</hi> so precious, their hides are still sufficiently valuable as
                    articles of commerce, together with the oil yielded by their fat, to subject
                    them to a devastating persecution, by which their numbers are being continually
                    diminished (see below, p. 581 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi></p>
                <p>Two species of seals only are met with regularly on the British coasts, the
                    common seal and the grey seal. The<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0606-0581"/> common seal <hi rend="italic">(Phoca
                    vitulina)</hi> is a constant resident in all suitable localities round the
                    Scottish, Irish, and English coasts, from which it has not been driven away by
                    the molestations of man. Although, naturally, the most secluded and
                    out-of-the-way spots are selected as their habitual dwelling-places, there are
                    few localities where they may not be occasionally met with. Within the writer’s
                    knowledge, one was seen not many years ago lying on the shingly beach at so
                    populous a place as Brighton, and another was lately caught in the river
                    Welland, near Stamford, 30 miles from the sea. They frequent bays, inlets, and
                    estuaries, and are often seen on sandbanks or mudflats left dry at low tide,
                    and, unlike some of their congeners, are not found on the ice-floes of the open
                    sea, nor, though gregarious, are very large numbers ever seen in one spot. The
                    young are produced at the end of May or beginning of June. They feed chiefly on
                    fish, and the destruction they occasion among salmon is well known to Scottish
                    fishermen. The common seal is widely distributed, being found not only on the
                    European and American coasts bordering the Atlantic Ocean but also in the North
                    Pacific. It is from 4 to 5 feet in length, and variable in colour, though
                    usually yellowish grey, with irregular spots of dark brown or black above and
                    yellowish white beneath. The grey seal <hi rend="italic">(Halichoerus
                    grypus)</hi> is of considerably larger size, the males attaining when fully
                    adult a length of 8 feet from nose to end of hind feet. The form of the skull
                    and the simple characters of the molar teeth distinguish it generically from the
                    common seal. It is of a yellowish grey colour, lighter beneath, and with dark
                    grey spots or blotches, but, like most other seals, is liable to great
                    variations of colour according to age. The grey seal appears to be restricted to
                    the North Atlantic, having been rarely seen on the American coasts, but not
                    farther south than Nova Scotia; it is chiefly met with on the coasts of Ireland,
                    England, Scotland, Norway and Sweden, including the Baltic and Gulf of Bothnia,
                    and Iceland, though it does not appear to range farther north. It is apparently
                    not migratory, and its favourite breeding places are rocky islands, the young
                    being born in the end of September or beginning of October.</p>
                <p>Other species of seals inhabiting the northern seas, of which stragglers have
                    occasionally visited the British coasts, are the small ringed seal or “floe-rat”
                    of the sealers <hi rend="italic">(Phoca hispida),</hi> the Greenland or harp
                    seal <hi rend="italic">(Phoca groenlandica),</hi> the hooded or bladder-nosed
                    seal <hi rend="italic">(Cystophora cristata),</hi> and possibly the Bearded seal
                    <hi rend="italic">(Phoca barbata),</hi> though of the last there is no certain
                    evidence. The general characters and geographical distribution of the remaining
                    species of the group are indicated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> vol. xv. p. 442. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">h. f.)</hi><hi

                <p>From a commercial point of view seals may be divided into two groups, —hair seals
                    and fur seals. The former are valued for the oil they yield and for their skins,
                    which are converted into leather, and the latter for their skins alone. The fur
                    seals are provided with a dense soft under-fur like velvet and a quantity of
                    long loose exterior hair, which has to be removed in dressing the hides. Hair
                    seals are either entirely without under-fur or possess it in too small a
                    quantity to render the skins of much commercial value as furs. The two groups
                    correspond to the two divisions of eared seals and earless seals described above
                    (see also vol. xv. pp. 442-443).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    for the fur seals, in allusion to the different character of the skin in the two
                    groups.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Hair Seals.—</hi> The principal hair seal
                    fisheries are those of Newfoundland and Labrador (area about 200 miles), the
                    Gulf of St Lawrence, Jan Mayen and the adjacent seas, Nova Zembla, the White Sea
                    and Arctic Ocean, the Caspian, and the North and South Pacific. The first-named
                    is by far the most important. To the immense icefields borne past these shores
                    during the spring months great herds of seals resort for the purpose of bringing
                    forth and suckling their young. These are usually produced in the last week of
                    February and increase rapidly in size. When born they weigh about 5 ft; in four
                    weeks the fat beneath the skin has increased to a depth of 3 to 4 inches, and
                    with the adhering skin weighs from 40 to 50 lb. At this age the animals are in
                    the best condition for being taken, as the oil then yielded is of the best
                    quality. They remain on the ice attended by their dams for about six weeks, when
                    they begin to take to the water, and it becomes much more difficult to capture
                    them. When a floe containing young seals is reached, the hunters take to the ice
                    armed with a pole or “gaff,” having a hook at one end and shod with iron at the
                    other. A blow on the nose from this quickly despatches the animal; by means of
                    the “scalping-knife” the skin with the fat adhering is then rapidly detached.
                    The fat and skins are rolled into bundles and dragged to the ship. When the ship
                    reaches port the skins are separated from the fat and salted for export to Great
                    Britain, where they are converted into leather. Of late years furriers have
                    succeeded in converting a few of the finer skins into ladies’ tippets. The fat
                    was formerly thrown into huge vats, where its own weight and the heat of the sun
                    extracted the oil, but in the improved modern process the fat is ground into
                    minute pieces by machinery and then steamed; the oil, after being exposed for a
                    time in glass-covered tanks to the action of the sun’s rays, is barrelled for
                    exportation. The greater part of it goes tβ England, where it is largely
                    employed both as an illuminant and as a lubricant. It is also used for tanning
                    purposes and in the manufacture of the finer kinds of soap.</p>
                <p>From 8000 to 10,000 men embark annually from Newfoundland on this pursuit. The
                    steamers, which are rapidly superseding sailing vessels, are stoutly timbered,
                    sheathed with iron and wood, and provided with iron-plated stems; they carry
                    from 150 to 300 men each, and make two, and sometimes when very successful even
                    three, trips in the season. From 20 to 25 steamships in all are engaged in this
                    industry, 6 of these being from Dundee, Scotland. The Dundee vessels arrive in
                    Newfoundland in February and there ship their crews; at the close of the sealing
                    season they proceed to the northern whale fishery and return home in October. A
                    “close time” for seals is now established by law. Sailing vessels cannot clear
                    for this fishery before 1st March, nor can steamers before 10th March. After the
                    young seals have taken to the water, the steamers in their second trips engage
                    in the pursuit of the old breeding seals till the middle or end of May. These
                    are taken either by shooting them or clubbing them when congregated in herds on
                    the ice. This practice, which is most injurious to the fishery, has of late been
                    partially abandoned, by an agreement among the owners of vessels not to continue
                    operations beyond 30th April. The failures and disappointments of the voyage are
                    numerous, many vessels returning to port with few seals or even with none. The
                    prizes, however, are so enormous that there is no hesitation in embarking
                    capital in the enterprise. It is no uncommon event for a steamer to return two
                    or three weeks after leaving port laden to the gunwale with seals. As many as
                    42,000 have been brought in by a single steamer, the value at two and a half
                    dollars per seal being $105,000 (£21,875). The men on board the steamers share
                    one-third of the proceeds of the voyage among them; the remainder goes to the
                    owners who equip and provision the vessels. In sailing vessels the men get
                    one-half the proceeds. The number of seals taken annually ranges from 350,000 to
                    500,000. In the three years 1877, 1878, and 1881 the average take was 436,413,
                    valued at £213,937. Between 1881 and 1886 the returns fell below this average
                    owing to the heavy ice, which comparatively few vessels succeeded in
                    penetrating. The large number of young seals which escaped during these years
                    will improve the fishery in the future.</p>
                <p>In the seas around Newfoundland and Labrador there are four species of seals,—the
                    bay seal, the harp, the hood, and the square flipper. The first of these
                    frequents the mouths of rivers and harbours and is never found on the ice. The
                    harp, so called from a curved line of dark spots on its back making a figure
                    somewhat resembling an ancient harp, is by far the most numerous, and is <hi

                    their<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n607/mode/1up"

                    the nose of the males, which they can inflate at pleasure for protection, are
                    much larger than the harps, but their oil is not of such good quality. But few
                    square flippers are taken; they are large seals from 12 to 16 feet in length,
                    and are believed to be identical with the great Greenland seals. The seals
                    frequenting these seas are migratory. In May, attended by their young, they
                    commence their northerly movements to the Greenland seas, where they spend two
                    or three months, and in September begin their southerly migration, moving along
                    the coast of Labrador, feeding in its fiords and bays. One division passes
                    through the Straits of Belle Isle into the Gulf of St Lawrence, the other along
                    the east coast of Newfoundland. By the close of the year they reach the Great
                    Banks, their southern headquarters, and early in February commence their
                    northerly movement to meet the ice on which their young are to be brought
                    forth.</p>
                <p>The Newfoundland fishery was of slight importance till the beginning of the 19th
                    century. At first the seals were taken in nets; the next method was shooting
                    them from large boats, which left shore about the middle of April. Afterwards
                    small schooners were employed, and a rapid expansion of the fishery followed.
                    Over 100 of these small vessels used to leave the port of St John’s, and as many
                    more the ports of Conception Bay. In 1795 the whole catch of seals was but 5000.
                    In 1805 it reached 81,000; in 1815,126,000; in 1822, 306,983. The largest
                    catches on record were in 1830, when 558,942 seals were taken; in 1831, 686,836;
                    1843, 651,370; and in 1844, 685,530. The following table shows the number of
                    seals taken in some recent years :—</p>

                <p>Of late years an increasing number of steamers from St John’s have resorted to
                    the Gulf of St Lawrence as well as small sailing vessels from the southern ports
                    of Newfoundland. A few residents of the Magdalen Islands also pursue the seals
                    on the Gulf ice, and the Canadians carry on a seal fishery along the shore by
                    means of nets both in spring and autumn. The nets are made of strong hempen
                    cord, some of them very large and costing with the anchors and gear as much as
                    £1500 each. This fishery is carried on from Blanc Juberlis Bay to Cape Whittle.
                    The number taken averages about 70,000 to 80,000.</p>
                <p>Next in importance is the seal fishery carried on between Greenland, Spitzbergen,
                    and the island of Jan Mayen,—between 68° and 74° N. lat. and 3° E. and 17° W.
                    long. In most years, however, the seals are taken mainly in the vicinity of Jan
                    Mayen. The fishery is carried on by the British, Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, and
                    Germans. The number taken by the British vessels about equals that taken by all
                    the others together. The species taken are the same as on the Newfoundland
                    coast, the harp or saddleback and the hood or bladder-nose. The breeding season
                    is about three weeks later than in the case of the Newfoundland seals, the young
                    being brought forth between the 16th and the 22d of March. The method of capture
                    is almost the same as that of the Newfoundland hunters. Steamers are now almost
                    exclusively employed. The only British ports now engaged in the enterprise are
                    Dundee and Peterhead. During the twelve years 1873 to 1885 the number of British
                    vessels taking part in it was from 14 to 21, the number of men varying from 900
                    to 1200, and the number of seals taken ranging from 35,000 to 75,000. The total
                    number of seals taken by these vessels during the ten years ending 1884 was
                    452,013. Formerly, from 1500 to 2700 men were employed, and the number of seals
                    taken ranged from 50,000 to 125,000. The decline has been largely caused by the
                    reckless and barbarous way in which the fishery has been conducted, the practice
                    of seal-hunters of all nations having been to reach the seals soon after the
                    young were born, and then to watch for the mothers as they came to suckle them
                    and shoot them without mercy, leaving the young to die in thousands of
                    starvation on the ice. The consequence is that the herds are not now a twentieth
                    part of their former size. Newfoundland hunters, on the other hand, do not
                    disturb the seals till they are grown and about to leave their mothers, the old
                    seals not being killed till a later date. By an international treaty between
                    England and Norway—the two nations most interested—a “close season” has been
                    established in the Jan Mayen fishery. The Dundee and Peterhead steamers are
                    chiefly manned by Shetlanders, who are taken on board at Lerwick. The vessels
                    make the ice from the 15th to the 20th March and commence the chase in the
                    destructive way already described. They follow up the capture of the young seals
                    in April, when they are better worth taking. Then they proceed to separate the
                    skins from the fat. The former are salted on board, and the fat is stowed in
                    tanks. In May the pursuit of the old seals on the ice commences and continues
                    till the 16th, when it is time to proceed to the whale fishery. The oil is not
                    manufactured till the vessels reach home late in the autumn. As the blubber
                    undergoes decay in the tanks, the oil is not so good in quality as that made in
                    Newfoundland from the fresh fat.</p>
                <p>The Jan Mayen fishery commenced in 1840. In that year 13 British vessels and 650
                    men engaged in it, and 17,300 seals were taken. The Norwegians and other
                    nationalities also took part in it. Steamers were introduced in 1858. The
                    following table shows the growth and decline of the fishery :—</p>

                <p>The Norwegian vessels are all steamers, sheathed with wood and iron, the crews
                    averaging forty-six men. They belong principally to Tönsberg, but Tromsö also
                    sends out a number of small vessels to hunt adult seals. The total annual
                    product has reached $300,000. Over twenty Norwegian and Swedish steamers are
                    engaged in this fishery. Since about the year 1873 or 1874 the Norwegians and
                    Swedes have discovered a new fishing-ground for adult seals off the coast of
                    Greenland between Iceland and Cape Farewell. It is carried on in the months of
                    June and July. The seals taken are all of the hood kind. At one time the Jan
                    Mayen fishery averaged 200,000 seals annually among all the nationalities
                    engaged. It does not now exceed 120,000 to 130,000.</p>
                <p>The Danes, the Eskimo, and the half-breeds carry on a seal-fishery off the
                    western coast of Greenland between Cape Farewell and 79° N. lat. The seals taken
                    are chiefly the floe or spotted seal and the square flipper. Rink, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Greenland,</hi> estimates the annual number taken at 89,000, but
                    at present it does not exceed 50,000, as the seals are becoming scarcer. The oil
                    is made at the Danish settlements on the coast, and the skins are dried, not
                    salted, and both are shipped to Denmark.</p>
                <p>The fisheries of Nova Zembla, once productive, have declined in value, and are
                    now carried on by only five vessels, which reach the island about the end of
                    June. The fishermen commence with hunting the seal and the walrus and afterwards
                    fish for the common trout. Five kinds of seals are found here, the chief being
                    the <hi rend="italic">Phoca vitulina</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Phoca
                    groenlandica.</hi> The number taken is small.</p>
                <p>The Russians carry on a seal-fishery on the eastern and western coasts of the
                    White Sea, in the bays of the Dwina and the Mezen and on the coast of Kanin. The
                    species is the <hi rend="italic">Phoca groenlandica.</hi> These seals live in
                    the high regions of the polar seas from May till September, and appear later in
                    the gulfs and bays of the Arctic Ocean, where the young are born on the floating
                    ice early in February. Soon after the hunt commences and lasts till the end of
                    March. On the eastern coast of the White Sea the chase is pursued over a space
                    of 230 miles. Two thousand hunters assemble at Kedy, near Cape Voronoff. High
                    wooden towers are erected along the shore, whence observers watch the movements
                    of the seals. Hunting sheds for the men are also erected. When a herd of seals
                    is observed, the men go out on the ice, drawing small boats after them, and kill
                    the young and old with clubs and guns. To approach the seals without being
                    discovered, the hunters muffle themselves in long white shirts and advance
                    slowly and noiselessly over the snow. They are often exposed to the greatest
                    dangers, owing to the sudden movements of the ice. In following up the chase in
                    April they use sailing boats 22 feet long, with an iron-plated bottom, which
                    they draw up on the ice, where a vast encampment is formed, and shooting-parties
                    search for the seals. On the western shore of the White Sea the seal-hunt is
                    less productive than on the eastern. The hunters meet at Devyatoe, a few miles
                    north of the river Ponoi. About 500 men engage in the chase. The Russians take
                    each year in the Arctic Ocean and the White Sea from 2,500,000 to 3,000,000 lb
                    of seal blubber. Allowing an average of 40 lb per seal, this would imply the
                    capture of 65,000 to 75,000 seals. The skins are made into leather.</p>
                <p>The most extensive and valuable seal-fishery of the Russians is in the Caspian
                    Sea, where the seals <hi rend="italic">(Phoca caspica)</hi> are plentiful. They
                    pass the summer in deep water, and in the autumn resort to the eastern basin,
                    where the ice forms earliest and breaks up latest. Here the pairing takes place
                    on the ice in December and January. The seals are also hunted at the mouths of
                    the Volga and the Ural, and in the southern part of the sea, on the islands of
                    the Gulf of Apsheron. There arc three methods of hunting the seals,—killing them
                    with clubs (the commonest and most successful way), shooting them on the ice,
                    and taking them in nets. From 130,000 to 140,000 are taken annually.</p>
                <p>A few seals are taken off the coast of California and Washington Territory. In
                    the South Pacific, off the coast of Chili, only a few are now taken where
                    formerly they were captured by the thousand.</p>
                <p>The elephant seal or sea elephant <hi rend="italic">(Macrorhinus leonina)</hi>
                    was formerly taken in great numbers at various places for the sake of<pb

                    the past; since about 1875 it has been carried on solely from New London in
                    Connecticut, the fleet numbering only four or five vessels. The yield in 1880
                    was 42,000 gallons of oil, worth $21,420.</p>
                <p>The average number of hair seals taken annually may be estimated as follows

                <p><hi rend="italic">Fur Seals.—</hi> The fur seals occupy two distinct areas. None
                    exist on the shores of the North Atlantic. South of the equator they extend from
                    near the tropics to the region of antarctic ice. By far the most important and
                    valuable fur seal fisheries are those carried on at St Paul’s and St George’s
                    Islands, belonging to the Pribyloff group,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    a characteristic pinniped of the Pribyloff Islands and other parts of Alaska. It
                    has very little commercial value; but by the natives along the Behring Sea coast
                    of Alaska, Kamchatka, and the Kuriles it is highly prized. From the hide they
                    make coverings for their boats; the intestines are made into garments; the

                    whiskers are sold to the Chinese, who use them as pickers to their opium pipes,
                    and in several ceremonies in their joss houses.</p></note> off the coast of
                    Alaska, at the Commander Islands in the Behring Sea, and that in the same sea
                    700 miles west of the Alaskan seal islets. The species found here is the
                    northern fur seal <hi rend="italic">(Callorhinus ursinus).</hi> The males attain
                    mature size about the eighth year, when their length is from 7 to 8 feet, their
                    girth from 7 to 8 feet, and their weight, when in full flesh, from 500 to 700
                    lb. The females are full grown at four years old, when they measure 4 feet in
                    length, 2 ½ in girth, and weigh from 80 to 100 lb. The yearlings weigh from 30
                    to 40 lb. The seals resort to these islands late in spring chiefly for
                    reproductive purposes, making their appearance from the southward. The number
                    annually visiting St Paul’s and St George’s is estimated at five millions. About
                    the middle of April the males begin to arrive and take their places along the
                    shore in “the rookeries,” as the breeding-grounds are called. The younger males
                    are prevented from landing by the older, and are compelled either to stay in the
                    water or to go to the uplands. By the middle of June all the males have
                    assembled, and then the females begin to appear. Each old male seal collects
                    from ten to fifteen or more females, whom he guards most jealously. The males
                    fight furiously, “so that night and day the aggregated sound is like that of an
                    approaching railway train.” By the middle of July the family circle is complete.
                    Soon after landing the female gives birth to one pup, weighing about 6 lb, which
                    she nurses at wide intervals without any affection. Pairing takes place soon
                    afterwards. No food is taken by the breeding males while on the rocks,—a period
                    of three to four months. When the males leave after this long fast, they are
                    reduced to half their former weight. In the end of October and middle of
                    November all leave the island, the young males going last and by themselves.</p>
                <p>The killing of the seals is carefully regulated. No females are killed, and only
                    a certain number of young “bachelor” seals whose skins are of superior quality.
                    These younger male seals are spread out on the slopes above the rookeries to
                    rest. A party of men armed with clubs of hard wood quietly creep between them
                    and the shore, and at a given signal start up with a shout and drive the seals
                    inland. When they reach the killing-grounds near the villages, they select those
                    that are two or three years old and seem likely to yield the most valuable fur.
                    These they despatch with a club. The skins are carefully salted for exportation.
                    Besides the skin each seal yields about a gallon and a half of oil. But it is
                    not used, as its rank odour renders refining very costly. The value of the skins
                    in the raw state varies from five to twenty-five dollars each; at times, when
                    furs are specially fashionable, a higher price is obtained. The quality of the
                    Alaska furs is superior, but those obtained in the South Shetland and antarctic
                    regions are rated best. A cloak of the richest fur seal, a yard deep or more,
                    will cost from £25 to £40. The roots of the loose exterior hairs penetrate
                    deeper into the skin than those of the fur or short hair, and can readily be cut
                    by paring on the fleshy side, without touching the roots of the fur; the long
                    hairs then drop off, leaving the valuable fur below in a sheet like pure velvet.
                    The number of seals killed on the Pribyloff Islands is limited to 100,000
                    annually, and with the precautions taken they increase as fast as if left to
                    themselves, “for when the number of males is in excess, the continual fighting
                    ou the rookeries destroys many of both females and young, which get trampled to
                    death.”</p>
                <p>Alaska was purchased from Russia by the United States in 1867. The Pribyloff
                    Islands were leased to the Alaska Commercial Com pany of San Francisco for
                    twenty years, from 1st May 1870, under Act of Congress approved 1st July 1870.
                    The annual rental is $55,000 with a tax of $2·62 on each skin taken,—making the
                    total rental $317,000 per annum. The Alaska Commercial Company have leased the
                    Commander Islands from the Russian Government. About 30,000 fur seals are
                    annually taken there.</p>
                <p>The fishery at the mouth of the Straits of Juan de Fuca and its vicinity is
                    carried on by Americans and Canadians. The seals are captured in the waters, the
                    largest number being secured at and about Cape Flattery, to the extent of 15,000
                    annually. The Lobos Islands, at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, are under the
                    protection of the Government of Uruguay, the number of seals annually taken
                    being limited to about 12,000. Some of the numerous islands about Cape Horn are
                    the breeding-places of fur seals, as are also the South Shetland Islands farther
                    south. This Cape Horn region is visited by a fleet of seven to ten vessels
                    belonging to New London and Stonington, Connecticut, and also by a few Chilian
                    and other South American vessels. Only occasionally does a vessel visit the
                    South Shetlands, though the quality of skins to be secured there is very
                    superior. The headquarters for the fleet between seasons is at Punta Arenas, or
                    Sandy Point, in the Straits of Magellan. The American fleet in 1880 numbered
                    nine vessels of 1192 tons. The result of the fishery was 9275 skins, worth
                    $90,431. Early in the 19th century the Falkland Islands abounded in fur seals,
                    but they have been exterminated. The number now (1886) annually secured there
                    does not average more than 500; in some years only 50 skins are taken.</p>
                <p>There are annually received at London from the Cape of Good Hope about 10,000
                    sealskins taken at various islands in the Southern Indian Ocean and along the
                    south-west coast of Africa. A few fur seals are taken in the Okhotsk Sea.</p>
                <p>Nearly all the fur-seal skins find their way to London, where they are plucked,
                    dressed, and dyed. A few, however, are prepared in New York. At the seal islands
                    they are salted and baled with the fur inside, and in this manner shipped to
                    London. The annual yield of the fur-seal fisheries of the world is about
                    185,000.</p>
