                <p><label type="entry">SCEPTICISM</label> signifies etymologically a state of doubt
                    or indecision in the face of different mutually conflicting statements
                    (σκϵπτομαι, I consider, reflect, hesitate, doubt). It is implied, moreover, that
                    this doubt is not merely a stage in the road to certainty and true knowledge.
                    The provisional suspense of judgment recommended by Descartes and others as the
                    true beginning of philosophy is no more than a passing phase of the individual’s
                    mind in his search for truth. But the doubt of the sceptic is professedly the
                    last result of investigation; it is the renunciation of the search for truth on
                    the ground that truth or real knowledge is unattainable by man. An account of
                    the chief historical appearances of scepticism and its different motives will
                    serve to illustrate and amplify this statement, and will lead up to any further
                    considerations of a general nature. At the outset, and in general terms,
                    scepticism may be summarily defined as a thoroughgoing impeachment of man’s
                    power to know—as a denial of the possibility of objective knowledge.</p>
                <p>Trust, not distrust, is the primitive attitude of the mind. What is put before
                    us, whether by the senses or by the statements of others, is instinctively
                    accepted as a veracious report, till experience has proved the possibility of
                    deception. In the history of philosophy, in the same way, affirmation precedes
                    negation; dogmatism goes before scepticism. And this must be so, because the
                    dogmatic systems are, as it were, the food of scepticism; without them it would
                    be without motive, without a <hi rend="italic">basis operandi.</hi> Accordingly,
                    we find that sceptical thought did not make its appearance till a succession of
                    positive theories as to the nature of the real, by their mutual inconsistency,
                    had suggested the possibility that they might all alike be false. The Sophistic
                    epoch of Greek philosophy was, in great part, such a negative reaction against
                    the luxuriance of self-confident assertion in the nature-philosophies of the
                    preceding age. Though scepticism as a definite school of opinion may be said, in

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0400-0379"/> with old precedent, to date only from the
                    time of Pyrrho of Elis, there can be no doubt that the main currents of
                    Sophistic thought were sceptical in the wider sense of that term. The Sophists
                    were the first in Greece to dissolve knowledge into individual and momentary
                    opinion (Protagoras), or dialectically to deny the possibility of knowledge
                    (Gorgias). In these two examples we see how the weapons forged by the dogmatic
                    philosophers to assist in the establishment of their own theses arc sceptically
                    turned against philosophy in general. As every attempt to rationalize nature
                    implies a certain process of criticism and interpretation to which the data of
                    sense arc subjected, and in which they are, as it were, transcended, the
                    antithesis of reason and sense is formulated early in the history of
                    speculation. The opposition, being taken as absolute, implies the impeachment of
                    the veracity of the senses in the interest of the rational truth proclaimed by
                    the philosophers in question. Among the pre-Socratic nature-philosophers of
                    Greece, Heraclitus and the Eleatics are the chief representatives of this
                    polemic against the “lying witness” of the senses. The diametrical opposition of
                    the grounds on which the veracity of the senses is impugned by the two
                    philosophies (viz., by Heraclitus because they testify to an apparent permanence
                    and identity in things, by the Eleatics because they testify to an apparent
                    multiplicity and change) was in itself suggestive of sceptical reflexion.
                    Moreover, although these philosophers are not in any sense themselves sceptical,
                    their arguments are easily susceptible of a wider application. Accordingly we
                    find that the arguments by which Heraclitus supported his theory of the
                    universal flux are employed by Protagoras to undermine the possibility of
                    objective truth, by dissolving all knowledge into the momentary sensation or
                    persuasion of the individual. The idea of an objective flux, or law of change
                    constituting the reality of things, is abandoned, and subjective points of sense
                    alone remain,— which is tantamount to eliminating the real from human
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>Still more unequivocal was the sceptical nihilism expressed by Gorgias in his
                    three celebrated theses:—(1) nothing exists; (2) if anything existed, it would
                    be unknowable; (3) if anything existed and were knowable, the knowledge of it
                    could not be communicated. The arguments of his book, “Concerning the
                    Non-existent, or Nature,” were drawn from the dialectic which the Eleatics had
                    directed against the existence of the phenomenal world. Rut they are no longer
                    used as indirect proofs of a universe of pure and unitary Being. The prominence
                    given by most of the Sophists to rhetoric, their cultivation of a subjective
                    readiness as the essential equipment for life, their substitution of persuasion
                    for conviction, all mark the sceptical undertone of their teaching. This
                    attitude of indifference to real knowledge passed in the younger and less
                    reputable generation into a corroding moral scepticism which recognized no good
                    but pleasure and no right but might.</p>
                <p>What Socrates chiefly did was to recreate the instinct for truth and the belief
                    in the possibility of its attainment. The scientific impulse thus communicated
                    was sufficient to drive scepticism into the background during the great age of
                    Greek philosophy (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the hundred years preceding
                    Aristotle’s death, 323 B.C.). The captious logic of the Megaric school,—in which
                    the Eleatic influence was strong,—their devotion to eristic and the elaboration
                    of fallacies, was indeed in some cases closely related to sceptical results. The
                    school has been considered with some truth to form a connecting link with the
                    later scepticism, just as the contemporary Cynicism and Cyrenaicism may be held
                    to be imperfect preludes to Stoicism and Epicureanism. The extreme nominalism of
                    some of the</p>
                <p>Cynics also, who denied the possibility of any but identical judgments, must be
                    similarly regarded as a solvent of knowledge. But with these insignificant
                    exceptions it holds true that, after the sceptical wave marked by the Sophists,
                    scepticism does not reappear till after the exhaustion of the Socratic impulse
                    in Aristotle.</p>
                <p>The first man in antiquity whose scepticism gave name to his doctrine was Pyrrho
                    of Elis (about 360-270 B. C. ). Pyrrho proceeded with the army of Alexander the
                    Great as far as India, in the company of Anaxarchus, the Democritean
                    philosopher. He afterwards returned to his native city, where he lived in poor
                    circumstances, but highly honoured by his fellow-citizens. Pyrrho himself left
                    no writings, and the accounts of his doctrine arc mainly derived from his pupil
                    Timon of Phlius (about 325-235 B. c. ). Timon is called the Sillographist, from
                    his satirical poem (Σtλλoι), in which all the philosophers of Greece are held up
                    to ridicule, with the exception of Xenophanes, who honestly sought, and Pyrrho,
                    who succeeded in finding, the truth. Other disciples are mentioned besides
                    Timon, but the school was short-lived, its place being presently taken by the
                    more moderate and cultured doubt of the New Academy. Zeller sums up Pyrrho’s
                    teaching in three propositions: —We know nothing about the nature of things;
                    hence tho right attitude towards them is to withhold judgment; the necessary
                    result of withholding judgment is imperturbability. The technical language of
                    the school expresses the first position by the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >ακαταληψία</hi>; things are wholly incomprehensible or inaccessible;
                    against every statement the opposite may be advanced with equal justice <hi
                        rend="italic">(ίσoσθeveιa των λόγων).</hi> The sceptical watchword which
                    embodies the second position is ϵ <hi rend="italic">πoχη,</hi> reserve of
                    judgment, or, as it is put by Timon, <hi rend="italic">ov8ev μάλλον,</hi> that
                    is, no one assertion is truer than another. This complete suspense of opinion is
                    also expressed by the terms <hi rend="italic">appcψia,</hi> or equilibrium, and
                        <hi rend="italic">aψaσιa,</hi> or refusal to speak, as well as by other
                    expressions. The Pyrrhonists were consistent enough to extend their doubt even
                    to their own principle of doubt. They thus attempted to make their scepticism
                    universal, and to escape the reproach of basing it upon a fresh dogmatism.
                    Mental imperturbability <hi rend="italic">(αταραξία)</hi> was the result to be
                    attained by cultivating such a frame of mind. Tho happiness or satisfaction of
                    the individual was the end which dominated this scepticism as well as the
                    contemporary systems of Stoicism and Epicureanism, and all three philosophies
                    place it in tranquillity or self-centred indifference. Scepticism withdraws the
                    individual completely into himself from a world of which he can know nothing. It
                    is men’s opinions or unwarranted judgments about things, say the sceptics, which
                    betray them into desire, and painful effort, and disappointment. From all this a
                    man is delivered who abstains from judging one state to be preferable to
                    another. But, as complete inactivity would have been synonymous with death, it
                    appears to have been admitted that the sceptic, while retaining his
                    consciousness of the complete uncertainty enveloping every step, might follow
                    custom in the ordinary affairs of life.</p>
                <p>The scepticism of the New Academy (or, to speak more strictly, of the Middle
                    Academy, under Arcesilaus and Carneades, founders respectively of the so-called
                    second and third Academies) differed very little from that of the Pyrrhonists.
                    The differences asserted by later writers are not borne out on investigation.
                    But the attitude maintained by the Academics was chiefly that of a negative
                    criticism of the views of others, in particular of the somewhat crude and
                    imperious dogmatism of the Stoics. They also, in the absence of certainty,
                    allowed a large scope to probability as a motive to action, and defended their
                    doctrine on this point with greater care and skill. The<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0401-0380"/> whole position was stated with more urbanity
                    and culture, and was supported, by Carneades in particular, by argumentation at
                    once more copious and more acute. It seems also true that the Academics were
                    less overborne than the Pyrrhonists by the practical issue of their doubts
                    (imperturbability); their interest was more purely intellectual, and they had
                    something of the old delight in mental exercitation for its own sake. Arcesilas
                    or Arcesilaus (about 315-240 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> made the Stoic
                    theory of irresistible impressions (<hi rend="italic">ϕαvτασίαι
                        κaτaληπτικaί)</hi> the special object of his attack. Mere irresistibleness
                        (<hi rend="italic">κατάληψις</hi>), he maintained, is no criterion of truth,
                    since false perceptions may equally possess this power to sway the mind. He
                    seems chiefly to have supported his position by adducing the already well-known
                    arguments of former philosophers against the veracity of the senses, and he
                    evidently held that by these arguments the possibility of knowledge in general
                    was sufficiently subverted. We can know nothing, he concluded,—not even this
                    itself, that we know nothing. He denied that the want of knowledge reduces us to
                    inaction. Notions influence the will immediately, apart from the question of
                    their truth, and, in all questions of conduct, probability <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >(ΤΟ</hi> eυλoγov) is our sufficient guide, as it is our highest attainable
                    standard. It is stated that Arcesilaus made his negative criticism merely a
                    preliminary to the inculcation of a modified Platonism. But this account, though
                    not in itself incredible, is not borne out by any evidence at our disposal. The
                    theory of Carneades (213-129 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> represents the
                    highest development of Academic scepticism. The dogmatic system which Carneades
                    had in view was that of Chrysippus, the Stoic, whose main positions, whether in
                    the theory of knowledge, in morals, or in theology, he subjected to an acute and
                    thorough-going criticism. As to the criterion of truth, Carneades denied that
                    this could be found in any impression, as such; for in order to prove its truth
                    an impression must testify, not only to itself, but also to the objects causing
                    it. We find, however, admittedly, that in many cases we are deceived by our
                    impressions; and, if this is so, there is no kind of impression which can be
                    regarded as guaranteeing its own truth. According to his own examples, it is
                    impossible to distinguish objects so much alike as is one egg to another; at a
                    certain distance the painted surface seems raised, and a square tower seems
                    round; an oar in water seems broken, and the neck-plumage of a pigeon assumes
                    different colours in the sun; objects on the shore seem moving as we pass by,
                    and so forth. The same applies, he argued, to purely intellectual ideas. Many
                    fallacies cannot be solved, and we cannot, for example, draw any absolute
                    distinction between much and little, or, in short, between any quantitative
                    differences. Our impressions, therefore, furnish us with no test of truth, and
                    we can derive no aid from the operations of the understanding, which are purely
                    formal, combining and separating ideas without giving any insight into their
                    validity. Besides this general criticism of knowledge, Carneades attacked the
                    cardinal doctrines of the Stoic school,—their doctrine of God and their proof of
                    divine providence from the evidences of design in the arrangements of the
                    universe. Many of his arguments are preserved to us in Cicero’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Academics</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De Natura Deorum.</hi>
                    His criticism of the contradictions involved in the Stoic idea of God really
                    constitutes the first discussion in ancient times of the personality of God, and
                    the difficulty of combining in one conception the characters of infinity and
                    individuality. As a positive offset against his scepticism, Carneades elaborated
                    more fully the Academic theory of probability, for which he employed the terms
                    ϵμϕασις and <hi rend="italic">πιθανότης.</hi> Being necessarily ignorant of the
                    relation of ideas to the objects they represent, we are reduced to judging them
                    by their relation to ourselves, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by their greater or
                    less clearness and appearance of truth. Though always falling short of
                    knowledge, this appearance of truth may be strong enough to determine us to
                    action. Carneades recognized three degrees of probability. The first or lowest
                    is where our impression of the truthfulness of an idea is derived simply from
                    the idea itself; the second degree is where that impression is confirmed by the
                    agreement of related ideas; if a careful investigation of all the individual
                    ideas bears out the same conclusion, we have the third and highest degree of
                    probability. In the first case, an idea is called probable (πιθανη); in the
                    second, probable and undisputed <hi rend="italic">(πιθavη καί
                    απερίσπαστος)</hi>; in the third, probable, undisputed, and tested <hi
                        rend="italic">(πiθavη καϊ απερίσπαστος καϊ περιωδενμενη).</hi> The
                    scepticism of Carneades was expounded by his successor Clitomachus, but the
                    Academy was soon afterwards (in the so-called fourth and fifth Academies)
                    invaded by the Eclecticism which about that time began to obliterate the
                    distinctions of philosophical doctrine which had hitherto separated the schools.
                    Cicero also, who in many respects was strongly attracted by the Academic
                    scepticism, finally took refuge in a species of Eclecticism based upon a
                    doctrine of innate ideas, and on the argument from the <hi rend="italic"
                        >consensus gentium.</hi></p>
                <p>The later scepticism—which is sometimes spoken of as the third sceptical
                    school—claimed to be a continuation of the earlier Pyrrhonism. Aenesidemus,
                    though not absolutely the first to renew this doctrine, is the first of whose
                    doctrine anything is known. He appears to have taught in Alexandria about the
                    beginning of the Christian era. Among the successors of Aenesidemus, the chief
                    names are those of Agrippa, whose dates cannot be determined, and the physician
                    Sextus Empiricus (about 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> whose <hi
                        rend="italic">Pyrrhonic Hypotyposes,</hi> and his work <hi rend="italic"
                        >Adversus Mathematicos,</hi> constitute a vast armoury of the weapons of
                    ancient scepticism. They are of the utmost value as an historical record. With
                    Saturninus, the pupil of Sextus, and Favorinus, the grammarian, ancient
                    scepticism may be said to disappear from history. What speculative power
                    remained was turned entirely into Neoplatonic channels. To Aenesidemus belongs
                    the first enumeration of the ten so-called tropes (τρόποι), or modes of
                    sceptical argument, though the arguments themselves were, of course, current
                    before his time. The first trope appeals to the different constitution of
                    different animals as involving different modes of perception; the second applies
                    the same argument to the individual differences which are found among men; the
                    third insists on the way in which the senses contradict one another, and
                    suggests that an endowment with more numerous senses would lead to a different
                    report as to the nature of things; the fourth argues from the variability of our
                    physical state and mental moods; the fifth brings forward the diversities of
                    appearance due to the position and distance of objects; the sixth calls

                    undergoes in quantity, temperature, colour, motion, &amp;c.; the eighth really
                    sums up the thought which underlies the whole series, when it argues from the

                    dependence of our impressions on custom, the new and strange impressing us much
                    more vividly than the customary; the tenth adduces the diversity of customs,
                    manners, laws, doctrines, and opinions among men. Aenesidemus likewise attacked

                    notion by Sextus Empiricus do we meet with the thought which furnished the nerve
                    of modern scepticism in Hume. The practical result of his scepticism Aenesidemus
                    sought, like the Pyrrhonists, in <hi rend="italic">αταραξία.</hi> He is somewhat
                    strangely said to have combined his scepticism with a revival of the philosophy
                    of Heraclitus; but the assertion perhaps rests, as Zeller contends, on a
                    confusion. To Agrippa is attributed the reduction of the sceptical tropes to
                    five. Of these, the first is based on the discrepancy of human opinions; the
                    second on the fact that every proof itself requires to be proved, which implies
                    a <hi rend="italic">regressus in infinitum;</hi> the third on the relativity of
                    our knowledge, which varies according to the constitution of the percipient and
                    the circumstances in which he perceives. The fourth is really a completion of
                    the second, and forbids the assumption of unproven propositions as the premises
                    of an argument. It is aimed at the dogmatists, who, in order to avoid the <hi
                        rend="italic">regressus in infinitum,</hi> set out from some principle
                    illegitimately assumed. The fifth seeks to show that reasoning is essentially of
                    the nature of a <hi rend="italic">circulus in probando,</hi> inasmuch as the
                    principle adduced in proof requires itself to be supported by that which it is
                    called in to prove. The attack made in several of these five tropes upon the
                    possibility of demonstration marks this enumeration as distinctly superior to
                    the first, which consists in the main of arguments derived from the fallibility
                    of the senses. The new point of view is maintained in the two tropes which were
                    the result of a further attempt at generalization. Nothing is self-evident, says
                    the first of these tropes, for, if all things were certain of themselves, men
                    would not differ as they do. Nor can anything be made certain by proof, says the
                    second, because we must either arrive in the process at something self-evident,
                    which is impossible, as has just been said, or we must involve ourselves in an
                    endless regress.</p>
                <p>When we review the history of ancient thought, we find, as Zeller puts it, that
                    “the general result of all sceptical inquiries lies in the proposition that
                    every assertion may be opposed by another, and every reason by reasons equally
                    strong—in the <hi rend="italic">ίσοσθϵveιa των λόγων.</hi> Or, as the same thing
                    may be expressed, what all sceptical proofs come back to is the relativity of
                    all our ideas. We can never know the nature of things as they are, but always
                    only the manner in which they appear to us. The criterion of the sceptic is the
                    appearance. Not even his own proof can claim truth and universal validity: he
                    does not assert; he only seeks to relate how a thing strikes him at the present
                    moment. And even when he expresses his doubts in the form of universal
                    statements they are intended to be included in the general uncertainty of
                    knowledge” <hi rend="italic">(Phil. d. Griechen,</hi> iii. 2, p. 58). Both
                    Zeller and Hegel, it may be added, remark upon the difference between the calm
                    of ancient scepticism and the perturbed state of mind evinced by many modern
                    sceptics. Universal doubt was the instrument which the sceptics of antiquity
                    recommended for the attainment of complete peace of mind; rest and satisfaction
                    can be attained, they say, in no other way. By the moderns, on the other hand,
                    doubt is portrayed, for the most part, as a state of unrest and painful
                    yearning. Even Hume, in various noteworthy passages of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Treatise,</hi> speaks of himself as recovering cheerfulness and mental tone
                    only by forgetfulness of his own arguments. His state of universal doubt, so far
                    from being painted as a desirable goal, is described by him as a “malady” or as
                    “philosophical melancholy and delirium.” The difference might easily be
                    interpreted either as a sign of sentimental weakness on the part of the moderns
                    or as a proof of the limitation of the ancient sceptics which rendered them more
                    easily satisfied in the absence of truth. It seems to prove, at all events, that
                    the ancient sceptics were more thoroughly convinced than their modern successors
                    of the reasonableness of their own attitude. But whether the ancients were the
                    better or the worse sceptics on that account is a nice question which need not
                    be decided here. It may be doubted, however, whether the thoroughgoing
                    philosophical scepticism of antiquity has any exact parallel in modern times,
                    with the single exception possibly of Hume’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Human
                        Nature.</hi> It is true we find many thinkers who deny the competency of
                    reason when it ventures in any way beyond the sphere of experience, and such men
                    are not unfrequently called sceptics. This is the sense in which Kant often uses
                    the term, and the usage is adopted by others,—for example, in the following
                    definition from Ueberweg’s <hi rend="italic">History of Philosophy</hi>:—“The
                    principle of scepticism is universal doubt, or at least doubt with regard to the
                    validity of all judgments respecting that which lies beyond the range of
                    experience.” The last characteristic, however, is not enough to constitute
                    scepticism, in the sense in which it is exemplified in the ancient sceptics.
                    Scepticism, to be complete, must hold that even within experience we do not
                    rationally conclude but are irrationally induced to believe. “In all the
                    incidents of life,” as Hume puts it, “we ought still to preserve our scepticism.
                    If we believe that fire warms, or water refreshes, 'tis only because it costs us
                    too much pains to think otherwise” <hi rend="italic">(Treatise,</hi> bk. i. iv.
                    7). This tone, which fairly represents the attitude of ancient sceptics, is rare
                    among the moderns, at least among those who are professed philosophers. It is
                    more easily matched in the unsystematic utterances of a man of the world like
                    Montaigne.</p>
                <p>One form of scepticism, however, may be claimed as an exclusively modern growth,
                    namely, philosophical scepticism in the interests of theological faith. These
                    sceptics are primarily Apologists. Their scepticism is not “de bonne foy”; it is
                    simply a means to the attainment of a further end. They find that the dogmas of
                    their church have often been attacked in the name of reason, and it may be that
                    some of the objections urged have proved hard to rebut. Accordingly, in an
                    access of pious rage, as it were, they turn upon reason to rend her. They deny
                    her claim to pronounce upon such matters; they go further, and dispute her
                    prerogative altogether. They endeavour to show that she is in contradiction with
                    herself, even on matters non-theological, and that everywhere this much vaunted
                    reason of man (la superbe raison) is the creature of custom and circumstance.
                    Thus the “imbecility” of reason becomes their warrant for the reception by
                    another organ—by faith—of that to which reason had raised objections. The Greeks
                    had no temptation to divide man in two in this fashion. When they were sceptics,
                    their scepticism had no ulterior motives; it was an end in itself. But this line
                    of argument was latent in Christian thought from the time when St Paul spoke of
                    the “foolishness” of preaching. Tertullian fiercely re-echoed the sentiment in
                    his polemic against the philosophers of antiquity :—“Crucifixus est Dei filius;
                    non pudet, quia pudendum est, Et mortuus est Dei filius; prorsus credibile est,
                    quia ineptum est. Et sepultus resurrexit; certum est, quia impossibile est.”
                    But, as Christianity became firmly established, Christian writers<note

                    reason and dogma, they laboured to reduce the doctrines of the church to a
                    rational system. This was the long task essayed by Scholasticism; and, though
                    the great Schoolmen of the 13th century refrained from attempting to rationalize
                    such doctrines as the Trinity and the Incarnation, they were far from
                    considering them as essentially opposed to reason. It was not till towards the
                    close of the Middle Ages that a sense of conflict between reason and revelation
                    became widely prevalent and took shape in the essentially sceptical theory of
                    the twofold nature of truth. Philosophical truth, as deduced from the teaching
                    of Aristotle, it was said, directly contradicts the teaching of the church,
                    which determines truth in theology; but the contradiction leaves the authority
                    of the latter unimpaired in its own sphere. It is difficult to believe that this
                    doctrine was ever put forward sincerely; in the most of those who professed it,
                    it was certainly no more than a veil by which they sought to cover their
                    heterodoxy and evade its consequences. Rightly divining as much, the church
                    condemned the doctrine as early as 1276. Nevertheless it was openly professed
                    during the period of the break up of Scholastic Aristotelianism. Pomponatius,
                    the Alexandrist of Padua (<hi rend="italic">οb</hi>. 1525), was one of its best
                    known advocates.</p>
                <p>The typical and by far the greatest example of the Christian sceptic is Pascal
                    (1623-1662). The form of the <hi rend="italic">Pensées</hi> forbids the attempt
                    to evolve from their detached utterances a completely coherent system. For,
                    though he declares at times “Le pyrrhonisme est le vrai,” “Se moquer de la
                    philosophie c’est vraiment philosopher,” or, again, “Humiliez-vous, raison
                    impuissante, taisez-vous, nature imbécile,” other passages might be quoted in
                    which he assumes the validity of reason within its own sphere. But what he
                    everywhere emphatically denies is the possibility of reaching by the unassisted
                    reason a satisfactory theory of things. The contradictions which meet us
                    everywhere are summed up and concentrated in the nature of man. Man is a
                    hopeless enigma to himself, till he sees himself in the light of revelation as a
                    fallen creature. The fall alone explains at once the nobleness and the meanness
                    of humanity; Jesus Christ is the only solution in which the baffled reason can
                    rest. These are the two points on which Pascal’s thought turns. “There is
                    nothing which is more shocking to our reason” than the doctrine of original sin;
                    yet, in his own words, “le noeud de notre condition prend ses replis et ses
                    tours dans cet abîme; de sorte que l’homme est plus inconcevable sans ce mystère
                    que ce mystère n’est inconcevable à l’homme.” Far, therefore, from being able to
                    sit in judgment upon the mysteries of the faith, reason is unable to solve its
                    own contradictions without aid from a higher source. In a somewhat similar
                    fashion, in the present century, Lamennais (in the first stage of his
                    speculations, represented by the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur l' Indifférence en
                        Matière Religieuse,</hi> 1817-21) endeavoured to destroy all rational
                    certitude in order to establish the principle of authority; and the same
                    profound distrust of the power of the natural reason to arrive at truth is
                    exemplified (though the allegation has been denied by the author) in the
                    writings of Cardinal Newman. In a different direction and on a larger scale,
                    Hamilton’s philosophy of the conditioned may be quoted as an example of the same
                    religious scepticism. Arguing from certain antinomies, said to be inherent in
                    reason as such, Hamilton sought to found theology (in great part at least) upon
                    our nescience, and to substitute belief for knowledge. He also imitated Pascal
                    at times in dilating upon the “impotence” and “imbecility” of our faculties;
                    but, as with Pascal, this was rather in reference to their incapacity to evolve
                    an</p>
                <p>“absolute” system than to their veracity in the ordinary details of experience.
                    The theological application and development of Hamilton’s arguments in Mansel's
                    Bampton Lectures <hi rend="italic">On the Limits of Religious Thought</hi>
                    marked a still more determined attack, in the interests of theology, upon the
                    competency of reason.</p>
                <p>Passing from this particular vein of sceptical or semi-sceptical thought, we
                    find, as we should expect, that the downfall of Scholasticism, and the conflict
                    of philosophical theories and religious confessions which ensued, gave a decided
                    impetus to sceptical reflexion. One of the earliest instances of this spirit is
                    afforded by the book of Agrippa of Nettesheim (1487-1535), <hi rend="italic">De
                        Incertitudine et Vanitate Scientiarum.</hi> Sceptical reflexion rather than
                    systematic scepticism is what meets us in Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592),
                    though the elaborate presentation of sceptical and relativistic arguments in his
                    “Apologie de Raimond Sebond” <hi rend="italic">(Essais,</hi> ii. 12), and the
                    emblem he recommends —a balance with the legend, “Que scay-je? ”—might allowably
                    be adduced as evidence of a more thoroughgoing Pyrrhonism. In his “tesmoynages
                    de nostre imbécillité,” he follows in the main the lines of the ancients, and he
                    sums up with a lucid statement of the two great arguments in which the sceptical
                    thought of every age resumes itself—the impossibility of verifying our
                    faculties, and the relativity of all impressions.<note anchored="true"

                    mutability of opinions and customs was probably the one which appealed most
                    strongly to himself. In the concluding lines of this essay, Montaigne seems to
                    turn to “nostre foy chrestienne” as man’s only succour from his native state of
                    helplessness and uncertainty. But undoubtedly his own habitual frame of mind is
                    better represented in his celebrated saying—“How soft and healthful a pillow are
                    ignorance and incuriousness .... for a well-ordered head.” More inclined than

                    for the advance of physical science and for the newly-founded Royal Society. But
                    he attacked unsparingly the Aristotelianism of the schools, which was still
                    dominant at Oxford. Against this, and also against the materialistic dogmatism
                    of Hobbes, he invoked the weapons of scepticism; and he was led by his own
                    arguments to query “whether there be any science in the sense of the
                    dogmatists.” He based this conclusion partly upon the ground that our knowledge
                    of causes, being derived simply from “concomitancy,” is far from being
                    “infallibly conclusive.” “The causality itself,” he says, anticipating Hume, “is
                    insensible”; accordingly, “the foundation of scientifical procedure is too weak
                    for so magnificent a superstructure.” More celebrated than any of the above was
                    Pierre Bayle (1617- 1706), whose scepticism lay more in his keen negative
                    criticism of all systems and doctrines which came before him as literary
                    historian than in any theoretic views of his own as to the possibility of
                    knowledge. Bayle also paraded the opposition between reason and revelation; but
                    the argument in his hands is a double-edged weapon, and when he extols the
                    merits of submissive faith his sincerity is at least questionable.</p>
                <p>Hume, the most illustrious and indeed the typical sceptic of modern times, is
                    treated at length in a separate article. Here, therefore, it is only necessary
                    to point out shortly in what his scepticism consists. It is sometimes placed, as
                    we have seen it is by Kant, in his distrust of our ability and right to pass
                    beyond the empirical sphere. But the mere denial of the possibility of “divinity
                    or school metaphysics,” as we find it in the <hi rend="italic">Inquiry,</hi>
                    combined with an apparent confidence in “experimental reasoning concerning
                    matter of fact and existence,” does not constitute scepticism, but rather what
                    would now be called agnosticism or positivism. It is essential to the sceptical
                    position that reason be dethroned within experience as well as beyond it, and
                    this is undoubtedly the result at which Hume arrives in his larger and more
                    thoroughgoing work. More generally, therefore, his scepticism may be considered
                    to lie in his relation to preceding philosophy. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Treatise</hi> is a <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi> of the
                    principles of Lockianism, inasmuch as these principles, when consistently
                    applied, leave the structure of experience entirely “loosened” (to use Hume’s
                    own expression), or cemented together only by the irrational force of custom.
                    Hume’s scepticism thus really arises from his thoroughgoing empiricism. Starting
                    with “particular perceptions” or isolated ideas let in by the senses, he never
                    advances beyond these “distinct existences.” Each of them exists on its own
                    account; it is what it is, but it contains no reference to anything beyond
                    itself. The very notion of objectivity and truth therefore disappears; the <hi
                        rend="italic">Schein</hi> or appearance of the moment is the only reality.
                    Hume’s analysis of the conceptions of a permanent world and a permanent self
                    reduces us to the sensationalistic relativism of Protagoras. He expressly puts
                    this forward in various passages as the conclusion to which reason conducts us.
                    The fact that the conclusion is in “direct and total opposition” to the apparent
                    testimony of the senses is a fresh justification of philosophical scepticism.
                    For, indeed, scepticism with regard to the senses is considered in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Inquiry</hi> to be sufficiently justified by the fact that
                    they lead us to suppose “an external universe which depends not on our
                    perception,” whereas “this universal and primary opinion of all men is soon
                    destroyed by the slightest philosophy.” Scepticism with regard to reason, on the
                    other hand, depends on an insight into the irrational character of the relation
                    which we chiefly employ, viz., that of cause and effect. It is not a real
                    relation in objects but rather a mental habit of belief engendered by frequent
                    repetition or custom. This point of view is applied in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Treatise</hi> universally. All real connexion or relation, therefore, and
                    with it all possibility of an objective system, disappears; it is, in fact,
                    excluded by Hume <hi rend="italic">ab initio,</hi> for “the mind never perceives
                    any real connexion among distinct existences.” Belief, however, just because it
                    rests, as has been said, on custom and the influence of the imagination,<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Belief is more properly
                            an act of the sensitive than of the cogitative part of our
                        nature.”</p></note> survives such demonstrations. “Nature,” as Hume delights
                    to reiterate, “is always too strong for principle.” “Nature, by an absolute and
                    uncontrollable necessity, has determined us to judge as well as to breathe and
                    feel.” The true philosopher, therefore, is not the Pyrrhonist, trying to
                    maintain an impossible equilibrium or suspense of judgment, but the Academic,
                    yielding gracefully to the impressions or maxims which he finds, as matter of
                    fact, to have most sway over himself. “I may— nay, I must—yield to the current
                    of nature, in submitting to my senses and understanding; and in this blind
                    submission I show most perfectly my sceptical principles,” for, after all, “if
                    we believe that fire warms or water refreshes, ’tis only because it costs us too
                    much pains to think otherwise.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Much the same conclusion is reached in what is perhaps
                            the ablest English exposition of pure philosophic scepticism since Hume
                            —Mr Arthur Balfour’s <hi rend="italic">Defence of Philosophic Doubt</hi>
                            (1879). “The reader may wish to know,” says Mr Balfour, “what constitute
                            the ‘ claims on our belief' which I assert to he possessed alike by
                            science and theology, and which I put forward as the sole practical
                            foundation on which our convictions ultimately rest. . . . Whatever they
                            may be, they are not rational grounds of conviction. . . It would be
                            more proper to describe them as <hi rend="italic">a kind of inward
                                inclination or impulse"</hi> (pp. 316-7).</p></note></p>
                <p>The system of Kant, or rather that part of his system expounded in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Critique of Pure Reason,</hi> though expressly distinguished
                    by its author from scepticism, has been included by many writers in their survey
                    of sceptical theories. The difference between Kant, with his system of pure
                    reason, and any of the thinkers we have passed in review is obvious; and his
                    limitation of reason to the sphere of experience suggests in itself the title of
                    agnostic or positivist rather than that of sceptic. Yet, if we go a little
                    deeper, there is substantial justification for the view which treats agnosticism
                    of the Kantian type as essentially sceptical in its foundations and in its
                    results. For criticism not only limits our knowledge to a certain sphere, but
                    denies that our knowledge within that sphere is real; we never know things as
                    they actually are, but only as they appear to us. Our knowledge, in Kant’s
                    language, does not show us “the inward essence of the object in itself, but only
                    the relation of the object to the subject.” But this doctrine of relativity
                    really involves a condemnation of our knowledge (and of all knowledge), because
                    it fails to realize an impossible and self-contradictory ideal. The man who
                    impeaches the knowing faculties because of the fact of relation which they
                    involve is pursuing the phantom of an apprehension which, as Lotze expresses it,
                    does not apprehend things, but is itself things; he is desiring not to know but
                    to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> the things themselves. If this dream or prejudice
                    be exploded, then the scepticism originating in it—and a large proportion of
                    recent sceptical thought does so originate—loses its <hi rend="italic">raison
                        d'être.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may
                            be as well to add that the sceptical side of Kantianism is mainly
                            confined to the <hi rend="italic">Critique of Pure Reason,</hi> but this
                            side of Kantian thought has been most widely influential. The remarks
                            made above would not apply to the coherent system of idealism which may
                            be evolved from Kant’s writings and which many would consider alone to
                            deserve the name of Kantianism or Criticism.</p></note> The prejudice,
                    however, which meets us in Kant is, in a somewhat different form, the same
                    prejudice which is found in the tropes of antiquity—what Lotze calls “the
                    inadmissible relation of the world of ideas to a foreign world of objects.”<pb

                    suppose idealism or realism to be true, in neither case do the things themselves
                    pass into our knowledge. No standpoint is possible from which we could compare
                    the world of knowledge with such an independent world of things, in order to
                    judge of the conformity of the one to the other. But the abstract doubt “whether
                    after all things may not be quite other in themselves than that which by the
                    laws of our thought they necessarily appear” is a scepticism which, though
                    admittedly irrefutable, is as certainly groundless. No arguments can be brought
                    against it, simply because no arguments can be brought to support it; the
                    scepticism rests on nothing more than the empty possibility of doubting. This
                    holds true, even if we admit the “independent” existence of such a world of
                    things. But the independence of things may with much greater reason be regarded
                    as itself a fiction or prejudice. The real “objective” to which our thoughts
                    must show conformity is not a world of things in themselves, but the system of
                    things as it exists for a perfect intelligence. Scepticism is deprived of its
                    persistent argument if it is seen that, while our individual experiences are to
                    be judged by their coherence with the context of experience in general,
                    experience as a whole does not admit of being judged by reference to anything
                    beyond itself.</p>
                <p>To the attack upon the possibility of demonstration, inasmuch as every proof
                    requires itself a fresh proof, it may quite fairly be retorted that the
                    contradiction really lies in the demand for proof of the self-evident, on which
                    all proof most ultimately depend. It is of course always possible that in any
                    particular case we may be deceived; we may be assuming as self-evidently true
                    what is in reality not so. But such incidental lapses are found to correct
                    themselves by the consequences in which they involve us, and they have no power
                    to shake our trust in the general validity of reason. It may, however, be
                    granted that the possibility of lapse throws us open to the objections,
                    ingenuous or disingenuous, of the sceptic; and we must remain exposed to them so
                    long as we deal with our first principles as so many isolated axioms or
                    intuitions. But the process of self-correction referred to points to another
                    proof—the only ultimately satisfactory proof of which first principles admit.
                    Their evidence lies in their mutual interdependence and in the coherence of the
                    system which they jointly constitute.</p>
                <p>Of a scepticism which professes to doubt the validity of every reasoning process
                    and every operation of all our faculties it is, of course, as impossible as it
                    would be absurd to offer any refutation. Here, as Butler incisively put it, “we
                    can go no further. For it is ridiculous to attempt to prove the truth of those
                    very perceptions whose truth we can no otherwise prove than by other perceptions
                    of exactly the same kind with them, and which there is just the same ground to
                    suspect, or to attempt to prove the truth of our faculties, which can no
                    otherwise be proved than by means of those very suspected faculties themselves.”
                    This absolute scepticism, indeed, can hardly be regarded as more than empty
                    words; the position which they would indicate is not one which has ever existed.
                    In any case, such scepticism is at all times sufficiently refuted by the
                    imperishable and justifiable trust of reason in itself. The real function of
                    scepticism in the history of philosophy is relative to the dogmatism which it
                    criticizes. And, as a matter of fact, it has been seen that many so-called
                    sceptics were rather critics of the effete systems which they found cumbering
                    the ground than actual doubters of the possibility of knowledge in general. And
                    even when a thinker puts forward his doubt as absolute it does not follow that
                    his successors are bound to regard it in the same light. The progress of thought
                    may show it to be, in truth, relative, as when the nerve of Hume’s scepticism is
                    shown to be his thoroughgoing empiricism, or when the scepticism of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Critique of Pure Reason</hi> is traced to the unwarrantable
                    assumption of things-in-themselves. When the assumptions on which it rests are
                    proved to be baseless, the particular scepticism is also overcome. In like
                    manner, the apparent antinomies on which such a scepticism builds will be found
                    to resolve themselves for a system based on a deeper insight into the nature of
                    things. The serious thinker will always repeat the words of Kant that, in
                    itself, scepticism is “not a permanent resting-place for human reason.” Its
                    justification is relative and its function transitional.</p>
