                    Dublin on the 23d of December 1770. He was sprung from an old Irish family, and
                    his father, while he exercised the trade of a merchant, regarded the profession
                    of a painter as in no sense a fit occupation for a descendant of the Shees.
                    Young Shee became, nevertheless, a student of art in the Dublin Society, and
                    came early to London, where he was, in 1788, introduced by Burke to Reynolds, by
                    whose advice he studied in the schools of the Royal Academy. In 1789 he
                    exhibited his first two pictures, the Head of an Old Man and Portrait of a
                    Gentleman. During the next ten years he steadily increased in practice, and
                    gradually gained ground among the aristocracy, with whom his suavity and good
                    manners were great recommendations. He was chosen an associate of the Royal
                    Academy in 1798, shortly after the illustrious Flaxman, and in 1800 he was made
                    a Royal Academician. In the former year he had married, removed to Romney’s
                    house in Cavendish Square, and set up as the legitimate successor of that
                    artist. Shee continued to paint with great readiness of hand and fertility of
                    invention, although his portraits were eclipsed by more than one of his
                    contemporaries, and especially by Lawrence, Hoppner, Phillips, Jackson, and
                    Raeburn. In addition to his portraits he executed various subjects and
                    historical works, such as Lavinia, Belisarius, his diploma picture Prospero and
                    Miranda, and the Daughter of Jephthah. In 1805 he published a poem consisting of
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhymes on Art,</hi> and it was succeeded by a second part in
                    1809. Although Byron spoke well of it in his <hi rend="italic">English Bards and
                    Scotch Reviewers,</hi> and invoked a place for “Shee and genius” in the temple
                    of fame, yet, as nature had not originally conjoined these two, it is to be
                    feared that even a poet’s invocation could not materially affect their
                    relations. Shee published another small volume of verses in 1814, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Commemoration of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and other Poems,</hi>
                    but this effort did not greatly increase his fame. He now produced a tragedy
                    called <hi rend="italic">Alasco,</hi> of which the scene was laid in Poland. The
                    play was accepted at Covent Garden,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n809/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0809-0784"/> and in the fertile fancy of the poet the play had
                    already gained for him a great dramatic fame, when Colman, the licenser, refused
                    it his sanction, on the plea of its containing certain treasonable allusions,
                    and Shee, in great wrath, resolved to make his appeal to the public. This
                    violent threat he carried out in 1824, but unfortunately the public found other
                    business to mind, and <hi rend="italic">Alasco</hi> is still on the list of
                    unacted dramas. On the death of Lawrence in 1830, Shee was chosen president of
                    the Royal Academy, and shortly afterwards he received the honour of knighthood.
                    He was excellently qualified by his gentlemanly manners, business habits, and
                    fluent speech for the position; and in the dispute regarding the use of rooms to
                    be provided by Government, and in his examination before the parliamentary
                    committee of 1836, he ably defended the rights of the Academy. He continued to
                    paint till 1845, and died on the 13th of August 1850 in his eightieth year.</p>
                <p>The earlier portraits of the artist are carefully finished, easy in action, with
                    good drawing and excellent discrimination of character. They show an undue
                    tendency to redness in the flesh painting,—a defect which is still more apparent
                    in his later works, in which the handling is less “square,” crisp, and
                    forcible.</p>
