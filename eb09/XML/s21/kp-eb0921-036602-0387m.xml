                    there before the Christian era,—nay, most probably as early as the beginning of
                    the so-called Stone Age (three thousand years before Christ).</p>

                    them during the period before the birth of Christ. It is only from that epoch we
                    can get any information concerning the language of the old Scandinavians, which
                    seems by that time not only to have spread over Denmark and great parts of
                    southern and middle Sweden and of (southern) Norway, but also to have reached
                    Finland (at least Nyland) and Esthonia. In spite of its extension over this
                    considerable geographical area, the language appears to have been fairly
                    homogeneous throughout the whole territory. Consequently, it may be regarded as
                    a uniform language, the mother of the younger Scandinavian tongues, and
                    accordingly has been named the primitive Scandinavian <hi rend="italic"
                    >(urnordisk)</hi> language. The oldest sources of our knowledge of this tongue
                    are the words which were borrowed during the first centuries of the Christian
                    era (some of them perhaps even earlier) by the Lapps from the inhabitants of
                    central Sweden and Norway, and by the Finns from their neighbours in Finland and
                    Esthonia, and which have been preserved in Finnish and Lappish down to our own

                    with those mentioned by contemporary Roman and Greek authors, are the oldest
                    existing traces of any Germanic language. Wrested from their context, however,
                    they throw but little light on the nature of the original northern tongue. But a
                    series of linguistic monuments have come down to us dating from the end of the
                    so-called early Iron Age (about 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),—</hi> the
                    knowledge and the use of the oldest runic alphabet (with twenty-four characters)
                    having at that period been propagated among the Scandinavians by the southern
                    Germanic tribes. In fact we still possess, preserved down to our own times,
                    primitive northern runic inscriptions, the oldest upon the utensils found at <hi

                    These runic inscriptions are for the most part found on stone-monuments
                    (sometimes on rocks) and bracteates (gold coins stamped on one side and used for
                    ornaments), as well as on metallic and wooden utensils, weapons, and

                    contains only sixteen words. Their language is somewhat later in character than

                    manuscripts, and no doubt approaches more nearly than any Germanic idiom the
                    primitive form of the Germanic tongue. For the sake of comparison, we give a
                    Gothic translation of one of the oldest of the primitive Scandinavian

                    by this means gained a fixed starting-point for further researches. A short

                    Scandinavian inscriptions are nevertheless sufficient to enable us to determine
                    with some certainty the relation which the language in which they are written
                    bears to other languages. Thus it is proved that it belongs to the Germanic
                    family of the Indo-European stock of languages, of which it constitutes an
                    independent and individual branch. Its nearest relation being the Gothic, these
                    two branches are sometimes taken together under the general denomination <hi
                    rend="italic">Eastern Germanic,</hi> as opposed to the other Germanic idioms
                    (German, English, Dutch, &amp;c.), which are then called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Western Germanic.</hi> The most essential point of correspondence between the
                    Gothic and Scandinavian branches is the insertion in certain cases of <hi

                    so-called Viking Period (about 800 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the
                    Scandinavian language seems to have undergone an extraordinarily rapid
                    development, which in a comparatively short time almost completely transformed
                    its character. This change is especially noticeable in the dropping of
                    unaccented vowels, and in the introduction of a certain vowel harmony of
                    different kinds (“Umlaut”, vowel changes, caused by a following <hi
                    rend="italic">i (j)</hi> or <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (<hi rend="italic">w</hi>),
                    as <hi rend="italic">kvoeði</hi> for <hi rend="italic">kwáði,</hi> poem, and
                    “Brechung”, as <hi rend="italic">healpa</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >helpa,</hi> to help), different assimilations of consonants (as <hi
                    rend="italic">ll, nn</hi> for <hi rend="italic">l</hi> p <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >,</hi><hi rend="italic">np; ll, nn, rr,</hi> and ss for <hi rend="italic">ls,
                    ns, rs,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">sr),</hi> dropping of <hi rend="italic"
                    >w</hi> before <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (as <hi

                    rend="italic">wulfs,</hi> wolf), simplified inflexion of the verbs, a new
                    passive formed by means of affixing the reflexive pronoun <hi rend="italic"
                    >sik</hi> to the active form (as <hi rend="italic">kalla-sk,</hi> to call one’s
                    self, to be called), &amp;c.</p>
                <p>At this epoch, therefore, the primitive Scandinavian language must be considered
                    as no longer existing. The next two centuries form a period of transition as
                    regards the language as well as the alphabet which it employed. We possess some
                    inscriptions belonging to this period in which the old runic alphabet of
                    twenty-four characters is still used, and the language of which closely
                    resembles that of the primitive Scandinavian monuments, as, for example, those
                    on the stones of <hi rend="italic">Stentoften</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Björketorp,</hi> both from southern Sweden, probably dating from the 10th
                    century, and being the longest inscriptions yet found with the old runic
                    alphabet. On the other hand, inscriptions have come down to us dating from about
                    the middle of the 9th century, in which the later and exclusively Scandinavian
                    alphabet of sixteen characters has almost completely superseded the earlier
                    alphabet, from which it was developed, 'while the language not only differs
                    widely from the original Scandinavian, but also exhibits dialectical
                    peculiarities suggesting the existence of a Danish-Swedish language as opposed
                    to Norwegian, as the form <hi rend="italic">ruulf</hi> on the stone at <hi
                    rend="italic">Flemlöse</hi> in Denmark, which in a Norwegian inscription would
                    have been written <hi rend="italic">hruulf</hi> corresponding to <hi
                    rend="italic">Hrolf</hi> in Old Norwegian literature. These differences,
                    however, are unimportant, and the Scandinavians still considered their language
                    as one and the same throughout Scandinavia, and named it <hi rend="italic">Donsk
                    tunga,</hi> Danish tongue. But when Iceland was colonized at the end of the 9th
                    and the beginning of the 10th century, chiefly from western Norway, a separate
                    (western) Norwegian dialect gradually sprang up, at first of course only
                    differing slightly from the mother-tongue. It was not until the introduction of
                    Christianity (about 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> that the language was
                    so far differentiated as to enable us to distinguish, in runic inscriptions and
                    in the literature which was then arising, four different dialects, which have
                    ever since existed as the four literary languages—Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish,
                    and Danish. Of these the latter two, often comprehended within the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Eastern Scandinavian,</hi> as well as the former two, <hi
                    rend="italic">Western Scandinavian,</hi> or, to use the Old Scandinavians’ own
                    name, <hi rend="italic">Norrϕnt mál,</hi> Northern tongue, are very nearly
                    related to each other. The most important differences between the two branches,
                    as seen in the oldest preserved documents, are the following:—(1) In E. Scand.
                    far fewer cases of “Umlaut,” as <hi rend="italic">vári,</hi> W. Scand. <hi
                    rend="italic">vaeri,</hi> were <hi rend="italic">; land,</hi> W. Scand. <hi
                    rend="italic">lond</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">landu),</hi> lands; (2) E.
                    Scand. “Brechung” of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> into <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> (or
                    to) before <hi rend="italic">ng(w), nk(w),</hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                    >siungse,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">syngva</hi> (from <hi rend="italic"
                    >singwa),</hi> to sing; (3) in E. Scand. <hi rend="italic">mp, nk, nt</hi> are
                    in many cases not assimilated into <hi rend="italic">pp, kk, tt,</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">krumpen,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">kroppenn,</hi> shrunken;
                    a <hi rend="italic">enkiae,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">ekkja,</hi> widow;
                    <hi rend="italic">bant,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">bait,</hi> he bound;
                    (4) in E. Scand. the dative of the definite plural ends in <hi rend="italic"
                    >-omen</hi> instead of W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">-onom,</hi> as in <hi
                    rend="italic">handomen, hondonom,</hi> (to) the hands; (5) in E. Scand. the
                    simplification of the verbal inflexional endings is far further advanced, and
                    the passive ends in -s for <hi rend="italic">-sk,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >kallaes,</hi> W. Scand. <hi rend="italic">kallask,</hi> to be called In several
                    of these points, and indeed generally speaking, the Western Scandinavian
                    languages have preserved the more primitive forms, as may be seen in the<pb

                    dating from a period before the beginning of the literature, as well as in many
                    modern Eastern Scandinavian dialects. For, having regard to the Scandinavian
                    dialects generally, we must adopt quite a different classification from that
                    indicated by the dialects which are represented in the literature. We now pass
                    on to review the latter and their history.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Icelandic.</hi> —In ancient times Icelandic was by far
                    the most important of the Scandinavian languages, in form as well as in
                    literature. To avoid ambiguity, the language before the Reformation (about
                    1530-40) is often called old Icelandic.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Old Icelandic</hi> was spoken not only in Iceland, but also
                    in Greenland, where Icelandic colonists lived for a lengthened period (983-
                    about 1400). Our knowledge of its character is almost exclusively derived from
                    the remarkably voluminous literature,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    runic monuments (about forty), all of them almost worthless from a philological
                    point of view. The oldest, the inscription on the church door of Valpjofstaðr,
                    dates from the beginning of the 13th century,<note anchored="true"

                    >Book of Homilies</hi> (of which a short specimen is given below) is considered
                    the oldest of all. About contemporary with this is the oldest part of an
                    inventory entitled <hi rend="italic">Reykjaholts máldage.</hi> From about 1200
                    we possess a fragment (Cod. Reg. old sign. 1812) of the only existing Old

                    century the <hi rend="italic">Stockholm Book of Homilies</hi> (Cod. Holm. 15,
                    4to), which from a philological point of view is of the greatest importance,
                    chiefly on account of its very accurate orthography, which is especially
                    noticeable in the indication of quantity; from the early part of the same
                    century comes the fragment (Cod. AM. 325, 2, 4to) entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agrip</hi> (“abridgment” of the history of Norway), probably a copy of a
                    Norwegian original, also orthographically important. Among later manuscripts we
                    may mention, as philologically interesting, the <hi rend="italic">Annales
                    Regii</hi> (Cod. Reg. 2087) from the beginning of the 14th century,
                    orthographically of great value; the rich manuscript of miscellanies, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hauksbók</hi> (Codd. AM. 371, 544, 675, 4to), a great part of
                    which is written with Haukr Erlendsson’s (+1334) own hand; and, above all, three
                    short essays, in which some Icelanders have tried to write a grammatical and
                    orthographical treatise on their own mother-tongue, all three appearing as an
                    appendix to the manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Prose Edda.</hi> The oldest
                    and most important of these essays (preserved in the Cod. Worm, from about 1330)
                    is by an unknown author of about 1150, and is probably intended to be a
                    continuation of a lost work of the first grammarian of Iceland, Póroddr
                    Rúnameistari (who flourished at the beginning of the 12th century); the second
                    (the oldest known manuscript of which is preserved in the Cod. Ups., c. 1290) is
                    perhaps the work of the famous Snorri Sturloson (+1241); the third (the oldest
                    manuscript in Cod. AM. 748, 4to, of the beginning of the 14th century) is by
                    Snorri’s nephew Ólafr Hvítaskáld (+1259), and is no doubt based partly upon
                    pórodd’s work above mentioned, partly and chiefly upon Priscian and

                <p>The oldest form of the Icelandic language is, however, not preserved in the
                    above-mentioned earliest manuscripts of the end of the 12th century, which are
                    written in the language of their own age, but in far later ones of the 13th
                    century, which contain poems by the oldest Icelandic poets, such as the renowned
                    Egill Skallagrimson (about 930) and the unknown authors of the so-called
                    Edda-songs. In spite of the late date of the manuscripts, the metrical form has
                    been the means of preserving a good deal of the ancient language. But, as
                    already remarked, during the 10th and 11th centuries this dialect differs but
                    little from Norwegian, though in the 12th this is no longer the case.</p>
                <p>We may here contrast a specimen of the above-mentioned oldest Icelandic
                    manuscript (from the end of the 12th century) with an almost contemporary

                    later, are— in Icel. lengthening of <hi rend="italic">a, o, u</hi> before <hi
                    rend="italic">If, Ig, Ik, Im,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ip</hi> (as Icel. <hi
                    rend="italic">halfr,</hi> Norw. and oldest Icel. <hi rend="italic">halfr,</hi>
                    half); later still, also of <hi rend="italic">a, i,</hi> ii, and <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> before <hi rend="italic">ng</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >nk</hi>; Icel. <hi rend="italic">di</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ey</hi> for
                    older and (ϕy (as in Icel. <hi rend="italic">daema, heyra,</hi> Norw. and oldest
                    Icel. <hi rend="italic">dϕma,</hi> to deem, <hi rend="italic">hϕyra,</hi> to
                    hear); Icel. termination of 2nd plur. of verbs in -8 (p) or <hi rend="italic"
                    >-t,</hi> but Norw. often in <hi rend="italic">-r</hi> (as Icel. <hi
                    rend="italic">taktið, -t,</hi> Norw. <hi rend="italic">takir,</hi> you take).
                    These points may be sufficient to characterize the language of the earlier
                    ‘classical” period of Icelandic (about 1190-1350). At the middle of the 13th
                    century the written language undergoes material changes, owing in a great
                    measure, no doubt, to the powerful influence of Snorri Sturloson. Thus in
                    unaccented syllables <hi rend="italic">i</hi> now appears for older <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (at first only when followed
                    by one or more consonants belonging to the same syllable) for <hi rend="italic"
                    >o</hi>; the passive ends in <hi rend="italic">-z</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >-sk.</hi> The other differences from Norwegian, mentioned above as occurring
                    later, are now completely established. With the beginning of the 14th century
                    there appear several new linguistic phenomena: a <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is
                    inserted between final <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and a preceding consonant (as in
                    <hi rend="italic">ríkur,</hi> mighty); <hi rend="italic">o</hi> (pronounced as
                    an open <hi rend="italic">o)</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">ö</hi> (the
                    character <hi rend="italic">ö</hi> was not introduced till the 16th century), or
                    before <hi rend="italic">ng, nk</hi> into <hi rend="italic">au</hi> (as <hi
                    rend="italic">long, fioll,</hi> pronounced <hi rend="italic">laung, fiöll)</hi>;
                    c before <hi rend="italic">ng, nk</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">ei</hi>; a
                    little later <hi rend="italic">e</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> and
                    the passive changes its termination from -z, oldest <hi rend="italic">-sk,</hi>
                    into <hi rend="italic">-zt</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">-zst)</hi> (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">kallazt,</hi> to be called). The post-classical period of old
                    Icelandic (1350-1530), which is, from a literary point of view, of but little
                    importance, already shows marked differences that are characteristic of Modern
                    Icelandic; as early as the 15th century we find <hi rend="italic">ddl</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">ll</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rl</hi> (as <hi rend="italic"
                    >falla,</hi> pronounced <hi rend="italic">faddla,</hi> to fall), <hi
                    rend="italic">ddn</hi> for <hi rend="italic">nn</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >rn</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">horn,</hi> pron. <hi rend="italic">hoddn,</hi>
                    horn); about the year 1500 <hi rend="italic">ve</hi> after <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">vo,</hi> in other positions to <hi
                    rend="italic">vo</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">hvelpr,</hi> pron. <hi rend="italic"
                    >xvolpur,</hi> whelp; <hi rend="italic">kvern,</hi> pron. <hi rend="italic"
                    >kvöm,</hi> mill), etc.</p>
                <p>Although dialectical differences are not altogether wanting, they do not occur to
                    any great extent in the Old Icelandic literary language. Thus, in some
                    manuscripts we find <hi rend="italic">ft</hi> replaced by <hi rend="italic">fst
                    (oft, ofst,</hi> often); in manuscripts from the western part of the island
                    there appears in the 13th and 14th centuries a tendency to change <hi
                    rend="italic">If, rf</hi> into <hi rend="italic">lb, rb (tolf, tolb,</hi>
                    twelve; <hi rend="italic">porf, porb,</hi> want), &amp;c. To what extent the
                    language of Greenland differed from that of Iceland we cannot judge from the few
                    runic monuments which have come down to us from that colony.</p>
                <p>Apart from the comparatively inconsiderable attempts at a grammatical treatment
                    of old Icelandic in the Middle Ages which we have mentioned above, grammar as a
                    science can only be said to have commenced in the 17 th century. The first
                    grammar, written by the Icelander Runolphus Jonas (+1654), dates from 1651. His
                    contemporary and compatriot Gudmund Andreae (+1654) compiled the first
                    dictionary, which was not, however, edited till 1683 (by the Dane Petrus
                    Resenius, +1688). The first scholars who studied old Icelandic systematically
                    were H. K. Rask (1787-1832), whose works<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">E.g., Veiledning til det Islandske

                    knowledge of the language, and his great contemporary Jac. Grimm, in whose <hi

                    particular attention is paid to Icelandic. Those who since the time of Rask and
                    Grimm have principally deserved well of Icelandic grammar are—the ingenious and
                    learned Norwegian P. A. Munch, 1863,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Modern Icelandic</hi> is generally dated from the
                    introduction of the Reformation into Iceland; the book first printed, the New
                    Testament of 1540, may be considered as the earliest Modern Icelandic document.
                    Although, on account of the exceedingly conservative tendency of Icelandic
                    orthography, the language of Modern Icelandic literature still seems to be
                    almost identical with the language of the 17th century, it has in reality
                    undergone a constant and active development, and, phonetically regarded, has
                    changed considerably. Indeed, energetic efforts to bring about an orthography
                    more in accordance with phonetics were made during the years 1835-47 by the
                    magazine entitled <hi rend="italic">Fjölnir,</hi> where we find such authors as
                    Jonas Hallgrimsson and Konr. Gíslason; but these attempts proved abortive. Of
                    more remarkable etymological changes in Modern Icelandic we may note the
                    following :—already about the year 1550 the passive termination <hi
                    rend="italic">-zt (-zst)</hi> passes into the till then very rare termination
                    <hi rend="italic">-st</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">kallast,</hi> to be called);
                    <hi rend="italic">y, y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ey</hi> at the beginning of
                    the 17th century coincided with <hi rend="italic">i, í,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>; the long vowels <hi rend="italic">d, w,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ó</hi> have passed into the diphthongs <hi rend="italic">au</hi>
                    (at least about 1650), <hi rend="italic">ai</hi> (about 1700), <hi rend="italic"
                    >ou</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">mál,</hi> language, <hi rend="italic">moela,</hi>
                    to speak, <hi rend="italic">stóll,</hi> chair); <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before
                    <hi rend="italic">i, j</hi> is changed into <hi rend="italic">dj</hi> (after a
                    consonant) or <hi rend="italic">j</hi> (after a vowel),— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    liggia,</hi> to lie, <hi rend="italic">eigi,</hi> not; in certain other cases
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi> has passed into <hi rend="italic">gw</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">w,—e.g., lágur,</hi> low, <hi rend="italic">ljúga,</hi> to lie;
                    initial <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is silent,— <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., (g)naga,</hi> to gnaw; has passed into <hi rend="italic"
                    >hn,— e.g., knútr,</hi> knot; <hi rend="italic">ps, pt</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">fs, ft; bb, dd, gg</hi> are pronounced as <hi rend="italic">bp,
                    dt, gk,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ll, rl, nn, rn</hi> now in most positions
                    (not, however, before <hi rend="italic">d, t,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s,</hi>
                    and in abbreviated names) as <hi rend="italic">dtl, dtn,—</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">j'jail,</hi> mountain, <hi rend="italic">bjöm,</hi> bear; <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> before <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is now pronounced as <hi
                    rend="italic">bp,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">hrafn,</hi> raven, &amp;c. Both in
                    vocabulary and syntax we find early, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the lawbook
                    <hi rend="italic">Jönsbök,</hi> printed in 1578(-80), Danish exercising an
                    important influence, as might be expected from political circumstances. In the
                    18th century, however, we meet with purist tendencies. As one of the leading men
                    of this century may be mentioned the poet Eggert Ólafsson (+1768), whose poems
                    were not printed till 1832. Worthy of mention in the history of Modern Icelandic
                    language are the learned societies which appeared in the same century, of which
                    the first, under the name of “Hið osynilega,” was established in 1760. At this
                    time archaic tendencies, going back to the Old Icelandic of the 13th and 14th
                    centuries, were continually gaining ground. In our century the following have
                    won especial renown in Icelandic literature:— Bjarne Porarensen (+1841),
                    Iceland’s greatest lyric poet, and Jonas Hallgrimsson (+ 1845), perhaps its most
                    prominent prose-author in modern times.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See R. Arpi, “Islands yngre literatur och sprak” <hi

                    1883-85).</p></note></p>
                <p>The dialectical differences in Modern Icelandic are comparatively trifling and
                    chiefly phonetic. The Westland dialect has, for example, preserved the old
                    Icelandic long <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> while the other dialects have changed
                    it to the diphthong <hi rend="italic">au</hi>; in the Northland dialect initial
                    <hi rend="italic">kn</hi> is preserved, in the others changed into <hi
                    rend="italic">hn</hi>; in the northern and western parts of the island old
                    Icelandic <hi rend="italic">hv</hi> appears as <hi rend="italic">kv,</hi> in a
                    part of south-eastern Iceland as <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> in the other dialects
                    as <hi rend="italic">xw,—e.g., hvelpr,</hi> whelp. As a matter of curiosity it
                    may be noted that on the western and eastern coasts traces are found of a
                    French-Icelandic language, which arose from the long sojourn of French fishermen
                    there.</p>
                <p>Owing to the exclusive interest taken in the ancient language, but little
                    attention is given even now to the grammatical treatment of Modern Icelandic.
                    Some notices of the language of the 17th century may be obtained from the
                    above-mentioned grammar of Runolphus Jonas (1651), and for the language of the
                    18th from Rask’s grammatical works. For the language of our own time there is
                    hardly anything to refer to but N. Friöriks-son’s works, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Islenzk mdlmyndalfjsing,</hi> 1861, and <hi rend="italic">Skyring hinna almennu

                    to the modern state of philology; compare also B. Magnusson Ölsen’s valuable

                    language, confined to Norway and the Faroes, but was, as already stated, for
                    some time spoken in parts of Ireland and the north of Scotland, the Isle of Man,
                    the Hebrides, Shetland, and Orkney (in the last two groups of islands it
                    continued to survive down to modern times), and also in certain parts of western
                    Sweden as at present defined (Boliuslan, Sarna in Dalarna, Jamtland, and
                    Harjedalen).</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of it is due only in a small measure to runic inscriptions,<note

                    these are comparatively few in number (a little more than one hundred) and of
                    trifling importance from a philological point of view, especially as they almost
                    wholly belong to the period between 1050 and 1350,<note anchored="true"

                    much earlier than the earliest literature. The whole literature preserved is
                    written in the Latin alphabet. The earliest manuscripts are not much later than
                    the oldest Old Icelandic ones, and of the greatest interest. On the whole,
                    however, the earliest Norwegian literature is in quality as well as in quantity
                    incomparably inferior to the Icelandic. It amounts merely to about a score of
                    different works, and of these but few are of any literary value. A small
                    fragment (Cod. AM. 655, 4to, Fragm. ix., A, <hi rend="smallcaps">b, c),</hi> a
                    collection of legends, no doubt written a little before 1200, is regarded as the
                    earliest extant manuscript. From the very beginning of the 13th century we have
                    the <hi rend="italic">Norwegian Book of Homilies</hi> (Cod. AM. 619, 4to) and
                    several fragments of law-books (the older <hi rend="italic">Gulapingslaw</hi>
                    and the older <hi rend="italic">Eiðsivakingslaw).</hi> The chief manuscript
                    (Cod. AM. 243B., fol.) of the principal work in Old Norwegian literature, the

                    >Konungsskuggtfa,</hi> (“Mirror for Kings”), is a little later. Of still later

                    information, especially concerning the dialectical differences of the language,
                    are likewise of great philological importance.</p>
                <p>As in Old Icelandic so in old Norwegian we do not find the most primitive forms
                    in the oldest MSS. that have come down to us; for that purpose we must recur to
                    somewhat (later ones, containing old poems from times as remote as the days of
                    Brage Boddason (the beginning of the 8th century) and pjoðolfr of Hvin (end of
                    the same century). It has already been stated that the language at this epoch
                    differed so little from other Scandinavian dialects that it could scarcely yet
                    be called by a distinctive name, and also that, as Icelandic separated itself
                    from the Norwegian mother-tongue (about 900), the difference between the two
                    languages was at first infinitely small—as far, of course, as the literary
                    language is concerned. From the 13th century, however, they exhibit more marked
                    differences; for, while Icelandic develops to a great extent independently,
                    Norwegian, owing to geographical and political circumstances, is considerably
                    influenced by the Eastern Scandinavian languages. The most important differences
                    between Icelandic and Norwegian at the epoch of the oldest MSS. (about 1200)
                    have already been noted. The tendency in Norwegian to retain the use of the
                    so-called u-Umlaut has already been mentioned. On the other hand, there appears
                    in Norwegian in the 13th century another kind of vowel-assimilation, almost
                    unknown to Icelandic, the vowel in terminations being in some degree influenced
                    by the vowel of the preceding syllable. Thus, for instance, we find in some
                    manuscripts (as the above-mentioned legendary <hi rend="italic">Olafssaga)</hi>
                    that the vowels <hi rend="italic">e, o</hi> and long <hi rend="italic">a,
                    se,</hi> 0 are followed in terminations by <hi rend="italic">e, o; i, u, y,</hi>
                    and short <hi rend="italic">a, se,</hi> 0, on the other hand, by <hi
                    rend="italic">i, u,—</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">b finer,</hi> prayers, <hi
                    rend="italic">konor,</hi> women; but <hi rend="italic">tiðir,</hi> times, <hi
                    rend="italic">tungur,</hi> tongues. The same fact occurs in certain old Swedish
                    manuscripts. When Norway had been united later with Sweden under one crown
                    (1319) we meet pure Suecisms in the Norwegian literary language. In addition to
                    this, the 14th century exhibits several differences from the old language<note

                    Norway), as the local name <hi rend="italic">Qviteseið (hvitr,</hi> white).
                    During the 15th century, Norway being united with Denmark, and at intervals also
                    with Sweden, a great many Danisms and a few Suecisms are imported into the
                    language. As Suecisms we may mention the termination <hi rend="italic">-in</hi>
                    of the 2d pers. plur. instead of <hi rend="italic">-ir, -tð</hi> (as <hi
                    rend="italic">vilin,</hi> you will), the pronoun <hi rend="italic">jak</hi>
                    instead of <hi rend="italic">ek,</hi> I. The most important Danisms<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0391-0370"/> are the following: <hi rend="italic">b, d,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> are substituted for <hi rend="italic">p, t,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">k,—</hi> as in the local names <hi rend="italic">Nabø</hi>
                    (earlier <hi rend="italic">Napa), Tvedae sοgn</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >pveita</hi><hi rend="italic">søkn); -a</hi> in terminations passes into <hi
                    rend="italic">-e,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">høre (høyra),</hi> to hear, <hi
                    rend="italic">søghe (søkja),</hi> to seek; single Danish words are introduced,—
                    <hi rend="italic">as jek (ek),</hi> I, <hi rend="italic">se (sjá),</hi> to see;
                    <hi rend="italic">spørge (spyrja),</hi> to ask, &amp;amp;c. Towards the end of
                    the Middle Ages the Danish influence shows an immense increase, which marks the
                    gradual decline of Norwegian literature, until at last Norwegian as literary
                    language is completely supplanted by Danish. During the 15th century Norway has
                    hardly any literature except charters, and as early as the end of that century
                    by far the greatest number of these are written in almost pure Danish. In the
                    16th century, again, charters written in Norwegian occur only as rare
                    exceptions, and from the Reformation onward, when the Bible and the old laws
                    were translated into Danish, not into Norwegian, Danish was not only the
                    undisputed literary language of Norway, but also the colloquial language of
                    dwellers in towns and of those who had learned to read. For the rise in recent
                    times of a new Norwegian language, employed in literature and spoken by the
                    educated classes, see p. 373.</p>
                <p>Dialectical differences, as above hinted, occur in great number in the Norwegian
                    charters of the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries. Especially marked is the
                    difference between the language of western Norway, which, in many respects,
                    shows a development parallel to that of Icelandic, and the language of eastern
                    Norway, which exhibits still more striking correspondences with contemporary Old
                    Swedish. The most remarkable characteristics of the eastern dialects of this
                    epoch are the following :— <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is changed into <hi
                    rend="italic">ae</hi> in the pronouns <hi rend="italic">paenn,</hi> this, <hi
                    rend="italic">paet,</hi> that, and the particle <hi rend="italic">paer,</hi>
                    there (the latter as early as the 13th century), and later on (in the 14th
                    century) also in terminations after a long root syllable,—as <hi rend="italic"
                    >sendae,</hi> to send, <hi rend="italic">høyrae,</hi> to hear (but <hi
                    rend="italic">gera,</hi> to do, <hi rend="italic">vita,</hi> to know); <hi
                    rend="italic">ia</hi> passes (as in Old Swedish and Old Danish) into <hi
                    rend="italic">iae—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">hiaerta</hi> (Icel. <hi
                    rend="italic">hjarta),</hi> heart; <hi rend="italic">y</hi> sometimes passes
                    into <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> before <hi rend="italic">r, l,—</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">hiurder,</hi> shepherd, <hi rend="italic">lykiul,</hi> key,
                    instead of <hi rend="italic">hyrðir, lykyl</hi> (older still, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hirðir, lykill</hi>; see above, p. 369); final <hi rend="italic">-r</hi> after
                    a consonant often passes into <hi rend="italic">-ar,</hi> sometimes only into
                    <hi rend="italic">-a</hi>,—as <hi rend="italic">prestar (prestr),</hi> priest,
                    <hi rend="italic">bøkar (bøkr),</hi> books, dat. sing, <hi rend="italic">brøða
                    (brøðr),</hi> (to a) brother; <hi rend="italic">tl</hi> passes into <hi

                    little, the name <hi rend="italic">Atsle, Asle (Atle); rs</hi> gives a “thick”
                    <hi rend="italic">s</hi>-sound (written <hi rend="italic">ls),—</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">Baerdols,</hi> genitive of the name <hi rend="italic">Bergpórr;
                    nd, ld</hi> are assimilated into <hi rend="italic">nn, ll,—</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">bann (band),</hi> band, the local name <hi rend="italic">Westfoll
                    (Vestfold)</hi>; and (as far back as the 13th century) traces occur of the vowel
                    assimilation, “tiljaevning,” that is so highly characteristic of the modern
                    Norwegian dialects,—as <hi rend="italic">voko, vuku,</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >vaku</hi>, (Icel. <hi rend="italic">voko, ∙u),</hi> accusative singular of <hi
                    rend="italic">vaka,</hi> wake, <hi rend="italic">mykyll</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">mykill,</hi> much. On the other hand, as characteristics of the
                    western dialects may be noted the following :—final <hi rend="italic">-r</hi>
                    after a consonant passes into <hi rend="italic">-ur, -or,—</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">vetur (vetr),</hi> winter, <hi rend="italic">rettur (réttr),</hi>
                    right, <hi rend="italic">aftor (aftr),</hi> again; <hi rend="italic">sl</hi>
                    passes into <hi rend="italic">tl,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">sytlla
                    (sysla),</hi> charge; <hi rend="italic">hv</hi> is changed into <hi
                    rend="italic">kv</hi> also in pronouns, —as <hi rend="italic">kver</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(hverr),</hi> who, <hi rend="italic">kvassu (hversu),</hi>
                    how.</p>
                <p>This splitting of the language into dialects seems to have continued to gain
                    ground, probably with greater rapidity as a Norwegian literary language no
                    longer existed. Thus it is very likely that the present dialectical division was
                    in all essentials accomplished about the year 1600; for, judging from the first
                    work on Norwegian dialectology,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Chr. Jensen's <hi rend="italic">Norsk dictionarium tiler

                    possessed at that time most of its present features. A little clog-calendar of
                    the year 1644 seems to prove the same regarding the Valders (Southern Norway)
                    dialect. How far the Old Norwegian dialects on the Faroes, in Ireland and
                    Scotland, on the Scottish islands, and on the Isle of Man differed from the
                    mother-tongue it is impossible to decide, on account of the few remnants of
                    these dialects which exist apart from local names, viz., some charters (from the
                    beginning of the 15th century onward) from the Faroes<note anchored="true"

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Old Swedish.—</hi> Tho territory of the Old Swedish
                    comprehended—(1) Sweden, except tho most northerly part, where Lappish (and
                    Finnish ?) was spoken, the most southerly (Skane, Halland, and Blekinge—see
                    below, p. 373), and certain parts of western Sweden (see above, p. 369); (2)
                    extensive maritimo tracts of Finland, Esthonia, and Livonia, with their
                    surrounding islands; and (3) certain places in Russia, where Swedish was spoken
                    for a short time. The oldest but also the most meagre sources of our knowledge
                    of Old Swedish are those words, almost exclusively personal names (nearly one
                    hundred), which were introduced into the Russian language at the foundation of
                    the Russian realm by Swedes (in 862), and which are for the most part somewhat
                    influenced by Russian phonetic laws, preserved in two Russian documents of the
                    years 912 and 945,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    Helga).</hi> Of about the same date, but of an infinitely greater variety, are
                    the runic inscriptions, amounting in number to about two thousand, which have
                    been found cut on stones (rarely wood, metal, or other materials) almost all
                    over Sweden, though they occur most frequently (about half of the total number)
                    in the province of Uppland, next to which come Södermanland, Östergötland, and
                    Gotland, with about two hundred each. For the most part they are tombstones or
                    monuments in memory of deceased relatives, rarely public notices. Their form is
                    often metrical, in part at least. Most of them are anonymous, in so far that we
                    do not know the name of the engraver, though, as a rule, the name of the man who
                    ordered them is recorded. Of the engravers named, about seventy in number, the
                    three most productive are Ubir, Bali, and Asmundr Karasun, all three principally
                    working in Upland; the first-mentioned name is signed on about forty, the others
                    on nearly twenty stones each. These inscriptions vary very much in age,
                    belonging to all centuries of Old Swedish, but by far the greatest number of
                    them date from the 11th and 12th centuries. From heathen times—as well as from
                    the last two centuries of the Middle Ages—we have comparatively few. The oldest
                    are probably the Ingelstad inscription in Östergötland, and the Gursten one
                    found in tho north of Smâland.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    stone from Rök in Östergötland probably dates from the first half of the 10th
                    century. Its inscription surpasses all the others both in length (more than one
                    hundred and fifty words) and in the importance of its contents, which are
                    equally interesting as regards philology and the history of culture; it is a
                    fragment (partly in metrical form) of an Old Swedish heroic tale.<note

                    inscriptions of Asmundr Karasun, and from about 1050 the so-called Ingvar
                    monuments (about twenty in number), erected most of them in Södermanland, in
                    honour of the men who fell in a great war in eastern Europe under the command of
                    a certain Ingvar; the stones cut by Bali belong to the same period. Somewhat
                    later are the inscriptions cut by Ubir, and about contemporary with them, viz.,
                    from the beginning of the 12th century, is the remarkable inscription on the
                    door-ring of tho church of Forsa in Helsingland, containing tho oldest

                    proper sense of the word, which was only in a limited degree written in runes.
                    Of the runic literature hardly anything has been preserved to our days,<note

                    extent incomparably inferior to Old Icelandic, though it, at least in quantity,
                    considerably surpasses Old Norwegian. In age, however, it is inferior to both of
                    them, beginning only in the 13th century. The oldest of the extant manuscripts
                    is a codex of the <hi rend="italic">Older Vestgötalaw</hi> (Cod. Holm. B 59),
                    written about the year 1290, and philologically of the greatest importance. Not

                    the year 1300. Of other works of value from a philological point of view wo only

                    numerous Old Swedish charters, from 1343 downwards, are also of great
                    importance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Old

                    The formal changes of the Swedish language during this period are, generally
                    speaking, such as appear about the same time in all the members of the group,—as
                    the change of soft R into common <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (the Rök-stone <hi
                    rend="italic">runaR,</hi> later <hi rend="italic">r</hi> unα <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi>, runes; this appeared earliest after dental consonants, later after an
                    accented vowel), and the change of sp into <hi rend="italic">st</hi> (in the
                    10th century <hi rend="italic">raispi,</hi> later <hi rend="italic">reisti,</hi>
                    raised); or they are, at least, common to it with Norwegian, —as the dropping of
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> before <hi rend="italic">l, n,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> (in the 10th century <hi rend="italic">hraur,</hi> younger
                    <hi rend="italic">rör</hi>, cairn), and the changing of nasal vowels (the long
                    ones latest) into non-nasalized. A very old specific Swedish characteristic,
                    however, is the splitting up of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> into <hi rend="italic"
                    >iu</hi> before <hi rend="italic">ngw, nkw,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic"

                    what we may call the classical period of Old Swedish (1200-1350), the time of
                    the later runic inscriptions and the oldest literature. During this period the
                    language is already distinctly separate from the (literary) Icelandic-Norwegian
                    (though not yet from Danish). The words of the <hi rend="italic">Older

                    vowel is inserted between final <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and a preceding
                    consonant; <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in terminations is often changed into <hi
                    rend="italic">ae</hi>; a u in the final syllable causes no change of a preceding
                    <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> the present tense takes the vowel of the infinitive
                    (and the preterite subjunctive that of preterite indicative plural). Other
                    important changes, appearing at the same time, but probably, partly at least, of
                    a somewhat older date, are the following :—all diphthongs are contracted (as <hi
                    rend="italic">ogha,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">auga, eye; dröm</hi> a, Icel.

                    <hi rend="italic">knae</hi>, Icel. <hi rend="italic">kné</hi>, knee); <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> α into <hi rend="italic">iae</hi>, as in Eastern Norwegian
                    (as <hi rend="italic">hiaerta,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">hjarta,</hi> heart);
                    <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> into <hi rend="italic">y</hi> after <hi rend="italic"
                    >r,</hi> and a consonant + <hi rend="italic">l</hi> (as <hi rend="italic"
                    >flygha,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">fljúga,</hi> to fly); the forms of the
                    three persons singular of verbs have assimilated (except in the so-called strong
                    preterite); the 2d pers. plur. ends in - <hi rend="italic">in</hi> for - <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> ö, and the passive voice in -s for the earlier <hi
                    rend="italic">-sk;</hi> the dat. plur. of substantives with suffixed article
                    ends in <hi rend="italic">-umin</hi> (Icel. <hi rend="italic">-onom,</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">sunumin, sunonom,</hi> to the sons). The transition to the 14th
                    century is marked by important changes :— short y, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    passed into ö in many positions (as d <hi rend="italic">or</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">dyr,</hi> door, &amp;amp;c.), and the forms of the dative and the
                    accusative of pronouns gradually became the same. The number of borrowed words
                    is as yet very limited, and is chiefly confined to ecclesiastical words of Latin
                    and Greek origin, introduced along with Christianity (as <hi rend="italic"
                    >kors,</hi> cross, <hi rend="italic">bref,</hi> epistle, <hi rend="italic"
                    >skoli,</hi> school, <hi rend="italic">praester,</hi> priest, <hi rend="italic"
                    >almosa,</hi> alms). At the middle of the 14th century the literary language
                    undergoes a remarkable reform, developing at the same time to a “rikssprâk,” a
                    uniform language, common to the whole country. The chief characteristics of this
                    later Old Swedish are the following:—the long <hi rend="italic">a</hi> has
                    passed into <hi rend="italic">å</hi> (that is, an open <hi rend="italic"
                    >o),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">io</hi> (except before <hi rend="italic">rd,
                    rt)</hi> into <hi rend="italic">io</hi> (as s <hi rend="italic">i</hi> o, sea,
                    lake); at the same time there appears a so-called law of vowel balance,
                    according to which the vowels <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and u are always found in
                    terminations after a short root syllable, and—at least when no consonant
                    follows— <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> after a long one
                    (as <hi rend="italic">Gu</hi> d <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, to God, <hi
                    rend="italic">til salu,</hi> for sale, but i <hi rend="italic">garpe,</hi> in
                    the court, <hi rend="italic">for visso,</hi> assuredly); <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">k (sk)</hi> before palatal vowels are softened
                    into <hi rend="italic">dj</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tj (stj); k</hi> and t in
                    unaccented syllables often pass into <hi rend="italic">gh, dh</hi> (as <hi
                    rend="italic">Sverighe</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Sverike,</hi> Sweden, <hi
                    rend="italic">litedh</hi> for <hi rend="italic">litet,</hi> a little); the
                    articles <hi rend="italic">paen</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">hin),</hi> the, and
                    (a little later) <hi rend="italic">en,</hi> a, come into use; the dual pronouns
                    vanish; the relative <hi rend="italic">aer,</hi> that, is changed with su <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi>; the present participle takes a secondary form in -s (as
                    <hi rend="italic">gangandes,</hi> beside <hi rend="italic">gangande,</hi>
                    going). A little later the following changes appear :—a short vowel is
                    lengthened before a single consonant, first when the consonant belongs to the
                    same syllable (as <hi rend="italic">hat,</hi> hate), afterwards also when it
                    belongs to the following one (as <hi rend="italic">hata,</hi> to hate); an
                    auxiliary vowel is inserted between <hi rend="italic">l</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> and a preceding consonant (as <hi rend="italic">gavel,</hi>
                    gable, <hi rend="italic">oken,</hi> desert); short <hi rend="italic">i</hi>,
                    ending a syllable, passes into <hi rend="italic">e</hi> (as <hi rend="italic"
                    >leva,</hi> to live); <hi rend="italic">th</hi> passes into t; a new conjugation
                    is formed which has no infinitive termination, but doubles the sign of the
                    preterite (as <hi rend="italic">bo, bodde, bolt,</hi> to dwell, dwelt, dwelt).
                    Owing to the political and commercial state of the country the language at this
                    period is deluged with borrowed words of Low German origin, mostly social and
                    industrial terms, such as the great number of verbs in <hi rend="italic">-era
                    (e.g., hantera,</hi> to handle), the substantives in - <hi rend="italic">eri
                    (rö</hi> v <hi rend="italic">er</hi> i, robbery), - <hi rend="italic"
                    >innα</hi><hi rend="italic">(forstinna,</hi> princess), <hi rend="italic">-het
                    (fromhet,</hi> piety), <hi rend="italic">b</hi> e- <hi rend="italic"
                    >(betala,</hi> to pay), and a great many others <hi rend="italic">(klen,</hi>
                    weak, <hi rend="italic">smaka,</hi> to taste, <hi rend="italic">grover,</hi>
                    big, <hi rend="italic">ρuηg,</hi> purse, <hi rend="italic">tukt,</hi>
                    discipline, <hi rend="italic">bruka,</hi> to use, <hi rend="italic">tvist</hi>,
                    quarrel, <hi rend="italic">stovel,</hi> boot, <hi rend="italic">arbeta,</hi> to
                    work, <hi rend="italic">frokoster,</hi> lunch, &amp;amp;c. ). Owing to the
                    political circumstances, we find towards the end of the period a very powerful
                    Danish influence, which extends also to phonetics and etymology, so that, for
                    example, nearly all the terminal vowels are supplanted by the uniform Danish <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> the hard consonants <hi rend="italic">p, t, k</hi> by <hi
                    rend="italic">b, d, g</hi> as in Danish, the second person plural of the
                    imperative ends in -e <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> beside -e <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">tagher,</hi> for older <hi rend="italic"
                    >takin).</hi></p>
                <p>Dialectical differences incontestably occur in the runic inscriptions as well as
                    in the literature; in the former, however, most of them are hidden from our eyes
                    by the character of the writing, which is, from a phonetic point of view, highly
                    unsatisfactory, indicating the most different sounds by the same sign (for
                    example, <hi rend="italic">o, u, y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ö</hi> are
                    denoted by one and the same rune); in the literature again they are reduced to a
                    minimum by the awakening desire to form a uniform literary language for the
                    whole country, and by the literary productivity and consequent predominant
                    influence of certain provinces (as Östergötland). This question, moreover, has
                    not hitherto been investigated with sufficient care.<note anchored="true"

                    possess more than two hundred runic inscriptions, among them a very remarkable
                    one of the 12th or 13th century, counting upwards of three hundred runes, cut on
                    a font (now in Aakirkeby on the island of Bornholm), and representing the life
                    of Christ in a series of pictures and words; on the other hand a literature has
                    been preserved consisting of a runic calendar from 1328, the law of the island
                    (from about 1350), a piece of traditional history, and a guild statute. The
                    language is distinguished from the Old Swedish of the mainland especially by the
                    following characteristics :—the old diphthongs are preserved <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g., auga,</hi> eye, <hi rend="italic">droyma,</hi> to dream, <hi
                    rend="italic">stain,</hi> stone), and a new triphthong has arisen by the change
                    of <hi rend="italic">iú</hi> into <hi rend="italic">iau</hi> (as <hi
                    rend="italic">fliauga,</hi> to fly); the long vowels <hi rend="italic">e, oe,

                    the church). Owing to the entire absence of documentary evidence it is
                    impossible to determine how far the dialects east of the Baltic, which no doubt
                    had a separate individuality, differed from the mother-tongue.</p>

                    (from 1599 onwards) called attention to and excited a lively interest in the
                    runic monuments, and, by his edition (1634) of the excellent Old Swedish work

                    attempt in modern times at a grammatical treatment of any old Germanic language.
                    The study of runes was very popular in the 17th century; M. Celsius (+1679)
                    deciphered the “staffless” runes (see above, p. 370), and J. Hadorph (+1693),
                    who also did good work in editing Old Swedish texts, copied more than a thousand
                    runic inscriptions. During the 18th century, again, Old Swedish was almost
                    completely neglected; but in the present century the study of runes has been
                    well represented by the collection of the Swede Liljegren (+1837) and by the

                    remarkable inscriptions. Old Swedish literature has also been made the object of
                    grammatical researches. A first outline of a history of the Swedish language is
                    to be found in the work of N. M. Petersen (1830) mentioned above (p. 370), and a
                    scheme of an Old Swedish grammar in P. A. Munch’s essay, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fornswenskans och Fornnorskans sprakbyggnad</hi> (1849); but Old Swedish
                    grammar was never treated as an independent branch of science until the
                    appearance of J. E. Rydqvist’s (+ 1877) monumental work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Svenska språkets lagar</hi> (in 6 vols., 1850-83), which was followed in Sweden
                    by a whole literature on the same subject. Thus phonetics, which were
                    comparatively neglected by Rydqvist, have been investigated with great success,
                    especially by L. F. Leffler and A. Kock; while the other parts of grammar have
                    been treated of above all by K. F. Söderwall, the chief of contemporary Old
                    Swedish scholars. His principal work, <hi rend="italic">Ordbok öfver Svenska
                    medeltidsspråket</hi> (1884 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>), now in course of

                    texts, which contains the vocabulary of the oldest literature—it worthily meets
                    the demand for an Old Swedish dictionary. An Old Swedish grammar, answering the
                    requirements of modern philology, is still needed.<note anchored="true"

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Modern Swedish.—</hi> The first complete translation of the
                    Bible, edited in 1541 by the brothers Olaus and Laurentius Petri, and generally
                    called the Bible of Gustavus I., may be regarded as the earliest important
                    monument of this. Owing to religious and political circumstances, and to the
                    learned influence of humanism, theological and historico-political works
                    preponderate in the Swedish literature of the following period, which therefore
                    affords but scanty material for philological research. It is not until the
                    middle of the 17th century that Swedish literature adequately exemplifies the
                    language, for at that period literature first began to be cultivated as a fine
                    art, and its principal representatives, such as Stiernhielm, Columbus, and
                    Spegel, were in reality the first to study it ns a means of expression and to
                    develop its resources. Amongst the authors of the 18th century we have to
                    mention in the first place Dalin, who was to some extent the creator of the
                    prose style of that epoch; while of the end of the century Kellgren and Bellman
                    are the most noteworthy examples, representing the higher and the more familiar
                    style of poetry respectively. The language of the 19th century, or at any rate
                    of the middle of it, is best represented in the works of Wallin and Tegnér,
                    which, on account of their enormous circulation, have had a greater influence
                    than those of any other authors.</p>
                <p>As to the language itself the earliest Modern Swedish texts, as Gustavus I.’s
                    Bible, differ considerably from the latest Old Swedish ones.<note

                    exterminate Danisms and reintroduce native and partially antiquated forms. At
                    the same time there appear several traces of a later state of the language: all
                    genitives (singular and plural), <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> end in -s, which
                    in earlier times was the proper ending of only certain declensions. In spite of
                    the archaistic efforts of many writers, both in forms and in vocabulary, the
                    language nevertheless underwent rapid changes during the 16th and 17th
                    centuries. Thus <hi rend="italic">sj</hi> and <hi rend="italic">stj</hi>
                    (original as well as derived from <hi rend="italic">sk</hi> before a palatal
                    vowel) assimilate into a simple <hi rend="italic">sh-</hi> sound; <hi
                    rend="italic">dj</hi> (original as well as derived from <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    before a palatal vowel), at least at the end of the 17th century, dropped its
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi>-sound (compare such spellings as <hi rend="italic"
                    >diufwer, giättar, envoyé,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">jufter,</hi> udder, <hi

                    of the pronoun <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> you, there arises a secondary form <hi

                    adjective gradually loses all the case-inflexions; in substantives the
                    nominative, dative, and accusative take the same form as early as the middle of
                    the 17th century; in the declension with suffixed article the old method of
                    expressing number and case both in the substantive and the article is changed,
                    so that the substantive alone takes the number-inflexion and the article alone
                    the case-ending; neuter substantives ending in a vowel, which previously had no
                    plural ending, take the plural ending - <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> some <hi
                    rend="italic">-er,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">bi∙n,</hi> bees, <hi rend="italic"
                    >bageri-er,</hi> bakeries. About the year 1700 the Old Swedish inflexion may, in
                    general, be considered as almost completely given up, although a work of such
                    importance in the history of the language as Charles XII.’s Bible (so-called) of
                    1703 (edited by Bishop J. Svedberg), by a kind of conscious archaism has
                    preserved a good many of the old forms. To these archaistic tendencies of
                    certain authors at the end of the 17th century we owe the great number of Old
                    Swedish and Icelandic borrowed words then introduced into the language,—</p>
                <p>as <hi rend="italic">fager,</hi> fair, <hi rend="italic">härja,</hi> to ravage,
                    <hi rend="italic">later,</hi> manners, <hi rend="italic">snille,</hi> genius,
                    <hi rend="italic">täma,</hi> girl, <hi rend="italic">tima,</hi> to happen,
                    &amp;amp;c. In addition to this, owing to humanistic influence, learned
                    expressions were borrowed from Latin during the whole 16th and 17th centuries;
                    and from German, chiefly at the Reformation and during the Thirty Years’ War,
                    numberless words were introduced,—as <hi rend="italic">språk,</hi> language, <hi
                    rend="italic">tapper,</hi> brave, <hi rend="italic">prakt,</hi> magnificence,
                    <hi rend="italic">hurtig,</hi> brisk, &amp;amp;c.; among these may be noted
                    especially a great number of words beginning in <hi rend="italic">an-, er-,
                    för-,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ge-.</hi> Owing to the constantly increasing
                    political and literary predominance of France French words were largely borrowed
                    in the 17th century, and to an equally great extent in the 18th; such are <hi
                    rend="italic">affär,</hi> business, <hi rend="italic">resρckt,</hi> respect, <hi
                    rend="italic">talaηg,</hi> talent, <hi rend="italic">charmant,</hi> charming,
                    &amp;amp;c. In the 19th century, again, especially about the middle of it, we
                    anew meet with conscious and energetic efforts after purism both in the
                    formation of new words and in the adoption of words from the old language (id,
                    diligence, <hi rend="italic">mala,</hi> to speak, <hi rend="italic"
                    >fylking,</hi> battle-array, &amp;amp;c.), and from the dialects <hi
                    rend="italic">(bliga,</hi> to gaze, <hi rend="italic">flis,</hi> flake, <hi
                    rend="italic">skrabbig,</hi> bad, &amp;amp;c. ). Consequently, the present
                    vocabulary differs to a very great extent from that of the literature of the
                    17th century. As for the sounds and grammatical forms, on the other hand,
                    comparatively few important changes have taken place during the last two
                    centuries. In the 18th century, however, the aspirates <hi rend="italic">dh</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> passed into <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> (after <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> into <hi rend="italic">j</hi>),—as <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">lagh,</hi> law, <hi rend="italic">brod</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >brödh,</hi> bread; <hi rend="italic">hv</hi> passed into <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> (in dialects already about the year 1600),— as <hi rend="italic"
                    >valp</hi> for <hi rend="italic">hvalper,</hi> whelp; <hi rend="italic">lj</hi>
                    likewise into <hi rend="italic">j,—</hi> thus <hi rend="italic">ljuster,</hi>
                    leister, occurs written <hi rend="italic">juster.</hi> In our time <hi
                    rend="italic">rd, rl, rn, rs,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rt</hi> are passing
                    into simple sounds (“supradental” <hi rend="italic">d, l, n, s,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">t),</hi> while the singular of the verbs is gradually supplanting
                    the plural. A vigorous reform, slowly but firmly carried on almost uniformly
                    during all periods of the Swedish language, is the throwing back of the
                    principal accent to the beginning of the word in cases where previously it stood
                    nearer the end, a tendency that is characteristic of all the Scandinavian
                    languages, but no doubt especially of Swedish. In the primitive Scandinavian age
                    the accent was removed in most simple words'; the originally accented syllable,
                    however, preserved a musically high pitch and stress. Thus there arose two
                    essentially different accentuations,—the one, with unaccented final syllable, as
                    in Icel. <hi rend="italic">stígr</hi> (Gr. oτϵiχϵir), thou goest, the
                    comparative <hi rend="italic">betre (cf</hi> Gr. τάσσων from <hi rend="italic"
                    >τaχvs),</hi> better, the other, with secondary stress and high pitch on the
                    final, as in Icel. pret, plur. <hi rend="italic">buoom</hi> (Sanskr. <hi
                    rend="italic">bubudhimá),</hi> we bade, part. pret, <hi rend="italic"
                    >bitenn</hi> (Sanskr. <hi rend="italic">bhinnás),</hi> bitten. The same change
                    afterwards took place in those compound words that had the principal accent on
                    the second member, so that such contrasts as German <hi rend="italic"
                    >úrtheil</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ertheílen</hi> were gradually brought into
                    conformity with the former accentuation. At the present day it is quite
                    exceptionally (and chiefly in borrowed words of later date) that the principal
                    accent in Swedish is on any other syllable than the first, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">lekámen,</hi> body, <hi rend="italic">välsígna,</hi> to bless.</p>

                    century. The first regular Swedish grammar was written in 1684 (not edited till

                    mentioned above, which, although chiefly dealing with the old language, throws a
                    flood of light on the modern also. Among the works of late years we must call

                    to the grammar of the modem language, if the advanced state of philology is
                    considered. A good though short abstract is given in H. Sweet’s essay on “Sounds
                    and Forms of Spoken Swedish” <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Phil. Soc.,</hi>
                    1877-79). Attempts to construct a dictionary were made in the 16th century, the
                    earliest being the anonymous <hi rend="italic">Variarum Rerum Vocabula cum Sueca
                    Interpretatione,</hi> in 1538, and the <hi rend="italic">Synonymorum
                    Libellus</hi> by Elavus Petri Helsingius, in 1587, both of which, however,
                    followed German originals. The first regular dictionary is by H. Spegel, 1712;
                    and in 1769 Joh. Ihre (+ 1780), probably the greatest philological genius of
                    Sweden, published his <hi rend="italic">Glossarium Sviogoticum,</hi> which still
                    remains the most copious Swedish dictionary in existence. In the present century
                    the diligent lexicographer A. F. Dalin has published several useful works. At
                    present the Swedish Academy has in preparation a gigantic dictionary on about
                    the same plan as Dr Murray’s <hi rend="italic">New English Dictionary</hi>;
                    there will also appear as soon as possible a complete list (with grammatical and

                    period also a great part of England, and Normandy. The oldest monuments of the
                    language are runic inscriptions, altogether about 250 in number.<note

                    the beginning of the 9th century, the Snoldelev-stone for instance on Sealand,
                    and the Flemløse-stone on Fünen. From about the year 900 date the very long
                    inscriptions of Tryggevaelde (Sealand) and Glavendrup (Fünen); from the 10th
                    century we have the stones of Jaellinge (Jutland), in memory of two of the
                    oldest historical kings of Denmark (Gorm and Harald); while from about 1000 we
                    have a stone at Dannevirke (Schleswig), raised by the conqueror of England, Sven
                    Tjuguskaegg. Relics of about the same age are the words that were introduced by
                    the Danes into English, the oldest of which date from the end of the 9th
                    century, the time of the first Danish settlement in England; most of these are
                    to be found in the early English work <hi rend="italic">Ormulum.</hi><note

                    century. The oldest manuscript that has come down to us dates from the end of
                    that century, written in runes and containing the law of Skåne. From about the
                    year 1300 we possess a manuscript written in Latin characters and containing
                    Valdemar’s and Erik’s laws of Sealand, the Flensborg manuscript of the law of
                    Jutland, and a manuscript of the municipal laws of Flensborg. These three
                    manuscripts represent three different dialects,—that, namely, of Skåne, Halland,
                    and Blekinge, that of Sealand and the other islands, and that of Jutland and
                    Schleswig. There existed no uniform literary language in the Old Danish period,
                    although some of the most important works of the 15th century, such as Michael’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rhymed Chronicle</hi>
                    (the first book printed in Danish, in 1495), on account of their excellent
                    diction, contributed materially to the final preponderance of their dialect,
                    that of Sealand, towards the Reformation.</p>
                <p>As to the form of the language, it hardly differs at all during the period
                    between 800 and 1200 a.d. from Old Swedish. It is only in the oldest literature
                    that we can trace any marked differences; these are not very important, and are
                    generally attributable to the fact that Danish underwent a little earlier the
                    same changes that afterwards took place in Swedish <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,
                    h</hi> in <hi rend="italic">hv</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hj</hi> in Danish was
                    mute as early as the end of the 14th century; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> p. 372,
                    above). The laws referred to above only agree in differing from the Swedish laws
                    in the following points :—the nominative already takes the form of the
                    accusative (as <hi rend="italic">kalf,</hi> calf, but Old Sw. nom. <hi
                    rend="italic">kalver,</hi> acc. <hi rend="italic">kalf)</hi>; the second person
                    plural ends in -ae (as <hi rend="italic">köpae,</hi> but Old Sw. <hi
                    rend="italic">köpin,</hi> you buy); in the subjunctive no differences are
                    expressed between persons and numbers. Among themselves, on the contrary, they
                    show considerable differences; the law of Skåne most nearly corresponds with the
                    Swedish laws, those of Sealand keep the middle place, while the law of Jutland
                    exhibits the most distinctive individuality. The Skåne law, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> retains the vowels <hi rend="italic">a, i, u</hi> in terminations,
                    which otherwise in Danish have become uniformly <hi rend="italic">ae</hi>; the
                    same law inserts <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> between
                    certain consonants (like Old Sw.; see p. 371), has preserved the dative, and in
                    the present tense takes the vowel of the infinitive; the law of Jutland, again,
                    does not insert <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and has
                    dropped the dative, while the present tense (undergoing an “Umlaut”) has not
                    always accepted the vowel of the infinitive; in all three characteristics the
                    laws of Sealand fluctuate. After 1350 we meet an essentially altered language,
                    in which we must first note the change of <hi rend="italic">k, ρ, t</hi> after a
                    vowel into <hi rend="italic">g, b, d</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">tag,</hi> roof,
                    <hi rend="italic">løbe,</hi> to run, <hi rend="italic">aede,</hi> to eat); <hi
                    rend="italic">th</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">t</hi> (as <hi rend="italic"
                    >ting,</hi> thing), <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> into <hi rend="italic">w</hi> (as
                    <hi rend="italic">law</hi> for <hi rend="italic">lagh,</hi> guild) and into <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">vei</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >waegh,</hi> way); <hi rend="italic">ld, nd</hi> are pronounced like <hi
                    rend="italic">ll, nn</hi>; <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is the general genitive
                    ending in singular and plural, &amp;amp;c. The vocabulary, which in earlier
                    times only borrowed a few and those mostly ecclesiastical words, is now —chiefly
                    owing to the predominant influence of the Hanse towns— inundated by German
                    words, such as those beginning with <hi rend="italic">be-, bi-, ge-, for-,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">und-,</hi> and ending in <hi rend="italic">-hed,</hi> and

                    >Det Danske, Norske, og Svenske sprogs historic,</hi> vol. i. (1829), one of the
                    first works that paid any attention to Old Danish, which till then had been
                    completely neglected. A dictionary on a large scale covering the whole of Old
                    Danish literature, except the very oldest, by O. Kalkar, has been in course of
                    publication since 1881; older and smaller is Chr. Molbech’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dansk Glossarium</hi> (1857-66).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Modern Danish. —</hi> The first important monument of this
                    is the translation of the Bible, by Chr. Pedersen, Peder Palladius, and others,
                    the so-called Christian III.’s Bible (1550), famous for the unique purity and
                    excellence of its language, the dialect of Sealand, then incontestably promoted
                    to be the language of the kingdom. The first secular work deserving of the same
                    praise is Vedel's translation of Saxo (1575). The succeeding period until 1750
                    offers but few works in really good Danish; as perfectly classical, however, we
                    have to mention the so-called Christian V.'s Law of Denmark (1683). For the
                    rest, humanism has stamped a highly Latin-French character on the literature,
                    striking even in the works of the principal writer of this period, Holberg. But
                    about the year 1750 there begins a new movement, characterized by a reaction
                    against the language of the preceding period and purist tendencies, or, at
                    least, efforts to enrich the language with new-formed words (not seldom after
                    the German pattern), as <hi rend="italic">omkreds,</hi> periphery, <hi
                    rend="italic">selvstaendighed,</hi> independence, <hi rend="italic"
                    >valgsρrog,</hi> devise, <hi rend="italic">digter,</hi> poet. The leading
                    representatives of these tendencies were Eilschow and Sneedorf. From their time
                    Danish may be said to have acquired its present essential features, though it
                    cannot be denied that several later authors, as J. Ewald and Öhlenschläger, have
                    exercised a considerable influence on the poetical style. As the most important
                    differences between the grammatical forms of the 18th and 19th centuries on one
                    hand and those of the 16th and 17th centuries on the other may be noted the
                    following :—most neuter substantives take a plural ending; those ending in a
                    vowel form their plural by adding <hi rend="italic">-r</hi> (as <hi
                    rend="italic">riger,</hi> for older <hi rend="italic">rige,</hi> plural of <hi
                    rend="italic">rige,</hi> kingdom), and many of those ending in a consonant by
                    adding <hi rend="italic">-e</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">huse</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">hus,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">hits,</hi> house); substantives
                    ending in <hi rend="italic">-ere</hi> drop their final <hi rend="italic">-e</hi>
                    (as <hi rend="italic">dommer</hi> for <hi rend="italic">dommere,</hi> judge);
                    the declension with suffixed article becomes simplified in the same way as in
                    Swedish (see above, p. 372); the plural of verbs takes the singular form (as <hi
                    rend="italic">drak</hi> for <hi rend="italic">drukke,</hi> we drank); and the
                    preterite subjunctive is supplanted by the infinitive (as <hi rend="italic"
                    >var</hi> for <hi rend="italic">vaare,</hi> were). The first Modern Danish
                    grammar is by E. Pontoppidan, 1668, but in Latin; the first in Danish is by the
                    famous Peder Syv, 1685. The works of the self-taught J. Højsgaard (<hi
                    rend="italic">e.g</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Accentueret og raisonneret
                    grammatica,</hi> 1747) possess great merit, and are of especial importance as
                    regards accent and syntax. The earlier part of this century gave us Rask’s
                    grammar (1830). A thoroughly satisfactory Modern Danish grammar does not exist;
                    perhaps the best is that by Th. Möbius (1871). The vocabulary of the 16th and
                    17th centuries is collected in Kalkar’s <hi rend="italic">Ordbog,</hi> mentioned
                    above, that of the 18th and 19th centuries in the voluminous and as yet
                    unfinished dictionary of Videnskabernas Selskab, and in C. Molbech’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Dansk ordbog</hi> (2d ed. 1859).<note anchored="true"

                <p>As already mentioned (p. 370), Danish at the Reformation became the language of
                    the literary and educated classes of Norway and remained so for three hundred
                    years, although it cannot be denied that many Norwegian authors even during this
                    period wrote a language with a distinct Norwegian colour, as for instance the
                    prominent prose-stylist Peder Claussøn Friis (+1614), the popular poet Peder
                    Dass (+ 1708), and, in a certain degree, also the two literary masters of the
                    18th century, Holberg and Wessel. But it is only since 1814, when Norway gained
                    her independence, that we can clearly perceive the so-called Dano-Norwegian
                    gradually developing as a distinct offshoot of the general Danish language. The
                    first representatives of this new language are the writer of popular life M.
                    Hansen (+ 1842), the poet H. Wergeland (+ 1845), and above all the tale-writer
                    P. C. Asbjørnsen (+ 1885). In our own days it has been further developed,
                    especially by the great poets Ibsen and Bjørnson and the novelist Lie; and it
                    has been said, not without reason, to have attained its classical perfection in
                    the works of the first-named author. This language differs from Danish
                    particularly in its vocabulary, having adopted very many Norwegian provincial
                    words (6000 to 7000), less in its inflexions, but to a very great extent in its
                    pronunciation. The most striking differences in this respect are the following
                    :—Norwegian <hi rend="italic">p</hi>, <hi rend="italic">t, k</hi> answer to
                    Danish <hi rend="italic">b, d, g</hi> in cases where they are of later date (see
                    above),—as <hi rend="italic">løpe,</hi> Danish <hi rend="italic">løbe,</hi> to
                    run, <hi rend="italic">liten,</hi> D. <hi rend="italic">liden,</hi> little, <hi

                    >tj, j; r</hi> (point-trill, not back-trill as in Danish) is assimilated in some
                    way with following <hi rend="italic">t (d), l, n,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi> into so-called supradental sounds (see p. 372); both the primitive
                    Scandinavian systems of accentuation are still kept separate from a musical
                    point of view, in opposition to the monotonous Danish. There are several other
                    characteristics, nearly all of which are points of correspondence with
                    Swedish.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See J. A.

                <p>the study of the Modem Norwegian dialects and their mother language, Old
                    Norwegian, the eminent philologist J. Aasen was led to undertake the bold
                    project of constructing, by the study of these two sources, and on the basis of
                    his native dialect (Søndmøre), a Norwegian-Norwegian (“Norsk-Norsk”) language,
                    the so-called “Landsmàl.” In 1853 he exhibited a specimen of it, and, thanks to
                    such excellent writers as Aasen himself, the poets O. Vinje and K. Janson, and
                    the novelist A. Garborg, as well as a zealous pro-pagandism of the society “Det
                    Norske Samlag” (founded in 1868), there has since arisen a valuable though not
                    very large literature in the “Landsmàl.” But it is nowhere spoken.<note

                    smaller groups,—the dialects of southern Sweden (with the island of Bornholm),
                    of the Danish islands, and of Jutland (and Schleswig).</p>

                <p>Hardly anything has been done towards the investigation of the Icelandic
                    dialects, while those of the Faroes have been studied chiefly by Hammershaimb.
                    The Norwegian dialects have been thoroughly examined by Aasen, whose works give
                    a general account of them; while in our own days Joh. Storm, above all, displays
                    an unwearying activity, especially in the minute investigation of their phonetic
                    constitution, to which Aasen had paid but scant attention. The substance of
                    these researches in the Norwegian dialects has recently been presented in a
                    magazine, called <hi rend="italic">Norvegia,</hi> of which the first volume is
                    in course of publication; it employs an alphabet invented by Storm. For the

                    Dalarne) inspired these studies with extraordinary animation at the middle of
                    the 19th century; in 1867 J. E. Rietz published a voluminous dialect dictionary;
                    the number of special essays, too, increased yearly. From 1872 so-called
                    “landsmåleforeningar” (dialect societies) were founded among the students at the
                    universities of Upsala, Lund, and Helsingfors (at Upsala alone 13), for a
                    systematic and thorough investigation of dialects. We find remarkable progress
                    in scientific method—especially with regard to phonetics—in the constantly
                    increasing literature; special mention may be made of the detailed descriptions
                    of the dialects of Värmland, Gotland, and Dalarna by Ad. Noreen, and A. F.
                    Freudenthal's monographs on the Finnish and Esthonian Swedish dialects. Since
                    1879 the Swedish dialect societies have published a magazine on a comprehensive
