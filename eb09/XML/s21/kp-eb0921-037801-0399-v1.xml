                <p><label type="entry">SCARRON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Paul</hi></label> (1610-1660),
                    poet, dramatist, novelist, and husband of Madame de Maintenon, was born or at
                    least baptized on the 4th July 1610. His father, of the same name, was a man of
                    position, and a member of the parlement of Paris. Paul the younger (who is said
                    to have quarrelled with his stepmother) became an abbé, was not ill-allowanced,
                    and travelled to Rome in 1634. Ho returned and became a well-known figure in
                    literary and fashionable society. A wild story used to be told of his having
                    (when in residence at his canonry of Le Mans) tarred and feathered himself as a
                    carnival freak, of his having been obliged to take refuge from popular wrath in
                    a swamp, and of his consequent deformity from rheumatism. The simple fact seems
                    to be that in 1637 he had an attack of fever with the usual sequelae of
                    rheumatic attacks, and that he put himself into the hands of a quack doctor.
                    This at least is how Tallemant tells the story, though he substitutes a less
                    creditable disease for fever. What is certain is that Scarron, after having been
                    in perfect health for nearly thirty years, passed twenty more in a state of
                    miserable deformity and pain. His head and body were twisted, and his legs
                    became useless. Nevertheless he bore up against his sufferings with invincible
                    courage, though they were complicated by his inheriting nothing from his father,
                    and by the poverty and miscouduct of his sisters, whom he supported. For a few
                    years he really held a benefice at Le Mans, but was then in no case to play
                    pranks. It is said, however, that here he conceived the idea of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Roman Comique</hi> and wrote the drama of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Jodelet,</hi> which gave a nickname to the actor who performed it. In 1646
                    he returned to Paris and worked hard for the booksellers, from the name of one
                    of whom he is said to have called literature pleasantly his " marquisat de
                    Quinet.” He had also a pension from Mazarin and one from the queen, but lost
                    both from being accused of “Frondeur” sentiments. The most singular action of
                    his life remains to be told. In his early years he had been, as hinted,
                    something of a libertine, and a young lady of some family, Céleste Palaiseau,
                    had openly lived with him. But in 1652, sixteen years after he had become almost
                    entirely paralysed, he married a girl of much beauty and no fortune, Françoise
                    or Francine d’Aubigné, granddaughter of Agrippa d’Aubigné, afterwards famous as
                    Madame de Maintenon. Scarron’s house was, both before and after the marriage, a
                    great centre of society, despite his narrow means. Yet only the most malignant
                    and unscrupulous libellers of the future favourite accuse her of light conduct
                    during the eight years of her marriage to this strange husband, and the
                    well-informed author of the <hi rend="italic">Historiettes</hi> distinctly
                    acquits her of any such. But Scarron, who had long been able to endure life only
                    by the aid of constant doses of opium, was at length worn out, and died on the
                    6th October 1660.</p>
                <p>Scarron’s work is very abundant, and, written as it was under pressure of want
                    and pain, it is very unequal. The piece most famous in his own day, his <hi
                        rend="italic">Virgile Travesti</hi> (1648-53), is now thought, and not
                    unjustly, a somewhat ignoble and unprofitable waste of singular powers for
                    burlesque. But the <hi rend="italic">Roman Comique</hi> (1651) is a work the
                    merit of which can be denied by no competent judge who has read it. Unfinished,
                    and a little desultory, this history of a troop of strolling actors is almost
                    the first French novel, in point of date, which shows real power of painting
                    manners and character, and is singularly vivid. It furnished Théophile Gautier
                    with the idea and with some of the details of his <hi rend="italic">Capitaine
                        Fracasse.</hi> Scarron also wrote some shorter novels of merit, which arc
                    thought to have inspired Molière and Sedaine. Of his plays <hi rend="italic"
                        >Jodelet</hi> (1645) and <hi rend="italic">Don Japhet d'Arménie</hi> (1653)
                    are the best. Both these and the others which he wrote are of course somewhat
                    antiquated in style, but with Corneille’s <hi rend="italic">Menteur</hi> they
                    stand above everything else in comedy before Molière. He also produced many
                    miscellaneous pieces.</p>
                <p>Scarron is generally spoken of and thought of as a representative writer of
                    burlesque, but in reality he possessed in abundance the faculty of true comedy.
                    The most complete edition of his works is held tobe that of 1737 (10 vols.,
                    Amsterdam), but his more celebrated pieces, including all those mentioned above,
                    have been frequently reprinted.</p>
