                        de</hi></label> (1740-1799), one of Switzerland’s most celebrated
                    physicists, was born in Geneva on February 17, 1740.<note anchored="true"

                            (1709-90), an agriculturist of unusually liberal opinions and wide
                            sympathies, when a young man had applied himself to literary pursuits,
                            and especially to the study of writings bearing on farming. He resided
                            all his life at his farm of Conches, on the Arve, near Geneva. As a
                            member of the council of Two Hundred he took part in public affairs.
                            Most of his writings were of a practical character, bearing on the
                            growth and diseases of grain and other farm produce. His last work, <hi

                                Fertility in the Earth,</hi> published in 1782, was more speculative
                            in its nature.</p></note> His youth was passed at his father’s farm,
                    where he early acquired a love for the study of nature. Following the example of
                    his father and of his uncle Charles Bonnet, with whom he was associated in a
                    research on the leaves of plants, he devoted himself at first to botany. Thus he
                    was led to make the acquaintance of Haller, who was not long in discerning and
                    appreciating his rare powers as an observer. In 1762, when only twenty-two years
                    of age, Saussure was elected to the chair of philosophy at Geneva, where, along
                    with another professor, he taught logic and physics alternately. But his natural
                    leanings were all towards the study of external nature; and he took advantage of
                    all available opportunities of travelling to thoroughly explore the mountains,
                    valleys, and lakes of his native land, and to visit those of foreign countries,
                    with the view of widening and deepening his conception of the constitution of
                    the world. The Society of Arts of Geneva was founded by Saussure in 1772, and in
                    1774, at the invitation of the Government, he elaborated a plan for the reform
                    of the system of teaching in his native town; but this was too radical in its
                    nature to be adopted. In 1786 he resigned his professorship to his friend and
                    fellow-worker Pictet. While honouring his country by his devotion to laborious
                    scientific investigations, he exhibited his patriotism by<pb break="no"

                    duties as a member of the council of Two Hundred, and afterwards of the National
                    Assembly. In consequence of over-exertion in this work his health began to fail
                    in 1794; but, although deprived of the use of his limbs, he continued to revise
                    the concluding volumes of his great work on Alpine physiography, which were
                    published in 1796. Latterly his mind became enfeebled, and when he was offered a
                    chair of philosophy by the French Government in 1798 he had lapsed into a
                    condition of partial imbecility. He died on January 22, 1799, at the age of
                    fifty-nine, leaving two sons and a daughter.</p>
                <p>The Alps formed the centre of Saussure’s investigations. They forced themselves
                    on his attention as the grand key to the true theory of the earth; but, as year
                    by year his mass of facts assumed ever-growing dimensions, his generalizations
                    became more guarded, until finally he came to consider a simple recording of
                    observations as the only justifiable course. As a young man he had roamed in
                    search of plants through many remote valleys and over the “montagnes maudits” as
                    his unappreciative fellow-dwellers by the lakes called the snow-capped summits
                    around them. It had been his dream, he says, since he was twenty to ascend Mont
                    Blanc; and he accomplished the feat on 3d August 1787. This was the second time
                    that the ascent of that mountain, until then deemed inaccessible, was made in
                    that year.</p>
                <p>Saussure found among the Alps opportunity for studying geology in a manner never
                    previously attempted. The inclination of the strata, the nature of the rocks,
                    the fossils, and the minerals received his closest attention. He acquired a
                    thorough knowledge of the chemistry of the day, watching for the brilliant
                    series of discoveries and the improvements in processes of analysis that brought
                    the science into such dazzling prominence during the last quarter of the
                    eighteenth century; and he applied all to the study of minerals, water, and air.
                    Saussure’s geological observations made him a firm believer in the Neptunian
                    theory: he regarded all rocks and minerals as deposited from aqueous solution or
                    suspension, and in view of this he attached much importance to the study of
                    meteorological conditions. He carried barometers and boiling-point thermometers
                    to the summits of the highest mountains, and estimated the relative humidity of
                    the atmosphere at different heights, its temperature, the strength of solar
                    radiation, the composition of air and its transparency. Then, following the
                    precipitated moisture, he investigated the temperature of the earth at all
                    depths to which he could drive his thermometer staves, the course, conditions,
                    and temperature of streams, rivers, glaciers, and lakes, even of the sea. He
                    invented a great number of instruments for these purposes, tested them, and
                    investigated the theory of their action. The most beautiful and complete of his
                    subsidiary researches is described in the <hi rend="italic">Essai sur
                        1’Hygrométrie,</hi> published in 1783. In it he records experiments made
                    with various forms of hygrometer in all climates and at all temperatures, and
                    supports the claims of his hair-hygrometer against all others. He invented and
                    improved many kinds of apparatus, including the magnetometer, the cyanometer for
                    estimating the blueness of the sky, the diaphanometer for judging of the
                    clearness of the atmosphere, the anemometer, and the mountain eudiometer. His
                    modifications of the thermometer adapted that instrument to many purposes: for
                    ascertaining the temperature of the air he used one with a fine bulb hung in the
                    shade or whirled by a string, the latter form being converted into an
                    evaporometer by inserting its bulb into a piece of wet sponge and making it
                    revolve in a circle of known radius at a known rate; for experiments on the
                    earth and in deep water he employed large thermometers wrapped in non-conducting
                    coatings so as to render them extremely sluggish, and capable of long retaining
                    the temperature once they had attained it. By the use of these instruments he
                    showed that the bottom water of deep lakes is uniformly cold at all seasons, and
                    that the annual heat wave takes six months to penetrate to a depth of 30 feet in
                    the earth. He recognized the immense advantages to meteorology of high-level
                    observing stations, and whenever it was practicable he arranged for simultaneous
                    observations being made at different altitudes for as long periods as possible.
                    It is perhaps as a geologist that Saussure worked most; he examined all the
                    formations he met with much care and exactness; and although his ideas on
                    matters of theory were in many cases very erroneous he was instrumental in
                    greatly advancing that science.</p>
                <p>Saussure’s work is collected and summarized in his four large volumes of <hi
                        rend="italic">Voyages dans les Alpes.</hi> This book is arranged in the form
                    of a narrative of the author’s various journeys, interspersed with accounts of
                    the observations made and descriptions of the apparatus employed. At the end
                    there is a long list of “agenda,” or subjects for investigation, which he
                    anticipated would throw light on the theory of the earth. These agenda are of
                    value as exhibiting not only the scope and definite focussing of Saussure’s mind
                    but his almost prophetic foresight, since subsequent scientific work has
                    advanced in each department very nearly on the lines there laid down.</p>
