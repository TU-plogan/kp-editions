                    (1742-1786), an eminent chemist, was born at Stralsund, the capital of
                    Pomerania, which then belonged to Sweden, on the 19th December 1742. His father
                    was a merchant, and Karl Wilhelm was the seventh of a family of eleven. In due
                    time the boy was sent to school, but he did not care for the languages, and as
                    he showed a strong taste for pharmacy he was apprenticed at the age of fourteen
                    to an apothecary in Gothenburg, called Bauch, with whom he stayed for eight
                    years. He was thoughtful and silent, and very punctual and precise in discharge
                    of his duties. His spare time and great part of his nights were devoted to the
                    experimental examination of the different bodies which he dealt with, and the
                    careful study of the standard works on chemistry. By these means he acquired a
                    large store of knowledge and great practical skill and manipulative dexterity.
                    In 1765 he removed to Malmö, and resided for five years with Kalström, an
                    apothecary, whence he removed to Stockholm, to Scharenberg, also an apothecary.
                    While here he wrote out an account of his experiments with cream of tartar, from
                    which he had isolated tartaric acid, and sent it to Bergman, the leading chemist
                    in Sweden. Bergman somehow neglected it, and this caused for a time a reluctance
                    on Scheele’s part to become acquainted with that savant, but the paper, through
                    the instrumentality of Retzius, was ultimately communicated to the Academy of
                    Sciences at Stockholm. In 1771 Scheele finished an elaborate inquiry into the
                    composition of the beautiful mineral fluor-spar, and showed that it consisted of
                    lime and a peculiar acid which he called fluor acid. He misunderstood, however,
                    the true character of the decomposition he had effected, and gave an erroneous
                    explanation of it. His experiments had been conducted in glass vessels, and he
                    was not aware that what he actually got was the fluo-silicic acid. This mistake
                    was subsequently pointed out and corrected by some other chemists. He left
                    Stockholm in 1773 and took up his residence at Upsala. Here he made the
                    acquaintance of Gahn, assessor of mines at Fahlun, through whose mediation he
                    was at length introduced to<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n409/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0409-0388"/> Bergman; the two soon became excellent
                    friends. In 1774 Scheele published his epoch-making investigation into the black
                    oxide of manganese, which had occupied him for two or three years, and in 1775
                    his memoirs on benzoic and arsenic acids. In the same year he left Upsala, in
                    order to settle at Koping, a small place at the western extremity of Lake
                    Miilar. Having heard that an apothecary’s shop was vacant, he applied for it,
                    passed a brilliant examination before the medical college, and was appointed.
                    But, instead of a small flourishing business, he found that he had to face
                    confusion and debt. Undismayed he set to work, introduced order and some
                    prosperity, and in two years bought the business from the widow of the former
                    proprietor. During this unfortunate period Scheele must have worked very hard,
                    for in spite of debt and difficulties he published in 1777 his treatise upon <hi
                        rend="italic">Λir and Fire,</hi> one of the most remarkable books in the
                    whole range of chemical literature, whether its originality, its close
                    reasoning, the number of discoveries which it contains, or the enormous amount
                    of experimental work it represents be considered. About this time Bergman
                    obtained for him from the Academy a grant, Scheele’s appreciation of which was
                    shown by his reserving one-sixth for his personal wants and devoting the
                    remainder to his experiments.</p>
                <p>Subsequent to this period, and for the remaining nine years of his life, the only
                    events to be recorded are the papers which he composed. Every year he published
                    two or three, and almost every one contained a capital discovery, either the
                    explanation of a phenomenon or reaction previously misunderstood or the
                    description of some new compounds. He was at the zenith of his now European fame
                    as a profound chemist and unfailing experimenter, and in the best years of his
                    life, when his career was suddenly arrested. The common account is that his
                    unremitting work, especially at night, exposing him to cold and draughts,
                    induced a rheumatic attack, to which in the course of a couple of months he
                    succumbed. Possibly his strength had been exhausted by long years of privation
                    and neglect of himself. He had intended, as soon as his circumstances should
                    enable him, to marry the widow of his predecessor. His illness, however,
                    increased very fast, and it was on his death-bed that he carried out his design
                    on the 19th May 1786. Two days later he died, bequeathing to his wife what
                    property he had acquired. He was only forty-four years of age.</p>
                <p>The discoveries with which Scheele enriched chemistry are numerous and important.
                    Reference has been already made to the discovery of tartaric acid and of the
                    composition of fluor-spar. The analysis of manganese oxide in 1774 led him to
                    the discovery of chlorine and of baryta <hi rend="italic">(terra ponderosa,</hi>
                    as it was called), to individualizing the salts of manganese itself, including
                    the green and purple compounds with potash, and to the explanation of how
                    manganese colours and decolorizes glass. In 1775 he showed how to prepare
                    benzoic acid by precipitating it from a solution in lime, and he investigated
                    arsenic acid and its reactions with different substances, discovering
                    arseniuretted hydrogen and the green colour “Scheele’s green,”—a process for
                    preparing which on the large scale he published in 1778. Other researches of
                    this period were concerned with the nature of quartz, clay, and alum, and with
                    an animal concretion or calculus from which he got for the first time uric
                    acid.</p>
                <p>The treatise on <hi rend="italic">Air and Fire</hi> appeared in 1777. It is
                    unnecessary now to enter into Scheele’s argument, for, however admirably it be
                    worked out, it started from an erroneous basis, and it is equally impossible in
                    limited space even to enumerate the experiments and the discoveries which fill
                    this book, and which have remained as permanent acquisitions to science through
                    all subsequent changes of theory. Among the most important of these is his
                    demonstration that the air consists mainly of two gases,—one which supports the
                    burning of bodies, the other which prevents it. This he snowed both analytically
                    and synthetically. His “empyreal,” or “fire-air,” or oxygen, he obtained for his
                    synthesis from acid of nitre, from saltpetre, from black oxide of manganese, and
                    from several other bodies. After the discovery of this substance Scheele applied
                    it to account for a great number of actions, and especially for its function in
                    respiration and the growth of plants. He went through a long series of actions,
                    seemingly the most diverse in character, trying to bring them under one general
                    law and making at every step the most acute and far-reaching observations and
                    discovering new compounds and new reactions. Thus he incidentally made and
                    described sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and he explained the chemical effect of
                    light upon compounds of silver and other substances.</p>
                <p>In 1778 he proposed a new method of making calomel and powder of algaroth. He
                    also examined a mineral, <hi rend="italic">molybdaena nitens,</hi> which had
                    been supposed to contain lead, but which he showed was quite distinct, and he
                    got from it molybdic acid. He demonstrated in 1779 that plumbago consists almost
                    solely of carbon, and he published a record of estimations of the amount of pure
                    air, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of oxygen, contained in the atmosphere, which
                    he had carried on daily during the entire year of 1778. In 1780 he showed that
                    the acidity of sour milk was due to a peculiar acid, now called lactic acid; and
                    from milk sugar, by boiling it with nitric acid, he obtained mucic acid. His
                    next discovery, in 1781, was the composition of tungsten, since called
                    scheelite, which he found consisted of lime combined with a peculiar
                    acid—tungstic acid. The following year he examined the mode of producing ether,
                    and in 1783 discovered glycerin, the sweet principle of fats and oils. In 1782-
                    1783 appeared a research which—of all those Scheele conducted— exhibits his
                    experimental genius at its very best. By a wonderful succession of experiments
                    he showed that the colouring matter of Prussian blue could not be produced
                    without the presence of a substance of the nature of an acid, to which was
                    ultimately given the name of prussic acid. He showed how this body was composed,
                    described its properties and compounds, and mentioned its smell and taste,
                    utterly unaware of its deadly character. Nothing but a study of Scheele’s own
                    memoir can give an adequate notion of the manner in which he attacked and solved
                    a problem so difficult aud complicated as this was at the period in the history
                    of chemistry when Scheele lived. In 1784-85-86 he returned to the subject with
                    which he had begun his career, that of the vegetable acids, and described four
                    new ones—citric, malic, oxalic, and gallic acids.</p>
                <p>The preceding is a bare list of the more prominent of Scheele’s discoveries, for
                    it must be remembered that he was not merely the first to prepare these bodies,
                    but that he made all the compounds of them possible at the time and explained
                    the conditions under which he produced them. Notable as is the list, and of
                    supreme importance as are most of the bodies themselves, no conception can be
                    gathered from it of Scheele’s immense power of experimental research,—a power
                    that has seldom, if ever, been surpassed. His natural endowments were cultivated
                    by unwearied practice and undivided attention; for scientific work was at once
                    his occupation and his relaxation. To appreciate this fully his own account of
                    his researches must be studied. It will thus be seen that his discoveries were
                    not made at haphazard, but were the outcome of experiments carefully planned to
                    substantiate the accuracy of theoretical views at which he had arrived. He thus
                    saved himself unnecessary labour; his experiments tell decisively on the
                    question at issue, and he reached his conclusions by the shortest and simplest
                    means. At the same time he left nothing in doubt if experiment would establish
                    it; he grudged no labour to make the truth indisputable; and he evidently never
                    considered his work complete about any body unless he could both unmake and
                    remake it. For him chemistry was both an analytic and a synthetic science, and
                    he shows this prominently in his researches on Prussian blue.</p>
                <p>His accuracy, qualitative and quantitative,—considering his primitive apparatus,
                    his want of assistance, his place of residence, the undeveloped state of
                    chemical and physical science,—was unrivalled. The work he executed left hardly
                    anything to be added to it: it was as thoroughly done as it was in the power of
                    an all-conscientious man to do. The one aim of Scheele’s life—and he never
                    swerved from it—was the experimental discovery of the truth in nature. Like many
                    other short-lived men of genius he compressed into his few years an amount of
                    work of the greatest originality; but how he managed to do it is a mystery to
                    the less-gifted. What he might have achieved had he lived a little longer can
                    only be surmised; but it may be supposed that, under the newer theory of
                    combustion to which he himself had unwittingly contributed so much, he would
                    have made certainly no fewer and no less important discoveries thau those which
                    were the outcome of its erroneous predecessor.</p>
                <p>Scheele’s papers appeared first in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the
