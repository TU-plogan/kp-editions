                    Loire, had long been completely Romanized. The very name “Gaul” was repudiated
                    by the inhabitants and confined to the natives of the ruder northern districts.
                    The lifetime of Severus exactly coincided with the period of greatest literary
                    development in Aquitania, then the truest or only true home of Latin letters and
                    learning— their last place of refuge, from which Severus saw them driven before
                    he closed his eyes on the world. Almost all that we know of his life comes from
                    a few allusions in his own writings, and some passages in the letters of his
                    friend Paulinus, bishop of Nola. In his early days he was famous as a pleader in
                    the courts, and his knowledge of Roman law is reflected in parts of his
                    writings. He married a wealthy lady belonging to a consular family, who died
                    young, leaving him no children. At this time Severus came under the powerful
                    influence of St Martin, bishop of Tours, by whom he was led to devote his wealth
                    to the Christian poor, and his own powers to a life of good works and
                    meditation. To use the words of his friend Paulinus, he broke with his father,
                    followed Christ, and set the teachings of the “fishermen” far above all his
                    “Tullian learning.” He rose to no higher rank in the church than that of
                    presbyter. His time was passed chiefly in the neighbourhood of Toulouse, and
                    such literary efforts as he permitted to himself were made in the interests of
                    Christianity. In many respects no two men could be more unlike than Severus, the
                    scholar and orator, well versed in the ways of the world, and Martin, the rough
                    Pannonian bishop of Tours, ignorant of learning, suspicious of culture, the
                    champion of the monastic life, the seer of visions, and the worker of miracles.
                    Yet the spirit of the rugged saint subdued that of the polished scholar, and the
                    works of Severus would have little importance now did they not reflect the
                    ideas, influence, and aspirations of Martin, the foremost ecclesiastic of Gaul,
                    and one of the most striking figures in the church of his day.</p>
                <p>The chief work of Severus is the <hi rend="italic">Chronica,</hi> a summary of
                    sacred history from the beginning of the world to his own times, with the
                    omission of the events recorded in the Gospels and the Acts, “lest the form of
                    his brief work should detract from the honour due to those events.” The book was
                    in fact a text-book, and was actually used as such in the schools of Europe for
                    about a century and a half after the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> was
                    published by Flacius Illyricus in 1556. Severus nowhere clearly points to the
                    class of readers for whom his book is designed. He disclaims the intention of
                    making his work a substitute for the actual narrative contained in the Bible.
                    “Worldly historians” had been used by him, he says, to make clear the dates and
                    the connexion of events and for supplementing the sacred sources, and with the
                    intent at one and the same time to instruct the unlearned and to “convince” the
                    learned. Probably the “unlearned” are the mass of Christians and the learned are
                    the cultivated Christians and pagans alike, to whom the rude language of the
                    sacred texts, whether in their Greek or their Latin form, would be distasteful.
                    The literary structure of the narrative itself shows that Severus had in his
                    mind principally readers on the same level of culture with himself. He was
                    anxious to show that sacred history might be presented in a form which lovers of
                    Sallust and Tacitus could appreciate and enjoy. The style is lucid and almost
                    classical. Though phrases and even sentences from many classical authors are
                    inwoven here and there, the narrative flows on easily, with no trace of the
                    jolts and jerks which offend us in almost every line of a patchwork imitator of
                    the classics like Sidonius. In order that his work might fairly stand beside
                    that of the old Latin writers, Severus boldly ignored the allegorical methods of
                    interpreting sacred history to which the heretics and the orthodox of the age
                    were alike wedded. Possibly he was not unshaken in his adherence to the peculiar
                    reading which nearly all men then gave to the maxim that “the letter killeth but
                    the spirit maketh alive.”</p>
                <p>As an authority for times antecedent to his own, Severus is of little moment. At
                    only a few points does he enable us to correct or supplement other records.
                    Bernays has shown that he based his narrative of the destruction of Jerusalem by
                    Titus on the account given by Tacitus in his “Histories,” a portion of which has
                    been lost. We are enabled thus to contrast Tacitus with Josephus, who warped his
                    narrative to do honour to Titus. In his allusions to the Gentile rulers with
                    whom the Jews came into contact from the time of the Maccabees onwards, Severus
                    discloses some points which are not without importance. But the real interest of
                    his work lies, first, in the incidental glimpses it affords all through of the
                    history of his own time, next and more particularly, in the information he has
                    preserved concerning the struggle over the Priscillianist heresy, which
                    disorganized and degraded the churches of Spain and Gaul, and particularly
                    affected Aquitaine. The sympathies here betrayed by Severus are wholly those of
                    St Martin. The stout bishop had withstood to his face Maximus, who ruled for
                    some years a large part of the western portion of the empire, though he never
                    conquered Italy. He had reproached him with attacking and overthrowing his
                    predecessors on the throne, and for his dealings with the church. Severus loses
                    no opportunity presented by his narrative for laying stress on the crimes and
                    follies of rulers, and on their cruelty, though he once declares that, cruel as
                    rulers could be, priests could be crueller still. This last statement has
                    reference to the bishops who had left Maximus no peace till he had stained his
                    hands with the blood of Priscillian and his followers. Martin, too, had
                    denounced the worldliness and greed of the Gaulish bishops and clergy.
                    Accordingly we find that Severus, in narrating the division of Canaan among the
                    tribes, calls the special attention of ecclesiastics to the fact that no portion
                    of the land was assigned to the tribe of Levi, lest they should be hindered in
                    their service of God. “Our clergy seem,” he says, “not merely forgetful of the
                    lesson but ignorant of it, such a passion for possessions has in our days
                    fastened like a pestilence on their souls. They are greedy of property, and tend
                    their estates and hoard their gold, and buy and sell and give their minds to
                    gain. Those of them who are reputed to be of better principles, who neither hold
                    property nor barter, sit and wait for gifts, and pollute all the grace of their
                    lives by taking fees, while they almost make market of their holiness; but I
                    have digressed farther than I intended, through vexation and weariness of the
                    present age.” We here catch an interesting glimpse of the circumstances which
                    were winning over good men to monasticism in the West, though the evidence of an
                    enthusiastic votary of the solitary life, such as Severus was, is probably not
                    free from exaggeration. Severus also fully sympathized with the action of St
                    Martin touching Priscillianism. This mysterious Western offshoot of Gnosticism
                    had no single feature about it which could soften the hostility of a character
                    such as Martin’s was, but he staunchly resisted the introduction of secular
                    punishment for evil doctrine, and withdrew from communion with those bishops in
                    Gaul, a large majority, who invoked the aid of Maximus against their erring
                    brethren. In this connexion it is interesting to note the account given by
                    Severus of the synod held at Rimini in 359, where the question arose whether the
                    bishops attending the assembly might lawfully receive money from the imperial
                    treasury to recoup their travelling and other expenses. Severus evidently
                    approves the action of the British and Gaulish bishops, who deemed it unbecoming
                    that they should lie under pecuniary obligation to the emperor. His ideal of the
                    church required that it should stand clear of and above the state.</p>
                <p>After the <hi rend="italic">Chronica</hi> the chief work of Severus is his <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Marlin,</hi> a contribution to popular Christian
                    literature which did much to establish the great reputation which that
                    wonderworking saint maintained throughout the Middle Ages. The book is not
                    properly a biography, but a catalogue of miracles, told in all the simplicity of
                    absolute belief. The power to work miraculous signs is assumed to be in direct
                    proportion to holiness, and is by Severus valued merely as an evidence of
                    holiness, which he is persuaded can only be attained through a life of isolation
                    from the<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n728/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0728-0703"/> world. In the first of his dialogues Severus puts
                    into the mouth of an interlocutor a most pleasing description of the life of
                    coenobites and solitaries in the deserts bordering on Egypt. The main evidence
                    of the virtue attained by them lies in the voluntary subjection to them of the
                    savage beasts among which they lived. But Severus was no indiscriminating
                    adherent of monasticism. The same dialogue shows him to be alive to its dangers
                    and defects. The second dialogue is a large appendix to the Life of Martin, and
                    really supplies more information of his life as bishop and of his views than the
                    work which bears the title <hi rend="italic">Vila S. Martini.</hi> The two
                    dialogues occasionally make interesting references to personages of the epoch.
                    In Dial. 1, cc. 6, 7, we have a vivid picture of the controversies which raged
                    at Alexandria over the works of Origen. The judgment of Severus himself is no
                    doubt that which he puts in the mouth of his interlocutor Postumianus: “I am
                    astonished that one and the same man could have so far differed from himself
                    that in the approved portion of his works he has no equal since the apostles,
                    while in that portion for which he is justly blamed it is proved that no man has
                    committed more unseemly errors.” Three epistles complete the list of Severus’s
                    genuine works. He is said to have been led away in his old age by Pelagianism,
                    but to have repented and inflicted long-enduring penance on himself.</p>
                <p>The text of the <hi rend="italic">Chronica</hi> rests on a single MS., one of the
                    Palatine collection now in the Vatican; of the other works MSS. are abundant.
                    Some spurious letters bear the name of Severus; also in a MS. at Madrid is a
                    work falsely professing to be an epitome of the <hi rend="italic">Chronica</hi>
                    of Severus, and going down to 511. The chief editions of the complete works of
                    Severus are those by De Prato (Verona, 1741) and by Halm (forming vol. i. of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum,</hi> Vienna,
                    1866). There is a most admirable monograph on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronica</hi> by Bernays (Berlin, 1S61). (J. S. B.)</p>
