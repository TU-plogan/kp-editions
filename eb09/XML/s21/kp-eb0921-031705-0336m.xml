                <p><label type="entry">SATIRE</label>. Satire, in its literary aspect, may be
                    defined as the expression in adequate terms of the sense of amusement or disgust
                    excited by the ridiculous or unseemly, provided that humour is a distinctly
                    recognizable element, and that the utterance is invested with literary form.
                    Without humour, satire is invective; without literary form, it is mere clownish
                    jeering. It is indeed exceedingly difficult to define the limits between satire
                    and the regions of literary sentiment into which it shades. The lofty ethical
                    feeling of a Johnson or a Carlyle borders it on the one hand, the witty sarcasm
                    of a Talleyrand, rancorous or good-natured, on the other; but, however exalted
                    the satirist’s aims, or amiable his temper, a basis of contempt or dislike is
                    the groundwork of his art. This feeling may be diverted from the failings of man
                    individual to the feebleness and imperfection of man universal, and the
                    composition may still be a satire; but if the element of scorn or sarcasm were
                    entirely eliminated it would become a sermon. That this expression of aversion
                    is of the essence of satire appears from the fact that the literary power which,
                    the more it is exerted upon<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n337/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0337-0318"/> grave and elevated subjects, removes them further
                    and further from the domain of satire can confer satiric dignity upon the most
                    scurrilous lampoon. The distinction between the intellectual form and the raw
                    material of satire is admirably illustrated by a passage in an accomplished
                    novelist. The clever young lady happening to compare a keen and bright person to
                    a pair of scissors, her unrefined companion is for the moment unable to
                    understand how a human being can resemble a piece of cutlery; but suddenly a
                    light breaks in upon her, and, taking up a broken pair of scissors from the
                    table, she imitates the halting gait of a lame lady, declaring that Mrs Brown
                    resembles that particular pair of scissors to the life. The first interlocutor
                    could have been satirical if she would; the second would if she could. The nice
                    and delicate perception of the former type of character may be fairly driven
                    into satire by the vulgarity and obtuseness of the second, as in the case of
                    Miss Austen; and it may be added that the general development of civilization,
                    repressing highhanded wrongs against which ridicule is no defence, and
                    encouraging failings which can be effectually attacked in no other manner,
                    continually tends to make satire more congenial to the amiable and refined, and
                    thus exalt its moral tone and purpose.</p>
                <p>The first exercise of satire was no doubt sufficiently coarse and boisterous. It
                    must have consisted in gibing at personal defects; and Homer’s description of
                    Thersites, the earliest example of literary satire that has come down to us,
                    probably conveys an accurate delineation of the first satirists, the carpers and
                    fault-finders of the clan. The character reappears in the heroic romances of
                    Ireland, and elsewhere; and it is everywhere implied that the licensed backbiter
                    is a warped and distorted being, readier with his tongue than his hands. The
                    verdict of unsophisticated man on satire is clearly that it is the offspring of
                    ill-nature; to redeem and dignify it by rendering it the instrument of morality
                    or the associate of poetry was a development implying considerable advance in
                    the literary art. The latter is the course adopted in the Old Testament, where
                    the few passages approximating to satire, such as Jotham’s parable of the
                    bramble and Job’s ironical address to his friends, are embellished either by
                    fancy or by feeling. An intermediate stage between personal ridicule and the
                    correction of faults and follies seems to have been represented in Greece by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Margites,</hi> attributed to Homer, which, while professedly
                    lampooning an individual, practically rebuked the meddling sciolism impersonated
                    in him. In the accounts that have come down to us of the writings of
                    Archilochus, the first great master of satire (about 700 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> we seem to trace the elevation of the instrument of private
                    animosity to an element in public life. Though a merciless assailant of
                    individuals, Archilochus was also a distinguished statesman, naturally for the
                    most part in opposition, and his writings seem to have fulfilled many of the
                    functions of a newspaper press. Their extraordinary merit is attested by the
                    infallible judgment of Quintilian eight hundred years after their composition;
                    and Gorgias’s comparison of them with Plato’s persiflage of the Sophists proves
                    that their virulence must have been tempered by grace and refinement.
                    Archilochus also gave satiric poetry its accepted form by the invention of the
                    iambic trimeter, slightly modified into the scazonic metre by his successors.
                    Simonides of Amorgus, about a generation later, and Hipponax, a century later
                    still, were distinguished like Archilochus for the bitterness of their attacks
                    on individuals, with which the former combined a strong ethical feeling, and the
                    latter a bright active fancy. All three were restless and turbulent, aspiring
                    and discontented, impatient of abuses and theoretically enamoured of liberty;
                    and the loss of their writings, which would have thrown great light on the
                    politics as well as the manners of Greece, is exceedingly to be lamented. With
                    Hipponax the direct line of Greek satire is interrupted; but two new forms of
                    literary composition, exceedingly capable of being rendered the vehicles of
                    satire, almost simultaneously make their appearance. Fable is first heard of in
                    Asiatic Greece about this date; and, although its original intention does not
                    seem to have been satirical, its adaptability to satiric purposes was soon
                    discovered and turned to account. A far more important step was the elevation of
                    the rude fun of rustic merrymakings to a literary status by the evolution of the
                    drama from the Bacchic festival. The means had now been found of allying the
                    satiric spirit with exalted poetry, and their union was consummated in the
                    person of a poet who combined humour with imagination in a degree never again to
                    be rivalled until Shakespeare. Every variety of satire is exemplified in the
                    comedies of Aristophanes; and if he does not rank as the first of satirists it
                    is only because he is so much beside. Such affluence of poetical genius could
                    not be perpetual, any more than the peculiar political and social conditions
                    which for a time made such fearless and uncontrolled satire possible. Through
                    the half-way house of mythological parody the comedy of public life passes into
                    the comedy of manners, metrical still, but approximating more closely to prose,
                    and consequently to satire on its own side of the line which it is convenient if
                    not strictly logical to trace between dramatists and ordinary satiric writers.
                    The step from Menander to Lucilius is not a long one, but it was not destined to
                    be taken by a Greek.</p>
                <p>A rude form of satire had existed in Italy from an early date in the shape of the
                    Fescennine verses, the rough and licentious pleasantry of the vintage and
                    harvest, which, lasting down to the 16th century, inspired Tansillo’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Vendemmiatore.</hi> As in Greece, these eventually, about 364 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> were developed into a rude drama, originally
                    introduced as a religious expiation. This was at first, Livy tells us (vii. 2),
                    merely pantomimic, as the dialect of the Tuscan actors imported for the occasion
                    was not understood at Rome. Verse, “like to the Fescennine verses in point of
                    style and manner,” was soon added to accompany the mimetic action, and, with
                    reference to the variety of metres employed, these probably improvised
                    compositions were entitled <hi rend="italic">Saturse,</hi> a term denoting <hi
                    rend="italic">miscellany,</hi> and derived from the <hi rend="italic">satura
                    lanx,</hi> “a charger filled with the first-fruits of the year’s produce,
                    anciently offered to Bacchus and Ceres.” The Romans thus had originated the name
                    of satire, and, in so far as the Fescennine drama consisted of raillery and
                    ridicule, possessed the thing also; but it had not yet assumed a literary form
                    among them. Livius Andronicus (240 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> the first
                    regular Latin dramatic poet, appears to have been little more than a translator
                    from the Greek. Satires are mentioned among the literary productions of Ennius
                    (200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> and Pacuvius (170 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> but the title rather refers to the variety of metres employed than
                    to the genius of the composition. The real inventor of Roman satire is Caius
                    Lucilius (148-103 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satires</hi> seem to have been mostly satirical in the modern acceptation of
                    the term, while the subjects of some of them prove that the title continued to
                    be applied to miscellaneous collections of poems, as was the case even to the
                    time of Varro, whose “Saturse” included prose as well as verse, and appear to
                    have been only partially satirical. The fragments of Lucilius preserved are
                    unfortunately very scanty, but the verdict of Horace, Cicero, and Quintilian
                    demonstrates that he was a very considerable poet. It is needless to dwell on
                    compositions so universally known as the <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> of
                    Lucilius’s successor Horace, in whose hands this class of composition
                    received<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n338/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0338-0319"/> an entirely new development, becoming genial,
                    playful, and persuasive. “Arch Horace strove to mend.” The didactic element
                    preponderates still more in the philosophical satires of Persius, the
                    propagandist of Stoicism, a writer whose intensity, dramatic gift, obscurity,
                    and abruptness render him, like the Browning and Meredith of our own days, the
                    luxury of the few and the despair of the many. Yet another form of satire, the
                    rhetorical, was carried to the utmost limits of excellence by Juvenal, the first
                    example of a great tragic satirist. Nearly at the same time Martial, improving
                    on earlier Roman models now lost, gave that satirical turn to the epigram which
                    it only exceptionally possessed in Greece, but has ever since retained. The
                    brevity, pregnancy, and polish of the Latin tongue were never more felicitously
                    exemplified than by this gifted writer. About the same time another variety of
                    satire came into vogue, destined to become the most important of any. The
                    Milesian tale, a form of entertainment probably of Eastern origin, grew in the
                    hands of Petronius and Apuleius into the satirical romance, immensely widening
                    the satirist’s field and exempting him from the restraints of metre. Petronius’s
                    “Supper of Trimalchio” is the revelation of a new vein, never fully worked till
                    our days. As the novel arose upon the ruins of the epic, so dialogue sprung up
                    upon the wreck of comedy. In Lucian comedy appears adapted to suit the
                    exigencies of an age in which a living drama had become impossible. Lucian’s
                    position as a satirist is something new, and could not, from the nature of the
                    case, have been occupied by any of his predecessors. For the first time since
                    the origin of civilization society felt apprehensive of impending dissolution,
                    and its fears found an interpreter in the Sophist of Samosata, “the Voltaire of
                    paganism,” an universal censor and mocker, devoid of the Christian’s hope of
                    general renovation, and unable to foresee the new social order which the
                    barbarian conquest was destined to create. Next to his wit, Lucian’s special
                    note is his sturdy love of truth and demand for genuineness in all things. With
                    him antique satire expires as a distinct branch of literature,—though mention
                    should be made of the sarcasms and libels with which the population of Egypt
                    were for centuries accustomed to insult the Roman conqueror and his parasites.
                    An exceedingly curious specimen, a denunciation of the apostate poet Hor-Uta—a
                    kind of Egyptian “Lost Leader ”—composed under Augustus, has recently been
                    published by M. Revillout from a demotic papyrus.</p>
                <p>It is highly interesting to remark how, after the great deluge of barbarism has
                    begun to retire, one form of satire after another peeps forth from the receding
                    flood, the order of development being determined by the circumstances of time
                    and place. In the Byzantine empire, indeed, the link of continuity is unbroken,
                    and such raillery of abuses as is possible under a despotism finds vent in the
                    pale copies of Lucian published in Ellissen’s <hi rend="italic">Analelcten.</hi>
                    The first really important satire, however, is a product of Western Europe,
                    recurring to the primitive form of fable, upon which, nevertheless, it
                    constitutes a decided advance. <hi rend="italic">Reynard the Fox,</hi> a genuine
                    expression of the shrewd and homely Teutonic mind, is a landmark in literature.
                    It gave the beast-epic a development of which the ancients had not dreamed, and
                    showed how cutting ridicule could be conveyed in a form difficult to resent.
                    About the same time, probably, the popular instinct, perhaps deriving a hint
                    from Rabbinical literature, fashioned Morolf, the prototype of Sancho Panza, the
                    incarnation of sublunar mother-wit contrasted with the starry wisdom of Solomon;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Till Eulenspiegel</hi> is a kindred Teutonic creation,
                    but later and less significant. <hi rend="italic">Piers Ploughman,</hi> the next
                    great work of the class, adapts the apocalyptic machinery of monastic and
                    anchoritic vision to the purposes of satire, as it had often before been adapted
                    to those of ecclesiastical aggrandizement. The clergy were scourged with their
                    own rod by a poet and a Puritan too earnest to be urbane. Satire is a distinct
                    element in Chaucer and Boccaccio, who nevertheless cannot be ranked as
                    satirists. The mock-heroic is successfully revived by Pulci, and the political
                    songs of the 14th and 15th centuries attest the diffusion of a sense of humour
                    among the people at large. The Renaissance, restoring the knowledge and
                    encouraging the imitation of classic models, sharpened the weapons and enlarged
                    the armoury of the satirist. Partly, perhaps, because Erasmus was no poet, the
                    Lucianic dialogue was the form in the ascendant of his age. Erasmus not merely
                    employed it against superstition and ignorance with infinite and irresistible
                    pleasantry, but fired by his example a bolder writer, untrammelled by the
                    dignity of an arbiter in the republic of letters. The ridicule of Ulric von
                    Hutten’s <hi rend="italic">Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum</hi> is annihilating,
                    and the art there for the first time fully exemplified though long previously
                    introduced by Plato, of putting the ridicule into the mouth of the victim, is
                    perhaps the most deadly shaft in the quiver of sarcasm. It was afterwards used
                    with even more pointed wit though with less exuberance of humour by Pascal, the
                    first modern example, if Dante may not be so classed, of a great tragic
                    satirist. Ethical satire is vigorously represented by Sebastian Brant and his
                    imitator Alexander Barclay; but in general the metrical satirists of the age
                    seem tame in comparison with Erasmus and Hutten, though including the great name
                    of Machiavelli. Sir Thomas More cannot be accounted a satirist, but his idea of
                    an imaginary commonwealth embodied the germ of much subsequent satire. In the
                    succeeding period politics take the place of literature and religion, producing
                    in France the <hi rend="italic">Satyre Ménippée,</hi> elsewhere the satirical
                    romance as represented by the <hi rend="italic">Argenis</hi> of Barclay, which
                    may be defined as the adaptation of the style of Petronius to state affairs. In
                    Spain, where no freedom of criticism existed, the satiric spirit took refuge in
                    the <hi rend="italic">novela picaresca,</hi> the prototype of Le Sage and the
                    ancestor of Fielding; Quevedo revived the mediaeval device of the vision as the
                    vehicle of reproof; and Cervantes’s immortal work might be classed as a satire
                    were it not so much more. About the same time we notice the appearance of direct
                    imitation of the Roman satirists in English literature in the writings of Donne,
                    Hall, and Marston, the further elaboration of the mock-heroic by Tassoni, and
                    the culmination of classical Italian satire in Salvator Rosa. The prodigious
                    development of the drama at this time absorbed much talent that would otherwise
                    have been devoted to satire proper. Most of the great dramatists of the 17th
                    century were more or less satirists, Molière perhaps the most consummate that
                    ever existed; but, with an occasional exception like <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Précieuses Ridicules,</hi> the range of their works is too wide to admit of
                    their being regarded as satires. The next great example of unadulterated satire
                    is Butler’s <hi rend="italic">Hudibras,</hi> and perhaps one more truly
                    representative of satiric aims and methods cannot easily be found. At the same
                    period dignified political satire, bordering on invective, received a great
                    development in Andrew Marvell’s <hi rend="italic">Advices to a Painter,</hi> and
                    was shortly afterwards carried to perfection in Dryden’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Absalom and Achitophel;</hi> while the light literary parody of which
                    Aristophanes had given the pattern in his assaults on Euripides, and which
                    Shakespeare had handled somewhat carelessly in the <hi rend="italic">Midsummer
                    Night’s Dream,</hi> was effectively revived in the duke of Buckingham’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Rehearsal.</hi> In France Boileau was long held to have attained
                    the <hi rend="italic">ne plus ultra</hi> of the Horatian style in satire and of
                    the mock-heroic, but Pope was soon<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n339/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0339-0320"/> to show that further progress was possible in
                    both. The polish, point, and concentration of Pope remain unsurpassed, as do the
                    amenity of Addison and the daring yet severely logical imagination of Swift;
                    while the <hi rend="italic">History of John Bull</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pseudologia</hi> place their friend Arbuthnot in the first rank of political
                    satirists. The 18th century was, indeed, the age of satire. Serious poetry had
                    for the time worn itself out; the most original geniuses of the age, Swift,
                    Defoe, and Richardson, are decidedly prosaic, and Pope, though a true poet, is
                    less of a poet than Dryden. In process of time imaginative power revives in
                    Goldsmith and Rousseau; meanwhile Fielding and Smollett have fitted the novel to
                    be the vehicle of satire and much beside, and the literary stage has for a time
                    been almost wholly engrossed by a colossal satirist, a man who has dared the
                    universal application of Shaftesbury’s maxim that ridicule is the test of truth.
                    The world had never before seen a satirist on the scale of Voltaire, nor had
                    satire ever played such a part as a factor in impending change. The parallel
                    with Lucian is in some respects very close. Toleration was Voltaire’s idol, as
                    truth was Lucian’s; and thus, aiming more than his predecessor at the practical
                    reformation of manners and institutions, his work was less purely negative. He
                    was nevertheless a destroyer, and as utterly out of sympathy with the positive
                    spirit of science for which he was preparing the way as Lucian could possibly be
                    with Goths or Christians. As a master of sarcastic mockery he is unsurpassed;
                    his manner is entirely his own; and he is one of the most intensely national of
                    writers, notwithstanding his vast obligations to English humorists, statesmen,
                    and philosophers. English humour also played an important part in the literary
                    regeneration of Germany, where, after Liscow and Rabener, direct imitators of
                    Swift and the essayists, Lessing, imbued with Pope but not mastered by him,
                    showed how powerful an auxiliary satire can be to criticism,—a relation which
                    Pope had somewhat inverted. Another great German writer, Wieland, owes little to
                    the English, but adapts Lucian and Petronius to the 18th century with playful if
                    somewhat mannered grace. Kortum’s <hi rend="italic">Jobsiad,</hi> a most
                    humorous poem, innovates successfully upon established models by making low
                    life, instead of chivalry, the subject of burlesque. Goethe and Schiller, Scott
                    and Wordsworth, are now at hand, and as imagination gains ground satire
                    declines. Byron, who in the 18th century would have been the greatest of
                    satirists, is hurried by the spirit of his age into passion and description,
                    bequeathing, however, a splendid proof of the possibility of allying satire with
                    sublimity in his <hi rend="italic">Vision of Judgment.</hi> Moore gives the
                    epigram a lyrical turn; Béranger, not for the first time in French literature,
                    makes the gay chanson the instrument of biting jest; and the classic type
                    receives fresh currency from Auguste Barbier. Courier, and subsequently
                    Corinenin, raise the political pamphlet to literary dignity by their poignant
                    wit. Peacock evolves a new type of novel from the study of Athenian comedy. Miss
                    Edgeworth skirts the confines of satire, and Miss Austen, the most refined and
                    delicate of all observers of manners, seasons her novels with the most exquisite
                    satiric traits. Washington Irving revives the manner of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Spectator,</hi> and Tieck brings irony and persiflage to the discussion of
                    critical problems. Two great satiric figures remain,—one representative of his
                    nation, the other most difficult to class. In all the characteristics of his
                    genius Thackeray is thoroughly English, and the faults and follies he chastises
                    are those especially characteristic of British society. Good sense and the
                    perception of the ridiculous are amalgamated in him; his satire is a thoroughly
                    British article, a little over-solid, a little wanting in finish, but honest,
                    weighty, and durable. Posterity will go to him for the humours of the age of
                    Victoria, as they go to Addison for those of Anne’s. But Heine hardly belongs to
                    any nation or country, time or place. He ceased to be a German without becoming
                    a Frenchman, and a Jew without becoming a Christian. Only one portrait really
                    suits him, that in Tieck’s allegorical tale, where he is represented as a
                    capricious and mischievous elf; but his song is sweeter and his command over the
                    springs of laughter and tears greater than it suited Tieck’s purpose to
                    acknowledge. In him the satiric spirit, long confined to established literary
                    forms, seems to obtain unrestrained freedom to wander where it will, nor have
                    the ancient models been followed since by any considerable satirist except the
                    Italian Giusti. The machinery employed by Moore was indeed transplanted to
                    America by Russell Lowell, whose <hi rend="italic">Biglow Papers</hi> represent
                    perhaps the highest moral level yet attained by satire. In no age has the spirit
                    of satire been so generally diffused as in the 19th century, but many of its
                    eminent writers, while bordering on the domains of satire, escape the definition
                    of satirist. The term cannot be properly applied to Dickens, the keen observer
                    of the oddities of human life; or to George Eliot, the critic of its emptiness
                    when not inspired by a worthy purpose; or to Balzac, the painter of French
                    society; or to Trollope, the mirror of the middle classes of England. If <hi
                    rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> could be regarded as a satire, Carlyle would
                    rank among the first of satirists; but the satire, though very obvious, rather
                    accompanies than inspires the composition. The number of minor satirists of
                    merit, on the other hand, is legion, and but few can be mentioned here. Poole,
                    in his broadly farcical <hi rend="italic">Little Pedlington,</hi> has rung the
                    changes with inexhaustible ingenuity on a single fruitful idea; Jerrold’s
                    comedies sparkle with epigrams, and his tales and sketches overflow with quaint
                    humour; Mallock has made the most of personal mimicry, the lowest form of
                    satire; Samuel Butler holds an inverting mirror to the world’s face with
                    imperturbable gravity; Courthope reproduces the airy grace and sonorous melody
                    of the Attic comedy; and the anonymous writer of the “Barnum” Christmas number
                    of <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi> has resuscitated with equal effect its reckless
                    fun and personality. One remarkable feature of the age is the union of
                    caricature with literature to a degree inconceivable before the improvements in
                    wood-engraving. All large capitals now have their comic illustrated journals,
                    destined for the most part to be the marvels and stumbling-blocks of posterity.
                    <hi rend="italic">Punch,</hi> however, has become almost a national institution,
                    and has fostered the genius of two pictorial satirists of the first rank, Leech
                    and Tenniel. The present tendencies of the civilized world seem highly
                    favourable to the influence of satire as a factor in human affairs, but
                    unfavourable to the production of satiric masterpieces. Satire is the inevitable
                    concomitant of freedom of speech, which must continue to prevail and diffuse
                    itself unless checked by military or socialistic despotism. But as the privilege
                    of the many it is less likely to be the resource of the few; and it may happen
                    that the press, dealing with follies of the day as they arise, will more and
                    more forestall the satire that springs from meditation and study. The principal
                    security is the originality and robustness of true satiric genius, which, having
                    defied prisons and scaffolds in the past, may find the means of eluding public
                    impatience and satiety in the future. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. g.)</hi></p>
