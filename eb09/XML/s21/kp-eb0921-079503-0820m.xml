                    the dramatist, was the first to connect the family with literature. He is
                    chiefly known as the favourite companion and confidant of Swift during his later
                    residence in Ireland. But enough is left of his writing to enable us to
                    understand the secret of his attraction for a man not easily pleased. His
                    correspondence with Swift and his whimsical treatise on the <hi rend="italic"

                    written by the author of <hi rend="italic">The Critic.</hi> Swift had a high
                    opinion of his scholarship, and that it was not contemptible is attested by an
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> of Persius, printed at Dublin in
                    1728. When Swift came to Dublin as dean of St Patrick's, Sheridan was

                    landed patrimony in Cavan, and a bishop in the family two generations back. He
                    so won upon the dean with his mirthfulness, wit, scholarship, good-nature, and
                    honesty that in a short time no party made for the dean’s entertainment was
                    considered complete without Sheridan. Sheridan was his confidant in the affair
                    of <hi rend="italic">Drapier's Letters</hi>; it was at Quilca,<note

                    rend="italic">Gulliver’s Travels</hi> was prepared for the press; and this
                    favoured friend was from an early period in their acquaintance one of his most
                    confidential correspondents when at a distance. Through Swift’s influence he
                    obtained a living near Cork, but damaged his prospects of further preferment by
                    a feat of unlucky absence of mind. Having to preach at Cork on the anniversary
                    of Queen Anne’s death he hurriedly chose a sermon with the text, “Sufficient
                    unto the day is the evil thereof,” and was at once struck off the list of
                    chaplains to the lord-lieutenant and forbidden the castle. In spite of this
                    mishap, for which the archdeacon of Cork made amends by the present of a lease
                    worth £250 per annum, he “still remained,” according to Lord Orrery, “a punster,
                    a quibbler, a fiddler, and a wit,” the only person in whose genial presence
                    Swift relaxed his habitual gloom. His latter days were not prosperous, probably
                    owing to his having “a better knowledge of books than of men or of the value of
                    money,” and he died in poverty and ill-health in 1738. The biographers of
                    Brinsley Sheridan are disposed to dwell chiefly on the eccentricities of his
                    ancestors, but both his grandfather and his father gave ample proof of more
                    solid qualities than improvidence and wit. The original source of information
                    about the schoolmaster grandfather is the father’s <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Swift</hi> (pp. 369-395), where his scholarship is dwelt upon as much as his
                    improvident conviviality and simple kindliness of nature.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas Sheridan</hi> (1721-1788), son of the above, born
                    at Quilca in 1721, had a more conspicuous career than his father. This ambitious
                    father sent him to an English school, Westminster; but he was forced by stress
                    of circumstances to return to Dublin and complete his education at Trinity
                    College. Then he went on the stage, and at once made a local reputation. There
                    is a tradition that on his first appearance in London he was set up as a rival
                    to Garrick, and Moore countenances the idea that Garrick remained jealous of him
                    to the end. For this tradition there is little foundation. Sheridan’s first
                    appearance in London was at Covent Garden in March 1744, when, heralded in
                    advance as the brilliant Irish comedian, he acted for three weeks in a
                    succession of leading parts, <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> being the first. He
                    did not appear in London again till ten years afterwards, when he was the
                    leading actor for a season at the same theatre. In the interval he had been
                    manager of a theatre in Dublin, had married a highly accomplished and well-born
                    lady (see next notice), and had been driven from Dublin as a result of taking
                    the unpopular side in politics. After his season in London he tried Dublin
                    again, but after two years more of unremunerative management, he left for
                    England finally in 1758. By this time he had conceived his scheme of British
                    education, and it was to push this rather than his connexion with the stage that
                    he crossed St George’s Channel. He lectured at Oxford and Cambridge, and
                    received honorary degrees from both universities in 1758 and 1759. But the
                    scheme did not make way, and we find him in 1760 acting under Garrick at Drury
                    Lane. His merits as an actor may be judged from the description of him in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rosciad</hi> (1. 987) at this period. He is placed in the
                    second rank, next to Garrick, but there is no hint of possible rivalry.
                    Churchill describes him as an actor whose conceptions were superior to his
                    powers of execution, whose action was always forcible but too mechanically
                    calculated, and who in spite of all his defects rose to greatness in occasional
                    scenes. Churchill never erred on the side of praising too much, and his
                    description may be accepted as correct, supported as it is by the fact that the
                    actor eked out his income by giving lessons in elocution. Boswell has some
                    amusing remarks on his success with a distinguished Scotch pupil, who used his
                    influence to get a pension for him from Lord Bute. Sheridan, however, attracted
                    attention chiefly by his enthusiastic advocacy, in public lectures and books, of
                    his scheme of education, in which oratory was to play a principal part. It is
                    generally said that he traced all the evils and perils of the Commonwealth to
                    the neglect of oratory. But this is a caricature. There was more serious
                    substance in his indictment of the established system of education. His main
                    count was that it did not fit the higher classes for their duties in life, that
                    it was uniform for all and profitable for none; and he urged as a matter of
                    vital national concern that special training should be given for the various
                    professions. Oratory came in as part of the special training of men intended for
                    public affairs, but his main contention was one very familiar now,—that more
                    time should be given in schools to the study of the English language. He rode
                    his hobby with great enthusiasm, published an elaborate and eloquent treatise on
                    education, and lectured on the subject in London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh,
                    and other towns. In 1769, after a residence of some years in France, partly for
                    economy, partly for his wife’s health, partly to study the system of education
                    there, he published a matured <hi rend="italic">Plan of Education,</hi> with a
                    letter to the king, in which he offered to devote the rest of his life to the
                    execution of his theories on condition of receiving a pension equivalent to the
                    sacrifice of his professional income. His offer was not accepted; but Sheridan,
                    still enthusiastic, retired to Bath, and prepared a pronouncing <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionary of the English Language,</hi> with a prosodial grammar.
                    After his son’s brilliant success he assisted in the management of Drury Lane,
                    and occasionally acted. His <hi rend="italic">Life of Swift,</hi> a very
                    entertaining book in spite of its incompleteness as a biography, was published
                    in 1784. He died at Margate in 1788. The year before his death he had a prospect
                    of realizing his scheme of education in Ireland, but the high official who had
                    sought his advice died just as the old man eagerly reached Dublin, and his hopes
                    were disappointed.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Frances Sheridan</hi> (1724-1766), wife of the above, and
                    mother of the dramatist, wrote two novels of high repute in their day, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sidney Biddulph</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nourjahad,</hi> and two
                    plays, <hi rend="italic">The Discovery</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Dupe.</hi>
                    We have it on the authority of Moore that, when <hi rend="italic">The
                    Rivals</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Duenna</hi> were running at Covent Garden,
                    Garrick revived <hi rend="italic">The Discovery</hi> at Drury Lane, as a
                    counter-attraction, “to play the mother off against the son, taking on himself
                    to act the principal part in it.” But the statement, intrinsically absurd, is
                    inaccurate. <hi rend="italic">The Discovery</hi> was not an old play at the
                    time, but one of Garrick’s stock pieces, and Anthony Bromville was one of his
                    favourite characters. It was first produced in 1763. So far from being jealous
                    of the elder Sheridan, Garrick seems to have been a most useful friend to the
                    family, accepting his wife’s play— which he declared to be “one of the best
                    comedies he ever read ”—and giving the husband several engagements. Mrs
                    Sheridan’s novels and plays were all written in the last six years of her life.
                    She died at Blois in 1766. Her maiden name was Chamberlaine. Her father was a
                    dignitary in the Irish Church, her grandfather an English<pb break="no"

                    result of romantic circumstances, fully detailed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs of Mrs Frances Sheridan,</hi> mentioned below.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="smallcaps">Richard Brinsley Butler Sheridan</hi> (1751— 1816),
                    second son of Thomas and Frances Sheridan, was born in Dublin in September 1751.
                    Moore records for the encouragement of slow boys that the future dramatist was
                    "by common consent of parent and preceptor pronounced an impenetrable dunce.”
                    The plain fact is that the expression occurs in a smart letter about him and his
                    sister, written by his mother to a schoolmaster. Mrs Sheridan wrote that she had
                    been the only instructor of her children hitherto, and that they would exercise
                    the schoolmaster in the quality of patience, “for two such impenetrable dunces
                    she had never met with.” One of the children thus humorously described was
                    Richard Brinsley, and the age of the “impenetrable dunce” at the time was seven.
                    At the age of eleven he was sent to Harrow. There, to please orthodox
                    biographers, he gave no such sign of future eminence as is implied in taking a
                    high place in school. Dr Parr, who was one of his masters, “saw in him vestiges
                    of a superior intellect,” but, though he “did not fail to probe and tease him,”
                    by no harassing or tormenting process could he incite the indolent boy to
                    greater industry than was “just sufficient to save him from disgrace.” But these
                    facts about young Sheridan’s determined indolence in the study of Latin and
                    Greek should be taken in connexion with his father’s peculiar theories on the
                    subject of English education. The father’s theories possibly did not encourage
                    the son to learn Latin and Greek. Why, with his views on the unprofitableness of
                    those studies, he sent his younger son to Harrow, is not obvious; but it was
                    probably as much for social as for educational reasons. If so, the purpose was
                    answered, for Sheridan was extremely popular at school, winning somehow, Dr Parr
                    confesses, “the esteem and even admiration of all his schoolfellows,” and giving
                    a foretaste of his mysterious powers of getting things done for him by making
                    the younger boys steal apples for his own private store and good-humouredly
                    defying the masters to trace the theft home to him.</p>
                <p>Sheridan left Harrow at the age of seventeen, having impressed his schoolfellows
                    at least, who are sometimes better judges than their masters, with a vivid sense
                    of his powers. It was probably his father’s design to send him afterwards to
                    Oxford, but the family circumstances were too straitened to permit of it, and
                    the educationist, who had just then returned from France, and was about to
                    launch his appeal to the king on behalf of his new plan of education, took his
                    son home and himself directed and superintended his studies. What his plans were
                    for his brilliant son’s future we have no means of knowing, but the probability
                    is that, if the projected academy had become an accomplished fact, he would have
                    tried to make Richard Brinsley an upper master in some one of its numerous
                    departments. There are traces of method in the superficially harum-scarum
                    Irishman’s courses, and it looks as if he had intended both of his sons to help
                    him in the magnificent project from which his sanguine temperament expected such
                    great things,—the elder, who had been with him in France, in what would now be
                    called the modern side, and the classically educated younger in the ancient
                    side. Meantime, pending His Majesty’s resolution on the projector’s offer,
                    Brinsley, besides being trained by his father daily in elocution, and put
                    through a course of English reading in accordance with the system, received the
                    accomplishments of a young man of fashion, had fencing and riding lessons at
                    Angelo’s, and began to eat terms at the Middle Temple. His destination
                    apparently was the bar, if fortune should deny him the more glorious career of
                    lieutenant in the new academy through which young England was to be
                    regenerated.</p>
                <p>As to how young Sheridan, with a cooler head to regulate his hot Irish blood,
                    looked at his father’s grand schemes, we have no record. But it is of importance
                    to remember those schemes, and the exact stage they had now reached, in
                    connexion with the accepted view of Sheridan’s behaviour at this time, which
                    represents him as a mere idler, hanging on at home like an ordinary
                    ne’er-do-well, too indolent to work for any profession, simply enjoying himself
                    and trusting recklessly to chance for some means of livelihood. The fact would
                    seem to be that over and above whatever he did in the way of qualifying himself
                    for a regular career—which possibly was little enough —he began from this time
                    with fundamentally steady purpose to follow the bent of his genius. After
                    leaving Harrow he kept up a correspondence with a school friend who had gone to
                    Oxford. With this youth, whose name was Halhed, he had not competed for school
                    honours; but both had dreams of higher things; and now they concocted together
                    various literary plans, and between them actually executed and published
                    metrical translations of Aristøenetus —an obscure Greek or pseudo-Greek author
                    brought to light or invented at the Renaissance, a writer of imaginary amorous
                    epistles. The two literary partners translated his prose into verse which has
                    the qualities of lightness, neatness, and wit, and is in no respect unworthy of
                    being the apprentice-work of Sheridan.</p>
                <p>In conjunction with the same young friend he began a farce entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Jupiter.</hi> It was not completed, but the fragment is of
                    interest as containing the same device of a rehearsal which was afterwards
                    worked out with such brilliant effect in <hi rend="italic">The Critic.</hi> Some
                    of the dialogue is very much in Sheridan’s mature manner. It would seem indeed
                    that at this time, idle as he appeared, Sheridan was deliberately exercising his
                    powers and preparing himself for future triumphs. Moore’s theory is that his
                    seeming indolence was but a mask; and extracts given from papers written in the
                    seven years between his leaving Harrow and the appearance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Rivals—</hi> sketches of unfinished plays, poems, political letters, and
                    pamphlets—show that he was far from idle. He was never much of a reader; he
                    preferred, as he said, to sit and think—a process more favourable to originality
                    than always having a book in his hand; but we may well believe that he kept his
                    eyes open, and his father’s connexion with fashionable society gave him abundant

                <p>Presently, too, already a favourite in Bath society from his charming manners and
                    his skill as a writer of graceful and witty verses, the youth played a part in
                    the living comedy which at once made him a marked man. There was in Bath a
                    celebrated musical family—“a nest of nightingales,”—the daughters of the
                    composer Linley, the head of his profession in the fashionable town. The eldest
                    daughter, a girl of sixteen, the prima donna of her father’s concerts, was
                    exceedingly beautiful, and very much run after by suitors, young and old,
                    honourable and dishonourable. In the latter class was a Captain Mathews, a
                    married man; in the former, young Sheridan. Mathews had artfully won the girl’s
                    affections, and persecuted her with his importunities, threatening to destroy
                    himself if she refused him. To protect her from this scoundrel’s designs the

                    performing this chivalrous duty he returned and fought two duels with Mathews,
                    which made a considerable sensation at the time. The youthful pair had gone
                    through the ceremony of marriage in the course of their flight, but Sheridan
                    chivalrously did not claim his wife, kept the marriage secret, and was sternly
                    denied access to Miss Linley by her father, who did not consider the
                    professionless young man an eligible suitor. Ultimately, after a courtship
                    romantic enough to have satisfied Lydia Languish, they were openly married in
                    April 1773.</p>
                <p>Sheridan’s daring start in life after this happy marriage showed a confidence in
                    his genius which was justified by' its success. Although he had no income, and
                    no capital beyond a few thousand pounds brought by his wife, he took a house in
                    Orchard Street, Portman Square, furnished it “in the most costly style,” and
                    proceeded to return on something like an equal footing the hospitalities of the
                    fashionable world. His wife—“the celebrated Miss Linley ”—was a most popular
                    singer, but he would not allow her to appear in public. She was to be heard only
                    at private concerts in their own house, and her beauty and accomplishments
                    combined with her husband’s wit to draw crowds of fashionable people to their
                    entertainments. Sheridan’s conduct may have been youthful pride and
                    recklessness, the thoughtless magnificence of a strong and confident nature; all
                    the same, it answered the purpose of deep-laid and daring policy. When
                    remonstrated with by a friend, and asked how he found the means of supporting
                    such a costly establishment, he is said to have answered— “My dear friend, it is
                    my means.” And so it proved, for his social standing and popularity helped to
                    get a favourable start for his first comedy, <hi rend="italic">The Rivals,</hi>
                    produced at Covent Garden on the 17th January 1775.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Rivals</hi> is said to have been not so favourably received
                    on its first night, owing to its length and to the bad playing of the part of
                    Sir Lucius O’Trigger. But the defects were remedied before the second
                    performance, and the piece at once took that place on the stage which it has
                    never lost. It was the last season but one of Garrick’s long career, and the
                    current story preserved by Moore is that the run upon Covent Garden was such as
                    to alarm the veteran of Drury Lane and drive him to extraordinary exertions to
                    counterbalance the attractions of the new play. This seems to be a myth, natural
                    enough in the circumstances, but unfounded in fact, for we have contemporary
                    testimony<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Blackwood’s Magazine,</hi> vol. xx. p. 26.</p></note> that Drury
                    Lane was never more crowded than during the last years of Garrick’s management,
                    when it was known that he intended to retire from the stage. There were crowded
                    houses at both theatres. Sheridan, though bearing his brilliant success lightly,
                    proceeded at once to take the tide at the flood. <hi rend="italic">St Patrick's
                    Day, or the Scheming Lieutenant,</hi> a lively farce, written it is said at the
                    request of Clinch, in gratitude for his coming to the rescue of Sir Lucius, was
                    produced in May. In the course of the year, with the assistance of his musical
                    father-in-law, he wrote the comic opera of <hi rend="italic">The Duenna</hi>;
                    and by the end of the year, with an eye to the profits of theatrical management,
                    he was in negotiation with Garrick for the purchase of his share of Drury Lane.
                    <hi rend="italic">The Duenna</hi> was the great theatrical success of the winter
                    of 1775-76; it ran even longer than <hi rend="italic">The Beggar's Opera</hi>
                    had done—up to that time the longest run on record. The bargain with Garrick was
                    completed in June 1776. The sum paid for the half-share was £35,000; of this
                    Sheridan contributed £10,000.</p>
                <p>None of his letters show where the money came from, and much wonder has been
                    expressed on the subject; but after all it is not so very mysterious that the
                    most brilliant dramatist of his time, in all the credit of unparalleled success,
                    should have been able to borrow such a sum as this with the best theatrical
                    property to offer as security. There is a tradition that Garrick advanced the
                    money or let it lie at interest; anyhow, the loan could not have appeared at the
                    time a very risky speculation. Two years afterwards Sheridan and his friends
                    bought the other half of the property for £45,000.</p>
                <p>From the first the direction of the theatre would seem to have been mainly in
                    Sheridan’s hands. It was opened under the new management in February 1777, with
                    a purified version of Vanbrugh’s <hi rend="italic">Relapse,</hi> under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Λ Trip to Scarborough.</hi> This is printed among
                    Sheridan’s works, but he has no more title to the authorship than Colley Cibber
                    to that of <hi rend="italic">Richard III.</hi> His chief task was to remove
                    indecencies; he added very little to the dialogue. Astonishment has been
                    expressed that he should have fallen back on an old play instead of writing a
                    new one. The fact is quoted among the proofs of his indolence. But the new
                    manager, apart from the engagements of a popular man of fashion, probably found
                    work and worry in his novel task of organization sufficient to leave him little
                    leisure for composition. Vanbrugh’s play was probably chosen for the simple
                    reason that it suited his company. Possibly also he wished to make trial of
                    their powers before entrusting them with a play of his own. <hi rend="italic"
                    >The School for Scandal</hi> was produced little more than two months
                    afterwards. Mrs Abington, who had played Miss Hoyden in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trip,</hi> played Lady Teazle, who may be regarded as a Miss Hoyden developed
                    by six months’ experience of marriage and town life. The actors who played the
                    brothers Surface had been tried in the <hi rend="italic">Trip</hi> in opposite
                    characters, Charles playing Townley, while Joseph played Tom Fashion. It looks
                    as if shrewd managerial caution was responsible for the delay quite as much as
                    indolence. The former may at least have been in Sheridan’s mind the plausible
                    excuse for the latter. There are tales of the haste with which the conclusion of
                    <hi rend="italic">The School for Scandal</hi> was written, of a stratagem by
                    which the last act was got out of him by the anxious company, and of the fervent
                    “Amen” written on the last page of the copy by the prompter, in response to the
                    author’s “Finished at last, thank God !” But, although the conception was thus
                    hurriedly completed, we know from Sheridan’s sister that the idea of a
                    “scandalous college” had occurred to him five years before in connexion with his
                    own experiences at Bath. His difficulty was to find a story sufficiently
                    dramatic in its incidents to form a subject for the machinations of the
                    character-slayers. He seems to have tried more than one plot, and in the end to
                    have desperately forced two separate conceptions together. The dialogue is so
                    brilliant throughout, and the auction scene and the screen scene so effective,
                    that nobody cares to examine the construction of the comedy except as a matter
                    of critical duty. But a study of the construction brings to light the
                    difficulties that must have worried the author in writing the play, and explains
                    why he was so thankful to have it finished and done with at last. After all, he
                    worried himself in vain, for <hi rend="italic">The School for Scandal,</hi>
                    though it has not the unity of <hi rend="italic">The Rivals,</hi> nor the same
                    wealth of broadly humorous incident, is universally regarded as Sheridan’s
                    masterpiece. He might have settled the doubts and worries of authorship with
                    Puff’s reflexion “What is the use of a good plot except to bring in good things
                    ?” The vitality of a play depends mainly on its good things in the way of
                    character, incident, and happy saying, and to a very limited extent on their
                    relevance to any central plan.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0824-0799"/> The third and last of Sheridan’s great comedies,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Critic,</hi> was produced in 1779, <hi rend="italic">The
                    School for Scandal</hi> meantime continuing to draw larger houses than any other
                    play every time it was put on the stage. <hi rend="italic">The Critic</hi> is
                    perhaps the highest proof of Sheridan’s skill as a dramatist, for in it he has
                    worked out, with perfect success for all time, a theme which, often as it has
                    been attempted, no other dramatist has ever succeeded in redeeming from tedious
                    circumstantiality and ephemeral personalities. The laughable infirmities of all
                    classes connected with the stage, —authors, actors, patrons, and audience,—are
                    touched off with the lightest of hands; the fun is directed, not at individuals,
                    but at absurdities that grow out of the circumstances of the stage as naturally
                    and inevitably as weeds in a garden. It seems that he had accumulated notes, as
                    his habit was, for another comedy to be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Affectation.</hi> Rut apparently he failed to hit upon any story that would
                    enable him to present his various types of affectation in dramatic interaction.
                    The similar difficulty in his satire against scandal, of finding sufficiently
                    interesting materials for the scandal-mongers, he had surmounted with a violent
                    effort. This other difficulty he might have surmounted too, if he had had
                    leisure to “sit and think” till the happy thought came. But his energies were
                    now called off in a different direction. His only dramatic composition during
                    the remaining thirty-six years of his life was <hi rend="italic">Pizarro,</hi>
                    produced in 1799—a tragedy in which he made liberal use of some of the arts
                    ridiculed in the person of Mr Puff. He is said also to have written more of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Stranger</hi> than he was willing to acknowledge.</p>
                <p>He entered parliament for Stafford in 1780. It was not a sudden ambition to shine
                    on a wider stage after having gained the highest honours of the theatre. Ever
                    since leaving Harrow he had dabbled a little in politics, had sketched letters
                    in the manner of Junius, and begun an answer to Johnson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taxation no Tyranny.</hi> But he had not made any public appearance as a
                    politician until his acquaintance with Fox led to his appearing on a Westminster
                    platform with the great leader of opposition. Apparently he owed his election
                    for Stafford to more substantial persuasives than the charms of his eloquence.
                    He paid the burgesses five guineas each for the honour of representing them. It
                    was the custom of the time. His first speech in parliament, like the first
                    speech of a great parliamentarian of this century, between whose career and
                    Sheridan’s there are many striking points of resemblance and contrast, was a
                    failure. But he persevered, spoke little for a time and chiefly on financial
                    questions, soon took a place among the best speakers in the House, and under the
                    wing of Fox filled subordinate offices in the short-lived ministries of 1782 and
                    1783. He was undersecretary for foreign affairs in the Rockingham ministry, and
                    a secretary of the treasury in the Coalition ministry. This was rapid promotion
                    for a man who owed everything to his own talents, and yet not an excessive
                    recognition of the services of such a speaker as he is described as having
                    proved himself at this exciting period. In debate he had the keenest of eyes for
                    the weak places in an opponent’s argument, and the happy art of putting them in
                    an irresistibly ludicrous light without losing his good temper or his presence
                    of mind. In those heated days of parliamentary strife he was almost the only man
                    of mark that was never called out, and yet he had not his match in the weapon of
                    ridicule.</p>
                <p>The occasion that gave Sheridan a chance of rising above the reputation of an
                    extremely effective and brilliant debater into the ranks of great parliamentary
                    orators was the impeachment of Warren Hastings. His speeches in that proceeding
                    were by the unanimous acknowledgment of his contemporaries among the greatest
                    delivered in that generation of great orators. The first was in 1787, on Burke’s
                    proposal that Hastings should be impeached. Sheridan spoke for three hours, and
                    the effect of his oratory was such that it was unanimously agreed to adjourn and
                    postpone the final decision till the House should be in a calmer mood. Of this,
                    and of his last great speech on the subject in 1794, only brief abstracts have
                    been preserved; but with the second, the four days’ speech in Westminster Hall,
                    on the occasion so brilliantly described by Macaulay, posterity has been more
                    fortunate. The reader should, however, be cautioned against accepting the
                    version given in a collection of Sheridan’s speeches published by a friend after
                    his death. This long passed current as a genuine specimen of Sheridan’s
                    eloquence at its best, in spite of Moore’s protest that he had in his possession
                    a copy of a shorthand writer’s report, and that the two did not correspond. But
                    Gurney’s verbatim reports of the speeches on both sides at the trial were
                    published at Sir G. Cornewall Lewis’s instigation in 1859, and from them we are
                    able to form an idea of Sheridan’s power as an orator. There are passages here
                    and there of gaudily figurative rhetoric, loose ornament, and declamatory
                    hyperbole such as form the bulk of the incorrect version; but the strong common
                    sense, close argumentative force, and masterly presentation of telling facts
                    enable us to understand the impression produced by the speech at the time.<note

                <p>Sheridan’s long parliamentary career terminated in 1812. He could not help being
                    to the last a conspicuous figure both in society and in parliament, but from the
                    time of the break-up of the Whig party on the secession of Burke he was more or
                    less an “independent member,” and his isolation was complete after the death of
                    Fox. The Begum speech remained his highest oratorical achievement. By it he is
                    fixed in the tradition of the House as one of its greatest names. But his
                    opinions on other great questions were given with a force and eloquence worthy
                    of his position. When Burke denounced the French Revolution, Sheridan joined
                    with Fox in vindicating the principle of non-intervention. He maintained that
                    the French people should be allowed to settle their constitution and manage
                    their affairs in their own way. But when the republic was succeeded by the
                    empire, and it became apparent that France under Napoleon would interfere with
                    the affairs of its neighbours, he employed his eloquence in denouncing Napoleon
                    and urging the prosecution of the war. One of his most celebrated speeches was
                    delivered in support of strong measures against the mutineers at the Nore. When
                    the Whigs came into power in 1806 Sheridan was appointed treasurer of the navy,
                    but was denied the honour of admission to the cabinet. After Fox’s death he
                    succeeded his chief in the representation of Westminster, and aspired to succeed
                    him as leader of the party, but this claim was not allowed, and thenceforward
                    Sheridan fought for his own hand. When the prince became regent in 1811
                    Sheridan’s private influence with him helped to exclude the Whigs from power.
                    For his interference on this occasion between the regent and his constitutional
                    advisers Sheridan was severely blamed. To judge fairly as to how far he was
                    justified in his conduct as a matter of private ethics we must take into account
                    his previous relations with the leaders of his party, a point on which Moore,
                    one of the disappointed placemen, is somewhat reticent. Throughout his
                    parliamentary career Sheridan was one of the boon companions of the prince, and
                    his champion in parliament in some dubious matters of payment of debts. But he
                    always resented any imputation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n825/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0825-0800"/> that he was the prince s confidential adviser or
                    mouthpiece. A certain proud and sensitive independence was one of the most
                    marked features in Sheridan’s parliamentary career. After a coolness arose
                    between him and his Whig allies he refused a place for his son from the
                    Government, lest there should be any suspicion in the public mind that his
                    support had been bought.</p>
                <p>His last years were harassed by debt and disappointment. At the general election
                    of 1812 he stood for Westminster and was defeated, and turned in vain to his old
                    constituency of Stafford. He could not raise money enough to win back their
                    confidence. As a member of parliament he had been safe against arrest for debt,
                    but now that this protection was lost his creditors closed in upon him, and from
                    this time till his death in 1816 the life of Sheridan, broken in health and
                    fortune, discredited in reputation, slighted by old associates, so enfeebled and
                    low-spirited as to burst into tears at a compliment, yet at times vindicating
                    his reputation as the wittiest of boon companions, is one of the most painful
                    passages in the biography of great men. Doubtless, in any attempt to judge of
                    Sheridan as he was apart from his works, we must make considerable deductions
                    from the mass of floating anecdotes that have gathered round his name. It was
                    not without reason that his granddaughter Mrs Norton denounced the unfairness of
                    judging of the real man from unauthenticated stories about his indolent
                    procrastination, his recklessness in money matters, his drunken feats and
                    sallies, his wild gambling, his ingenious but discreditable shifts in evading
                    and duping creditors. The real Sheridan was not a pattern of decorous
                    respectability, but we may fairly believe that he was very far from being as
                    disreputable as the Sheridan of vulgar legend. Against the stories about his
                    reckless management of his affairs we must set the broad facts that he had no
                    source of income but Drury Lane theatre, that he bore from it for thirty years
                    all the expenses of a fashionable life, and that the theatre was twice burnt to
                    the ground during his proprietorship. Enough was lost in those fires to account
                    ten times over for all his debts. His biographers always speak of his means of
                    living as a mystery. Seeing that he started with borrowed capital, it is
                    possible that the mystery is that he applied much more of his powers to plain
                    matters of business than he affected or got credit for. The records of his wild
                    bets in the betting book of Brook’s Club date in the years after the loss of his
                    first wife, to whom he was devotedly attached. The reminiscences of his son’s
                    tutor, Mr Smyth, show anxious and fidgetty family habits, curiously at variance
                    with the accepted tradition of his imperturbable recklessness. Many of the
                    tricks which are made to appear as the unscrupulous devices of a hunted and
                    reckless debtor get a softer light upon them if we ascribe them to a whimsical,
                    boyish, ungovernable love of fun, which is a well-attested feature of his
                    character. But the real Sheridan, as he was in private life, is irrecoverably
                    gone. Even Moore, writing so soon after his death, had to lament that he could
                    “find out nothing about him.” Moore seems to have made an imperfect use of the
                    family papers, and it is on record that Lord Melbourne, who had undertaken to
                    write Sheridan’s life, always regretted having handed over his materials to the
                    professional biographer. He died on the 7th of July 1816, and was buried with
                    great pomp in Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>There is, unfortunately, no complete authoritative biography of Sheridan. Mrs
                    Norton, his granddaughter, questioned the accuracy of Moore’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life</hi> in many particulars, and announced her intention of writing a history
                    of the Sheridans from the family papers, of which Moore had made very partial
                    use. But she never carried out the project The current statements about the
                    father and grandfather of the dramatist are inaccurate and misleading in several
                    important respects. The best account of them—making allowance for a slight bias
                    of family pride—is to bo found in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Mrs Frances
                    Sheridan,</hi> by her granddaughter, the dramatist’s niece, Miss Lefanu. There
                    is an excellent sketch of Sheridan’s political career in Mr W. Fraser Rae’s <hi
