                <p><label type="entry">SETTLEMENT</label>, in law, is a mutual arrangement between
                    living persons for regulating the present or future enjoyment of property. It
                    also denotes the instrument by which such enjoyment is regulated. The prevailing
                    notion of a settlement is the dealing with property in a manner different from
                    that in which the law would have dealt with it apart from the settlement.
                    Definitions of settlement for the purposes of the Acts are contained in the Acts
                    of 1856, 1877, and 1882 (see below). They are, however, scarcely sufficient for
                    a general definition. On the one hand they are too extensive, and include wills;
                    on the other they are not comprehensive enough, as they apply only to real
                    estate. They also include only cases of successive limitations, but the idea of
                    succession does not in itself seem a necessary part of the conception of
                    settlement, although no doubt most settlements contemplate successive enjoyment.
                    Settlements may be either for valuable consideration or not: the latter are
                    usually called voluntary, and are in law to some extent in the same position as
                    revocable gifts; the former are really contracts, and in general their validity
                    depends upon the law of contract. They may accordingly contain any provisions
                    not contrary to law or public policy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    nominated) may have suggested the modern mode of giving enjoyment of property in
                    succession. Such a <hi rend="italic">substitutio</hi> could, however, only have
                    been made by will, while the settlement of English law is, in the general
                    acceptation of the term, exclusively an instrument <hi rend="italic">inter
                    vivos.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">dos</hi> or <hi rend="italic">donatio propter
                    nuptias</hi> corresponds to a considerable extent with the marriage settlement,
                    the instrument itself being represented by the <hi rend="italic">dotale
                    instrumentum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pacta dotalia.</hi> In the earliest
                    period of Roman law no provision for the wife was required, for she passed under
                    <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> of her husband, and became in law his daughter,
                    entitled as such to a share of his property at his death. In course of time the
                    plebeian form of marriage by <hi rend="italic">usus,</hi> according to which the
                    wife did not become subject to <hi rend="italic">manus,</hi> gradually
                    superseded the older form, and it became necessary to make a provision for the
                    wife by contract. Such provision from the wife’s side was made by the <hi
                    rend="italic">dos,</hi> the property contributed by the wife or some one on her
                    behalf towards the expenses of the new household. <hi rend="italic">Dos</hi>
                    might be given before or after marriage, or might be increased after marriage.
                    It was a duty enforced by legislation to provide <hi rend="italic">dos</hi>
                    where the father possessed a sufficient fortune. <hi rend="italic">Dos</hi> was
                    of three kinds :— <hi rend="italic">profectitia,</hi> contributed by the father
                    or other ascendant on the male side; <hi rend="italic">adventitia,</hi> by the
                    wife herself or any person other than those who contributed <hi rend="italic"
                    >dos profectitia; receptitia,</hi> by any person who contributed <hi
                    rend="italic">dos adventitia,</hi> subject to the stipulation that the property
                    was to be returned to the person advancing it on dissolution of the marriage.
                    The position of the husband gradually changed for the worse. From being owner,
                    subject to an obligation to return the <hi rend="italic">dos</hi> if the wife
                    predeceased him, he became a trustee of the <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi> of the
                    property for the wife’s family, retaining only the enjoyment of the income as
                    long as the marriage continued. The contribution by the husband was called <hi
                    rend="italic">donatio propter nuptias.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Hunter, <hi rend="italic">Roman Law,</hi> p. 150; Maine,
                    <hi rend="italic">Early History of Institutions,</hi> lect. xi.</p></note> The
                    most striking point of difference between the Roman and the English law is that
                    under the former the children took no interest in the contributions made by the
                    parents. Other modes of settling property in Roman law were the life interest or
                    <hi rend="italic">usus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">fideicommissum,</hi> and the
                    prohibition of alienation of a <hi rend="italic">legatum.</hi></p>
                <p>The oldest form of settlement in England was perhaps the gift in frankmarriage to
                    the donees in frankmarriage, and the heirs between them two begotten (Littleton,
                    § 17). This was simply a form of gift in special tail, which became up to the
                    reign of Queen Elizabeth the most usual kind of settlement. The time at which
                    the modern form of settlement of real estate came into use seems to be doubtful.
                    There does not appear to be any trace of a limitation of an estate to an unborn
                    child prior to 1556. In an instrument of that year such a limitation was
                    effected by means of a feoffment to uses. The plan of granting the freehold to
                    trustees to preserve contingent remainders<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The appointment of such trustees has been rendered
                    unnecessary by 8 and 9 Vict. c. 106 and 40 and 41 Vict. c. 33.</p></note> is
                    said to have been invented by Lord Keeper Bridgman in the 17th century, the
                    object being to preserve the estate from forfeiture for treason during the
                    Commonwealth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    sketch of the history of settlement is abridged from a paper by the late Mr
                    Joshua Williams, <hi rend="italic">Papers of the Juridical Society,</hi> vol. i.
                    p. 45.</p><p>At the present time the settlement in England is, so far as regards
                    real estate, used for two inconsistent purposes, —to “make an eldest son,” as it
                    is called, and to avoid the results of the right of succession to real property
                    of the eldest son by making provision for the younger children. The first result
                    is generally obtained by a strict settlement, the latter by a marriage
                    settlement, which is for valuable consideration if ante-nuptial, voluntary if
                    post-nuptial. At the same time it should be remembered that these two kinds of
                    settlement are not mutually exclusive: a marriage settlement may often take the
                    form of a strict settlement and be in substance a resettlement of the family
                    estate.</p><p>There are three possible varieties of the marriage settlement :—
                    (1) the dotal system <hi rend="italic">(régime dotal),</hi> under which the
                    husband generally has the usufruct but not the property in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dos</hi>; this is the system generally followed in countries where the Roman
                    law prevails; (2) the system of community of goods <hi rend="italic">(communauté
                    de biens),</hi> by which the wife becomes a kind of partner of the husband; this
                    system, said to have been originally the custom of ancient Germany, is in vogue
                    in France and Louisiana; (3) the system of separate property, by which (subject
                    to contract) the wife’s property is free from the control of her husband; this
                    system prevails in the United Kingdom and the United States. An ordinary English
                    marriage settlement of personalty is a deed to which the parties are the
                    intended husband and wife and trustees nominated on their behalf. It generally
                    contains the following clauses :—a power to vary the investments of the settled
                    property within limits; trusts of the income for the benefit of the husband and
                    wife during their lives; trusts for the issue, usually according to the
                    appointment of the husband and wife or the survivor, and in default for sons
                    attaining twenty-one and for daughters attaining that ago or marrying, equally,
                    subject to a “hotchpot” clause, charging the children with the amount of any
                    previous appointments; a power of advancement of the portions of children in
                    anticipation; a trust for the maintenance of infant children after the death of
                    the parents, with a direction for the accumulation of surplus income; ultimate
                    trusts fixing the destination of the settled property in default of issue. The
                    receipt and trustee clauses, at one time usual, have been rendered unnecessary
                    by recent legislation. The Conveyancing Act, 1881, superseding Lord St Leonard’s
                    Act of 1859 and Lord Cranworth's Act of 1860, gives power to appoint new
                    trustees, and makes a trustee’s receipt a sufficient discharge. Trustees were
                    formerly much restricted in their investments, but various Acts of Parliament
                    have now increased their powers of choice of investment (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Trust).</hi> The settlement of real estate is still a matter of
                    greater difficulty than that of personalty, though it has been considerably
                    simplified by recent legislation. A short statutory form of settlement of real
                    estate is provided by the Conveyancing Act, 1881 (Fourth Schedule, Form iv.).
                    The Act further enacts that a covenant by the settlor for further assurance is
                    to be implied. This takes the place of those covenants usually inserted in
                    settlements before the Act, which were the ordinary covenants for title. (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Real Estate. )</hi> The Settled Land Act, 1882, gives
                    statutory authority to certain provisions generally inserted by conveyancers.
                    The clauses must, however, still vary infinitely according to the circumstances
                    of particular cases. Where the settlement is of copyholds, the usual course is
                    to surrender them to the use of trustees as joint tenants in fee upon such
                    trusts as will effect the desired devolution of the property.</p><p>A strict
                    settlement of real estate usually takes place on the coming of age or marriage
                    of the eldest son, if it be the intention of the parties that the estate should
                    continue undivided. The consideration for the settlement in the first case is
                    usually an immediate allowance made to the son, in the second the marriage
                    itself, a valuable consideration. It will appear on referring to the articles
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Entail</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Real Estate</hi> that
                    an estate cannot be entailed for a period exceeding a fixed number of existing
                    lives and an additional term of twenty-one years, but that if it be sought to
                    bar the entail within that period the consent of the protector of the settlement
                    must be obtained. The process of resettlement is thus described by Lord St
                    Leonards: “Where there are younger children, the father is always anxious to
                    have the estate resettled on them and their issue, in case of failure of issue
                    of the first son. This he cannot accomplish without the concurrence of the son;
                    and, as the son, upon his establishment in life in his father’s lifetime,
                    requires an immediate provision, the father generally secures to him a provision
                    during their joint lives as a consideration for the resettlement of the estate
                    in remainder upon the younger sons.” The settlement usually takes the form of a
                    life estate for the father, followed by a life estate for the son, with
                    remainder in tail to the unborn child of the son, the continuance of the estate
                    in the family being further secured by a series of cross-remainders. There is
                    often a name and arms clause, under which, by means of a</p></note> The
                    settlement of chattels is no doubt of considerably later origin, and the
                    principles were adopted by courts of equity from the corresponding law as to
                    real estate.<pb break="no"

                    >Trust),</hi> every person succeeding to the settled estate as tenant in tail is
                    forced to assume the name and arms of the settlor under penalty of forfeiture of
                    his estate. Certain parts of the personalty of the settlor are often settled
                    upon trusts to devolve with the real estate. In order to attain this end, the
                    chattels are not simply subjected to the same limitations as the real estate. If
                    so subjected, they would vest absolutely in the first tenant in succession, as
                    no estate can be limited in personalty (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Personal
                    Estate).</hi> A declaration is added that they shall not vest absolutely in any
                    tenant until he shall attain twenty-one, and in case he should die under that
                    age that they shall devolve as nearly as possible in the same way as the lands.
                    By means of strict settlement the actual possessor of a settled estate at any
                    given time is in general only a tenant for life. It is a rule of law that in a
                    settlement of this nature there should be a full and complete communication of
                    all material circumstances by the one party to the other.</p>
                <p>It is only within a comparatively recent period that any dissatisfaction at the
                    system of settlement has been felt. In 1829 the Real Property Commissioners saw
                    no reason to recommend any alteration of the law as it then existed. To use the
                    words of the First Report, p. 6, “Settlements bestow upon the present possessor
                    of an estate the benefits of ownership, and secure the property to his
                    posterity. The existing rule respecting perpetuities has happily hit the medium
                    between the strict entails which prevail in the northern part of the island, and
                    by which the property entailed is for ever abstracted from commerce,<note

                    shortly afterwards altered by the Rutherford Act of 1848 (see <hi

                    affirming that these are not substitutions at all. In other countries the right
                    of settlement or substitution has been much modified by legislation, mostly in
                    the direction of limiting the authority of the settlor. Thus in Austria no
                    family settlement <hi rend="italic">(Familien-Fideicommiss)</hi> can be created
                    without the consent of the legislature, <hi rend="italic">Civil Code,</hi> §

                    Europe. In England families are preserved, and purchasers always find a supply
                    of land in the market.” This optimistic view, it is scarcely necessary to say,
                    is not the one generally accepted at present. The inconveniences inseparable in
                    an economical point of view from the settlement of land have been proposed to be
                    met in two ways,—(1) by a total prohibition of the creation of life estates (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Land),</hi> and (2) by an extension of the powers of the
                    limited owner. The latter is the one which has hitherto commended itself to the
                    legislature of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>Up to thirty years ago a settled estate in England or Ireland could be sold or
                    leased only under the authority of a private Act of Parliament. The dealings of
                    the limited owner with his property were practically confined to certain powers
                    of raising money for draining conferred by 8 and 9 Vict. c. 56 and the Public
                    and Private Drainage Acts (now repealed). The first general Act was the Leases
                    and Sale of Settled Estates Act, 1856, which proceeded on the principles
                    generally followed in the private Acts. The Act allowed the tenant for life to
                    demise the premises (except the principal mansion house) for various terms, and
                    to sell with the approval of the court. Several amending Acts were passed, and
                    finally the law was consolidated and amended by the Settled Estates Act, 1877
                    (40 and 41 Vict. c. 18). Meanwhile the Improvement of Land Act, 1864 (which
                    applies to the United Kingdom), and the Limited Owners’ Residence Acts, 1870 and
                    1871, had been passed. The Act of 1864 allowed the owner of a settled estate to
                    charge upon the land, by way of rent-charge, the expenses of certain
                    improvements, such as drainage, irrigation, inclosing, reclamation, clearing,
                    erection of labourers’ cottages and farmhouse buildings, planting for shelter,
                    construction of any buildings which will increase the value of the land for
                    agricultural purposes, and construction of jetties or landing-places on the
                    sea-coast or navigable rivers and lakes. This list of improvements has been
                    since extended by the Settled Land Act, 1882. The Act of 1870 enabled the owners
                    of settled estates to charge such estates with the expense of building mansions
                    as residences. The building of such mansions is by the Act of 1871 an
                    improvement within the meaning of the Act of 1864. The Settled Estates Act, 1877
                    (40 and 41 Vict. c. 18), allowed the tenant for life, or for a greater estate,
                    of a settled estate, to demise settled land on an agricultural lease for a term
                    not exceeding twenty-one years (in Ireland thirty-five years). The lease must
                    not be without impeachment of waste. This is the only case in which the powers
                    of the Act may be exercised without the leave of the court. The court may
                    authorize leases of any settled estates or of any rights or privileges over or
                    affecting any settled estates, subject to the conditions that—(1) the lease be
                    made to take effect in possession at or within one year next after the making,
                    and be for a term for an agricultural lease as above, for a mining lease not
                    exceeding forty years, a repairing lease sixty years, a building lease
                    ninety-nine years, with power for the court to grant for a longer term if in
                    accordance with the custom of the district and beneficial to the inheritance;
                    (2) the best rent must be reserved; (3) in a mineral lease three-fourths of the
                    rent is to be invested (one-fourth where the limited owner is entitled to work
                    the minerals for his own benefit); (4) the lease is not to authorize felling of
                    trees except for the purpose of clearing for building; (5) the lease is to be by
                    deed, and is to contain a condition for reentry on non-payment of rent for
                    twenty-eight days. The court may also authorize sales of settled estates and of
                    timber, and dedication for streets, roads, squares, gardens, sewers, and other
                    works. The application to the court (which in England is the Chancery Division
                    or the Chancery of Lancashire, in Ireland the Chancery Division) is by petition
                    in a summary way with the consent of the persons having any beneficial estate
                    under the settlement, and all trustees having any estate on behalf of any unborn
                    child. The court may dispense with consent under certain circumstances. No
                    application is to be granted by the court where a similar application has been
                    refused by parliament. Money received on sale under the Act is to be invested as
                    the Act directs, for the benefit of the settled estate. In 1882 the powers of
                    the limited owner were still further increased. In that year was passed the
                    Settled Land Act, 1882 (45 and 46 Vict. c. 38), since amended by 47 and 48 Vict.
                    c. 19. For this very valuable Act the statute book is indebted to the late Earl
                    Cairns. It does not repeal the Act of 1877, but gives cumulative powers. The Act
                    of 1877 must still be brought into action in certain cases to which the Act of
                    1882 does not apply. The broad distinction between the two Acts is that the
                    powers given by the Act of 1877 are based entirely, except in agricultural
                    leases, on judicial proceedings, while those given by the Act of 1882 may be
                    exercised by the tenant for life at his option, generally without the consent of
                    trustees or the court. The powers are those usually inserted in settlements of
                    real estate, and are conferred upon every tenant for life beneficially entitled
                    to possession. This includes a tenant in tail by Act of Parliament restrained
                    from defeating an estate tail, but not a tenant in tail where the land in
                    respect of which he is restrained was purchased with money provided by
                    parliament,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>That is to
                    say, the Act would apply to the estates tail of the marquis of Abergavenny or
                    the earl of Shrewsbury, but not to Blenheim or Strathfieldsaye, purchased with
                    public money for the dukes of Marlborough and Wellington (see <hi

                    in tail after possibility of issue extinct, a tenant by the curtesy, &amp;c. A
                    married woman may exercise the powers given by the Act in spite of any restraint
                    on anticipation contained in the settlement. The Act does not apply to
                    corporations, whether sole or aggregate. The chief powers given by the Act are
                    those of selling and leasing. A tenant for life may sell settled land or any
                    part of it, or any easement, right, or privilege over it, or the seignory of a
                    manor, and may make exchange or partition. A sale must be for the best price,
                    and an exchange or partition for the best consideration; the sale may be in one
                    lot or several, and by auction or private contract. A reservation as to user or
                    as to mines and minerals may be imposed. Settled land in England may not be
                    exchanged for land out of England. A lease is not to exceed for building
                    ninety-nine years, mining sixty, any other kind twenty-one. The regulations as
                    to leases are in general correspondence with those of the Act of 1877. The time
                    for which non-payment of rent gives a right of re-entry is thirty instead of
                    twenty-eight days, and there are additional regulations as to building and
                    mining leases. Where the tenant for life is impeachable for waste in respect of
                    mines, three-fourths of the mining rent is to be set aside as capital money, in
                    other cases one-fourth. The tenant for life may surrender and regrant leases.
                    The principal mansion house and the demesnes thereof, and other lands usually
                    occupied therewith, cannot be sold or leased without the consent of the trustees
                    of the settlement or the order of the court. The Act provides for three kinds of
                    sale :—(1) by the tenant for life <hi rend="italic">mero motu,</hi> the ordinary
                    case; (2) with consent of trustees or the court, as in the case of the principal
                    mansion and of the application of money paid for a lease or reversion; (3) by
                    order of the court, as in the case of the variation of a building or mining
                    lease according to the circumstances of the district, of parliamentary
                    opposition for the protection or recovery of settled land, and of the sale or
                    purchase of chattels as heirlooms to devolve with land.<note anchored="true"

                    held to include an hereditary dignity, such as a baronetcy.</p></note> Land

                    on the same trusts as the other settled property. Capital money is to be applied
                    as the Act directs, generally for the benefit of the settled property. The
                    tenant for life may enter into a contract for carrying into effect the purposes
                    of the Act. A contract not to exercise the powers of the Act is void. As to
                    procedure, an application to the Chancery Division is to be made by petition or

                    for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Acts of 1877 and
                    1882. For more minute information than can be given in this place the Acts and
                    rules themselves must be consulted.</p>
                <p>The necessity for a settlement, as far as the wife’s interests are concerned, has
                    been diminished by the Married Women’s Property Act, 1882 (45 and 46 Vict. c.
                    75). It is still, however, usual to have a settlement on marriage, especially
                    where there is property of any considerable value. The Act contains a saving of
                    existing settlements and a power to make future settlements with or without
                    restriction against anticipation (not to be valid against a married woman’s
                    ante-nuptial debts). No settlement or agreement for a settlement is to have
                    greater validity against a married woman’s creditors than such settlement or
                    agreement would have when made or entered into by a man. A future or
                    reversionary interest in settled personalty is specially excepted from the
                    operation of Malins's Act (20 and 21 Vict. c. 5), under which a married woman
                    may by deed acknowledged dispose of her future or reversionary interest in
                    unsettled personalty. The former law as to <hi rend="italic">equity to a
                    settlement</hi> seems to have been rendered obsolete by the Married Women’s
                    Property Act. The doctrine of equity formerly was in accordance with the maxim,
                    "He who seeks equity must do equity,”— that, where a husband was forced to
                    obtain the assistance of a court of equity to reach property to which he was
                    entitled in right of his wife, equity would only aid him on condition of his
                    settling a certain portion on his wife. Now that a husband cannot succeed to any
                    property in right of his wife during her lifetime, the reason for the doctrine
                    of equity to a settlement has disappeared.</p>
                <p>As a rule a settlement can only be made by a person not under
                    disability,—therefore apart from statute not by a lunatic, or a bankrupt, and
                    generally not by an infant. But by the Infants’ Settlement Act (18 and 19 Vict
                    c. 43) infant males of twenty or over or infant females of seventeen or over may
                    with the approbation of the Chancery Division obtained by petition make a valid
                    settlement or contract for a settlement of all or any part of their property. By
                    the Acts of 1877 and 1882 the powers of the Acts may in certain cases be
                    exercised by trustees of a settlement, trustees in bankruptcy, committees of
                    lunatics, and guardians of infants.</p>
                <p>Where the parties are not in a position to make an immediate settlement, articles
                    for a settlement are sometimes entered into, but more rarely than formerly on
                    account of the facilities offered by the Infants’ Settlement Act. The court will
                    enforce the execution of a settlement in accordance with the articles, and will
                    reform one already made if not in accordance with them. The court will also
                    enforce the specific performance of any contract on the faith of which a
                    marriage has taken place, in spite of the provisions of § 4 of the Statute of
                    Frauds (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fraud).</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At one time the ecclesiastical courts went

                    should be noticed that marriage itself is not such a part performance of a
                    contract as to give the court jurisdiction. An imperfect obligation arising from
                    an informal ante-nuptial agreement can be made binding as between the parties by
                    a post-nuptial settlement; but this will not protect such a settlement from
                    being treated as a voluntary settlement against creditors.</p>
                <p>A settlement or contract for settlement made in consideration of marriage or for
                    other valuable consideration is as a rule irrevocable by the settlor and good
                    against creditors. The only exception or apparent exception is the provision in
                    the Bankruptcy Act, 1883 (46 and 47 Vict. c. 52, § 47 (2)), that any covenant or
                    contract made in consideration of marriage for the future settlement on or for
                    the settlor’s wife or children of any money or property wherein he had not at
                    the date of his marriage any estate or interest, and not being money or property
                    of or in right of his wife, shall, on his becoming bankrupt before the property
                    or money shall have been actually transferred or paid, be void against the
                    trustee in bankruptcy. With regard to voluntary settlements, 13 Eliz. c. 5
                    avoids as against creditors conveyances of lands or chattels contrived to delay,
                    hinder, or defraud creditors or others, with a proviso protecting estates or
                    interests conveyed on good consideration and <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> to
                    persons not having notice of fraud. 46 and 47 Vict. c. 52, § 47 (1), enacts that
                    any settlement of property, not being a settlement made before and in
                    consideration of marriage or made in favour of a purchaser or incumbrancer in
                    good faith and for valuable consideration, or a settlement made on or for the
                    wife or children of the settlor of property which has accrued to the settlor
                    after marriage in right of nis wife, shall, if the settlor becomes bankrupt
                    within two years after the date of the settlement, be void,against the trustee
                    in the bankruptcy, and shall, if the settlor becomes bankrupt within ten years,
                    be void against the trustee unless the parties claiming under the settlement can
                    prove that the settlor was at the time of making the settlement able to pay all
                    his debts without the aid of the settled property, and that the interest of the
                    settlor in such property had passed to the trustee of the settlement on the
                    execution thereof. 27 Eliz. c. 4 was passed for the benefit of purchasers, as 13
                    Eliz. c. 5 was for that of creditors, but refers to real estate and chattels
                    real only. It enacts that every conveyance of lands with intent to defraud
                    purchasers shall be void as against such purchasers only, and that conveyances
                    with power of revocation shall be void against subsequent purchasers. The Act
                    has been construed to mean that a voluntary conveyance of real estate is void as
                    against a subsequent purchaser, mortgagee, or lessee for value. With these
                    exceptions a voluntary settlement is good as between the settlor and the objects
                    of the settlement, and as between them and third persons. So far is this the
                    case that the court will not assist a settlor to destroy the effect of a
                    voluntary settlement by compelling specific performance against a subsequent
                    purchaser. On the other hand the court will not enforce specific performance of
                    a voluntary settlement, in spite of its being a contract under seal. Such an
                    instrument, however, creates a debt and will be admitted to proof in a
                    creditors’ suit.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    death, and so corresponds rather to the English will than the English
                    settlement. The English marriage settlement is represented in Scotland by the
                    <hi rend="italic">contract of marriage,</hi> which, like the English settlement,
                    may bo ante-or post-nuptial. The main difference between the ante-and the
                    post-nuptial contract is the extent to which the property the subject of the
                    contract may be withdrawn from creditors. In the former case a preference or <hi
                    rend="italic">jus crediti</hi> is according to circumstances conferred on the
                    wife or children; in the latter case the wife or children cannot compete with
                    the creditors. A post-nuptial contract is also liable to revocation by the
                    husband or wife. The Married Women’s Property Act, 1881, while it makes the wife
                    complete mistress of her property, at the same time does not exclude or abridge
                    the power of settlement by ante-nuptial contract of marriage.</p>
                <p>A contract of marriage may be made with or without the creation of trustees, the
                    latter being the more usual form. If the contract settle heritable property, it
                    generally contains a narrative or inductive clause, containing the names of the
                    parties with an obligation to celebrate the marriage, a disposition of the
                    estate with its destination, provisions as to the wife and younger children and
                    a declaration that these provisions shall be in full of their legal claims, a
                    conveyance by the wife of her whole means and estate to her husband or the
                    trustees, an appointment of trustees to secure implement of provisions to the
                    wife and children, a registration clause, and a testing clause. If the contract
                    settle movables, it is, <hi rend="italic">mutatis nudandis,</hi> in much the
                    same form, with the addition of a clause excluding the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    mariti</hi> of a future husband of the wife (see <hi rend="italic">Juridical
                    Styles,</hi> vol. i. p. 174, vol. ii. p. 498). The Rutherford Act (11 and 12
                    Vict. c. 36) and the Entail Act, 1882 (45 and 46 Vict. c. 53), specially provide
                    that settlements by marriage contract are not to be disappointed until the birth
                    of a child, who by himself or his guardian consents to disentail, or until the
                    marriage is dissolved, unless with the consent of the trustees of the contract.
                    Improvements by limited owners were allowed by law much earlier than in England.
                    10 Geo. III. c. 51 enabled heirs of entail to charge the entailed estates with
                    the sums of money laid out by them in building mansions. This principle was
                    expressly adopted for England, as the preamble of the Act shows, by the Limited
                    Owners’ Residence Act, 1870. The Rutherford Act and other Acts empowered heirs
                    of entail to excamb, to feu, to lease, to charge by bond and disposition in
                    security, to sell, to grant family provisions, and to erect labourers’ cottages.
                    The Settled Estates Act and Settled Land Act do not apply to Scotland.
                    Substitution, as in Roman law, can only be made by testamentary or <hi
                    rend="italic">mortis causa</hi> disposition. The Rutherford Act and the Entail
                    Amendment Act, 1868 (31 and 32 Vict. c. 84), more strict than the law of England
                    against perpetuities, forbid the creation of a life-rent interest in heritables
                    or movables except in favour of a party in life at the date of the deed creating
                    such interest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> Marriage settlements are not in as common
                    use as in England, no doubt owing to the fact that the principle of the Married
                    Women’s Property Act was the law of most of the States of the Union long before
                    its adoption by England. In Louisiana, in the absence of stipulation to the
                    contrary, community of goods is the rule. Settlements other than marriage
                    settlements are practically unknown in the United States. Property cannot, as a
                    general rule, be tied up to anything like the extent still admissible in
                    England. In those States where entail is allowed the entail may be barred by
                    simple means of alienation. (J. W+.)</p>
