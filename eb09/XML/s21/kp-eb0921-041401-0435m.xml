                    Schleswig-Holstein and Lauenburg, is bounded on the W. by the German Ocean, on
                    the N. by Jutland, on the E. by the Baltic, Lübeck, and Mecklenburg, and on the
                    S. by Mecklenburg and the lower course of the Elbe (separating it from Hanover).
                    It thus consists of the southern half of the Cimbric peninsula, and forms the
                    connecting link between Germany and Denmark. In addition to the mainland, which
                    decreases in breadth from south to north, the province includes several islands,
                    the most important being Alsen and Fehmarn in the Baltic, and Röm, Sylt, and
                    Föhr in the North Sea. The total area of the province is 7280 square miles, 450
                    of which belong to the small duchy of Lauenburg in the south-east corner, while
                    the rest are divided almost equally between Holstein to the south of the Eider
                    and Schleswig to the north of it. From north to south the province is about 140
                    miles long, while its breadth varies from 90 miles in Holstein to 35 miles at
                    the narrower parts of Schleswig.</p>
                <p>Schleswig-Holstein belongs to the great North-German plain, of the characteristic
                    features of which it affords a faithful reproduction in miniature, down to the
                    continuation of the Baltic ridge or plateau (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Germany)</hi> by a range of low wooded hills skirting its eastern coast and
                    culminating in the Bungsberg (570 feet), a little to the north of Eutin. This
                    hilly district contains the most productive land in the province, the soil
                    consisting of diluvial drift or boulder clay. The central part of the province
                    forms practically a continuation of the great Lüneburg Heath, and its thin sandy
                    soil is of little use in cultivation. Along the west coast extends the “Marsh
                    land,” a belt of rich alluvial soil formed by the deposits of the German Ocean,
                    and varying in breadth from five to fifteen miles. It is seldom more than a few
                    feet above the sea-level, while at places it is actually below it, and it has
                    consequently to be defended by an extensive system of dykes or embankments, 25
                    feet high, resembling those of Holland. The more ancient geological formations
                    are scarcely met with in Schleswig-Holstein. The contrast between the two
                    coast-lines of the province is very marked. The Baltic coast, about 300 miles in
                    length, has generally steep well-defined banks and is very irregular in form,
                    being pierced by numerous long and narrow fjords, which run deep into the
                    interior of the land and often afford excellent harbours. The islands of Alsen
                    and Fehmarn are separated from the coast by very narrow channels. The North Sea
                    coast (200 miles), on the other hand, is very low and flat, and its smooth
                    outline is interrupted only by the estuary of the Eider and the peninsula of
                    Eiderstedt. Dunes or sand-hills, though rare on the protected mainland, occur on
                    Sylt, and other islands, while the small unprotected islands called “Halligen”
                    are being gradually washed away by the sea. The numerous islands on the west
                    coast probably formed part of the peninsula at no very remote period, and the
                    sea between them and the mainland is very shallow and full of sandbanks. The
                    climate of Schleswig-Holstein is mainly determined by the proximity of the sea,
                    and the mean annual temperature, varying from 45° Fahr. in the north to 49°
                    Fahr. in the south, is rather higher than is usual in the same latitude. Rain
                    and fog are frequent, but the climate is on the whole very healthy. The lower
                    course of the Elbe forms the southern boundary of Holstein for 65 miles, but the
                    only river of importance within the province is the Eider, which rises in
                    Holstein, and after a course of 120 miles falls into the North Sea, forming an
                    estuary 3 to 12 miles in breadth. It is navigable from its mouth as far as
                    Rendsburg, and the waterway between the two seas is completed by a canal from
                    Rendsburg to Kiel. The new Baltic Canal, which is to be navigable for large
                    vessels, will also intersect Holstein. There are numerous lakes in north-east
                    Holstein, the largest of which are the Plöner See (12 square miles) and the
                    Selenter See (9 square miles).</p>
                <p>Of the total area of the province 58·3 per cent. is occupied by tilled land, 28·5
                    per cent. by meadows and pastures, and only 6·4 per cent. by forests. The
                    ordinary cereals are all cultivated with success and there is generally a
                    considerable surplus for exportation; rape is grown in the marsh lands and flax
                    on the east coast, while large quantities of apples and other fruit are raised
                    near Altona for the Hamburg and English markets. In 1883 the province contained
                    156,534 horses, 727,505 cattle, 320,768 sheep, 268,061 pigs, and 42,580 goats.
                    The marsh lands afford admirable pasture, and a greater proportion of cattle (65
                    per 100 inhabitants) is reared in Schleswig-Holstein, mainly by small owners,
                    than in any other Prussian province. Great numbers of fat cattle are exported to
                    England. The Holstein horses are also in request, but sheepfarming is
                    comparatively neglected. Bee-keeping is found a productive industry, and in 1883
                    the province possessed 113,836 hives. The hills skirting the bays of the Baltic
                    coast are generally pleasantly wooded, but the forests are nowhere of great
                    extent except in the duchy of Lauenburg. The fishing in the Baltic is
                    productive; Eckernförde is the chief fishing station in Prussia. The oysters
                    from the beds on the west coast of Schleswig are widely known under the misnomer
                    of “Holstein natives.” The mineral resources of the province are almost confined
                    to a few layers of rock-salt near Segeberg. The manufacturing industry is also
                    insignificant and does not extend much beyond the large towns, such as Altona,
                    Kiel, and Flensburg. The shipbuilding of Kiel and other seaports is, however,
                    important; and lace is made by the peasants of North Schleswig. The commerce and
                    shipping of Schleswig-Holstein, stimulated by its position between two seas, as
                    well as by its excellent harbours and waterways, are much more prominent than
                    its manufactures. Kiel is the chief seaport of Prussia, while an oversea trade
                    is also carried on by Altona and Flensburg. The main exports are grain, cattle,
                    horses, fish, and oysters, in return for which come timber, coal, salt, wine,
                    and<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n436/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0436-0415"/> colonial produce. The trading fleet of
                    Schleswig-Holstein in 1884 consisted of 713 vessels (142 steamers), with a total
                    burthen of 115,600 tons; more than half the ships belonged to the North Sea
                    coast, but 90 per cent. of the steamers and 65 per cent. of the tonnage must be
                    credited to the Baltic.</p>
                <p>The population of the province in 1880 was 1,127,149, comprising 1,111,383
                    Protestants, 8903 Roman Catholics, and 3522 Jews. The urban and rural
                    communities are in the proportion of 4 to 6. About 38 per cent. of the
                    population are supported by agriculture, 26 per cent. by manufacturing industry,
                    10 per cent. by trade, while 12 per cent. are domestic servants and
                    day-labourers, 6 per cent. is absorbed by the official and professional classes,
                    and 5 ½ per cent. by those who returned no occupation. The great bulk of the
                    Holsteiners and more than half the Schleswigers are of genuine German stock, but
                    there are about 150,000 Danes in the north part of Schleswig. Among the Germans
                    the prevalent tongue is Low German, but the North Frisians on the west coast of
                    Schleswig and the North Sea islands (about 30,000 in all) still speak a Frisian
                    dialect, which, however, is gradually dying out. The peninsula of Angeln,
                    between the Gulf of Flensburg and the Schlei, is supposed to have been the
                    original seat of the English, and most observers profess to see a striking
                    resemblance between this district and the counties of Kent and Surrey. The
                    peasants of Dithmarschen also retain many of their ancient peculiarities. The
                    boundary between the Danish and German languages is approximately a line between
                    Flensburg and Tondern; not more than 15 per cent. of the entire population of
                    the province speak Danish as their mother-tongue. The chief educational
                    institution in Schleswig-Holstein is the university of Kiel; and the excellence
                    of the ordinary school system is proved by the fact that in 1883-84 the
                    Schleswig-Holstein recruits showed a smaller proportion of illiteracy (0·11 per
                    cent.) than those from any other part of the German empire. Schleswig is the
                    official capital of the province, but Altona and Kiel are the largest towns, the
                    former being also the headquarters of an army corps and the latter the chief
                    naval station of Germany. Kiel and Friedrichsort are fortified, and the old
                    lines of Düppel are also maintained. The province sends ten members to the
                    reichstag and nineteen to the Prussian house of deputies. The provincial estates
                    meet in Rendsburg.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The history of the southern part of the Cimbric
                    peninsula is the record of a struggle between the Danes and the Germans, ending
                    in the meantime in favour of the latter. The earliest inhabitants of whose
                    existence we have any trace seem to have been of German stock, and German
                    authorities maintain that it was the emigration to England of the Jutes and
                    Angles that first gave the Scandinavian or Danish element scope to develop in
                    the district. In the early part of the ninth century we find Charlemagne in
                    conflict with the Danish rulers of South Jutland or Schleswig<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name of Schleswig did not
                    come into general use for this part of the Cimbric peninsula until the end of
                    the 14th century.</p></note> and establishing a “Danish mark” between the Eider
                    and the Schlei. Some attempt to introduce Christianity was also made at this
                    time by Bishop Ansgarius, but it was not till the middle of the following
                    century that the new creed found anything approaching to general acceptance. In
                    1027 the Danish king Knud (the English Canute) obtained from Conrad the
                    recognition of Schleswig’s independence of the empire, and henceforth the Eider
                    became the recognized boundary between Germany and Denmark (“Eidora Romani
                    terminus imperii”). Schleswig, though a Danish province, was not merged in the
                    other possessions of Denmark, but enjoyed a certain measure of independence
                    under the rule of viceroys or dukes chosen from the younger sons of the royal
                    house. One of the most vigorous of these rulers was Knud Laward (1115-1131), who
                    extended his sway over the Wendish district of Wagria (see below) and held it as
                    a fief of the German empire. He was thus the first ruler of Schleswig to hold
                    that singular double relationship to the king of Denmark and the German empire
                    which afterwards became so important a factor in the history of the country.
                    Valdemar, son of Knud, became king of Denmark, and Knud’s grandson, King
                    Valdemar II., conferred the duchy of South Jutland or Schleswig on his son Abel
                    in 1232. The terms of this investment afterwards became a fertile subject of
                    dispute between the dukes and the crown, the former maintaining that they held
                    their land as an hereditary and inalienable fief, while the kings argued that
                    the fief was revocable at pleasure. The dukes, however, assisted by their
                    kinsmen, the counts of Holstein, succeeded in establishing their position and
                    finally remained in undisputed possession of their duchy. In 1326 Duke Valdemar
                    V. of Schleswig was raised to the throne of Denmark through the influence of his
                    uncle, Count Gerhard of Holstein, to whom in return he ceded his duchy. Valdemar
                    had to abdicate in 1330 and received his duchy back again, granting, however,
                    the “Constitutio Valde-maria,” which ensured the rights of eventual succession
                    in Schleswig to the Holstein counts. This compact came to fruition in 1375, when
                    the male ducal line became extinct, and Margaret of Denmark formally recognized
                    the union of the two territories in 1386. Henceforth we have the same prince
                    ruling over Schleswig and</p>
                <p>Holstein, holding the first as a fief of the Danish crown and the other as a fief
                    of the German empire.</p>
                <p>The history of Holstein before its union with Schleswig has been partly indicated
                    in the foregoing paragraph. Nordalbingia, or the land to the north of the Elbe,
                    was inhabited by the Saxons, under whom it was divided into four <hi
                    rend="italic">gaus</hi> or hundreds :— <hi rend="smallcaps">Dithmarschen</hi>
                    (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) on the west, Holstein proper or Holtsaten (“men of
                    the forest”) in the middle, Wagria on the east, and Stormarn on the south. The
                    Nordalbingians were the last of the Saxons to be subdued by Charlemagne (804),
                    who gave Wagria to his Wendish allies the Obotrites, and established a Wendish
                    mark on their frontier at the same time that he established a Danish mark on the
                    Eider. The other three gaus were incorporated with the duchy of Saxony,
                    Dithmarschen being included in the countship of Stade while Holstein and
                    Stormarn had a count of their own. In 1110 the countship of Holstein was
                    conferred upon Adolphus I. of Schauenburg, who founded the influential lino that
                    eventually ruled over Schleswig-Holstein. Wagria was added to Holstein by
                    Adolphus II. about 1140. In the beginning of the 13th century the Danish kings
                    extended their sway over all German territory to the north of the Elbe, and
                    their conquests were confirmed by an imperial grant in 1214. This state of
                    affairs, however, was of no long continuance, and Adolphus III. of Holstein
                    succeeded in reestablishing his independence in 1225. The Holstein family now
                    became split up into several branch-lines, of which that of Rendsburg proved the
                    most lasting and important. A daughter of this line married Duke Abel of
                    Schleswig, and the Holstein counts lent faithful aid to their kinsmen in
                    resisting the encroachments and claims of the kings of Denmark. In the
                    distracted state of Denmark at the beginning of the 14th century Count Gerhard
                    of Holstein became the practical ruler of the kingdom, but preferred to place
                    the crown on the head of his nephew Valdemar. Legally speaking, Holstein
                    remained a mediate fief of Saxony; but with the decline of the Saxon duchy this
                    relationship became obscured, and, when the Holstein lands were created a duchy
                    in 1474, the new duke held his lands directly from the emperor.</p>
                <p>In 1448 the royal line of Denmark became extinct, and the crown was offered to
                    Adolphus VII. of Schleswig-Holstein, who refused it for himself but exerted his
                    influence to secure it for his nephew Christian of Oldenburg. Adolphus died in
                    1459, leaving no sons. Christian was the legal heir of Schleswig, but his claims
                    to Holstein were by no means so strong. The estates of Schleswig-Holstein,
                    however, decided in his favour on the plea that the duchies<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This use of the term “duchies" anticipates a
                    little, as Holstein was not made a duchy till 1474. Dithmarschen, indeed, which
                    was supposed to be a part of ducal Holstein, was not subdued till
                    1559.</p></note> could not be separated, and exacted from him a confirmation of
                    this indissoluble connexion. It was also formally stipulated that the duchies
                    should never be actually incorporated with the kingdom of Denmark, while the
                    hereditary nature of the fief was given up and the estates acquired the right to
                    choose as their duke any one of Christian’s descendants. This Succession Act was
                    the basis of the union of the two duchies for the next four hundred years, and
                    the practical contradiction between their own inseparable connexion and their
                    feudal duty to different sovereigns is at once the cause and the explanation of
                    the complicated “Schleswig-Holstein question.”</p>
                <p>Now follows a series of endless shiftings, divisions, and reunions of the two
                    duchies. After 1580 the various collateral lines of the Oldenburg family thus
                    formed are represented by two main branches,—the royal or Glückstadt line and
                    the Gottorp or ducal line. In the division of Schleswig-Holstein between these
                    two no regard was paid to the boundary of the Eider; each of them ruled over
                    detached parts of both duchies, though the whole of Schleswig was still under
                    the sovereignty of Denmark and the whole of Holstein under that of Germany.
                    Practically Schleswig came to be regarded merely as a part of Denmark, while
                    Holstein’s connexion with Germany preserved for it a flicker of independence. In
                    1660 Denmark became an absolute monarchy and the principle of female succession
                    was acknowledged. As in Schleswig-Holstein the right of inheritance was confined
                    to the male line, the policy of Denmark was vigorously directed towards, doing
                    away as far as possible with all separate rights in the duchy and to getting the
                    Gottorp or ducal portions into the possession of the crown. This policy was
                    naturally more successful in Schleswig than in Holstein, and in 1721 Frederick
                    IV. was able to gain the guarantee of the powers for the incorporation of the
                    whole of Schleswig with the Danish monarchy. He had, however, to give up his
                    claim to Holstein. In 1762 the Holstein-Gottorp line succeeded to the throne of
                    Russia in the person of Peter III., and this led in 1773 to an agreement by
                    which the Gottorp line resigned its share of Holstein to the king of Denmark in
                    exchange for Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. The whole of Schleswig-Holstein thus
                    came once more under the sway of a ruler who was at the same time king of
                    Denmark.</p>

                    constitutional rights of the duchies led to the events forming the recent
