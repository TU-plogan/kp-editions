                    between 17° 13' and 18° 35' N. lat. and 74° 39' and 76° 11' E. long. It is
                    bounded on the N. by Ahmadnagar district, on the E. by the nizam’s territory and
                    Akalkot state, on the S. by Kaladgi district and some of the Patvardhan states,
                    and on the W. by Sátára and Poona districts and the states of Phaltan and Panth
                    Pratinidhi. Except in Karmala and Barsi subdivisions, situated in the north and
                    east, where there is a good deal of hilly ground, the district is generally flat
                    or undulating; but it is very bare of vegetation, and presents everywhere a
                    bleak treeless appearance. The chief rivers are the Bhima and its
                    tributaries—the Μάη, the Nira, and the Sina—all flowing towards the south-east.
                    Besides these there are several smaller streams. Lying in a tract of uncertain
                    rainfall, Sholapur is peculiarly liable to seasons of scarcity; much, however,
                    has been done by the opening of canals and ponds, such as the Ekrúk and Ashti
                    tanks, to secure a better water-supply. The Great Indian Peninsular Railway
                    enters the district at Pomalvádi in the northwest corner and crosses it in a
                    south-easterly direction, a distance of nearly 150 miles. Sholapur has recently
                    been connected with a branch of the Southern Mahratta Railway.</p>
                <p>The population of Sholapur district in 1881 was 582,487 (294,814 males and
                    287,673 females). Hindus numbered 530,121, Mohammedans 43,967, and Christians
                    625. There are three towns with populations exceeding 10,000 each, viz., <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sholapur</hi> (q.v.), Pandharpur (16,910), Barsi (16,126). In
                    1883-84 there were 1,763,340 acres under cultivation, of which 22,282 were twice
                    cropped, besides 325,987 acres of fallow or grass land. Joár, which forms the
                    staple food of the people, occupied 923,706 acres, bajri 298,239, wheat 55,504,
                    rice 25,027, pulses 185,528, and oil-seeds 147,914 acres. The produce of the
                    district finds an easy outlet by the railway to</p>
                <p>Poona and Bombay. The chief exports are cotton, which comes from the nizam’s
                    dominions, oil, oil-seeds, ghi, turmeric, and cotton cloth; imports include
                    salt, piece-goods, yarn, gunney bags, and iron ware. The chief industries are
                    spinning, weaving, and dyeing. The silks and finer sorts of cotton cloth
                    prepared in Sholapur bear a good name; blankets are also woven in large numbers.
                    The gross revenue of the district in 1883-84 amounted to £129,429, of which the
                    land-tax yielded £98,963.</p>
                <p>Sholapur district passed from the Bahmani to the Bijápur kings and from them to
                    the Maráthás. In 1818, on the fall of the Peshwa, it was ceded to the British,
                    when it formed part of the Poona collectorate, but in 1838 it was made a
                    separate collectorate. Since then its progress has been rapid.</p>
