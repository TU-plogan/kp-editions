                <p><label type="entry">SAMARITANS</label>. This term, which primarily means
                    “inhabitants of Samaritis or the region of Samaria,” is specially used, as in
                    the New Testament and in Josephus, as the name of a peculiar religious community
                    which had its headquarters in the Samaritan country, and is still represented by
                    a few families (about 150 souls) at Nábulus, the ancient Shechem. They regard
                    themselves as Israelites, descendants of the ten tribes, and claim to possess
                    the orthodox religion of Moses, accepting the Pentateuch and transmitting it in
                    a text which for the most part has only microscopic variations from the Torah of
                    the Jews. But they regard the Jewish temple and priesthood as schismatical, and
                    declare that the true sanctuary of God’s choice is not Zion but Mount Gerizim,
                    overhanging Shechem (John iv. 20); here they had a temple which was destroyed by
                    John Hyrcanus about 128 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c. (Jos.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Ant.,</hi> xiii. 9, 1), and on the top of the mountain they still celebrate
                    the passover. The sanctity of this site they prove from their Pentateuch,
                    reading Gerizim for Ebal in Deut. xxvii. 4. With this change the chapter of
                    Deuteronomy can be interpreted with a little straining as a command to select
                    Gerizim as the legitimate sanctuary (comp. ver. 7); and accordingly in Exod. xx.
                    and Deut. v. a commandment taken from Deut. xxvii. is inserted at the close of
                    the decalogue. Thus on their reckoning the tenth commandment is the direction to
                    build an altar and do sacrifice on Gerizim,—from which of course it follows that
                    not only the temple of Zion but the earlier temple of Shiloh and the priesthood
                    of Eli were schismatical. Such at least is the express statement of the later
                    Samaritans; the older Samaritans, as they had no sacred books except the
                    Pentateuch, probably ignored the whole history between Joshua and the captivity,
                    and so escaped a great many difficulties. The contention that the Pentateuch is
                    a law given by Moses for a community worshipping on Mount Gerizim is of course
                    glaringly unhistorical. By the (unnamed) sanctuary of God’s choice the
                    Deuteronomist certainly designed the temple of Zion; and the priestly law, which
                    is throughout based on the practice of the priests of Jerusalem before the
                    captivity, was reduced to form after the exile, and was first published by Ezra
                    as the law of the rebuilt temple of Zion. The Samaritans must therefore have
                    derived their Pentateuch from the Jews after Ezra’s reforms, after 444 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi> Before that time Samaritanism cannot have existed
                    in a form at all similar to that which we know; but there must have been a
                    community ready to accept the Pentateuch. In point of fact the district of Mount
                    Ephraim was not entirely stripped of its old Hebrew population by the Assyrian
                    captivity, and the worship of Jehovah went on at the old shrines of Northern
                    Israel side by side, or even interfused, with the old heathenish rites of the
                    new settlers whom the Assyrians brought to fill up the lands desolated by war.
                    The account of the religious condition of the country given in 2 Kings xvii. 24
                        <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> dwells only on the partial adoption of
                    Jehovah-worship by the foreigners who had come into the land, but by no means
                    implies that the foreigners constituted the whole population. Josiah extended
                    his reforms beyond the limits of Juda?a proper to Bethel and other Samaritan
                    cities (2 Kings xxiii. 19), and the narrative shows that at that date things
                    were going on at the Northern sanctuaries much as they had done in the time of
                    Amos and Hosea. To a considerable extent his efforts to make Jerusalem the
                    sanctuary of Samaria as well as of Judaea must have been successful, for in Jer.
                    xli. 5 we find fourscore men from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria making a
                    pilgrimage to “the house of Jehovah,” after the catastrophe of Zedekiah. And so
                    it is not surprising to find that the people of this district came to Zerubbabel
                    and Joshua after the restoration, claiming to be of the same religion with the
                    Jews and asking to be associated with them in the rebuilding of the temple.
                    Their overtures were rejected by the leaders of the new theocracy, who could not
                    but fear the results of interfusion with so large a mass of men of mixed blood
                    and very questionable orthodoxy; and so the Jehovah-worshippers of Samaria were
                    thrown into the ranks of “the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin” (Ezra iv.).
                    Nevertheless, down to the time of Nehemiah, the breach was not absolute; but the
                    expulsion from Jerusalem in 432 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c</hi> of a man of
                    high-priestly family who had married a daughter of Sanballat made it so; and it
                    is more than probable, as has been explained in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Israel,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 419, that this priest is the Manasseh of
                    Josephus, who carried the Pentateuch to Shechem, and for whom the temple of
                    Gerizim was built. For, though the story in Josephus <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Ant.,</hi> xi. 8) is falsely dated and mixed with fable, it agrees with
                    Neh. xiii. in too many essential points to be wholly rejected, and supplies
                    exactly what is wanted to explain the existence in Shechem of a community
                    bitterly hostile to the Jews, and yet constituted in obedience to Ezra’s
                    Pentateuch.</p>
                <p>When we consider what difficulties were met with in the introduction of
                    Pentateuchal orthodoxy even at Jerusalem, the foundation of a community of the
                    Law in the Samaritan country, among the mixed populations whom the Judaean
                    leaders did not venture to receive into fellowship, must appear a very
                    remarkable exploit. The Samaritan religion was built on the Pentateuch alone;
                    and the fact that they did not receive even those prophetic books and historical
                    narratives which originated in Northern Israel (all which have been preserved to
                    us only by the Jews) shows that, before they received the Pentateuch, their
                    Jehovah-worship was a mere affair of traditional practice, uninspired by
                    prophetic ideas and unsupported by written record of the great deeds of Jehovah
                    in time past. It can hardly in any respect have risen above the level of the
                    popular religion of North Israel as described and condemned by Hosea and Amos.
                    In Judaea the duty of conformity to the Pentateuch was enforced by appeal to the
                    prophets and to the history of the nation’s sins and chastisements, and the
                    acceptance of a vast and rigid body of ordinances was more easy because they
                    came as the consolidation and logical development of a movement that had been in
                    progress from the days of Isaiah. Among the Samaritans, on the other hand, the
                    acceptance of the Pentateuch implied a tremendous<pb break="no"

                    felt that they had fallen behind the Judaeans in religious matters, and the
                    opportunity of putting themselves on a par with them by securing a copy of the
                    institutes of Moses and the services of a Judaean priest would naturally be
                    grasped at. But what is remarkable is that, having got the Pentateuch, they
                    followed it with a fidelity as loyal and exact as the Jews themselves, save in
                    the one matter of the change of the sanctuary. No concessions were made to
                    heathenism or to the old lax Jehovah-worship; the text of the sacred book was
                    transmitted with as much conscientiousness as was practised by Jewish scribes in
                    the first centuries after Ezra;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>This appears especially by comparison of the Samaritan
                            Pentateuch with the Septuagint. It is not of course to be wondered at
                            that the Judaean text is on the whole superior to the Samaritan, for the
                            Samaritans had no opportunity of revising their text by Judaean copies.
                            The Samaritan character is an independent development of the old Hebrew
                            writing as it was about the time when they first got the Pentateuch.
                            This in itself is an indication that from the first their text ran a
                            separate course, and that there was no opportunity of checking
                            corruptions that had got into it by reference to different recensions.
                            In Judaea also there were important variations between MSS. down to the
                            time of the Septuagint and even later, and in many cases the Septuagint
                            readings agree with the Samaritan Pentateuch, showing an affinity
                            between the sources of these two texts. But ultimately the Jewish
                            scribes were able to constitute or rather to select an authoritative
                            text, and whether by good luck or by judgment the text they chose was on
                            the whole one of a singularly good type. The Samaritans never had
                            opportunity to do anything of this kind.</p></note> and even from the
                    unwilling witness of their enemies the Jews we can gather that they fulfilled
                    all righteousness with scrupulous punctiliousness so far as the letter of the
                    written law was concerned, though of course they did not share in the later
                    developments of the oral law, and so were heretics in the eyes of the
                        Pharisees.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare,

                            were falsely accused, it is plain that even this partisan writer did not
                            venture to represent them as indifferent to ritual orthodoxy. No doubt,
                            in addition to the legal ordinances, the Samaritans retained some
                            ancient traditional practices, as they certainly introduced some new
                            observances. Their passover, for example, has some peculiar features,
                            one of which, viz., the application of the sacrificial blood to the
                            faces of the children, has an exact parallel in the old Arabic <hi

                <p>That it was possible to establish such a community on such a soil is a remarkable
                    evidence that in that age the tendency to a legal religion was favoured by
                    general causes, not confined to Judsea alone; it must be remembered that
                    elaborate hierocracies sprang up after the fall of the old nationalities in many
                    parts of western Asia (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Priest,</hi> vol. xix. p.
                    729). At the same time it must be remembered that, as Ezra could not have
                    succeeded without Nehemiah, Manasseh had Sanballat’s civil authority to back
                    him. It is probable, too, that Josephus is right in assuming that he was
                    strengthened by a considerable secession of Judaeans, and it is not to be
                    supposed that the “Samaritans” ever embraced anything like the whole population
                    of the Samaritan country. Samaria itself was Hellenized in the time of
                    Alexander; and in Ecclus. 1. 26 the foolish people that dwell at Shechem are
                    distinguished from the inhabitants of the Samaritan hill-country in

                    like the Jews, throve and multiplied under the discipline of the law, but at no
                    time in their history do they appear to have had the political importance that
                    would have accrued to so closely knit a religious body if it had held all the
                    fertile Samaritan district.</p>
                <p>Jews and Samaritans were separated by bitter jealousies and open feuds (Jos., <hi
                        rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xii. 4, 1), but their internal development and
                    external history ran closely parallel courses till the Jewish state took a new
                    departure under the</p>
                <p>Maccabees. The religious resemblance between the two bodies was increased by the
                    adoption of the institution of the synagogue, and from the synagogue there
                    certainly grew up a Samaritan theology and an exegetical tradition. The latter
                    is embodied in the Samaritan Targum or Aramaic version of the Pentateuch, which
                    in its present form is, according to Nöldeke’s investigations, not earlier than
                    the fourth Christian century, but in general agrees with the readings of
                    Origen’s <hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi> Σαμαρειτιόν. For the dogmatic views of the
                    Samaritans our sources are all late; they embrace hymns and other books of
                    little general interest, and mainly at least of mediaeval origin. Like the Jews,
                    too, the Samaritans had a haggada; indeed the Arabic books they still possess
                    under the name of chronicles are almost entirely haggadic fable with very little
                    admixture of true tradition. The recent date of all this literature seems to
                    show that the old Samaritans had not nearly so vigorous an intellectual life as
                    the Jews, though what life they had moved in similar lines; indeed, having no
                    sacred book but the Pentateuch, and having passed through no such national
                    revival as that of the Maccabees, they lacked two of the most potent influences
                    that shaped the development of Judaism. On the other hand, they shared with the
                    Jews the influence of a third great intellectual stimulus, that of Hellenism.
                    Samaritans as well as Jews were carried to Egypt by Ptolemy Lagi; the rivalry of
                    the two sects was continued in Alexandria (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi>
                    xii. 1, 1), and Hellenized Samaritans wrote histories and epic poems in Greek
                    with exactly the same patriotic mendacity which characterizes Jewish Hellenism
                    Of this, the oldest surviving Samaritan literature, some fragments have been

                <p>Under the Maccabees their relations with Judaea became very bitter, and they were
                    severely chastised by Hyrcanus, who destroyed their temple. Hostilities between
                    the two nations recurred from time to time; and in the New Testament, in
                    Josephus, and in Jewish tradition we see how deep-seated was their mutual

                            not always so positive in calling them pure Gentiles. The groundless
                            accusation of dove-worship (which makes their religion that of the
                            Syrian Aphrodite) arose in post-Mishnic times.</p></note> But, with all
                    this, the sects were too nearly alike not to have much in common. The Roman yoke
                    galled both in the same way; the Samaritan false prophet whose movement Pilate
                    put down with cruel slaughter (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xviii. 4, 1),
                    and probably also Simon Magus and Dositheus (Orig., <hi rend="italic">Cont.
                        Cels.,</hi> i. p. 44), are parallel phenomena to the false Messiahs that
                    arose among the Jews. The original views of the Samaritans were like those of
                    the Sadducees, and they did not believe in a resurrection or a Messiah; but it
                    was impossible for their faith to survive under the cruel pressure of foreign
                    bondage without absorbing something from Jewish eschatology. And so too, in the
                    struggle of the Jews with Vespasian, perhaps also in that with Hadrian, the
                    Samaritans forgot their old feud, and took part against the Romans. They seem
                    also to have shared in great measure in the subsequent dispersion, for in later
                    times we hear of Samaritans and Samaritan synagogues not only in Egypt but in
                    Rome, and in other parts of the empire.<pb break="no"

                    service. Under these circumstances they naturally came to be mainly traders and
                    merchants’ clerks; in Constantinople “a Samaritan” meant “a banker’s clerk.” In
                    their old homes they still remained numerous enough to make a serious
                    insurrection under Justinian (529 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> Its
                    suppression was followed by very stern decrees against the whole sect, and
                    Europe heard little more of the Samaritans till, towards the close of the 16th
                    century, Western scholars took an interest in the few congregations that still
                    remained in the East, at Cairo and Damascus as well as at Nábulus. It was found
                    that during the Middle Ages they had formed an Arabic literature of considerable
                    size but of little intrinsic worth, and had continued faithfully to preserve
                    their scriptures. Since then their numbers have been constantly on the wane, and
                    they have almost lost their old learning, which was never very considerable.</p>

                    the corruptions of the text, differs little from other Palestinian Aramaic, (<hi

                    The so-called Samaritan book of Joshua is an Arabic chronicle going down to
                    Roman times, but of almost no historical use. It may date from the 13th century.
