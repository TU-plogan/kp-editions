                    form, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sheldrake,</hi> a word whose derivation<note

                    >(Engl. Words,</hi> p. 76) gave it from the local “sheld” ( = particoloured),
                    which, applied to animals, as a horse or a cat, still survives in East Anglia.
                    This opinion is not only suitable but is confirmed by the bird’s Old Norsk name

                    interpret <hi rend="italic">Skjöldungr</hi> by the secondary meaning of <hi
                    rend="italic">Skjöldr,</hi> a shield, asserting that it refers to “the
                    shield-like band across the breast” of the bird. If they be right the proper
                    spelling of the English word would be “Shield-drake,” as some indeed have it. A
                    third suggested meaning, from the Old Norsk <hi rend="italic">Skj6l,</hi>
                    shelter, is philologically to be rejected, but, if true, would refer to the

                    ornithology, a bird somewhat larger and of more upright stature than an ordinary
                    Duck, having its bill, with a basal fleshy protuberance (whence the specific
                    term <hi rend="italic">cornuta),</hi> pale red, the head and upper neck very
                    dark glossy green, and beneath that a broad white collar, succeeded by a still
                    broader belt of bright bay extending from the upper back across the upper
                    breast. The outer scapulars, the primaries, a median abdominal stripe, which
                    dilates at the vent, and a bar at the tip of the middle tail-quills are black;
                    the inner secondaries and the lower tail-coverts are grey; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">speculum</hi> or wing-spot is a rich bronzed-green. The rest of
                    the plumage is pure white, and the legs are flesh-coloured. There is little
                    external difference between the sexes, the female being only somewhat smaller
                    and less brightly coloured. The Sheldrake frequents the sandy coasts of nearly
                    the whole of Europe and North Africa, extending across Asia to India, China, and
                    Japan, generally keeping in pairs and sometimes penetrating to favourable inland
                    localities. The nest is always made under cover, usually in a rabbit-hole among
                    sandhills, and in the Frisian Islands the people supply this bird with
                    artificial burrows, taking large toll of it in eggs and down. Barbary,
                    south-eastern Europe, and Central Asia are inhabited by an allied species of
                    more inland range and very different coloration, the T. <hi rend="italic"

                    paire or by thousands, to their inland waters. This species is of an almost
                    uniform bay colour all over, except the quill-feathers of the wings and tail,
                    and (in the male) a ring round the neck, which are black, while the wing-coverts
                    are white and the <hi rend="italic">speculum</hi> shines with green and purple;

                    night on the opposite banks of a river, whence they unceasingly call to one
                    another: “Charkwa, shall I come?” “No, Charkwi.” “Charkwi, shall I come?” “No,
                    Charkwa.” As to how, under these circumstances, the race is perpetuated the
                    legend is silent.</p></note> A species closely resembling the last, but with a
                    grey head, <hi rend="italic">T. cana,</hi> inhabits South Africa, while in some
                    of the islands of the Malay Archipelago, and in the northern parts of Australia,
                    there is a fourth species, <hi rend="italic">T. radjah,</hi> which almost equals
                    the true Sheldrake in its brightly contrasted plumage, but yet wants some of the
                    lively colours the latter displays—its head, for instance, being white instead
                    of dark green. Further to the southward in Australia occurs another species of
                    more sombre colours, the <hi rend="italic">T. tadornoides;</hi> and New Zealand
                    is the home of a sixth species, <hi rend="italic">T. variegata,</hi> still less
                    distinguished by bright hues. In the last two the plumage of the sexes differs
                    not inconsiderably, but all are believed to have essentially the same habits as
                    the <hi rend="italic">T. cornuta.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The <hi rend="italic">Anas scutellata</hi> of the Indo-Malay

                <p>It is not without a purpose that these different species are here particularized.
                    Sheldrakes will, if attention be paid to their wants, breed freely in captivity,
                    crossing if opportunity be given them with other species, and an incident
                    therewith connected possesses an importance hardly to be overrated by the
                    philosophical naturalist, though it seems not to have met with the attention it
                    deserves. In the Zoological Society’s gardens in the spring of 1859 a male of
                    <hi rend="italic">T. cοrnuta</hi> mated with a female of <hi rend="italic">T.
                    cana,</hi> and, as will have been inferred from what has been before stated,
                    these two species differ greatly in the colouring of their plumage. The young of
                    their union, however, presented an appearance wholly unlike that of either
                    parent, and an appearance which can hardly be said, as has been said <hi
                    rend="italic">(P. Z. S.,</hi> 1859, p. 442), to be “a curious combination of the
                    colours of the two.” Both sexes of this hybrid have been admirably portrayed by
                    Mr Wolf (<hi rend="italic">tom</hi>. <hi rend="italic">cit.,</hi> Aves, pl.
                    158); and, strange to say, when these figures are compared with equally faithful
                    portraits by the same master <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> 1864, pls. 18,
                    19) of the Australian and New Zealand species, <hi rend="italic">T.
                    tadornoides</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. variegata,</hi> it will at once be
                    seen that the hybrids present an appearance almost midway between the two
                    species last named—species which certainly had nothing to do with their
                    production. The only explanation of this astounding fact seems to be that
                    afforded by the principle of “reversion,” as set forth by Mr Darwin, and
                    illustrated by him from examples of certain breeds of Doves, domestic Fowls, and
                    Ducks <hi rend="italic">(Anim. and Pl. under Domestication,</hi> i. pp. 197-200,
                    ii. p. 40), as well as, in the matter of domestic Fowls, by Mr Cambridge
                    Phillips <hi rend="italic">(Zoologist,</hi> 1884, p. 331). It is a perfectly
                    fair hypothesis that the existing animals of New Zealand and Australia retain
                    more of their ancestral character than do those of countries in which we may
                    suppose the struggle for life to have been fiercer and the action of natural
                    selection stronger. Why it is so we cannot say, yet experiment proves that the
                    most widely different breeds of Pigeons and other poultry, when crossed, produce
                    offspring that more resembles the ancestral wild species from which the
                    domesticated forms have sprung than it resembles either of the immediate
                    parents. This mysterious agency is known as<pb break="no"

                    just cited proves that the same effect is produced in species as well as in
                    “races,”—indicating the essential identity of both, —the only real difference
                    being that “species” are more differentiated than are “races,” or that the
                    distinction between them, instead of being (as many writers, some of the first
                    repute, have maintained) qualitative, is merely quantitative, or one of
                    degree.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is further
                    worthy of remark that the young of <hi rend="italic">T. variegata</hi> when
                    first hatched closely resemble those of <hi rend="italic">T. casarca,</hi> and
                    when the former· assume their first plumage they resemble their father more than
                    their mother (P. <hi rend="italic">Z. S.,</hi> 1866, p. 150).</p></note></p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Tadoma,</hi> as shewn by its tracheal characters,
