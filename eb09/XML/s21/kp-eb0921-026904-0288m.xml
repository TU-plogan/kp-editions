                <p><label type="entry">SANSKRIT</label> is the name applied by Hindu scholars to the
                    ancient literary language of India. The word <hi rend="italic">samskrita</hi> is
                    the past participle of the verb <hi rend="italic">kar,</hi> “to make” (cognate
                    with Latin <hi rend="italic">creo),</hi> with the preposition <hi rend="italic"
                    >sam,</hi> “together” (cog. <hi rend="italic">apa, opos,</hi> Eng. “same ”), and
                    has probably to be taken here in the sense of “completely formed” or “accurately
                    made, polished,”—some noun meaning “speech” (esp. <hi rend="italic">bhasha)</hi>
                    being either expressed or understood with it. The term was, doubtless,
                    originally adopted by native grammarians to distinguish the literary language of
                    the educated classes from the uncultivated popular dialects—the forerunners of
                    the modern vernaculars of northern India—which had, from an early period,
                    developed side by side with it, and which were called (from the same root <hi
                    rend="italic">kar,</hi> but with different prepositions) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prakrita, i.e.,</hi> either “derived” or “natural, common” forms of speech. But
                    this designation of the literary idiom, being evidently intended to imply a
                    language regulated by conventional rules, also involves a distinction between
                    the grammatically fixed language of Brahmanical India and an earlier, less
                    settled, phase of the same language exhibited in the Vedic waitings. For greater
                    convenience the Vedic language is, however, usually included in the term, and
                    scholars generally distinguish between the Vedic and the classical Sanskrit. The
                    Sanskrit language, with its old and modern descendants, represents the
                    easternmost branch of the great IndoGermanic, or Aryan, stock of speech.
                    Philological research has clearly established the fact that the Indo-Aryans must
                    originally have immigrated into India from the north-west. In the oldest
                    literary documents handed down by them their gradual advance can indeed be
                    traced</p>
                <p>The origin of comparative philology dates from the time when European scholars
                    became accurately acquainted with the ancient language of India. Before that
                    time classical scholars had been unable, through centuries of learned research,
                    to determine the true relations between the then known languages of our stock.
                    This fact alone shows the importance of Sanskrit for comparative research.
                    Though its value in this respect has perhaps at times been overrated, it may
                    still be considered as the eldest daughter of the old mother-tongue. Indeed, so
                    far as direct documentary evidence goes, it may rather be said to be the only
                    surviving daughter; for none of the other six principal members of the family
                    have left any literary monuments, and their original features have to be
                    reproduced, as best they can, from the materials supplied by their own daughter
                    languages: such is the case as regards the Iranic, Hellenic, Italic, Celtic,
                    Teutonic, and Letto-Slavic languages. To the Sanskrit the antiquity and extent
                    of its literary documents, the transparency of its grammatical structure, the
                    comparatively primitive state of its accent system, and the thorough grammatical
                    treatment it has early received at the hand of native scholars must ever secure
                    the foremost place in the comparative study of Indo-Germanic speech.<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0289-0270"/> The Sanskrit alphabet consists of the following
                    sounds :—</p>
                <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Fourteen vowels, viz.:—</p>
                <p>Ten simple vowels: <hi rend="italic">a â, i</hi> î, <hi rend="italic">u û, r r,
                    l</hi> (<hi rend="italic">l</hi>); and</p>
                <p>Four diphthongs: <hi rend="italic">6 di, 6 du.</hi></p>
                <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Thirty-three consonants, viz.:—</p>
                <p>Five series of mutes and nasals:</p>
                <p>guttural: <hi rend="italic">k kh g gh n</hi> palatal: <hi rend="italic">c ch j jh
                    ñ</hi> lingual: <hi rend="italic">t th d dh n</hi> dental: <hi rend="italic">t
                    th d dh n</hi> labial: <hi rend="italic">p ph b bh m;</hi></p>
                <p>Four semivowels: <hi rend="italic">y r I v</hi> (<hi rend="italic">w</hi>);</p>
                <p>Three sibilants: palatal <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> lingual <hi rend="italic"
                    >sh</hi>, dental <hi rend="italic">s</hi>; and A soft aspirate: A.</p>
                <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Three unoriginal sounds, viz.:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">visarga</hi> (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>), a hard aspirate,
                    standing mostly for original <hi rend="italic">s</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi>; and two nasal sounds of less close contact than the mute-nasals, viz.,
                    <hi rend="italic">anusvâra</hi> (<hi rend="italic">m</hi>) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >anumâsika (m).</hi></p>
                <p>As regards the vowels, a prominent feature of the language is the prevalence of
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-sounds, these being about twice as frequent as all the
                    others, including diphthongs, taken together (Whitney).</p>
                <p>The absence of the short vowels <hi rend="italic">ě</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ǒ</hi> from the Sanskrit alphabet, and the fact that Sanskrit shows the <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>-vowel where other vowels appear in other languages,— <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., bharantam = φίροντα, ferentem; janas — ytvos, genus,—</hi>
                    were formerly considered as strong evidence in favour of the more primitive
                    state of the Sanskrit vowel system as compared with that of the sister
                    languages. Recent research has, however, shown pretty conclusively from certain
                    indications in the Sanskrit language itself that the latter must at one time
                    have possessed the same, or very nearly the same, three vowel-sounds, and that
                    the differentiation of tho original «-sound must, therefore, have taken place
                    before tho separation of the languages.</p>
                <p>The vowels <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">6,</hi> though
                    apparently simple sounds, are classed as diphthongs, being contracted from
                    original <hi rend="italic">di</hi> and <hi rend="italic">du</hi> respectively,
                    and liable to be treated as such in the phonetic modifications they have to
                    undergo before any vowel except <hi rend="italic">d.</hi></p>
                <p>As regards the consonants, two of the five series of mutes, the palatal and
                    lingual series, are of secondary (the one of Indo-Iranian, the other of purely
                    Indian) growth.</p>
                <p>The palatals are, as a rule, derived from original gutturals, the modification
                    being generally due to the influence of a neighbouring palatal sound <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> or if (a): <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g., carati</hi> = Lat. <hi rend="italic">currit; janu = yovu, genu,</hi>
                    knee. The surd aspirate cA, in words of Indo-Germanic origin, almost invariably
                    goes back to original <hi rend="italic">sk</hi>: <hi rend="italic">e.g., chid·
                    (chind-)= scindo, σχίζω</hi>; chaya = σκιά.</p>
                <p>The palatal sibilant ś (pronounced <hi rend="italic">sh)</hi> likewise originated
                    from a guttural mute <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> but one of somewhat different
                    phonetic value from that represented by Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">k</hi> or c.
                    The latter, usually designated by A* (or <hi rend="italic">q),</hi> is
                    frequently liable to labialization (or dentalization) in Greek, probably owing
                    to an original pronunciation <hi rend="italic">kw (qu): e.g., katara = ποτϵρος,
                    uter</hi>; while the former (<hi rend="italic">k</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi>) shows invariably κ in Greek, and a sibilant in the Letto-Slavic and the
                    Indo-Iranian languages: <hi rend="italic">e.g., svan (sun) = κύων</hi> (κνν),
                    <hi rend="italic">canis,</hi> Germ, <hi rend="italic">hund; daian=SeKa,
                    decern,</hi> Goth, <hi rend="italic">taihun.</hi></p>
                <p>The non-original nature of the palatals betrays itself even in Sanskrit by their
                    inability to occur at the end of a word,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> acc.
                    vacam = Lat. <hi rend="italic">vocem,</hi> but nom. <hi rend="italic">vdk =
                    vox,—</hi> and by otherwise frequently reverting to the guttural state.</p>
                <p>The linguals differ in pronunciation from the dentals in their being uttered with
                    the tip of the tongue turned up to the dome of the palate, while in the
                    utterance of the dentals it is pressed against the upper teeth, not against the
                    upper gums as is done in the English dentals, which to Hindus sound more like
                    their own linguals. The latter, when occurring in words of Aryan origin, are, as
                    a rule, modifications of original dentals, usually accompanied by the loss of an
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> or other adjoining consonant; but more commonly they
                    occur in words of foreign, probably non-Aryan, origin, of regular occurrence in
                    tho language, however, is the change of dental <hi rend="italic">n</hi> into
                    lingual <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and of dental <hi rend="italic">s</hi> into
                    lingual <hi rend="italic">sh,</hi> when preceded in the same word by certain
                    other letters.</p>
                <p>The sonant aspirate <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is likewise non-original, being
                    usually derived from original sonant aspirated mutes, especially <hi
                    rend="italic">gh: e.g., hamsa = xhv</hi> (for χανς), <hi rend="italic"
                    >anser,</hi> Germ, <hi rend="italic">gans; aham = ϵγών, ego,</hi> Goth. <hi
                    rend="italic">ik.</hi></p>
                <p>The contact of final and initial letters of words in the same sentence is often
                    attended in Sanskrit with considerable euphonic modifications; and we have no
                    means of knowing how far the practice of the vernacular language may have
                    corresponded to these phonetic theories. There can be no doubt, however, that a
                    good deal in this respect has to be placed to the account of grammatical
                    reflexion; and the very facilities which the primitive structure of the language
                    offered for grammatical analysis and an insight into the principles of internal
                    modification may have given the first impulse to external modifications of a
                    similar kind.</p>
                <p>None of the cognate languages exhibits in so transparent a manner as the Sanskrit
                    the cardinal principle of Indo-Germanic word-formation by the addition of
                    inflexional endings—either caseendings or personal terminations (themselves
                    probably original roots)—to stems obtained, mainly by means of suffixes, from
                    monosyllabic roots, with or without internal modifications.</p>
                <p>There are in Sanskrit declension three numbers and seven cases, not counting the
                    vocative, viz., nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive
                    and locative. As a matter of fact, all these seven cases appear, however, only
                    in the singular of «-stems and of the pronominal declension, other noun-stems
                    have only one case-form for the ablative and genitive singular. In the plural,
                    the ablative everywhere shares its form with the dative (except in tho personal
                    pronoun, where it has the same ending as in the singular), whilst the dual shows
                    only three different case-forms—one for the nominative and accusative, another
                    for the instrumental, dative, and ablative, and a third for the genitive and
                    locative.</p>
                <p>The declension of a-stems, corresponding to the first and second Latin
                    declensions, is of especial interest, not so much on account of its being
                    predominant from the earliest time, and becoming more and more so with the
                    development of the language, but because it presents the greatest number of
                    alternative forms, which supply a kind of test for determining the age of
                    literary productions, a test which indeed has already been applied to some
                    extent by Professor Lanman, in his excellent <hi rend="italic">Statistical
                    Account of Noun Inflexion in the Veda.</hi> These alternative case-forms are
                    :—</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">dsas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> for tho nominative
                    plural masc. and fern.: <hi rend="italic">e.g., asvasas</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">asvas = cqui (equae).</hi> The forms in <hi rend="italic"
                    >dsas,—</hi> explained by Bopp as the sign of the plural <hi rend="italic"
                    >as</hi> applied twice, and by Schleicher as the sign of the plural <hi
                    rend="italic">as</hi> added to the nominative singular,— occur to those in <hi
                    rend="italic">ds (i.e.,</hi> the ordinary plural sign <hi rend="italic">as</hi>
                    added to the a-stem) in the Rigveda in the proportion of 1 to 2, and in the
                    peculiar parts of the Atharvaveda in that of 1 to 25, whilst the ending <hi
                    rend="italic">ds</hi> alone remains in the later language.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">â</hi> and <hi rend="italic">âni</hi> for the nominative
                    and accusative plural of neuters: as <hi rend="italic">yugd, yugdni</hi> = ζυγά,
                    <hi rend="italic">juga.</hi> The proportion of the former ending to the latter
                    in the Rik is 11 to 7, in the Atharvan 2 to 3, whilst the classical Sanskrit
                    knows only the second form.</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">ebhis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dis</hi> for the
                    instrumental plural masc. and neuter: <hi rend="italic">e.g., devebhis,
                    devais.</hi> In the Rik the former forms are to the latter in the proportion of
                    5 to 6, in the Atharvan of 1 to 5, while in the later language only the
                    contracted form is used. The same contraction is found in other languages; but
                    it is doubtful whether it did not originate independently in them.</p>
                <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">â</hi> and <hi rend="italic">âu for</hi> the nominative and
                    accusative dual masc.: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">ubhd, ubhdu
                    =</hi> In the Rik forms in <hi rend="italic">â</hi> outnumber those in <hi
                    rend="italic">âu</hi> more than eight times; whilst in tho Atharvan, on the
                    contrary, those in <hi rend="italic">âu</hi> (the only ending used in the
                    classical language) occur five times as often as those in <hi rend="italic"
                    >â.</hi></p>
                <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">â</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ena (enâ)</hi> for the
                    instrumental singular masc. and neut.: as <hi rend="italic">dânâ, dânena =
                    dono.</hi> The ending <hi rend="italic">ena</hi> is the one invariably used in
                    the later language. It is likewise the usual form in the Veda; but in a number
                    of cases it shows a final long vowel which, though it may be entirely due to
                    metrical requirements, is more probably a relic of the normal instrumental
                    ending <hi rend="italic">â,</hi> preserved for prosodic reasons. For the simple
                    ending <hi rend="italic">â,</hi> as compared with that in <hi rend="italic"
                    >ena,</hi> Prof. Lanman makes out a proportion of about 1 to 9 in the Rigveda
                    (altogether 114 cases); while in the peculiar parts of the Atharvan he finds
                    only 11 cases.</p>
                <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">âin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ânám for</hi> the genitive
                    plural: <hi rend="italic">e.g., (asvâm), asvânâm = Ticiruv, equum
                    (cquorum).</hi> The form with inserted nasal (doubtless for <hi rend="italic"
                    >andm,</hi> as in Zend <hi rend="italic">aspanam),</hi> which is exclusively
                    used in the later language, is also the prevailing one in tho Rik. There are,
                    however, a few genitives of «-stems in original <hi rend="italic">dm</hi> (for
                    <hi rend="italic">a-dm),</hi> which also appear in Zend, Prof. Lanman
                    enumerating a dozen instances, some of which are, however, doubtful, while
                    others are merely conjectural.</p>
                <p>The Sanskrit verb system resembles that of the Greek in variety and completeness.
                    While the Greek excels in nicety and definiteness of modal distinction, the
                    Sanskrit surpasses it in primitiveness and transparency of formation. In this
                    part of the grammatical system there is, however, an even greater difference
                    than in the noun inflexion between the Vedic and the classical Sanskrit. While
                    the former shows, upon the whole, the full complement of modal forms exhibited
                    by the Greek, the later language has practically discarded the subjunctive mood.
                    The Indo-Aryans never succeeded in working out a clear formative distinction
                    between the subjunctive and indicative moods.; and, their syntactic requirements
                    becoming more and more limited, they at last contented themselves, for modal
                    expression, with a present optative and imperative, in addition to the
                    indicative tense-forms, and a little-used aorist optative with a special
                    “precative” or “benedictive” meaning attached to it.</p>
                <p>Another part of the verb in which the later language differs widely from Vedic
                    usage is the infinitive. The language of the old hymns shows a considerable
                    variety of case-forms of verbal abstract nouns with the function of infinitives,
                    a certain number of which<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n290/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0290-0271"/> can still be traced back to the parent language,
                    as, for instance, such dative forms as jiv-ase = viv-ere; <hi rend="italic"
                    >sah-adhyai = έχεσϴαι; dâ -</hi><hi rend="italic">mane = δόμεναι; dâ-vane =
                    δόύναι.</hi> Further, ji-she, “to conquer,” for <hi rend="italic">ji-si,</hi>
                    apparently an aorist infinitive with the dative ending (parallel to the radical
                    forms, such as <hi rend="italic">yudh-i,</hi> “to fight,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >dris'-e,</hi> “to see”), thus corresponding to the Greek aorist infinitive
                    λυσαι (but <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> also Latin <hi rend="italic">da-re,</hi>
                    for <hi rend="italic">dase, es-se,</hi> &amp;c.). The classical Sanskrit, on the
                    other hand, practically uses only one infinitive form, viz., the accusative of a
                    verbal noun in <hi rend="italic">tu, e.g., sthatum, etum,</hi> corresponding to
                    the Latin supinum <hi rend="italic">datum, Hum.</hi> But, as in Latin another
                    case, the ablative <hi rend="italic">(datu),</hi> of the same abstract noun is
                    utilized for a similar purpose, so the Vedic language makes two other cases do
                    duty as infinitives, viz., the dative in <hi rend="italic">lave (e.g.,
                    datave,</hi> and the anomalous é <hi rend="italic">tavai),</hi> and the
                    gen.-abl. in <hi rend="italic">tos (datos).</hi> A prominent featuro of the
                    later Sanskrit syntax is the so-called gerund or indeclinable participle in <hi
                    rend="italic">tvâ,</hi> apparently the instrumental of a stem in <hi
                    rend="italic">tva</hi> (probably a derivative from that in <hi rend="italic"
                    >tu),</hi> as well as the gerund in <hi rend="italic">ya</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">tya</hi> after a final short radical vowel) made from compound
                    verbs. The old language knows not only such gerunds in <hi rend="italic"
                    >tvA,</hi> using them, however, very sparingly, but also corresponding dative
                    forms in <hi rend="italic">tvâya (yuktvdya),</hi> and the curious contracted
                    forms in <hi rend="italic">tvî (kritvi,</hi> “to do ”). And, besides those in
                    <hi rend="italic">ya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tya,</hi> it frequently uses
                    forms with a final long vowel, as <hi rend="italic">bhid-yd, i-tyd,</hi> thus
                    showing the former to be shortened instrumentals of abstract nouns in <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ti.</hi></p>
                <p>The Sanskrit verb, like the Greek, has two voices, active and middle, called,
                    after their pamary functions, <hi rend="italic">parasmâi-pacla,</hi> “word for
                    another,” and <hi rend="italic">âtmane-pada,</hi> “word for one’s self.” While
                    in Greek the middle forms have to do duty also for the passive in all tenses
                    except the aorist and future, the Sanskrit, on the other hand, has developed for
                    the passive a special present-stem in <hi rend="italic">ya,</hi> the other
                    tenses being supplied by the corresponding middle forms, with the exception of
                    the third person singular aorist, for which a special form in <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> is usually assigned to the passive.</p>
                <p>The present-stem system is by far the most important part of the whole verb
                    system, both on account of frequency of actual occurrence and of its excellent
                    state of preservation. It is with regard to the different ways of present-stem
                    formation that the entire stock of assumed roots has been grouped by the native
                    grammarians under ten different classes. These classes again naturally fall
                    under two divisions or “conjugations,” with this characteristic difference that
                    the one (the second) retains the same stem (ending in <hi rend="italic">a)</hi>
                    throughout the present and imperfect, only lengthening the final vowel before
                    terminations beginning with <hi rend="italic">v</hi> or <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    (not final); while the other shows two different forms of the stem, a strong and
                    a weak form, according as the accent falls on the stem-syllable or on the
                    personal ending: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 3 sing, <hi rend="italic"
                    >bhára-ti, ϕϵρϵι—</hi> 2 pl. <hi rend="italic">bhára-tha, ϕϵρϵτϵ</hi>; but e <hi
                    rend="italic">-ti, eicri—i-tha,</hi> ire (for ίτέ); 1 sing, <hi rend="italic"
                    >strno-mi, στόρ-νυμι—</hi> 1 pl. <hi rend="italic">strnu-mas (στόρνυϵς
                    ).</hi></p>
                <p>As several of the personal endings show a decided similarity to personal or
                    demonstrative pronouns, it is highly probable that, as might indeed be <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> expected, all or most of them are of pronominal
                    origin,—though, owing to their exposed position and consequent decay, their
                    original form and identity cannot now be determined with certainty. The active
                    singular terminations, with the exception of the second person of the
                    imperative, are unaccented and of comparatively light appearance; while those of
                    the dual and plural, as well as the middle terminations, have the accent, being
                    apparently too heavy to be supported by the stem-accent, either because, as
                    Schleicher supposed, they are composed of two different pronominal elements, or
                    otherwise. The treatment of the personal endings in the first, and presumably
                    older, conjugation may thus be said somewhat to resemble that of enclitics in
                    Greek.</p>
                <p>In the imperfect, the present-stem is increased by the augment, consisting of a
                    prefixed a. Here, as in the other tenses in which it appears, it has invariably
                    the accent, as being the distinctive element (originally probably an independent
                    demonstrative adverb “then ”) for the expression of past time. This shifting of
                    the word-accent seems to have contributed to the further reduction of the
                    personal endings, and thus caused the formation of a new, or secondary, set of
                    terminations which came to be appropriated for secondary tenses and moods
                    generally. As in Greek poetry, the augment is frequently omitted in
                    Sanskrit.</p>
                <p>The mood-sign of the subjunctive is <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> added to (the
                    strong form of) the tense-stem. If the stem ends already in <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> the latter becomes lengthened. As regard the personal terminations,
                    some persons take the primary, others the secondary forms, while others again
                    may take either the one or the other. The first singular active, however, takes
                    <hi rend="italic">ni</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">mi,</hi> to distinguish
                    it from the indicative. But besides these forms, showing the mood-sign <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> the subjunctive (both present and aorist) may take another
                    form, without any distinctive modal sign, and with the secondary endings, being
                    thus identical with the augmentless form of the preterite.</p>
                <p>The optative invariably takes the secondary endings, with some peculiar
                    variations. In the active of the first conjugation, its mood-sign is <hi
                    rend="italic">yA,</hi> affixed to the weak form of the stem: <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> root <hi rend="italic">as,—</hi><hi rend="italic">syâm</hi> = Lat.
                    <hi rend="italic">siem, sîm;</hi> while in the second conjugation and throughout
                    the middle it is f, probably a contraction of <hi rend="italic">yâ: e.g., bhares
                    = ϕepois.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the ordinary perfect, made from a reduplicated stem, with distinction
                    between strong (active singular) and weak forms, and a partly peculiar set of
                    endings, the later language makes large use of a periphrastic perfect,
                    consisting of the accusative of a feminine abstract noun in <hi rend="italic">A
                    (-Am)</hi> with the reduplicated perfect forms of the auxiliary verbs <hi
                    rend="italic">kar,</hi> “to do,” or <hi rend="italic">as</hi> (and occasionally
                    bhû), “to be.” Though more particularly resorted to for the derivative forms of
                    conjugation—viz., the causative (including the so-called tenth conjugational
                    class), the desiderative, intensive, and denominative—this perfect-form is also
                    commonly used with roots beginning with prosodically long vowels, as well as
                    with a few other isolated roots. In the Rigveda this formation is quite unknown,
                    and the Atharvan offers a single instance of it, from a causative verb, with the
                    auxiliary <hi rend="italic">kar.</hi> In the Vedic prose, on the other hand, it
                    is rather frequent,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It
                    also shows occasionally other tense-forms than the perfect of the same
                    periphrastic formation with <hi rend="italic">kar.</hi></p></note> and it is
                    quite common in the later language.</p>
                <p>In addition to the ordinary participles, active and middle, of the reduplicated
                    perfect,— <hi rend="italic">e.g., jajan-van, yeyov-ds; bubudh-âná,
                    πεπυσ-μένο,—</hi> there is a secondary participial formation, obtained by
                    affixing the possessive suffix <hi rend="italic">vat (rant)</hi> to the passive
                    past participle: <hi rend="italic">e.g., krita-vant,</hi> lit. “having (that
                    which is) done.” A secondary participle of this kind occurs once in the
                    Atharvaveda, and it is occasionally met with in the Brahmanas. In the later
                    language, however, it not only is of rather frequent occurrence, but has assumed
                    quite a new function, viz., that of a finite perfect-form; thus <hi
                    rend="italic">kritavdn, kritavantas,</hi> without any auxiliary verb, mean, not
                    “having done, but “he has done,” “they have done.”</p>
                <p>The original Indo-Germanic future-stem formation in <hi rend="italic">sya,</hi>
                    with primary endings,— <hi rend="italic">e.g., dasyati = δώσει</hi> (for <hi
                    rend="italic">δώσετι),—</hi> is the ordinary tense-form both in Vedic and
                    classical Sanskrit,—a preterite of it, with a conditional force attached to it
                    <hi rend="italic">(adasyat),</hi> being also common to all periods of the
                    language.</p>
                <p>Side by side with this future, however, an analytic tense-form makes its
                    appearance in the Brahmanas, obtaining wider currency in the later language.
                    This periphrastic future is made by means of the nominative singular of a <hi
                    rend="italic">nomen agentis</hi> in <hi rend="italic">tar (datar,</hi> nom.
                    data=Lat. <hi rend="italic">dator),</hi> followed by the corresponding present
                    forms of <hi rend="italic">as,</hi> “to be” <hi rend="italic">(dâtâ-smi,</hi> as
                    it were, <hi rend="italic">daturus sum),</hi> with the exception of the third
                    persons, which need no auxiliary, but take the respective nominative of the
                    noun.</p>
                <p>The aorist system is somewhat complicated, including as it does
                    augment-preterites of various formations, viz., a radical aorist, sometimes with
                    reduplicated stem,— <hi rend="italic">e.g., ásthâm= έστην; srudhi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> = κλυθ; á</hi><hi rend="italic">dudrot;</hi> an
                    a-aorist (or thematic aorist) with or without reduplication,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g., aricas=enres; dpaptam, cf. ϵπϕνον;</hi> and several different forms of a
                    sibilant-aorist. In the older Vedic language the radical aorist is far more
                    common than the a-aorist, which becomes more frequently used later on. Of the
                    different kinds of sibilant-aorists, the most common is the one which makes its
                    stem by the addition of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> to the root, either with or
                    without a connecting vowel <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in different roots: <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> root <hi rend="italic">ji—</hi> 1 sing, <hi
                    rend="italic">djdisham,</hi> 1 pl. <hi rend="italic">Ajdishma; dkramisham,
                    dkramishma.</hi> A limited number of roots take a double aorist-sign with
                    inserted connecting vowel <hi rend="italic">(sish</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >sis),—e.g., aydsisham (cf. scrip-sis-ti);</hi> whilst others—very rarely in the
                    older but more numerously in the later language—make their aorist-stem by the
                    addition of <hi rend="italic">sa,—e.g., ádikshas= ϵδϵιξας.</hi></p>
                <p>As regards the syntactic functions of the three preterites,—the imperfect,
                    perfect, and aorist,—the classical writers make virtually no distinction between
                    them, but use them quite indiscriminately. In the older language, on the other
                    hand, the imperfect is chiefly used as a narrative tense, while the other two
                    generally refer to a past action which is now complete,—the aorist, however,
                    more frequently to that which is only just done or completed. The perfect, owing
                    doubtless to its reduplicative form, has also not infrequently the force of an
                    iterative, or intensive, present.</p>
                <p>The Sanskrit, like the Greek, shows at all times a considerable power and
                    facility of noun-composition. But, while in the older language, as well as in
                    the earlier literary products of the classical period, such combinations rarely
                    exceed the limits compatible with the general economy of inflexional speech,
                    during the later, artificial period of the language they gradually become more
                    and more excessive, both in size and frequency of use, till at last they, absorb
                    almost the entire range of syntactic construction.</p>
                <p>One of the most striking features of Sanskrit word-formation is that regular
                    interchange of light and strong vowel-sounds, usually designated by the native
                    terms of <hi rend="italic">guna</hi> (quality) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >vriddhi</hi> (increase). The phonetic process implied in these terms consists
                    in the raising, under certain conditions, of a radical or thematic light vowel
                    <hi rend="italic">i, u, r, l,</hi> by means of an inserted a-sound, to the
                    diphthongal (guna) sounds <hi rend="italic">di</hi> (Sanskr. ê <hi rend="italic"
                    >), ău</hi> (Sariskr. <hi rend="italic">ô),</hi> and the<pb break="no"

                    have <hi rend="italic">véda,</hi> “knowledge, ’ and therefrom <hi rend="italic"
                    >vâidika;</hi> from <hi rend="italic">yug, yóga, yâúgika.</hi> While the
                    interchange of the former kind, due mainly to accentual causes, was undoubtedly
                    a common feature of Indo-Germanic speech, the latter, or vriddhi-change, which
                    chiefly occurs in secondary stems, is probably a later development. Moreover,
                    there can be no doubt that the vriddhi-vowels are really due to what the term
                    implies, viz., to a process of “increment,” or vowel-raising. The same was
                    universally assumed by comparative philologists till a few years ago, as regards
                    the relation between the guna-sounds <hi rend="italic">di (8)</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ău (6)</hi> and the respective simple <hi rend="italic">i-</hi>
                    and «-sounds. According to a recent theory, however, which has already received
                    a considerable amount of acceptance, we are henceforth to look upon the heavier
                    vowels as the original, and upon the lighter vowels as the later sounds,
                    produced through the absence of stress and pitch. The grounds on which this
                    theory is recommended are those of logical consistency. In the analogous cases
                    of interchange between <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ar,</hi>
                    as well as <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and <hi rend="italic">al,</hi> most scholars
                    have indeed been wont to regard the syllabic <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> as weakened from original <hi rend="italic">ar</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">al,</hi> while the native grammarians represent the latter as
                    produced from the former by increment. Similarly the verb <hi rend="italic">as
                    (ĕs),</hi> “to be,” loses its vowel wherever the radical syllable is unaccented:
                    <hi rend="italic">c.g., dsti,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">est—smás,
                    s(u)mus</hi>; opt. <hi rend="italic">syâm,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">siēm
                    (sīm).</hi> For other analogous cases of vowel-change, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Philology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 783 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> On the strength
                    of these analogous cases of vowel-modification we are, therefore, to accept some
                    such equation as this :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ásmi: smás = δϵρκομαι: ϵδρ(α)κον = λϵίπω: λιπϵιν</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">=emi (ϵιμϵν): imás (ιμϵν for ίμϵν) =ϕϵύγω: ϕυγϵιν</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">= dóhmi</hi> (I milk): <hi rend="italic">duhmás.</hi></p>
                <p>Acquiescence in this equation would seem to involve at least one important
                    admission, viz., that original root-syllables contained no simple <hi
                    rend="italic">i-</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi>-vowels, except as the second
                    element of the diphthongs <hi rend="italic">ai, ei, oi; au, eu, ou.</hi> We
                    ought no longer to speak of the roots <hi rend="italic">vid,</hi> “to know,” <hi
                    rend="italic">dik,</hi> “to show, to bid,” <hi rend="italic">dhugh,</hi> “to
                    milk,” <hi rend="italic">yug,</hi> “to join,” but of <hi rend="italic">vcid,
                    dcik, dhaugh</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dhcugh, yeug,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, as the
                    same law would apply with equal force to suffixal vowels, the suffix <hi
                    rend="italic">nu</hi> would have to be called <hi rend="italic">nau</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">neu</hi>; and, in explaining, for instance, the irregularly formed
                    <hi rend="italic">δϵίκνυμι, δϵίκνυμϵν,</hi> we might say that, by the. affixion
                    of vev to the root δϵικ, the present-stem δικνϵύ was obtained (δικνϵυμι), which,
                    as the stress was shifted forward, became 1 plur. δικνυμϵσ(ι),—the subsequent
                    modifications in the radical and formative syllables being due to the effects of
                    “analogy” <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> G. Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Griech.
                    Gramm,.,</hi> § 487). Now, if there be any truth in the “agglutination” theory,
                    according to which the radical and formative elements of Indo-Germanic speech
                    were at one time independent words, we would have to be prepared for a pretty
                    liberal allowance, to the parent language, of diphthongal monosyllables such as
                    <hi rend="italic">dcik ned,</hi> while simple combinations such as <hi
                    rend="italic">dik nu</hi> could only spring up after separate syllable-words had
                    become united by the force of a common accent. But, whether the
                    agglutinationists be right or wrong, a thcory involving the priority of the
                    diphthongal over the simple sounds can hardly be said to be one of great <hi
                    rend="italic">prima facie</hi> probability; and one may well ask whether the
                    requirements of logical consistency might not be satisfied in some other, less
                    improbable, way.</p>
                <p>Now, the analogous cases which have called forth this theory turn upon the loss
                    of a radical or suffixal <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (ĕ), occasioned by the
                    shifting of the word-accent to some other syllable: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    acc. <hi rend="italic">mâtáram,</hi> instr. <hi rend="italic">mâtra;
                    πϵτομαι,</hi> ϵπτόμην; <hi rend="italic">δϵρκομαι</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ϵδρ(α)κον</hi>; <hi rend="italic">ásmi, smás.</hi> Might we not then assume
                    that at an early stage of noun and verb inflexion, through the giving way, under
                    certain conditions, of the stem <hi rend="italic">a (ĕ),</hi> the habit of
                    stem-gradation, as an element of inflexion, came to establish itself and
                    ultimately to extend its sphere over stems with <hi rend="italic">i-</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi>-vowels, but that, on meeting here with more
                    resistance<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We might
                    compare the different treatment in Sanskrit of <hi rend="italic">an</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> bases <hi rend="italic">(mûrdháni-mûrdhna;
                    vâdini-vâdinâ);</hi> for, though the latter are doubtless of later origin, their
                    inflexion might have been influenced by that of the former. Also a comparison of
                    such forms as <hi rend="italic">(devá) devanám, (agní) agninam,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">(dhenú) dhenúnam,</hi> tells in favour of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi>- and <hi rend="italic">u</hi>-vowels, as regards power of resistance,
                    inasmuch as it does not require the accent in order to remain intact.</p></note>
                    than in the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (ĕ)-vowel, the stem-gradation then took the
                    shape of a raising of the simple vowel, in the “strong” cases and verb-forms, by
                    that same <hi rend="italic">a-</hi> element which constituted the distinctive
                    element of those cases in the other variable stems? In this way the above
                    equation would still hold good, and the corresponding vowel-grades, though of
                    somewhat different genesis, would yet be strictly analogous.</p>
                <p>The accent of Sanskrit words is marked only in the more important Vedic texts,
                    different systems of notation being used in different works. Our knowledge of
                    the later accentuation of words is entirely derived from the statements of
                    grammarians. As in Greek, there are three accents, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >udâtta</hi> (“raised,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> acute), the <hi
                    rend="italic">anudâtta</hi> (“not raised,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> grave),
                    and the <hi rend="italic">svarita</hi> (“sounded, modulated,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> circumflex). The last is a combination of the two others, its proper
                    use being confined almost entirely to a vowel preceded by a semivowel <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> or <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> representing an original
                    acuted vowel. Hindu scholars, however, also include in this term the accent of a
                    grave syllable preceded by an acuted syllable, and itself followed by a
                    grave.</p>
                <p>The Sanskrit and Greek accentuations present numerous coincidences. Although the
                    Greek rule, confining the accent within the last three syllables, has frequently
                    obliterated the original likeness, the old features may often be traced through
                    the later forms. Thus, though augmented verb-forms in Greek cannot always have
                    the accent on the augment as in Sanskrit, they have it invariably as little
                    removed from it as the accentual restrictions will allow: <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g., ábharam, ϵϕϵρον; ábharâma, ϵϕϵρομϵν; ábharâ-mahi, ϵϕϵρόμϵθα.</hi></p>
                <p>The most striking coincidence in noun declension is the accentual distinction
                    made by both languages between the “strong” and “weak” cases of monosyllabic
                    nouns,—the only difference in this respect being that in Sanskrit the accusative
                    plural, as a rule, has the accent on the case-ending, and consequently shows the
                    weak form of the stem: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> stem <hi rend="italic">pad,
                    ποδ</hi>; <hi rend="italic">padam, πόδα</hi>; <hi rend="italic">padás,
                    ποδός</hi>; <hi rend="italic">padi, ποδí; pâdas, πόδϵς; padás,</hi> πόδας; <hi
                    rend="italic">padam, ποδών; patsú, ποσí.</hi> In Sanskrit a few other classes of
                    stems (especially present participles in <hi rend="italic">ant, at),</hi>
                    accented on the last syllable, are apt to yield their accent to heavy vowel (not
                    consonantal) terminations; compare the analogous accentuation of Sanskrit and
                    Greek stems in <hi rend="italic">tár: pitáram, πατϵρα; pitré, πατρός; pitáras,
                    πατϵρϵς; pitrshu, πατρ(ά)σι. ·</hi></p>
                <p>The vocative, when heading a sentence (or verse-division), has invariably the
                    accent on the first syllable; otherwise it is not accented.</p>
                <p>Finite verb-forms also, as a rule, lose their accent, except when standing at the
                    beginning of a sentence or verse-division (a vocative not being taken into
                    account), or in dependent (mostly relative) clauses, or in conjunction with
                    certain particles. Of two or more co-ordinate verb-forms, however, only the
                    first is unaccented.</p>
                <p>In writing Sanskrit the natives, in different parts of India, generally employ
                    the particular character used for writing their own vernacular. The character,
                    however, most widely understood and employed by Hindu scholars, and used
                    invariably in European editions of Sanskrit works (unless printed in Roman
                    letters) is the so-called <hi rend="italic">Devandgarl,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ndgari</hi> (“town’’-script) of the gods.</p>
                <p>The origin of the Indian alphabets is still enveloped in doubt. The oldest
                    hitherto known specimens of Indian writing are five rock-inscriptions,
                    containing religious edicts in Pali (the Prakrit used in the Buddhist
                    scriptures), issued by the emperor Aśoka (Piyadasi) of the Maurya dynasty, in
                    253-251 B.C., and scattered over the area of northern India from the vicinity of
                    Peshawar, on the north-west frontier, and Girnar in Guzerat, to Jaugada and
                    Dhauli in Katak, on the eastern coast. The most western of these
                    inscriptions—called, from villages near it, the Kapurdagarhi or Shâhbâz-garhi
                    inscription—is executed in a different alphabet from the others. It reads from
                    right to left, and is usually called the Arian Pali alphabet, it being also used
                    on the coins of the Greek and Indo-Scythian princes of Ariana; while the other,
                    which reads from left to right, is called the Indian Pali alphabet. The former,
                    which is manifestly derived from a Semitic (probably Aramaean) source, has left
                    no traces on the subsequent development of Indian writing. The Indo-Pali
                    alphabet, on the other hand, from which the modern Indian alphabets are derived,
                    is of uncertain origin. The similarity, however, which several of its letters
                    present to those of the old Phoenician alphabet (itself probably derived from
                    the Egyptian hieroglyphics) suggests for this alphabet also—or at least for the
                    germ of it—the probability of a Semitic origin, though, already at Aśoka’s time,
                    the Indians had worked it up to a high degree of perfection and wonderfully
                    adapted it to their peculiar scientific.ends. As to the probable time and
                    channel of its introduction, no satisfactory theory has yet been proposed.
                    Considering, however, the high state of perfection it exhibits in the Maurya and
                    Andhra inscriptions, as well as the wide area over which these are scattered, it
                    can hardly be doubted that the art of writing must have been known to and
                    practised by the Indians for various purposes long before the time of Aśoka. The
                    fact that no reference to it is found in the contemporary literature has
                    probably to be accounted for by a strong reluctance on the part of the Brahmans
                    to commit their sacred works to writing. A useful resume of the various theories
                    proposed on this subject will be found in a paper contributed by Mr R. Cust to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,</hi> new series,
                    vol. xvi.</p>
                <p>The invention of the numeral figures, which used to be generally ascribed to the
                    Indians, has also been rendered doubtful by more recent research.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0292-0273"/> The history of Sanskrit literature labours under
                    the same disadvantage as the political history of ancient India, from the total
                    want of anything like a fixed chronology. As there are extremely few
                    well-ascertained political facts until comparatively recent times, so in that
                    whole vast range of literary development there is scarcely a work of importance
                    the date of which scholars have succeeded in fixing with absolute certainty. The
                    original composition of most Sanskrit works can indeed be confidently assigned
                    to certain general periods of literature, but as to many of them, and these
                    among the most important, scholars have but too much reason to doubt whether
                    they have come down to us in their original shape, or whether they have not
                    rather, in course of time, undergone alterations and additions so serious as to
                    make it impossible to regard them as genuine witnesses of any one phase of the
                    development of the Indian mind. Nor can we expect many important chronological
                    data from the new materials which will doubtless yet be brought to light in
                    India. Though by such discoveries a few isolated spots may indeed be lighted up
                    here and there, the real task of clearing away the mist which at present
                    obscures our view, if ever it can be cleared away, will have to be performed by
                    patient research—by a more minute critical examination of the multitudinous
                    writings which have been handed down from the remote past. In the following
                    sketch it is intended to take a rapid view of the more important works and
                    writers in the several departments of literature.</p>
                <p>In accordance with the two great phases of linguistic development above referred
                    to, the history of Sanskrit literature readily divides itself into two principal
                    periods, the Vedic and the classical. It should, however, be noted that these
                    periods partly overlap each other, and that some of the later Vedic works are
                    included in that period on account of the subjects with which they deal, and for
                    their archaic style, rather than for any just claim to a higher antiquity than
                    may have to be assigned to the oldest works of the classical Sanskrit.</p>

                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">veda—i.e.,</hi> “knowledge,” (sacred) “lore ”—
                    embraces a body of writings the origin of which is ascribed to divine revelation
                    <hi rend="italic">(śruti,</hi> literally “hearing”), and which forms the
                    foundation of the Brahmanical system of religious belief. This sacred canon is
                    divided into three or (according to a later scheme) four coordinate collections,
                    likewise called Veda:—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Rig-veda,</hi> or lore of praise
                    (or hymns); (2) the <hi rend="italic">Sâma-veda,</hi> or lore of tunes (or
                    chants) <hi rend="italic">; (3)</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Yajur-veda,</hi> or
                    lore of prayer; and (4) the <hi rend="italic">Atharva-veda,</hi> or lore of the
                    Atharvans. Each of these four Vedas consists primarily of a collection <hi
                    rend="italic">(samhitâ)</hi> of sacred, mostly poetical, texts of a devotional
                    nature, called <hi rend="italic">mantra.</hi> This entire body of texts (and
                    particularly the first three collections) is also frequently referred to as the

                    case classed together with the Rik.</p>
                <p>The Brahmanical religion finds its practical expression chiefly 'in sacrificial
                    performances. The Vedic sacrifice requires for its proper performance the
                    attendance of four officiating priests, each of whom is assisted by one or more
                    (usually three) subordinate priests, viz.:—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Hotar
                    (i.e.,</hi> either “sacrificer,” or “invoker ”), whose chief business is to
                    invoke the gods, either in short prayers pronounced over the several oblations,
                    or in liturgical recitations <hi rend="italic">(sastra),</hi> made up of various
                    hymns and detached verses <hi rend="italic">; (2)</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Udgdtar, or</hi> chorister, who has to perform chants <hi rend="italic"
                    >(stotra)</hi> in connexion with the hotar’s recitations; (3) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Adhvaryu,</hi> or offering priest <hi rend="italic">par
                    excellence,</hi> who performs all the material duties of the sacrifice, such as
                    the kindling of the fires, the preparation of the sacrificial ground and the
                    offerings, the making of oblations, &amp;c.; (4) the <hi rend="italic">Brahman,
                    or</hi> chief “priest,” who has to superintend the performance and to rectify
                    any mistakes that may be committed. Now, the first three of these priests stand
                    in special relation to three of the Vedic Samhitas in this way, that the
                    Samhitas of the Samaveda and Yajurveda form special song and prayer books,
                    arranged for the practical use of the udgatar and adhvaryu respectively; whilst
                    the Rik-samhita, though not arranged for any such practical purpose, contains
                    the entire body of sacred lyrics whence the hotar draws the material for his
                    recitations. The brahman, on the other hand, had no special text-book assigned
                    to him, but was expected to be familiar with all the Samhitas as well as with
                    the practical details of the sacrificial performance. In point of fact, however,
                    the brahmans, though their attendance at Vedic sacrifices was required, can
                    scarcely be said to have formed a separate class of priests: their office was
                    probably one which might be held by any priest of the three other classes who
                    had acquired the necessary qualification by additional study of the other
                    Samhitas and manuals of ritual. In later times, when the votaries of the fourth
                    Veda pressed for recognition of their Samhita as part of the sacred canon, the
                    brahman priest was claimed by them as specially connected with the Atharvaveda.
                    It is perhaps for this reason that the latter is also called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Brahmaveda,—</hi> though this designation may also be taken to
                    mean the Veda of spells or secret doctrines <hi rend="italic">(brahman).</hi> It
                    sometimes happens that verses not found in our version of the Rik-samhita, but
                    in the Atharvaveda-samhita, are used by the hotar; but such texts, if they did
                    not actually form part of some other version of the Rik,—as Sayana in the
                    introduction to his commentary on the Rik-samhita assures us that they did,—were
                    probably inserted in the liturgy subsequent to the recognition of the fourth
                    Veda.</p>
                <p>The several Samhitas have attached to them certain theological prose works,
                    called <hi rend="italic">Brahmana,</hi> which, though subordinate in authority
                    to the Mantras or Samhitas, are like them held to be divinely revealed and to
                    form part of the canon. The chief works of this class are of an exegetic
                    nature,—their purport being to supply a dogmatic exposition of the sacrificial
                    ceremonial in so far as the particular class of priests for whose enlightenment
                    the Brahmana is intended is concerned in it. Notwithstanding the uninteresting
                    character of no small part of their contents, the Brahmanas are of considerable
                    importance, both as regards the history of Indian institutions and as “the
                    oldest body of Indo-European prose, of a generally free, vigorous, simple form,
                    affording valuable glimpses backward at the primitive condition of unfettered
                    Indo-European talk” (Whitney).</p>
                <p>More or less closely connected with the Brahmanas (and in a few exceptional cases
                    with Samhitâs) are two classes of treatises, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Âranyaka</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Upanishad.</hi> The Aranyakas, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> works “relating to the forest,” being intended to be

                    differ in character and style from the Brahmanas, but like them are chiefly
                    ritualistic, treating of special ceremonies not dealt with, or dealt with only
                    imperfectly, in the latter works, to which they thus stand in the relation of
                    supplements. The Upanishads, on the other hand, are of a purely speculative
                    nature, and must be looked upon as the first attempts at a systematic treatment
                    of metaphysical questions. The number of Upanishads hitherto known is very
                    considerable (about 170); but, though they nearly all profess to belong to the
                    Atharvaveda, they have to be assigned to very different periods of Sanskrit
                    literature,—some of them being evidently quite modern productions. The oldest
                    treatises of this kind are doubtless those which form part of Vedic Sanihitas,
                    Brahmanas, and Aranyakas, though not a few others which have no such special
                    connexion have to be classed with the later products of the Vedic age.</p>
                <p>As the sacred texts were not committed to writing till a much later period, but
                    were handed down orally in the Brahmanical schools, it was inevitable that local
                    differences of reading should spring up, which in course of time gave rise to a
                    number of independent versions, more or less differing from one another. Such
                    different text-recensions, called <hi rend="italic">sakha (i.e.,</hi> branch),
                    were at one time very numerous, but only a limited number of them have survived.
                    As regards the Samhitas, the poetical form of the hymns, as well as the concise
                    style of the sacrificial formulas, would render these texts less liable to
                    change, and the discrepancies of different versions would chiefly consist in
                    various readings of single words or in the different arrangement of the textual
                    matter. The diffuse ritualistic discussions and loosely connected legendary
                    illustrations of the Brahmanas, on the other hand, offered scope for very
                    considerable modifications in the traditional matter, either through the
                    ordinary processes of oral transmission or through the special influence of
                    individual teachers.</p>
                <p>An original Brahmana, then, may be characterized as a series of theoretic
                    discourses, composed by recognized authorities on ritualistic matters, such as
                    might be delivered or referred to in connexion with practical instruction in the
                    sacrificial art. The growing intricacy of the ceremonial, however, could not
                    fail, in course of time, to create a demand for treatises of a more practical
                    tendency, setting forth, in concise and methodical form, the duties of the
                    several priests in the sacrificial performances. But, besides the purely
                    ceremonial matter, the Brahmanas also contained a considerable amount of matter
                    bearing on the correct interpretation of the Vedic texts; and, indeed, the
                    sacred obligation incumbent on the Brahmans of handing down correctly the letter
                    and sense of those texts necessarily involved a good deal of serious grammatical
                    and etymological study in the Brahmanical schools. These literary pursuits could
                    not but result in the accumulation of much learned material, which it would
                    become more and more desirable to throw into a systematic form, serving at the
                    same time as a guide for future research. These practical requirements were met
                    by a class of treatises, grouped under six different heads or subjects, called
                    <hi rend="italic">Vedangas, i.e.,</hi> members, or limbs, of the (body of the)
                    Veda. None of the works, however, which have come down to us under this
                    designation can lay any just claim to being considered as the original treatises
                    on their several subjects; but they evidently represent a more or less advanced
                    stage of scientific development. Though a few of them are composed in metrical
                    form— especially in the ordinary epic couplet, the <hi rend="italic">anushtubh
                    śloka,</hi> consisting of two lines of sixteen syllables, or of two octosyllabic
                    padas. each—the majority of them belong to a class of writings called <hi
                    rend="italic">stitra, i.e.,</hi> “string, consisting as they do of strings of
                    rules in the shape of tersely expressed aphorisms, intended to be committed to
                    memory. The Sûtras form a connecting link between the Vedic and the classical
                    periods of literature. But, although these treatises, so far as they deal with
                    Vedic subjects, are included by the native authorities among the Vedic writings,
                    and in point of language may, generally speaking, be considered as the latest
                    products of the Vedic age, they have no share in the sacred title of <hi
                    rend="italic">sruti</hi> or revelation. They are of human, not of divine,
                    origin. And yet, as the production of men of the highest standing, and
                    profoundly versed in Vedic lore, the Sfitras are naturally regarded as works of
                    great authority, second only to that of the revealed scriptures themselves; and
                    their relation to the latter is expressed in the generic title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Smriti,</hi> or Tradition, usually applied to them.</p>
                <p>The six branches of Vedic science, included under the term Vedânga, are as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Sikshâ,</hi> or Phonetics. The privileged position of
                    representing this subject is assigned to a small treatise ascribed to the great
                    grammarian Pânini, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Pâninîyâ śikshâ,</hi> extant in
                    two different (Rik and Yajus) recensions. But neither this treatise nor any
                    other of the numerous aikshas which have recently come to light can lay claim to
                    any very high age. Scholars, however, usually include under this head certain
                    works, called <hi rend="italic">Prâtisdkhya, i.e.,</hi> “belonging to a certain
                    <hi rend="italic">śakhâ</hi> or recension,” which deal minutely with the
                    phonetic peculiarities of the several Samhitas, and are of great importance for
                    the textual criticism of the Vedic Samhitas.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Chhandas,</hi> or Metre. Tradition makes the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chhan-dah-sûtra</hi> of Pingala the starting-point of prosody. The
                    Vedic metres, however, occupy but a small part of this treatise, and they are
                    evidently dealt with in a more original manner in the Nidana-sûtra of the
                    Samaveda, and in a chapter of the Rik-pratisakhya. For profane prosody, on the
                    other hand, Pingala’s treatise is rather valuable, no less than 160 metres being
                    described by him.</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Vydkarana,</hi> or Grammar. Panini’s famous grammar is said
                    to be <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Vedânga; but it marks the culminating point of
                    grammatical research rather than the beginning, and besides treats chiefly of
                    the post-Vedic language.</p>
                <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Nirukta,</hi> or Etymology. Yâska’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nirukta</hi> is the traditional representative of this subject, and this
                    important work certainly deals entirely with Vedic etymology or explanation. It
                    consists, in the first place, of strings of words in three chapters:—(1)
                    synonymous words; (2) such as are purely or chiefly Vedic; and (3) names of
                    deities. These lists are followed by Yâska’s commentary, interspersed with
                    numerous illustrations. Yâska, again, quotes several predecessors in the same
                    branch of science; and it is probable that the original works on this subject
                    consisted merely of lists of words similar to those handed down by him.</p>
                <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Jyotisha,</hi> or Astronomy. Although astronomical
                    calculations are frequently referred to in older works in connexion with the
                    performance of sacrifices, the metrical treatise which has come down to us in
                    two different recensions under the title of Jyotisha, ascribed to one Lagadha,
                    or Lagata, seems indeed to be the oldest existing systematic treatise on
                    astronomical subjects. With the exception of some apparently spurious verses of
                    one of the recensions, it betrays no sign of the Greek influence which shows
                    itself in Hindu astronomical works from about the third century of our era; and
                    its date may therefore be set down as probably not later than the early
                    centuries after Christ.</p>
                <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">Kalpa,</hi> or Ceremonial. Tradition does not single out
                    any special work as the Vedanga in this branch of Vedic science; but the
                    sacrificial practice gave rise to a large number of systematic sfitra-manuals
                    for the several<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n294/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0294-0275"/> classes of priests. The most important of these
                    works have come down to us, and they occupy by far the most prominent place
                    among the literary productions of the sûtra-period. The Kalpa-sutras, or rules
                    of ceremonial, are of two kinds:—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Śrauta-sûtras,</hi>
                    which are based on the £ruti, and teach the performance of the great sacrifices,
                    requiring three sacrificial fires; and (2) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Smârta-sutras,</hi> or rules based on the smriti or tradition. The latter class
                    again includes two kinds of treatises:—(1) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grihya-sûtras,</hi> or domestic rules, treating of ordinary family rites, such
                    as marriage, birth, name-giving, &amp;c., connected with simple offerings in the
                    domestic fire; and (2) the <hi rend="italic">Sâmayâchârika-</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">Dharma-) sûtras,</hi> which treat of customs and temporal duties,
                    and are supposed to have formed the chief sources of the later law-books.
                    Besides, the Śrauta-sûtras of the Yajurveda have usually attached to them a set

                    which treat of the measurement by means of cords, and the construction, of
                    different kinds of altars required for sacrifices. These treatises (the study of
                    which has been successfully taken up by Prof. Thibaut of Benares) are of
                    considerable interest as supplying important information regarding the earliest
                    geometrical operations in India. Along with the Sutras may be classed a large
                    number of supplementary treatises, usually called <hi rend="italic">Pariśishta
                    (παραλιόμϵνα),</hi> on various subjects connected with the sacred texts and

                    <hi rend="italic">Rigveda-samhitâ</hi> has come down to us in the recension of
                    the Sakala school. Mention is made of several other versions; and regarding one
                    of them, that of the Bashkalas, we have some further information, according to
                    which it seems, however, to have differed but little from the Sakala text. The
                    latter consists of 1028 hymns, including eleven so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vâlakhilyas,</hi> which were probably introduced into the collection
                    subsequently to its completion. The hymns are composed in a great variety of
                    metres, and consist, on an average, of rather more than 10 verses each, or about
                    10,600 verses altogether. This body of sacred lyrics has been subdivided by
                    ancient authorities in a twofold way, viz., either from a purely artificial
                    point of view, into eight <hi rend="italic">ashtakas</hi> of about equal length,
                    or, on a more natural principle, based on the origin of the hymns, and
                    invariably adopted by European scholars, into ten books, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >mandalas, of</hi> unequal length. Tradition (not, however, always trustworthy
                    in this respect) has handed down the names of the reputed authors, or rather
                    inspired “seers” <hi rend="italic">(rishi),</hi> of most hymns. These
                    indications have enabled scholars to form some idea as to the probable way in
                    which the Rik-samhita originated, though much still remains to be cleared up by
                    future research.</p>
                <p>In the first place, mandalas ii.-vii. are evidently arranged on a uniform plan.
                    Each of them is ascribed to a different family of rishis, whence they are
                    usually called the six “family-books — ii., the Gritsamadas; iii., the
                    Visvamitras or Kusikas; iv., the Vâma-devyas; v., the Atris; vi., the
                    Bharadvajas; and vii., the Vasishthas. Further, each of these books begins with
                    the hymns addressed to Agni, the god of fire, which are followed by those to
                    Indra, the Jupiter Pluvius, whereupon follow those addressed to minor deities—
                    the Visve Devah (“all-gods ”), the Maruts (storm-gods), &amp;c. Again, the hymns
                    addressed to each deity are arranged (as Prof. Delbriick has shown) in a
                    descending order, according to the number of verses of which they consist.</p>
                <p>The first mandala, the longest in the whole Samhita, contains 191 hymns,
                    ascribed, with the exception of a few isolated ones, to sixteen poets of
                    different families. Here again the hymns of each author are arranged on
                    precisely the same principle as the</p>
                <p>“family-books.” The eighth and ninth books, on the other hand, have a special
                    character of their own. To the Siimaveda-sarphita, which, as wo shall see,
                    consists almost entirely of verses chosen from the Rik for chanting purposes,
                    these two mandalas have contributed a much larger proportion of verses than any
                    of the others. Now, the hymns of the eighth book are ascribed to a number of
                    different rishis, mostly belonging to the Kanva family. The productions of each
                    poet are usually, though not always, grouped together, but no other principle of
                    arrangement has yet been discovered. The chief peculiarity of this mandala,
                    however, consists in its metres. Many of the hymns are composed in the form of
                    stanzas, called <hi rend="italic">pragátha</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">gâ,</hi>
                    “to sing”), consisting of two verses in the <hi rend="italic">brihatî</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">satobrihatî</hi> metres; whence this book is usually known
                    under the designation of Pragathah. The other metres met with in this book are
                    likewise such as were evidently considered peculiarly adapted for singing, viz.,
                    the <hi rend="italic">gdyaM</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">gd,</hi> “to sing”) and
                    other chiefly octosyllabic metres. It is not yet clear how to account for these
                    peculiarities; but further research may perhaps show that either the Kanvas were
                    a family of udgatars, or chanters, or that, before the establishment of a common
                    system of worship for the Brahmanical community, they were accustomed to carry
                    on their liturgical service exclusively by means of chants, instead of using the
                    later form of mixed recitation and chant. One of the rishis of this family is
                    called Pragatha Kanva; possibly this surname “pragatha” may be an old, or local,
                    synonym of udgatar, or perhaps of the chief chanter, the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">Prastotar,</hi> or precentor. The ninth mandala, on the other
                    hand, consists entirely of hymns (114) addressed to <hi rend="italic">Soma,</hi>
                    the deified juice of the so-called “moon-plant” <hi rend="italic">(Sarcostemma
                    viminale,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Asclepias acida),</hi> and ascribed to poets
                    of different families. They are called <hi rend="italic">pavamdnt,</hi>
                    “purificational,” because they were to be recited by the liotar while the juice
                    expressed from the soma plants was clarifying. The first sixty of these hymns
                    are arranged strictly according to their length, ranging from ten down to four
                    verses; but as to the remaining hymns no such principle of arrangement is
                    observable, except perhaps in smaller groups of hymns. One might, therefore,
                    feel inclined to look upon that first section as the body of soma hymns set
                    apart, at the time of the first redaction of the Samhita, for the special
                    purpose of being used <hi rend="italic">as pavamdnyah,—</hi> the remaining hymns
                    having been added at subsequent redactions. It would not, however, by any means
                    follow that all, or even any, of the latter hymns were actually later
                    productions, as they might previously have formed part of the family
                    collections, or might have been overlooked when the hymns were first collected.
                    Other mandalas (viz., i., viii., and x.) still contain four entire hymns
                    addressed to Soma, consisting together of 58 verses, of which only a single one
                    (x. 25, 1) is found in the Samaveda-samliita, as also some 28 isolated verses to
                    Soma, and four hymns addressed to Soma in conjunction with some other deity,
                    which are entirely unrepresented in that collection.</p>
                <p>The tenth mandala contains the same number of hymns (191) as the first, which it
                    nearly equals in actual length. The hymns are ascribed to many rishis, of
                    various families, some of whom appear already in the preceding mandalas. The
                    traditional record is, however, less to be depended upon as regards this book,
                    many names of gods and fictitious personages appearing in the list of its
                    rishis. In the latter half of the book the hymns are clearly arranged according
                    to the number of verses, in decreasing order,— occasional exceptions to this
                    rale being easily adjusted by the removal of a few additional verses. A similar
                    arrangement seems also to suggest itself in other portions of the book. This
                    mandala stands somewhat apart from the preceding books, both its language and
                    the general character of many of its hymns betraying a comparatively modern
                    origin. In this respect it stands about on a level with the
                    Atharvaveda-samliita, with which it is otherwise closely connected. Of some 1350
                    Rik-verses found in the Atharvan, about 550, or rather more than 40 per cent.,
                    occur in the tenth mandala. In the latter we meet with the same tendencies as in
                    the Atharvan to metaphysical speculation and abstract conceptions of the deity
                    on the one hand, and ,to superstitious practices on the other. But, although in
                    its general appearance the tenth mandala is decidedly more modern than the other
                    books, it contains not a few hymns which are little, if at all, inferior, both
                    in respect of age and poetic quality, to the generality of Vedic hymns.</p>
                <p>It has become the custom, after Roth’s example, to call the Rik-samhita (as well
                    as the Atharvan) an historical collection, as compared with the Samlritas put
                    together for purely ritualistic purposes. And indeed, though the several family
                    collections which make up the earlier mandalas may originally have served ritual
                    ends, as the hymnals of certain clans or tribal confederacies, and although the
                    Saipliita itself, in its oldest form, may have been intended as a common
                    prayer-book, so to speak, for the whole of the Brahmanical community, it is
                    certain that in the stage in which it has been finally handed down it includes a
                    certain portion of hymn material (and even some secular poetry) which could
                    never have been used for purposes of religious service. It may, therefore, be
                    assumed that the Rik-samhitâ contains all of the nature of popu-<pb break="no"

                    or seemed to them worthy of being preserved. The question as to the exact period
                    when the hymns were collected cannot be answered with any approach to accuracy.
                    For many reasons, however, which cannot be detailed here, scholars have come to
                    fix on the year 1000 B.C. as an approximate date for the collection of the Vedic
                    hymns. From that time every means that human ingenuity could suggest was adopted
                    to secure the sacred texts against the risks connected with oral transmission.
                    But, as there is abundant evidence to show that even then not only had the text
                    of the hymns suffered corruption, but their language had become antiquated to a
                    considerable extent, and was only partly understood, the period during which the
                    great mass of the hymns were composed must have lain considerably further back,
                    and may very likely have extended over the earlier half of the second millenary,
                    or from about 2000 to 1500 B.C.</p>
                <p>As regards the people which raised for itself this imposing monument, the hymns
                    exhibit it as settled in the regions watered by the mighty Sindhu (Indus), with
                    its eastern and western tributaries. The land of the five rivers forms the
                    central home of the Vedic people; but, while its advanced guard has already
                    debouched upon the plains of the upper Gangâ and Yamuna, those who bring up the
                    rear are still found loitering far behind in the narrow glens of the Kubhâ
                    (Cabul) and Gomati (Gomal). Scattered over this tract of land, in hamlets and
                    villages, the Vedic Aryas are leading chiefly the life of herdsmen and
                    husbandmen. The numerous clans and tribes, ruled over by chiefs and kings, have
                    still constantly to vindicate their right to the land but lately wrung from an
                    inferior race of darker hue; just as in these latter days their kinsmen in the
                    Far West are ever on their guard against the fierce attacks of the dispossessed
                    red-skin. Not unfrequently, too, the light-coloured Aryas rage internecine war
                    with one another,—as when the Bliaratas, with allied tribes of the Panjab,
                    goaded on by the royal sage Visvamitra, invade the country of the Tritsu king
                    Sudas, to be defeated in the “ten kings’ battle,” through the inspired power of
                    the priestly singer Vasishtha. The priestly office has already become one of
                    high social importance by the side of the political rulers, and to a large
                    extent an hereditary profession; but it does not yet present the baneful
                    features of an exclusive caste. The Aryan housewife shares with her husband the
                    daily toil and joy, the privilege of worshipping the national gods, and even the
                    triumphs of song-craft, some of the finest hymns being attributed to female
                    seers.</p>
                <p>The religious belief of the people consists in a system of natural symbolism, a
                    worship of the elementary forces of nature, regarded as beings endowed with
                    reason and power superior to those of man. In giving utterance to this simple
                    belief, the priestly spokesman has, however, frequently worked into it his own
                    speculative and mystic notions. Indra, the stout-hearted ruler of the
                    cloud-region, receives by far the largest share of the devout attentions of the
                    Vedic singer. His ever-renewed battle with the malicious demons of darkness and
                    drought, for the recovery of the heavenly light and the rain-spending cows of
                    the sky, forms an inexhaustible theme of spirited song. Next to him, in the
                    affections of the people, stands Agni (ignis), the god of fire, invoked as the
                    genial inmate of the Aryan household, and as the bearer of oblations, and
                    mediator between gods and men. Indra and Agni are thus, as it were, the divine
                    representatives of the king (or chief) and the priest of the Aryan community;
                    and if, in the arrangement of the Sarnhitâ, the Brahmanical collectors gave
                    precedence to Agni, it was but one of many avowals of their own hierarchical
                    pretensions. Hence also the hymns to Indra are mostly followed, in the family
                    collections, by those addressed to the Viśve Devâh (the “all-gods”) or to the
                    JIaruts (Mavors, Mars), the warlike storm-gods and faithful companions of Indra,
                    as the divine impersonation of the Aryan freemen, the <hi rend="italic">viś</hi>
                    or clan. But, while Indra and Agni are undoubtedly the favourite figures of the
                    Vedic pantheon, there is reason to believe that these gods had but lately
                    supplanted another group of deities who play a less prominent part in the hymns,
                    viz., Father Heaven (Dyaus Pitar, Zϵύς πατήρ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> Jupiter);
                    Varuna (ουρανος), the allembracing firmament; Mitra (Zend. Mithra), the genial

                    concise in its style and more systematic in its arrangement—merits which would
                    lead one to infer that it is probably the more modern work of the two. It
                    consists of thirty chapters <hi rend="italic">(adhyâya)</hi>; while the Aitareya
                    has forty, divided into eight books (or pentads, <hi rend="italic"
                    >panchakd,</hi> of five chapters each). The last ten adhyayas of the latter work
                    are, however, clearly a later addition,—though they must have already formed
                    part of it at the time of Pânini (c. 400 B.C. ?), if, as seems probable, one of
                    his grammatical sfitras, regulating the formation of the names of Brahmanas,
                    consisting of thirty and forty adhyayas, refers to these two works. In this last
                    portion occurs the well-known legend (also found in the Śânkhâyana-sûtra, but
                    not in the Kaushitaki-brahmana) of Śunahśepa, whom his father Ajigarta sells and
                    offers to slay, the recital of which formed part of the inauguration of kings.
                    While the Aitareya deals almost exclusively with the Soma sacrifice, the
                    Kaushitaka, in its first six chapters, treats of the several kinds of <hi
                    rend="italic">haviryajna,</hi> or offerings of rice, milk, ghee, &amp;c.,
                    whereupon follows the Soma sacrifice in this way, that chapters 7-10 contain the
                    practical ceremonial and 11-30 the recitations <hi rend="italic">(śastra)</hi>
                    of the hotar. Sayana, in the introduction to his commentary on the work,
                    ascribes the Aitareya to the sage Mahidâsa Aitareya (son of Itara), also
                    mentioned elsewhere as a philosopher; and it seems likely enough that this
                    person arranged the Brahmana and founded the school of the Aitareyins. Regarding
                    the authorship of the sister work we have no information, except that the
                    opinion of the sage Kaushîtaki is frequently referred to in it as authoritative,
                    and generally in opposition to the Paingya—the Brahmana, it would seem, of a
                    rival school, the Paingins.</p>

                    Nirukta. Saunaka himself is said to have been the author of a Srauta-sfitra

                    him, alsogoes under his name, just as the Aitareya is sometimes called
                    Asvalayana-bralimana. The Śankhayana Śrauta-sûtra consists of eighteen adhyayas.

                <p>A few works remain to be noticed, bearing chiefly on the textual form and
                    traditionary records of the Rik-samhita. In our remarks on the Vedangas, the
                    Pratisakhyas have already been referred to as the chief repositories of sikslia
                    or Vedic phonetics. Among these works the <hi rend="italic"

                    18G9.</p></note> occupies the first place. The original composition of this
                    important work is ascribed to the same <hi rend="italic">Sakalya</hi> from whom
                    the vulgate recension of the (Sakala) Samhita takes its name. He is also said to
                    be the author of the existing <hi rend="italic">Pada-pâtha (i.e.,</hi> the
                    text-form in which each word is given unconnected with those that precede and
                    follow it),—which report may well be credited, since the pada-text was doubtless
                    prepared with a view to an examination, such as is presented in the
                    Prâtisâkliya, of the phonetic modifications undergone by words in their
                    syntactic combination. In the Prâtiśâkliya itself, Sâkalya’s father (or Sâkalya
                    the elder) is also several times referred to as an authority on phonetics,
                    though the younger Śâkalya is evidently regarded as having improved on his
                    father’s theories. Thus both father and son probably had a share in the
                    formulation of the rules of pronunciation and modification of Vedic sounds. The
                    completion or final arrangement of the Rik-pratisakhya, in its present, form, is
                    ascribed to Śaunaka, the reputed teacher of Asvalayana. Śaunaka, however, is
                    merely a family name (“descendant of Śunaka”), which is given even to the rishi
                    Gritsamada, to whom nearly the whole, of the second mandala of the Rik is
                    attributed. How long after Śâkalya this particular Śaunaka lived we do not know;
                    but some generations at all events would seem to lie between them, considering
                    that in the meantime the Sakalas, owing doubtless to minor differences on
                    phonetic points in the Samhitâ text, had split into several branches, to one of
                    which, the Śaiśira (or Śaiśirîya) school, Śaunaka belonged. While Śâkalya is
                    referred to both by Yaska and Panini, neither of these writers mentions Śaunaka.
                    It seems nevertheless likely, for several reasons, that Panini was acquainted
                    with Śaunaka’s work, though the point has by no means been definitively settled.
                    The Rik-prâtiśâkhya is composed in mixed slokas, or couplets of various metres,
                    a form of composition for which Śaunaka seems to have had a special
                    predilection. Besides the Prâtiśâkhya, and the Grihya-sûtra mentioned above,
                    eight other works are ascribed to Saunaka, viz., the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brihad-devatâ,</hi> an account, in epic ślokas, of the deities of the hymns,
                    which supplies much valuable mythological information; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rig-vidhâna,</hi> a treatise, likewise in epic metre, on the magic effects of
                    Vedic hymns and verses; the <hi rend="italic">Pdda-vidhâna,</hi> a similar
                    treatise, apparently no longer in existence; and five different indexes or
                    catalogues <hi rend="italic">(anukramanî)</hi> of the rishis, metres, deities,
                    sections <hi rend="italic">(anuvâka),</hi> and hymns of the Rigveda. It is,
                    however, doubtful whether the existing version of the Brihaddevata is the
                    original one; and the Rigvidhana would seem to be much more modern than
                    Saunaka’s time. As regards the Anukramanis, they seem all to have been composed
                    in mixed ślokas; but, with the exception of the Anuvâkânukramanî, they are only
                    known from quotations, having been superseded by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sarvânukrama,</hi> or complete index, of <hi rend="italic">Kâtyâyana.</hi> Both
                    these indexes have been commented upon by Shadguruśishya, towards the end of the
                    12th century of our era.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Sâma-veda.—</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">sâman,</hi> of
                    uncertain derivation, denotes a solemn tune or melody to be sung or chanted to a
                    <hi rend="italic">rich</hi> or verse. The set chants (stotra) of the Soma
                    sacrifice are as a rule performed in triplets, either actually consisting of
                    three different verses, or of two verses which, by the repetition of certain
                    parts, are made, as it were, to form three. The three verses are usually sung to
                    the same tune; but in certain cases two verses sung to the same tune had a
                    different saman enclosed between them. One and the same saman or tune may thus
                    be sung to many different verses; but, as in teaching and practising the tunes
                    the same verse was invariably used for a certain tune, the term “saman,” as well
                    as the special technical names of samans, are not unfrequently applied to the
                    verses themselves with which they were most commonly connected, just as one
                    would quote the beginning of the text of an English hymn, when the tune usually
                    sung to that hymn is meant. The Indian chant somewhat resembles the Gregorian or
                    Plain Chant.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Burnell,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ärsheyabrahmana,</hi> p. xli.</p></note> Each saman is divided

                    and <hi rend="italic">sdman</hi> or tune, the saman-liymnal consists of two
                    parts, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Sdmaveda-samhitd,</hi> or collection of texts
                    (rich) used for making up saman-hymns, and the <hi rend="italic">Gana,</hi> or
                    tune-books, song-books. The textual matter of the Samliita consists of somewhat
                    under 1600 different verses, selected from the Rik-samhita, with the exception
                    of some seventy-five verses, some of which have been taken from Khila hymns,
                    whilst others which also occur in the Atharvan or Yajurveda, as well as such not
                    otherwise found, may perhaps have formed part of some other recension of the

                    the regular ceremonial, as well as such as were perhaps no longer required but
                    had been so used at one time or other. The verses of the Purvârchika are
                    arranged on much the same plan as the family-books of the Rik-samhita, viz., in
                    three sections containing the verses addressed to Agni, Indra, and Soma <hi
                    rend="italic">(pava-mâna)</hi> respectively,—each section (consisting of one,
                    three, and one adhyâyas respectively) being again arranged according to the
                    metres. Hence this part is also called <hi rend="italic">Chhandas-</hi> (metre)
                    <hi rend="italic">drchika.</hi> Over and above this natural arrangement of the
                    two archikas, there is a purely formal division of the texts into six and nine
                    prapathakas respectively, each of which, in the first part, consists of ten
                    decades (dasat) of verses. We have two recensions of the Samhita, belonging to
                    the Ranayaniya and Kauthuma schools, and differing but slightly from each other.
                    Besides the six prapathakas (or five adhyayas) of the Purvarchika, some schools
                    have an additional “forest” chapter, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Âranyaka-samhitd,</hi> the tunes of which—along with others apparently intended
                    for being chanted by anchorites—are contained in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aranya-gdna.</hi> Besides the two tune-books belonging to the Purvarchika,
                    there are two others, the <hi rend="italic">Uha-gdna</hi> (“modification-songs
                    ”) and <hi rend="italic">Uhya-gdna,</hi> which follow the order of the
                    Uttararchika, giving the several saman-hymns chanted at the Soma sacrifice, with
                    the modifications the tunes undergo when applied to texts other than those for
                    which they were originally composed. The Saman hymnal, as it has come down to
                    us, has evidently passed through a long course of development. The practice of
                    chanting probably goes back to very early times; but the question whether any of
                    the tunes, as given in the Ganas, and which of them, can lay claim to an
                    exceptionally high antiquity will perhaps never receive a satisfactory
                    answer.</p>
                <p>The title of <hi rend="italic">Brdhmana</hi> is bestowed by the Chhandogas, or
                    followers of the Samaveda, on a considerable number of treatises. In accordance
                    with the statements of some later writers, their number was usually fixed at
                    eight; but within the last few years one new Bralimana has been recovered, while
                    at least two others which are found quoted may yet be brought to light in India.
                    The majority of the Samaveda-brahmanas present, however, none of the
                    characteristic features of other works of that class; but they are rather of the
                    nature of sutras and kindred treatises, with which they probably belong to the
                    same period of literature. Moreover, the contents of these works—as might indeed
                    be expected from the nature of the duties of the priests for whom they were
                    intended—are of an extremely arid and technical character, though they all are
                    doubtless of some importance, either for the textual criticism of the Samhita or
                    on account of the legendary and other information they supply. These works are
                    as follows: —(1) the <hi rend="italic">Tândya-mahâ-</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"

                <p>If the Sâmaveda has thus its ample share of Brâhmana-literature, though in part
                    of a somewhat questionable character, it is not less richly supplied with
                    siltra-treatises, some of which probably belong to the oldest works of that
                    class. There are three Śrauta-sûtras, which attach themselves more or less
                    closely to the Panchavimśa-brâhmana:—Masaka’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ârsheya-kalpa,</hi> which gives the beginnings of the sâmans in their
                    sacrificial order, thus supplementing the Ârsheya-brahmana, which enumerates

                    difficult passages of which it explains. Besides these, there are a

                    prosody and phonetics of the sama-texts. The more important of them are—the <hi

                    priests, divides itself into an older and a younger branch, or, as they are

                    Yajurveda to the sage Vaiśampâvana. Of his disciples three are specially named,
                    viz., Katha, Kalapin, and Yaska Paingi, the last of whom again is stated to have

                    >Kâlâpaka</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Maitrâyanî Samhitâ,</hi><note

                    &lt;fec., in <hi rend="italic">Bibt. Ind.</hi></p></note> The Kathaka and
                    Kâlapaka are frequently mentioned together; and the author of the “great
                    commentary” on Panini once remarks that these works were taught in every
                    village. The Kathas and Kâlapas are often referred to under the collective name
                    of Charakas, which apparently means “wayfarers” or itinerant scholars; but
                    according to a later writer (Hemachandra) Charaka is no other than Vaiśimpâyana
                    himself, after whom his followers would have been thus called. From the Kathas
                    proper two schools seem early to have branched off, the Prâchya- (eastern) and
                    Kapishthala-Kathas, the text-recension of the latter of whom lias recently been
                    discovered in the <hi rend="italic">Kapishthala-katha-samhitâ.</hi> The Kalapas
                    also soon became subdivided into numerous different schools. Thus from one of
                    Kalapin’s immediate disciples, Haridru, the Haridraviyas took their origin,
                    whose text-recension, the <hi rend="italic">Hâri-dravika,</hi> is quoted
                    together with the Kathaka as early as in Yaska’s Nirukta; but we do not know
                    whether it differed much from the original Kalapa texts. As regards the
                    Taittiriya-saiphita, that collection, too, in course of time gave rise to a
                    number of different schools, the text handed down being that of the Apastambas;
                    while the contents of another recension, that of the Atrcyas, are known from
                    their Anukramani, which has been preserved.</p>
                <p>The four collections of old Yajus texts, so far known to us, while differing more
                    or less considerably in arrangement and verbal points, have the main mass of
                    their textual matter in common. This common matter consists of both sacrificial
                    prayers (yajus) in verse and prose and exegetic or illustrative prose portions
                    (brahmana). A prominent feature of the old Yajus texts, as compared with the
                    other Vedas, is the constant intermixture of textual and exegetic portions. The
                    Charakas and Taittiriyas thus do not recognize the distinction between Samhita
                    and Brahmana in the sense of two separate collections of texts, but they have
                    only a Samhitâ, or collection, which includes likewise the exegetic or</p>
                <p>Brahmana portions. The Taittiriyas seem at last to have been impressed with their
                    want of a separate Brahmana and to have set about supplying the deficiency in
                    rather an awkward fashion: instead of separating from each other the textual and
                    exegetic portions of their Samhitä, they merely added to the latter a supplement
                    (in three books), which shows the same mixed condition, and applied to it the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Taittirlya-brâhmanaa.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    main body of this work is manifestly of a supplementary nature, a portion of it
                    may perhaps be old, and may once have formed part of the Samhita, considering
                    that the latter con-, sists of seven ashtakas, instead of eight, as this term
                    requires, and that certain essential parts of the ceremonial handled in the
                    Brahmana are entirely wanting in the Saiphitä. Attached to this work is the <hi

                <p>The defective arrangement of the Yajus texts was at last remedied by a different
                    school of Adhvaryus, the Väjasaneyins. The reputed originator of this school and
                    its text-recension is Yâjnavalkya Vâjasaneya (son of Väjasani). The result of
                    the rearrangement of the texts was a collection of sacrificial mantras, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vâjasaneyi-samhitâ,</hi> and a Brâhmana, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Śatapatha.</hi> On account of the greater lucidity of this arrangement, the
                    Väjasaneyins called their texts the White (or clear) Yajurveda,—the name of
                    Black (or obscure) Yajus being for opposite reasons applied to the Charaka
                    texts. Both the Samhita and Brahmana of the Väjasaneyins have come down to us in
                    two different recensions, viz., those of the <hi rend="italic">MAdhyandina</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">KAnva</hi> schools; and we find besides a considerable
                    number of quotations from a Väjasaneyaka, from which we cannot doubt that there
                    must have been at least one other recension of the Satapatha-brâhmana. The
                    difference between the two extant recensions is, on the whole, but slight as
                    regards the subject-matter; but in point of diction it is quite sufficient to
                    make a comparison especially interesting from a philological point of view.
                    Which of the two versions may be the more original cannot as yet be determined;
                    but the phonetic and grammatical differences will probably have to be accounted
                    for by a geographical separation of the two schools rather than by a difference
                    of age. In several points of difference the Känva recension agrees with the
                    practice of the Rik-samhitä, and there probably was some connexion between the
                    Yajus school of Känvas and the famous family of risliis of that name to which
                    the eighth mandala of the Rik is attributed.</p>

                    to be to point out the fruitlessness of mere works, and to insist on the
                    necessity of man’s acquiring a knowledge of the supreme spirit. The sacrificial
                    texts of the Adhvaryus consist, in about equal parts, of verses (rich) and prose
                    formulas (yajus). The majority of the former occur likewise in the Rik-samhitâ,
                    from which they were doubtless extracted. Not unfrequently, however, they show
                    considerable discrepancies of reading, which may bo explained partly from a
                    difference of recension and partly as the result of the adaptation of these
                    verses to their special sacrificial purpose. As regards the prose formulas,
                    though only a few of them are actually referred to in the Rik, it is quite
                    possible that many of them may be of high antiquity.</p>

                    first nine books of the former, corresponding to the first eleven of the Kânvas,
                    and consisting of sixty adhyâyas, form a kind of running commentary on the first
                    eighteen books of the Vâj.-Samhitâ; and it has been plausibly suggested by Prof.
                    Weber that this portion of the Brâhmana may be referred to in the Maliabhasliya
                    on Pan. iv. 2, 60, where a Satapatha and a Shashti-patha (i.e., “consisting of
                    60 paths ”) are mentioned together as objects of study, and that consequently it
                    may at one time have formed an independent work. This view is also supported by
                    the circumstance that of the remaining five books (10-14) of the Madhyandinas
                    the third is called the middle one (madhyama); while the Kanvas apply the same
                    epithet to the middlemost of the five books (12-16) preceding their last one.
                    This last book would thus seem to be treated by them as a second supplement, and
                    not without reason, as it is of the Upanishad order, and bears the special title

                    construction of fire-altars, and recognize the sage Sandilya as their chief
                    authority, Yâjnavalkya’s opinion is frequently referred to in the Satapatha as
                    authoritative. This is especially the case in the later books, part of the
                    Brihad-aranyaka being even called Yajnavalkîya-kânda. As regards the age of the
                    Satapatha, the probability is that the main body of the work is considerably
                    older than the time of Panini, but that some of its latter parts were considered
                    by Panini’s critic Kâtyâyana to be of about the same age as, or not much older
                    than, Panini. Even those portions had probably been long in existence before
                    they obtained recognition as part of the canon of the White Yajus.</p>
                <p>The contemptuous manner in which the doctrines of the Charaka-adhvaryus are
                    repeatedly animadverted upon in the Śatapatha betrays not a little of the <hi
                    rend="italic">odium theologicum</hi> on the part of the divines of the
                    Vajasaneyins towards their brethren of the older schools. Nor was their
                    animosity confined to mere literary warfare, but they seem to have striven by
                    every means to gain ascendency over their rivals. The consolidation of the
                    Brahmanical hierarchy and the institution of a common system of ritual worship,
                    which called forth the liturgical Vedic collections, were doubtless consummated
                    in the so-called Madhya-desa, or “middle country,” lying between the Sarasvati
                    and the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganga; and more especially in its western
                    part, the Kuru-kshetra, or land of the Kurus, with the adjoining territory of
                    the Panchalas, between the Yamuna and Ganga. From thence the original schools of
                    Vaidik ritualism gradually extended their sphere over the adjacent parts. The
                    Charakas seem for a long time to have held sway in the western and north-western
                    regions; while the Taittiriyas in course of time spread over the whole of the
                    peninsula south of the Narmada (Nerbudda), where their ritual has remained
                    preeminently the object of study till comparatively recent times. The
                    Vajasaneyins, on the other hand, having first gained a footing in the lands on
                    the lower Ganges, chiefly, it would seem, through the patronage of King Janaka
                    of Videha, thence gradually worked their way westwards, and eventually succeeded
                    in superseding the older schools north of the Vindhya, with the exception of
                    some isolated places where even now families of Brahmans are met with which

                    collections to be recognized as part of the sacred canon. That it is also the
                    youngest Veda is proved by its language, which, both from a lexical and a
                    grammatical point of view, marks an intermediate stage between the main body of
                    the Rik and the Brahmana period. It is not less manifest from the spirit of its
                    contents, which shows that the childlike trust of the early singer in the
                    willingness of the divine agents to comply with the earnest request of their
                    pious worshipper had passed away, and in its place had sprung up a superstitious
                    fear of a host of malevolent powers, whose baleful wrath had to be deprecated or
                    turned aside by incantations and magic contrivances. How far some lower form of
                    worship, practised by the conquered race, may have helped to bring about this
                    change of religious belief it would be idle to inquire; but it is far from
                    improbable that the hymns of the Rik reflect chiefly the religious notions of
                    the more intelligent and educated minority of the community, and that
                    superstitious practices like those disclosed by the greater part of the Atharvan
                    and a portion of the tenth book of the Rik had long obtained among the people,
                    and became the more prevalent the more the spiritual leaders of the people gave
                    themselves up to theosopliic and metaphysical speculations. Hence also verses of
                    the Atharvaveda are not unfrequently used in domestic (grihya) rites, but very
                    seldom in the Srauta ceremonial. But, even if these or such like spells and
                    incantations had long been in popular use, there can be no doubt that by the
                    time they were collected they must have adapted themselves to the modifications
                    which the vernacular language itself had undergone in the mouths of the
                    people.</p>
                <p>This body of spells and hymns is traditionally connected with two old mythic

                    some 750 different pieces, about five-sixths of which is in various metres, the
                    remaining portion being in prose. The whole mass is divided into twenty books.
                    The principle of distribution is for the most part a merely formal one, in books
                    i.-xiii. pieces of the same or about the same number of verses being placed
                    together in the same book. The next five books, xiv.- xviii., have each its own
                    special subject:—xiv. treats of marriage and sexual union; xv., in prose, of the
                    Vrâtya, or religious vagrant; xvi. consists of prose formulas of conjuration;
                    xvii. of a lengthy mystic hymn; and xviii. contains all that relates to death
                    and funeral rites. Of the last two books no account is taken in the
                    Atharva-prâtiśâkhya, and they indeed stand clearly in the relation of
                    supplements to the original collection. The eighteenth book evidently was the
                    result of a subsequent gleaning of pieces similar<pb break="no"

                    escaped the collectors’ attention; while the last book, consisting almost
                    entirely of hymns to Indra, taken from the Rik-saiphita, is nothing more than a
                    liturgical manual of the recitations and chants required at the Soma
                    sacrifice.</p>
                <p>The Atharvan has come down to us in a much less satisfactory state of
                    preservation than any of the other Samhitas, and its interpretation, which
                    offers considerable difficulties on account of numerous popular and
                    out-of-the-way expressions, has so far received comparatively little aid from
                    native sources. A commentary by the famous Vedic exegete Sayana, which has
                    lately come to light in India, may, however, be expected to throw light on some
                    obscure passages. Even more important is the discovery, some years ago, through
                    the exertions of Sir William Muir, of an entirely different recension of the
                    Atharva-sarphita, preserved in Kashmir. This new recension,<note anchored="true"

                    consists likewise of twenty books (kanda), but both in textual matter and in its
                    arrangement it differs very much from the current text. A considerable portion
                    of the latter, including unfortunately the whole of the eighteenth book, is
                    wanting; while the hymns of the nineteenth book are for the most part found also
                    in this text, though not as a separate book, but scattered over the whole
                    collection. Possibly, therefore, this recension may have formed one of the
                    sources whence the nineteenth book was compiled. The twentieth book is wanting,
                    with the exception of a few of the verses not taken from the Rik. As a set-off
                    to these shortcomings the new version offers, however, a good deal of fresh
                    matter, amounting to about one-sixth of the whole. From the Mahâbhâshya and
                    other works quoting as the beginning of the Atharva-samhitâ a verse that
                    coincides with the first verse of the sixth hymn of the current text, it has
                    long been known that at least one other recension must have existed; but owing
                    to the defective state of the Kashmir MS. it cannot be determined whether the
                    new recension (as seems likely) corresponds to the one referred to in those
                    works.</p>

                    consists of two parts, the first of which contains cosmogonic speculations,

                    Kausika is repeatedly referred to in the work on points of ceremonial doctrine.
                    Connected with this Sutra are upwards of seventy <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pariśishtas,</hi> or supplementary treatises, mostly in metrical form, on
                    various subjects bearing on the performance of grihya rites. The last sûtra-work
                    to be noticed in connexion with this Veda is the <hi rend="italic">Śaunakîyâ
                    Chaturâdhyâyikâ,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the Atharva-samhitii, so called from its consisting of four lectures (adhyâya).
                    Although Śaunaka can hardly be credited with being the actual author of the
                    work, considering that his opinion is rejected in the only rule where his name
                    appears, there is no reason to doubt that it chiefly embodies the phonetic
                    theories of that teacher, which were afterwards perfected by members of his
                    school. Whether this Śaunaka is identical with the writer of that name to whom
                    the final redaction of the Sakala-prâtiśâkhya of the Rik is ascribed is not
                    known; but it is worthy of note that on at least two points where Sakalya is
                    quoted by Panini, the Chaturâdhyayikâ seems to be referred to rather than the
                    Rik-prâtisâkhya. Śaunaka is quoted once in the Vâjasaneyi-prâtiśâkhya; and it is
                    possible that Kâtyâyana had the Chaturadhyayikâ in view, though his reference
                    does not quite tally with the respective rule of that work.</p>

                    specially attach themselves to one or other of the Saiphitas or Brahmanas of the
                    other Vedas. The Atharvana-upanishads, mostly composed in ślokas, may be roughly
                    divided into two classes, viz., those of a purely speculative or general
                    pantheistic character, treating chiefly of the nature of the supreme spirit, and
                    the means of attaining to union therewith, and those of a sectarian tendency. Of
                    the former category, a limited number —such as the Praśna, Mundaka, and
                    Mândûkya-upanishads—have probably to be assigned to the later period of Vedic
                    literature; whilst the others presuppose more or less distinctly the existence
                    of some fully developed system of philosophy, especially the Vedanta or the
                    Yoga. The sectarian Upanishads, on the other hand—identifying the supreme spirit
                    either with one of the forms of Vishnu (such as the Narayana,
                    Nrisiipha-tâpanîya, Râma-tâpanîya, Gopâla-tâpanîya), or with Siva <hi

                    post-Vedic times.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Classical Period.</hi></p>
                <p>The classical literature of India is almost entirely a product of artificial
                    growth, in the sense that its vehicle was not the language of the general body
                    of the people, but of a small and educated class. It would scarcely be possible,
                    even approximately, to fix the time when the literary idiom ceased to be
                    understood by the common people. We only know that in the 3d century B.C. there
                    existed several dialects in different parts of northern India which differed
                    considerably from the Sanskrit; and Buddhist tradition, moreover, tells us that
                    Gautama Sakyamuni himself, in the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    made use of the local dialect of Magadha (Behar) for preaching his new doctrine.
                    Not unlikely, indeed, popular dialects, differing perhaps but slightly from one
                    another, may have existed as early as the time of the Vedic hymns, when the
                    Indo-Aryans, divided into clans and tribes, occupied the Land of the Seven
                    Rivers; but such dialects must, at any rate, have sprung up after the extension
                    of the Aryan sway and language over the whole breadth of northern India. Such,
                    however, has been the case in the history of all nations; and there is no reason
                    why, even with the existence of local dialects, the literary language should not
                    have kept in touch with the people in India, as elsewhere, but for the fact that
                    from a certain time that language remained altogether stationary, allowing the
                    vernacular dialects more and more to diverge from it. Although linguistic
                    research had been successfully carried on in India for centuries, the actual
                    grammatical fixation of Sanskrit seems to have taken place about
                    contemporaneously with the first spread of Buddhism; and indeed that popular
                    religious movement undoubtedly exercised a powerful influence on the linguistic
                    development of India.</p>

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Epic Poems.—</hi> The Hindus, like the Greeks, possess two
                    great national epics, the <hi rend="italic">Pamayana</hi> and the <hi

                    “relating to Rama,” is ascribed to the poet Vâlmîki; and, allowance being made
                    for later additions here and there, the poem indeed presents the appearance of
                    being the work of an individual genius. In its present form it consists of some
                    24,000 ślokas, or 48,000 lines of sixteen syllables, divided into seven
                    books.</p>
                <p>(I.) King Daśaratha of Kosala, reigning at Ayodhya (Oudhi), has four sons born
                    him by three wives, viz., Rama, Bharata, and the twins Lakshmana and Satrughna.
                    Rama, by being able to bend an enormous bow, formerly the dreaded weapon of the
                    god Rudra, wins for a wife Sita, daughter of Janaka, king of Videha (Tirhut).
                    (II.) On his return to Ayodhya he is to be appointed heir-apparent (yuva-raja,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> juvenis rex); but Bharata’s mother persuades the
                    king to banish his eldest son for fourteen years to the wilderness, and appoint
                    her son instead. Separation from his favourite son soon breaks the king’s heart;
                    whereupon the ministers call on Bharata to assume the reins of government. He
                    refuses, however, and, betaking himself to Rama’s retreat on the Chitrakûta
                    mountain (in Bundelkhund), implores him to return; but, unable to shake Rama’s
                    resolve to complete his term of exile, he consents to take charge of the kingdom
                    in the meantime. (III.) After a ten years’ residence in the forest, Rama
                    attracts the attention of a female demon (Rakshasî); and, infuriated by the
                    rejection of her advances, and by the wounds inflicted on her by Lakshmana, who
                    keeps Rama company, she inspires her brother Ravana, demon-king of Ceylon, with
                    love for Sita, in consequence of which the latter is carried off by him to his
                    capital Lankâ. While she resolutely rejects the Rakshasa’s addresses, Rama sets
                    out with his brother to her rescue. (IV.) After numerous adventures they<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0300-0281"/> enter into an alliance with Sugrîva, king of the
                    monkeys; and, with the assistance of the monkey-general Hanumân, and Râvana’s
                    own brother Vibhîshana, they prepare to assault Lankâ. (V.) The monkeys, tearing
                    up rocks and trees, construct a passage across the straits— the so-called Adam’s
                    Bridge, still designated Rama’s Bridge in India. (VI.) Having crossed over with
                    his allies, Rama, after many hot encounters and miraculous deeds, slays the
                    demon and captures the stronghold; whereupon he places Vibhishana on the throne
                    of Lanka. To allay Rama’s misgivings as to any taint she might have incurred
                    through contact with the demon, Sita now undergoes an ordeal by fire; after
                    which they return to Ayodhya, where, after a triumphal entry, Rama is installed.
                    (VII.) In the last book—probably a later addition—Rama, seeing that the people
                    are not yet satisfied of Sita’s purity, resolves to put her away; whereupon, in
                    the forest, she falls in with Valiniki himself, and at his hermitage gives birth
                    to two sons. While growing up there, they are taught by the sage the use of the
                    bow, as well as the Vedas, and the Ramayana as far as the capture of Lanka and
                    the royal entry into Ayodhya. Ultimately Rama discovers and recognizes them by
                    their wonderful deeds and their likeness to himself, and takes his wife and sons
                    back with him.</p>

                    king, who offered to have his nephews brought up together with his own sons, of
                    whom he had a hundred, Duryodhana being the eldest. From their great-grandfather
                    Kuril both families are called <hi rend="italic">Kauravas</hi>; but for
                    distinction that name is more usually applied to the sons of Dhritarashtra,
                    while their cousins, as the younger line, are named, after their father, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pândavas.</hi> The rivalry and varying fortunes of these two
                    houses form the main plot of the great epopee. The Pându princes soon proved
                    themselves greatly superior to their cousins; and Yudhishthira, the eldest of
                    them all, was to be appointed heir-apparent. But, by his son’s advice, the king,
                    good-natured but weak, induced his nephews for a time to retire from court and
                    reside at a house where the unscrupulous Duryodhana meant to destroy them. They
                    escaped, however, and passed some time in the forest with their mother. Here
                    Draupadi, daughter of King Drupada, won by Arjuna in open contest, became the
                    wife of the five brothers. On that occasion they also met their cousin, Kunti’s
                    nephew, the famous Yâdava prince Krishna of Dvârakâ, who ever afterwards
                    remained their faithful friend and confidential adviser. Dhritarâshtra now
                    resolved to divide the kingdom between the two houses; whereupon the Pândavas
                    built for themselves the city of Indraprastha (on the site of the modern Delhi).
                    After a time of great prosperity, Yudhishthira, in a game of dice, lost
                    everything to Duryodhana, when it was settled that the Pandavas should retire to
                    the forest for twelve years, but should afterwards be restored to their kingdom
                    if they succeeded in passing an additional year in disguise, without being
                    recognized by anyone. During their forest-life they met with many adventures,
                    among which may be mentioned their encounter with King Jayadratlia of Chedi, who
                    had carried off Draupadi from their hermitage. After the twelfth year has
                    expired they leave the forest, and, assuming various disguises, take service at
                    the court of king Virata of Matsya. Here all goes well for a time till the
                    queen’s brother Kichaka, a great warrior and commander of the royal forces,
                    falls in love with</p>
                <p>Draupadi, and is slain by Bhima. The Kauravas, profiting by Kichaka’s death, now
                    invade the Matsyan kingdom, when the Pandavas side with king Virata, and there
                    ensues, on the field of Kurukshetra, a series of fierce battles, ending in the
                    annihilation of the Kauravas. Yudhishthira now at last becomes yuva-raja, and
                    eventually king,—Dhritarashtra having resigned and retired with his wife and
                    Kunti to the forest, where they soon after perish in a conflagration. Learning
                    also the death of Krishna, Yudhishthira himself at last becomes tired of life
                    and resigns his crown; and the five princes, with their faithful wife, and a dog
                    that joins them, set out for Mount Meru, to seek admission to Indra’s heaven. Οn
                    the way one by one drops off, till Yudhishthira alone, with the dog, reaches the
                    gate of heaven; but, the dog being refused admittance, the king declines
                    entering without him, when the dog turns out to be no other than the god of
                    Justice himself, having assumed that form to test Yudhishtliira’s constancy.
                    But, finding neither his wife nor his brothers in heaven, and being told that
                    they are in the nether world to expiate their sins, the king insists on sharing
                    their fate, when this, too, proves a trial, and they are all reunited to enjoy
                    perpetual bliss.</p>
                <p>Whether this story is partly based, as Lassen suggested, on historical
                    events,—perhaps a destructive war between the neighbouring tribes of the Kurus
                    and Pau-châlas,—or whether, as Dr A. Holtzmann thinks, its principal features go
                    back to Indo-Germanic times, will probably never be decided. The complete work
                    consists of upwards of 100,000 couplets,—its contents thus being nearly eight
                    times the bulk of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey</hi> combined. It is divided into eighteen books, and a supplement,
                    entitled Harivamsa, or genealogy of the god Hari (Krishna-Vishnu). In the
                    introduction, Vyasa, being about to dictate the poem, is made to say (i. 81)
                    that so far he and some of his disciples knew 8800 couplets; and further on (i.
                    101) he is said to have composed the collection relating to the Bharatas
                    (bharata-samhita), and called the <hi rend="italic">Bharatam,,</hi> which, not
                    including the episodes, consisted of 21,000 ślokas. Now, as a matter of fact,
                    the portion relating to the feud of the rival houses constitutes somewhere
                    between a fourth and a fifth of the work; and it is highly probable that this
                    portion once formed a separate poem, called the <hi rend="italic">Bhârata.</hi>
                    But, whether the former statement is to be understood as implying the existence,
                    at a still earlier time, of a yet shorter version of about one-third of the
                    present extent of the leading narrative cannot now be determined. While some of
                    the episodes are so loosely connected with the story as to be readily severed
                    from it, others are so closely interwoven with it that their removal would
                    seriously injure the very texture of the work. This, however, only shows that
                    the original poem must have undergone some kind of revision, or perhaps repeated
                    revisions. That such has indeed taken place, at the hand of Brahmans, for
                    sectarian and caste purposes, cannot be doubted.</p>
                <p>The earliest direct information regarding the existence of epic poetry in India
                    is contained in a passage of Dion Chrysostom (c. 80 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.),</hi> according to which “even among the Indians, they say, Homer’s
                    poetry is sung, having been translated by them into their own dialect and
                    tongue;” and “the Indians are well acquainted with the sufferings of Priam, the
                    lamentations and wails of Andromache and Hecuba, and the prowess of Achilles and
                    Hector.” Now, although these allusions would suit either poem, they seem on the
                    whole to correspond best to certain incidents in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahâbhârata,</hi> especially as no direct mention is made of a warlike
                    expedition to a remote island for the rescue of an abducted woman, the
                    resemblance of which to the Trojan expedition would naturally have struck a
                    Greek becoming acquainted with the general outline of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Râmâyana.</hi> Whence Dion derived his information is not known; but as many
                    leading names of the Mahabharata and even the name of the poem itself<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Viz., as an adj., apparently

                    have been current in his time (<hi rend="italic">?c.</hi> 400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> but most probable that it existed already in
                    poetical form, as undoubtedly it did at the time of Patanjali, the author of the
                    “great commentary” on Pânini <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 150 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.).</hi> The great epic is also mentioned, both as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bhârata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mahâbhârata,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grihya-sûtra</hi> of Âśvalâyana, whom Lassen supposes to have lived about 350
                    B.C. Nevertheless it must remain uncertain whether the poem was then already in
                    the form in which we now have it, at least as far as the leading story and
                    perhaps some of the episodes are concerned, a large portion of the episodical
                    matter being clearly of later origin. It cannot, however, be doubted, for many
                    reasons, that long before that time heroic song had been diligently cultivated
                    in India at the courts of princes and among Kshatriyas, the knightly order,
                    generally. In the <hi rend="italic">Mahdâhârata</hi> itself the transmission of
                    epic legend is in some way connected with the Sûtas, a social class which, in
                    the caste-system, is defined as resulting from the union of Kshatriya men with
                    Brâhmana women, and which supplied the office of charioteers and heralds, as
                    well as (along with the Magadhas) that of professional minstrels. Be this as it
                    may, there is reason to believe that, as Hellas had her <hi rend="italic"
                    >άοιδοι</hi> who sang the <hi rend="italic">κλϵα άνδρων</hi>, and Iceland her
                    skalds who recited favourite sagas, so India had from olden times her
                    professional bards, who delighted to sing the praises of kings and inspire the
                    knights with warlike feelings. But if in this way a stock of heroic poetry had
                    gradually accumulated which reflected an earlier state of society and manners,
                    we can well understand why, after the Brâhmanical order of things had been
                    definitely established, the priests should have deemed it desirable to subject
                    these traditional memorials of Kshatriya chivalry and prestige to their own
                    censorship, and adapt them to their own canons of religious and civil law. Such
                    a revision would doubtless require considerable skill and tact; and if in the
                    present version of the work much remains that seems contrary to the Brâhmanical
                    code and pretensions— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the polyandric union of
                    Draupadî and the Pându princes—the reason probably is that such legendary, or it
                    may be historical, events were too firmly rooted in the minds of the people to
                    be tampered with; and all the clerical revisers could do was to explain them
                    away as best they could. Thus the special point alluded to was represented as an
                    act of duty and filial obedience, in this way, that, when Arjuna brings home his
                    fair prize, and announces it to his mother, she, before seeing what it is, bids
                    him share it with his brothers. Nay, it has even been suggested, with some
                    plausibility, that the Brâhmanical editors have completely changed the
                    traditional relations of the leading characters of the story. For, although the
                    Pandavas and their cousin Krishna are constantly extolled as models of virtue
                    and goodness, while the Kauravas and their friend Karna—a son of the sungod,
                    born by Kunti before her marriage with Pându, and brought up secretly as the son
                    of a Sûta—are decried as monsters of depravity, these estimates of the heroes’
                    characters are not unfrequently belied by their actions,— especially the honest
                    Kama and the brave Duryodhana contrasting not unfavourably with the wily Krishna
                    and the cautious and somewhat effeminate Yudhishthira. These considerations,
                    coupled with certain peculiarities on the part of the Kauravas, suggestive of an
                    original connexion of the latter with Buddhist institutions, have led Dr
                    Holtzmann to devise an ingenious theory, viz., that the traditional stock of
                    legends was first worked up into its present shape by some Buddhist poet, and
                    that this version, showing a decided predilection for the Kuru party, as the
                    representatives of Buddhist principles, was afterwards revised in a contrary
                    sense, at the time of the</p>
                <p>Brâhmanical reaction, by votaries of Vishnu, when the Buddhist features were
                    generally modified into Śaivite tendencies, and prominence was given to the
                    divine nature of Krishna, as an incarnation of Vishnu. The chief objection to
                    this theory probably is that it would seem to make such portions as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bhagavad-gîtâ</hi> (“song of the holy one”)—the famous theosophic
                    episode in which Krishna, in lofty and highly poetical language, expounds the
                    doctrine of faith (bhakti) and claims adoration as the incarnation of the
                    supreme spirit—even more modern than many scholars may be inclined to admit as
                    at all necessary, considering that at the time of Patanjali’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahâbhâshya</hi> the Krishna worship, as was shown by Prof. Bhandarkar, had
                    already attained some degree of development. Of the purely legendary matter
                    incorporated with the leading story not a little, doubtless, is at least as old
                    as the latter itself. Some of these episodes—especially the well-known story of
                    Nala and Damayanti, and the touching legend of Sâvitrî—form themselves little
                    epic gems, of which any nation might be proud. There can be no doubt, however,
                    that this great storehouse of legendary lore has received considerable additions
                    down to comparatively recent times, and that, while its main portion is
                    considerably older, it also contains no small amount of matter which is
                    decidedly more modern than the <hi rend="italic">Râmâyana.</hi></p>
                <p>As regards the leading narrative of the <hi rend="italic">Râmâyana,</hi> while it
                    is generally supposed that the chief object which the poet had in view was to
                    depict the spread of Aryan civilization towards the south, Mr T. Wheeler has
                    tried to show that the demons of Lankâ against whom Rama’s expedition is
                    directed are intended for the Buddhists of Ceylon. Prof. Weber, moreover, from a
                    comparison of Rama’s story with cognate Buddhist legends in which the expedition
                    to Lanka is not even referred to, has endeavoured to prove that this feature,
                    having been added by Vâlmîki to the original legend, was probably derived by him
                    from some general acquaintance with the Trojan cycle of legends, the composition
                    of the poem itself being placed by the same scholar somewhere about the
                    beginning of the Christian era. Though, in the absence of positive proof, this
                    theory, however ably supported, can scarcely be assented to, it will hardly be
                    possible to put the date of the work farther back than about a century before
                    our era; while the loose connexion of certain passages in which the divine
                    character of Rama, as an avatar of Vishnu, is especially accentuated, raises a
                    strong suspicion of this feature of Rama’s nature having been introduced at a
                    later time.</p>
                <p>A remarkable feature of this poem is the great variation of its text in different
                    parts of the country, amounting in fact to several distinct recensions. The
                    so-called Gauda recension, current in Bengal, which differs most of all, has
                    been edited, with an Italian translation, by G. Gorresio; while the version
                    prevalent in western India, and published at Bombay, has been made the basis for
                    a beautiful poetical translation by Mr R. Griffith. This diversity has never
                    been explained in a quite satisfactory way; but it was probably duo to the very
                    popularity and wide oral diffusion of the poem. Yet another version of the same
                    story, with, however, many important variations of details, forms an episode of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mahâbhârata,</hi> the relation of which to Valmiki’s work
                    is still a matter of uncertainty. To characterize the Indian epics in a single
                    word though often disfigured by grotesque fancies and wild exaggerations, they
                    are yet noble works, abounding in passages of remarkable descriptive power,
                    intense pathos, and high poetic grace and beauty; and, while, as works of art,
                    they are far inferior to the Greek epics, in some respects they appeal far more
                    strongly to the romantic<pb break="no"

                    >Purânas</hi> are partly legendary partly speculative histories of the universe,
                    compiled for the purpose of promoting some special, locally prevalent form of
                    Brahmanical belief. They are sometimes styled a fifth Veda, and may indeed in a
                    certain sense be looked upon as the scriptures of Brahmanical India. The term
                    <hi rend="italic">purâna,</hi> signifying “old,” applied originally to
                    prehistoric, especially cosmogonic, legends, and then to collections of ancient
                    traditions generally. The existing works of this class, though recognizing the
                    Brahmanical doctrine of the Trimûrti, or triple manifestation of the deity (in
                    its creative, preservative, and destructive activity), are all of a sectarian
                    tendency, being intended to establish, on quasi-historic grounds, the claims of
                    some special god, or holy place, on the devotion of the people. For this purpose
                    the compilers have pressed into their service a mass of extraneous didactic
                    matter on all manner of subjects, whereby these works have become a kind of
                    popular encyclopaedias of useful knowledge. It is evident, however, from a
                    comparatively early definition given of the typical Purâna, as well as from
                    numerous coincidences of the existing works, that they are based on, or enlarged
                    from, older works of this kind, more limited in their scope, and probably of a
                    more decidedly tritheistic tendency of belief. Thus none of the Purânas, as now
                    extant, is probably much above a thousand years old, though a considerable
                    proportion of their materials is doubtless much older, and may perhaps in part
                    go back to several centuries before our era.</p>
                <p>In legendary matter the Purânas have a good deal in common with the epics,
                    especially the <hi rend="italic">Mahâbhârata,—</hi> the compilers or revisers of
                    both classes of works having evidently drawn their materials from the same
                    fluctuating mass of popular traditions. They are almost entirely composed in
                    epic couplets, and indeed in much the same easy flowing style as the epic poems,
                    to which they are, however, geatly inferior in poetic value.</p>
                <p>According to the traditional classification of these works, there are said to be
                    eighteen <hi rend="italic">(mahâ-,</hi> or great) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Purânas,</hi> and as many <hi rend="italic">Upa-purânas,</hi> or subordinate
                    Purânas. The former are by some authorities divided into three groups of six,
                    according as one or other of the three primary qualities of external
                    existence—goodness, darkness (ignorance), and passion—is supposed to prevail in
                    them, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Vishnu, Ndradiya, Bhdgavata, Garuda, Padma,
                    Varâha, — Matsya, Kûrma, Linga, Siva, Skanda, Agni,—Brahmânda, Brahma-vaivarta,
                    Mârkandeya, Bhavishya, Vâmana,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Brahma-Purânas.</hi>
                    In accordance with the nature of the several forms of the Trimurti, the first
                    two groups chiefly devote themselves to the commendation of Vishnu and Siva
                    respectively, whilst the third group, which would properly belong to Brahman,
                    has been largely appropriated for the promotion of the claims of other deities,
                    viz., Vishnu in his sensuous form of Krishna, Devi, Ganesa, and Surya. As Prof.
                    Banerjea has shown in his preface to the <hi rend="italic">M&amp;r-kandeya,</hi>
                    this seems to have been chiefly effected by later additions and interpolations.
                    The insufficiency of the above classification, however, appears from the fact
                    that it omits the <hi rend="italic">Vdyu-pur&amp;na,</hi> probably one of the
                    oldest of all, though some MSS. substitute it for one or other name of the
                    second group. The eighteen principal Puranas are said to consist of together
                    400,000 couplets. In Northern India the Vaishnava Purânas, especially the <hi

                    supposed to have been composed by Vopadeva, the grammarian, who lived in the
                    13th century. It has, however, been shown<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Râjendralâla Mitra, <hi rend="italic">Notices of Sansk.

                    and that the latter is already quoted in a work by Ballala Sena of Bengal, in
                    the lltli century.</p>
                <p>From the little we know regarding the Upa-purdnas, their character does not seem
                    to differ very much from that of the principal Puranas. One of them, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Brahmânda-purâna,</hi> contains, as an episode, the well-known <hi
                    rend="italic">Adhyâtma-Râmâyana,</hi> a kind of spiritualized version of
                    Valmiki’s poem. Besides these two classes of works there is a large number of
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">Sthala-purânas,</hi> or chronicles recounting the
                    history and merits of some holy “place” or shrine, where their recitation
                    usually forms an important part of the daily service. Of much the same nature
                    are the numerous <hi rend="italic">Mâhâtmyas</hi> (literally “relating to the
                    great spirit”), which usually profess to be sections of one or other Purana.
                    Thus the <hi rend="italic">Devî-mâhâtmya,</hi> which celebrates the victories of
                    the great goddess Durgâ over the Asuras, and is daily read at the temples of
                    that deity, forms a section, though doubtless an interpolated one, of the
                    Markandeya-purâna.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tantras,</hi> which have to be considered as a later
                    development of the sectarian Puranas, are the sacred writings of the numerous
                    <hi rend="italic">Sdktas,</hi> or worshippers of the female energy <hi
                    rend="italic">(sakti)</hi> of some god, especially the wife of Siva, in one of
                    her many forms (Parvati, Devi, Kali, Bhavânî, Durgâ, &amp;c.). This worship of a
                    female representation of the divine power appears already in some of the
                    Purânas; but in the Tantras it assumes quite a peculiar character, being largely
                    intermixed with magic performances and mystic rites, partly, it would seem, of a
                    grossly immoral nature. This class of writings does not appear to have been in
                    existence at the time of Amarasimha (6th century); but they are mentioned in
                    some of the Purfinas. They are usually in the form of a dialogue between Siva
                    and his wife. Their number is very large; but they still await a critical
                    examination at the hands of western scholars. Among the best known may be
                    mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Rudra yamala, Kulârnava, Syâmâ-rahasya,</hi> and

                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Modern Epics.—</hi> A new class of epic poems begin to make
                    their appearance about the 5th or 6th century of our era, during a period of
                    renewed literary activity which has been fitly called<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>M. Müller, <hi rend="italic">India: What can
                    it teach us?</hi> note G.</p></note> the Renaissance of Indian literature. These
                    works differ widely in character from those that had preceded them. The great
                    national epics, composed though they were in a language different from the
                    ordinary vernaculars, had at least been drawn from the living stream of popular
                    traditions, and were doubtless readily understood and enjoyed by the majority of
                    the people. The later productions, on the other hand, are of a decidedly
                    artificial character, and must necessarily have been beyond the reach of any but
                    the highly cultivated. They are, on the whole, singularly deficient in incident
                    and invention, their subject matter being almost entirely derived from the old
                    epics. Nevertheless, these works are by no means devoid of merit and interest;
                    and a number of them display considerable descriptive power and a wealth of
                    genuine poetic sentiment, though unfortunately often clothed in language that
                    deprives it of half its value. The simple heroic couplet has mostly been
                    discarded for various more or less elaborate metres; and in accordance with this
                    change of form the diction becomes gradually more complicated,—a growing taste
                    for unwieldy compounds, a jingling kind of alliteration, or rather agnomination,
                    and an abuse of similes marking the increasing artificiality of these
                    productions.</p>
                <p>The generic appellation of such works is <hi rend="italic">kâvya,</hi> which,
                    meaning “poem,” or the work of an individual poet <hi rend="italic">(kavi),</hi>
                    is already applied to the <hi rend="italic">Râmâyana.</hi> Six poems of this
                    kind are singled out by native rhetoricians as standard works, under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Mahâ-kâvya,</hi> or great poems. Two of these are ascribed
                    to the famous dramatist Kalidasa, the most prominent figure of the Indian
                    Renaissance, and truly a master of the poetic art. He is said to have been one
                    of the nine literary “gems” at the court of Vikramaditya, now generally
                    identified with King Vikramaditya Harslia of Ujjayinî (Ujjain or Oujein), who
                    reigned about the middle of the 6th century, and seems to have originated the
                    Vikramaditya era, reckoned from 56 B.C. Of the poets whose works have come

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0303-0284"/> to us Kalidasa appears to be one of the earliest;
                    but there can be little doubt that he was preceded in this as in other
                    departments of poetic composition by many lesser lights, eclipsed by the sun of
                    his fame, and forgotten. Of the six “great poems” named below the first two are
                    those attributed to Kalidasa. (1) The <hi rend="italic">Raghu-vamśa,</hi><note

                    of Raghu,” celebrates the ancestry and deeds of Rama. The work, consisting of
                    nineteen cantos, is manifestly incomplete; but hitherto no copy has been
                    discovered of the six additional cantos which are supposed to have completed it.
                    (2) The <hi rend="italic">Kumâra-sambhava</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Text and Latin transl. published by F.

                    (the war-god) Kurnara” (or Skanda), the son of Śiva and Pârvatî, consists of
                    eight cantos, the last of which has only recently been made public, being
                    usually omitted in the MSS., probably on account of its amorous character
                    rendering it unsuitable for educational purposes, for which the works of
                    Kalidasa are extensively used in India. Nine additional cantos, which were
                    published at the same time, have been proved to be spurious. Another poem of
                    this class, the <hi rend="italic">Nalodaya,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Text, with comm, and Latin transl., edited by

                    Nala,”—describing the restoration of that king, after having lost his kingdom
                    through gambling,—is wrongly ascribed to Kalidasa, being far inferior to the
                    other works, and of a much more artificial character. (3) The <hi rend="italic"

                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">Bhatti-kâvya,</hi> to distinguish it from
                    other poems (especially one by Pravarasena), likewise bearing the former title,
                    was composed for the practical purpose of illustrating the less common
                    grammatical forms and the figures of rhetoric and poetry. In its closing couplet
                    it professes to have been written at Vallabhi, under Śrîdharasena, but, several
                    princes of that name being mentioned in inscriptions as having ruled there in
                    the 6th and 7th centuries, its exact date is still uncertain. Bhatti, apparently
                    the author’s name, is usually identified with the well-known grammarian
                    Bhartrihari, whose death Prof. M. Muller, from a Chinese statement, fixes at 650
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> while others make him Bhartrihari’s son. (6) The
                    <hi rend="italic">Naishadhîya,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Naishadha-charita,</hi>
                    the life of Nala, king of Nishadha, is ascribed to Sri-Harsha (son of Hira), who
                    is supposed to have lived in the latter part of the 12th century. A small
                    portion of the simple and noble episode of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahâbhârata</hi> is here retold in highly elaborate and polished stanzas, and
                    with a degree of lasciviousness which (unless it be chiefly due to the poet’s
                    exuberance of fancy) gives a truly appalling picture of social corruption.
                    Another highly esteemed poem, the <hi rend="italic">Râghava-pândavîya,</hi>
                    composed by Kaviraja (“king of poets”),—whose date is uncertain, though some
                    scholars place him later than the 10th century,—is characteristic of the
                    trifling uses to which the poet’s art was put. The well-turned stanzas are so
                    ambiguously worded that the poem may be interpreted as relating to the leading
                    story of either the <hi rend="italic">Râmâyana</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahâbhârata.</hi></p>
                <p>A still more modern popular development of these artificial poems are the
                    numerous so-called <hi rend="italic">Champûs,</hi> being compositions of mixed
                    verse and prose. As specimens of such works may be mentioned the <hi
                    rend="italic">Champû-bhârata</hi> in twelve cantos, by Ananta Bhatta, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Champû-râmâyana</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bhoja-champû,</hi>
                    in five books, by Bhojarâja (or Vidarbharâja) Pandita, being popular abstracts
                    of the two great epics.</p>
                <p>Very similar in character to the artificial epics are the panegyrics, composed by
                    court poets in honour of their patrons. Such productions were probably very
                    numerous; but only two of any special interest are hitherto known, viz., the <hi

                    The work was composed by the Kashmirian poet Kalhana, about 1150, and was
                    afterwards continued by three successive supplements, bringing down the history
                    of Kashmir to the time of the emperor Akbar. Unfortunately the two existing
                    editions were prepared from very imperfect MS. materials; but Dr Buhler’s
                    discovery of new MSS., as well as of some of the works on which Kalhana’s poem
                    is based, ought to enable the native scholar (Prof. Bhaudarkar) who has
                    undertaken a new edition to put the text in a more satisfactory condition.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Drama.—</hi> The early history of the Indian drama is
                    enveloped in obscurity. The Hindus themselves ascribe the origin of dramatic
                    representation to the sage Bharata, who is fabled to have lived in remote
                    antiquity, and to have received this science directly from the god Brahman, by
                    whom it was extracted from the Veda. The term <hi rend="italic">bharata—(?)
                    i.e.,</hi> one who is kept, or one who sustains (a part)—also signifies “an
                    actor ”; but it is doubtful which of the two is the earlier,—the appellative use
                    of the word, or the notion of an old teacher of the dramatic art bearing that
                    name. On the other hand, there still exists an extensive work, in epic verse, on
                    rhetoric and dramaturgy, entitled <hi rend="italic">Nâtya-śâstra,</hi> and
                    ascribed to Bharata. But, though this is probably the oldest theoretic work on
                    the subject that has come down to us, it can hardly be referred to an earlier
                    period than several centuries after the Christian era. Not improbably, however,
                    this work, which presupposes a fully developed scenic art, had an origin similar
                    to that of some of the metrical law-books, which are generally supposed to be
                    popular and improved editions of older sûtra-works. We know that such treatises
                    existed at the time of Panini, as he mentions two authors of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nata-sûtras,</hi> or “rules for actors,” viz., Silalin and Krisasva. Now, the
                    words <hi rend="italic">nata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nâtya—</hi> as well as
                    <hi rend="italic">nâtaka,</hi> the common term for “drama ”—being derived from
                    the root <hi rend="italic">nat (nart)</hi> “to dance,” seem to point to a
                    pantomimic or choral origin of the dramatic art. It might appear doubtful,
                    therefore, in the absence of any clearer definition in Panini’s grammar, whether
                    the “actors’ rules” he mentions did not refer to mere pantomimic performances.
                    Fortunately, however, Patanjali, in his “great commentary,” speaks of the actor
                    as singing, and of people going “to hear the actor.” Nay, he even mentions two
                    subjects, taken from the cycle of Vishnu legends—viz., the slaying of Kamsa (by
                    Krishna) and the binding of Bali (by Vishnu)—which were represented on the stage
                    both by mimic action and declamation. Judging from these allusions, theatrical
                    entertainments in those days seem to have been very much on a level with our old
                    religious spectacles or mysteries, though there may already have been some
                    simple kinds of secular plays which Patanjali had no occasion to mention. It is
                    not, however, till some five or six centuries later that we meet with the first
                    real dramas, which mark at the same time the very culminating point of Indian
                    dramatic composition. In this, as in other departments of literature, the
                    earlier works have had to make way for later and more perfect productions; and
                    no trace now remains of the intermediate phases of development.</p>
                <p>Here, however, the problem presents itself as to whether the existing dramatic
                    literature has naturally grown out of such popular religious performances as are
                    alluded to by Patanjali, or whether some foreign influence has intervened at
                    some time or other and given a different direction to dramatic composition. The
                    question has been argued both for and against the probability of Greek
                    influence; but it must still be considered as <hi rend="italic">sub judice.</hi>
                    There are doubtless some curious points of resemblance between the Indian drama
                    and the Modern Attic (and Roman) comedy, viz., the prologue, the occasional
                    occurrence of a token of recognition, and a certain correspondence of
                    characteristic stage figures (especially the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n304/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0304-0285"/> Vidûshaka, or jocose companion of the hero,
                    presenting a certain analogy to the servus of the Roman stage, as does the Vita
                    of some plays to the Roman parasite)—for which the assumption of some
                    acquaintance with the Greek comedy on the part of the earlier Hindu writers
                    would afford a ready explanation. On the other hand, the differences between the
                    Indian and Greek plays are perhaps even greater than their coincidences, which,
                    moreover, are scarcely close enough to warrant our calling in question the
                    originality of the Hindus in this respect. Certain, however, it is that, if the
                    Indian poets were indebted to Greek playwrights for the first impulse in
                    dramatic composition, in the higher sense, they have known admirably how to
                    adapt the Hellenic muse to the national genius, and have produced a dramatic
                    literature worthy to be ranked side by side with both the classical and our own
                    romantic drama. It is to the latter especially that the general character of the
                    Indian play presents a striking resemblance, much more so than to the classical
                    drama. The Hindu dramatist has little regard for the “unities” of the classical
                    stage, though he is hardly ever guilty of extravagance in his disregard of them.
                    The dialogue is invariably carried on in prose, plentifully interspersed with
                    those neatly turned lyrical stanzas in which the Indian poet delights to depict
                    some natural scene, or some temporary physical or mental condition. The most
                    striking feature of the Hindu play, however, is the mixed nature of its
                    language. While the hero and leading male characters speak Sanskrit, women and
                    inferior male characters use various Prakrit dialects. As regards these
                    dialectic varieties, it can hardly be doubted that at the time when they were
                    first employed in this way they were local vernacular dialects; but in the
                    course of the development of the scenic art they became permanently fixed for
                    special dramatic purposes, just as the Sanskrit had, long before that time,
                    become fixed for general literary purposes. Thus it would happen that these
                    Prakrit dialects, having once become stationary, soon diverged from the spoken
                    vernaculars, until the difference between them was as great as between the
                    Sanskrit and the Prakrits. As regards the general character of the dramatic
                    Prakrits, they are somewhat more removed from the Sanskrit type than the Pali,
                    the language of the Buddhist canon, which again is in a rather more advanced
                    state than the language of the Asoka inscriptions <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 250
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> And, as the Buddhist sacred books were
                    committed to writing about 80 B.C., the state of their language is attested for
                    that period at latest; while the grammatical fixation of the scenic Prakrits has
                    probably to be referred to the early centuries of our era.</p>
                <p>The existing dramatic literature is not very extensive. The number of plays of
                    all kinds of any literary value will scarcely amount to fifty. The reason for
                    this paucity of dramatic productions doubtless is that they appealed to the
                    tastes of only a limited class of highly cultivated persons, and were in
                    consequence but seldom acted. As regards the theatrical entertainments of the
                    common people, their standard seems never to have risen much above the level of
                    the religious spectacles mentioned by Patanjali. Such at least is evidently the
                    case as regards the modern Bengâli <hi rend="italic">jâtras—</hi> described by
                    Wilson as exhibitions of some incidents in the youthful life of Krishna,
                    maintained in extempore dialogue, interspersed with popular songs—as well as the
                    similar <hi rend="italic">râsas</hi> of the western provinces, and the rough and
                    ready performances of the <hi rend="italic">bhanrs,</hi> or professional
                    buffoons. Of the religious drama Sanskrit literature offers but one example,
                    viz., the famous <hi rend="italic">Gîtagovinda,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ed., with a Latin transl., by C. Lassen;
                    Engl, transl. by E. Arnold.</p></note> composed by Jayadeva in the 12th century.
                    It is rather a mytho-lyrical poem, which, however, in the opinion of Lassen, may
                    be considered as a modern and refined specimen of the early form of dramatic
                    composition. The subject of the poem is as follows:—Krishna, while leading a
                    cowherd’s life in Vrin-davana, is in love with Radha, the milkmaid, but has been
                    faithless to her for a while. Presently, however, he returns to her</p>
                <p>“whose image has all the while lingered in his breast,” and after much earnest
                    entreaty obtains her forgiveness. The emotions appropriate to these situations
                    are expressed by the two lovers and a friend of Radha in melodious and
                    passionate stanzas of great poetic beauty. Like the Song of Solomon, the
                    Gîtagovinda, moreover, is supposed by the Hindu commentators to admit of a
                    mystic interpretation; for, “as Krishna, faithless for a time, discovers the
                    vanity of all other loves, and returns with sorrow and longing to his own
                    darling Radha, so the human soul, after a brief and frantic attachment to
                    objects of sense, burns to return to the God from whence it came”

                    toy-cart,” is by tradition placed at the head ol the existing dramas; and a
                    certain clumsiness of construction seems indeed to justify this distinction.
                    According to several stanzas in the prologue, the play was composed by a king
                    Sudraka, who is there stated to have, through Siva’s favour, recovered his
                    eyesight, and, after seeing his son as king, to have died at the ripe age of a
                    hundred years and ten days. According to the same stanzas, the piece was enacted
                    after the king’s death; but it is probable that they were added for a subsequent
                    performance. In Bana’s novel <hi rend="italic">Kâdambarî</hi> (c. 630 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> a king Śûdraka, probably the same, is represented
                    as having resided at Bidisa (Bhilsa)—some 130 miles east of Ujjayinî (Ujjain),
                    where the scene of the play is laid. Charudatta, a Brahman merchant, reduced to
                    poverty, and Vasantasenâ, an accomplished courtezan, meet and fall in love with
                    each other. This forms the main story, which is interwoven with a political
                    underplot, resulting in a change of dynasty. The connexion between the two plots
                    is effected by means of the king’s rascally brother-in-law, who pursues
                    Vasantasena with his addresses, as well as by the part of the rebellious cowherd
                    Aryaka, who, having escaped from prison, finds shelter in the hero’s house. The
                    wicked prince, on being rejected, strangles Vasantasena, and accuses Charudatta
                    of having murdered her; but, just as the latter is about to be executed, his
                    lady love appears again on the scene. Meanwhile Aryaka has succeeded in deposing
                    the king, and, having himself mounted the throne of Ujjain, he raises
                    Vasantasena to the position of an honest woman, to enable her to become the wife
                    of Charudatta. The play is one of the longest, consisting of not less than ten
                    acts, some of which, however, are very short. The interest of the action is, on
                    the whole, well sustained; and, altogether, the piece presents a vivid picture
                    of the social manners of the time.</p>
                <p>In Kalidasa (? <hi rend="italic">c..</hi> 550 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the
                    dramatic art attained its highest point of perfection. From this accomplished
                    poet we have three well-constructed plays, abounding in stanzas of exquisite
                    tenderness and fine descriptive passages, viz., the two well-known
                    mytho-pastoral dramas, <hi rend="italic">Śakuntalâ</hi> in seven and <hi

                    to be a princess by birth, and is accepted by the queens as their sister.</p>
                <p>In the prologue to this play, Kalidasa mentions Bhasa and Saumilla as his
                    predecessors in dramatic composition. Of the former poet some six or seven
                    stanzas have been gathered from anthologies by Prof. Aufrecht, who has also
                    brought to light one fine stanza ascribed to Ramila and Saumila.</p>
                <p>Sri Harslia-deva—whom Dr F. Hall has proved to be identical with King Siladitya

                    century—has three plays attributed to him. Most likely, however, he -did not
                    write any of them himself, but they were only dedicated to him as the patron of
                    their authors. Such at least seems to have been the case as regards the <hi

                    wife. She suffers shipwreck, but is rescued and received into Vatsa’s palace as

                    from each other; but, on learning the maiden’s origin, she becomes reconciled,
                    and recognizes her as a “sister.” According to H. H. Wilson, “the manners
                    depictured are not influenced by lofty principle or profound reflexion, but they
                    are mild, affectionate, and elegant. It may be doubted whether the harams of
                    other eastern nations, either in ancient or modern times, would afford materials
                    for as favourable a delineation.” Very similar in construction, but distinctly

                    Gauri (Siva’s wife). But, learning that Garuda, the mythic bird, is in the habit
                    of consuming one snake daily, he resolves to offer himself to the bird as a
                    victim, and finally succeeds in converting Garuda to the principle of ahimsâ, or
                    abstention from doing injury to living beings; but he himself is about to
                    succumb from the wounds he has received, when, through the timely intervention
                    of the goddess Gauri, he is restored to his former condition. The piece seems to
                    have been intended as a compromise between Brahmanical (Saiva) and Buddhist
                    doctrines, being thus in keeping with the religious views of king Harsha, who,
                    as we know from Hwen-tsang, favoured Buddhism, but was very tolerant to
                    Brahmans. It begins with a benedictory stanza to Buddha, and concludes with one
                    to Gauri. The author is generally believed to have been a Buddhist, but it is
                    more likely that he was a Saiva Brahman, possibly Bana himself. Nay, one might
                    almost feel inclined to take the hero’s self-sacrifice in favour of a Naga as a
                    travesty of Buddhist principles.</p>
                <p>Bhavabhûti, surnamed Srî-kantha, “whose throat is beauty (eloquence),” was a
                    native of Padmapura in the Vidarbha country (the Berars), being the son of the
                    Brahman Nilakantha, and his wife Jatukarni. He is said to have passed his
                    literary life at the court of Yasovarman of Kanauj, who is supposed to have
                    reigned in the latter part of the 7th and beginning of the 8th century.
                    Bhavabhuti was the author of three plays, two of which, the <hi rend="italic"

                    Wilson.</p></note> is a domestic drama in ten acts, representing the fortunes of
                    Madhava and Malati, the son and daughter of two ministers of neighbouring kings,
                    who from childhood have been destined for each other, but, by the resolution of
                    the maiden’s royal master to marry her to an old and ugly favourite of his, re
                    for a while threatened with permanent separation. The action of the play is full
                    of life, and abounds in stirring, though sometimes improbable, incidents. The
                    poet is considered by native pandits to be not only not inferior to Kalidasa,
                    but even to have surpassed him in his <hi rend="italic">Uttararâmacharita.</hi>
                    But, though he ranks deservedly high as a lyric poet, he is far inferior to
                    Kalidasa as a dramatic artist Whilst the latter delights in depicting the
                    gentler feelings and tender emotions of the human heart and the peaceful scenes
                    of rural life, the younger poet finds a peculiar attraction in the sterner and
                    more imposing aspects of nature and the human character. Bhavabhûti’s language,
                    though polished and felicitous, is elaborate and artificial compared with that
                    of Kalidasa, and his genius is sorely shackled by a slavish adherence to the
                    arbitrary rules of dramatic theorists.</p>
                <p>Bhatta Narayana, surnamed Mrigaraja or Simha, “the lion,” the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Venisamhâra</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Edited by J. Grill, 1871.</p></note> (“the seizing by the
                    braid of hair ”), is a poet of uncertain date. Tradition makes him one of the
                    five Kanauj Brahmans whom king Adisura of Bengal, desirous of establishing the
                    pure Vaishnava doctrine, invited to his court, and from whom the modern Bengali
                    Brahmans are supposed to be descended. The date of that event, however, is
                    itself doubtful; while a modern genealogical work fixes it at 1077, Lassen
                    refers it to the beginning of the 7th century and Grill to the latter part of
                    the 6th. If it could be proved that the poet is identical with the Narayana whom
                    Bana (c. 630) mentions as being his friend, the question would be settled in
                    favour of the earlier calculations. The play, consisting of six acts, is founded
                    on the story of the <hi rend="italic">Mahâbhârata,</hi> and takes its title from
                    the insult offered to Draupadi by one of the Kaurava princes, who, when she had
                    been lost at dice by Yudhishthira, dragged her by the hair into the assembly.
                    The piece is composed in a style similar to that of Bhavabhûti’s plays, though
                    less polished, and inferior to them in dramatic construction and poetic
                    merit.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hanuman-nâtaka</hi> is a dramatized version of the story of
                    Rama, interspersed with numerous purely descriptive poetic passages. It consists
                    of fourteen acts, and on account of its length is also called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mahâ-nâtaka,</hi> or great drama. Tradition relates that it was
                    composed by Hanuman, the monkey general, and inscribed on rocks; but, Valmiki,
                    the author of the <hi rend="italic">Râmâyana,</hi> being afraid lest it might
                    throw his own poem into the shade, Hanuman allowed him to cast his verses into
                    the sea. Thence fragments were ultimately picked up by a merchant, and brought
                    to King Bhoja, who directed the poet Damodara Miśra to put them together, and
                    fill up the lacunae; whence the present composition originated. Whatever
                    particle of truth there may be in this story, the “great drama” seems certainly
                    to be the production of different hands. “The language,” as Wilson remarks, “is
                    in general very harmonious, but the work is after all a most disjointed and
                    nondescript composition, and the patchwork is very glaringly and clumsily put
                    together.” It is nevertheless a work of some interest, as compositions of mixed
                    dramatic and declamatory passages of this kind may have been common in the early
                    stages of tho dramatic art. The connexion of the poet with King Bhoja, also
                    confirmed by the <hi rend="italic">Bhoja-prabandha,</hi> would bring the
                    composition, or final redaction, down to about the 10th or 11th century. There
                    are, however, two different recensions of the work, a shorter one commented upon
                    by Molianadasa, and a longer one arranged by Madhusûdana. A Damodara Gupta is
                    mentioned as having lived under Jayapida of Kashmir (755-86); but this can
                    scarcely be the same author.</p>

                    signet,” is a drama of political intrigue, in seven acts, partly based on
                    historical events, the plot turning on the reconciliation of Rakshasa, the
                    minister of the murdered king Nanda, with the hostile party, consisting of
                    prince Chandragupta (the Greek Sandrocottus, 315-291 B.C.), who succeeded Nanda,
                    and his minister Chanakya. The plot is developed with considerable dramatic
                    skill, in vigorous, if not particularly elegant, language. The play was composed
                    by Viśâkhadatta, prior, at any rate, to the 11th century, but perhaps as early
                    as the 7th or 8th century, as Buddhism is referred to in it in rather
                    complimentary terms.</p>

                    already alluded to the marked predilection of the mediaeval Indian poet for
                    depicting in a single stanza some peculiar physical or mental situation. The
                    profane lyrical poetry consists chiefly of such little poetic pictures, which
                    form a prominent feature of dramatic compositions. Numerous poets and poetesses
                    are only known to us through such detached stanzas, preserved in native
                    anthologies or manuals of rhetoric. Thus the <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">Sârngadhara-paddhati,</hi> another anthology, of the 14th
                    century, contains some 6000 verses culled from two hundred and sixty-four
                    different writers and works. These verses are either of a purely descriptive or
                    of an erotic character; or they have a didactic tendency, being intended to
                    convey, in an attractive and easily remembered form, some moral truth or useful
                    counsel. An excellent specimen of a longer poem, of a partly descriptive partly
                    erotic character, is Kâlidâsa’s <hi rend="italic">Megha-dûta,</hi><note

                    little masterpiece has called forth a number of more or less successful
                    imitations, such as Lakshmidasa’s <hi rend="italic">Suka-sandesa,</hi> or
                    “parrot-message,” lately edited by the maharaja of Travancore. Another much
                    admired descriptive poem by Kalidasa is the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>As regards religious lyrics, the fruit of sectarian fervour, a large collection
                    of hymns and detached stanzas, extolling some special deity, might be made from
                    Puranas and other works. Of independent productions of this kind only a few of
                    the more important can be mentioned here. Śankaracharya, the great Vedantist,
                    who probably lived in the 7th century, is credited with several devotional
                    poems, especially the <hi rend="italic">Ananda-laharî,</hi> or “wave of joy,” a
                    hymn of 103 stanzas, in praise of the goddess Parvati. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sûrya-sataka,</hi> or century of stanzas in praise of Śûrya, the sun, is
                    ascribed to Mayûra, the contemporary (and, according to a tradition, the
                    father-in-law) of Bana (in the early part of the 7 th century). The latter poet
                    himself composed the <hi rend="italic">Chandikâstotra,</hi> a hymn of 102
                    stanzas, extolling Siva’s consort. The <hi rend="italic">Khandapraśasti,</hi> a
                    poem celebrating the ten avataras of Vishnu, is ascribed to no other than
                    Hanuman, the monkey general, himself. Jayadeva’s beautiful poem <hi
                    rend="italic">Gîtagovinda,</hi> which, like most productions concerning Krishna,
                    is of a very sensuous character, has already been referred to.</p>
                <p>The particular branch of didactic poetry in which India is especially rich is
                    that of moral maxims, expressed in single stanzas or couplets, and forming the
                    chief vehicle of the <hi rend="italic">Nîti-śâstra</hi> or ethic science.
                    Excellent collections of such aphorisms have been published,—in Sanskrit and
                    German by Dr v. Böhtlingk, and in English by Dr J. Muir. Probably the oldest
                    original collection of this kind is that ascribed to Chanakya,—and entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Râjanîtisa-muchchaya, “</hi> collection on the conduct of kings
                    ”—traditionally connected with the Machiavellian minister of Chandragupta, but
                    (in its present form) doubtless much later—of which there are several
                    recensions, especially a shorter one of one hundred couplets, and a larger one
                    of some three hundred. Another old collection is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kâmandakîya-Nîtisâra,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    ascribed to Kamandaki, who is said to have been the disciple of Chanakya. Under
                    the name of Bhartrihari have been handed down three centuries of sententious
                    couplets, one of which, the <hi rend="italic">nîti-śataka,</hi> relates to
                    ethics, whilst the other two, the <hi rend="italic">sringâra-</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">vairâgya-śatakas,</hi> consist of amatory and devotional verses
                    respectively. The <hi rend="italic">Nîti-pradipa,</hi> or “lamp of conduct,”
                    consisting of sixteen stanzas, is ascribed to Vetâlabhatta who is mentioned as
                    one of nine gems at Vikramaditya’s court (c. 550 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Amarû-śataka,</hi> consisting of a hundred

                    collections of stories and fairy tales, interspersed with moral maxims, are—the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vetâla-pan-chavimśati</hi> or “twenty-five (stories) of the
                    Vetala” (the original of the Baital Pachisi), ascribed either to Jambhala Datta,
                    or to Śivadâsa (while Prof. Weber suggests that Vetâla-bhatta may have been the
                    author), and at all events older than the 12th century, since Somadeva has used
                    it; the <hi rend="italic">Śuka-saptati,</hi> or “seventy (stories related) by
                    the parrot,” the author and age of which are unknown; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simhdsana-dvâtrimśikâ,</hi> or “thirty-two (tales) of the throne,” being
                    laudatory stories regarding Vikramaditya, related by thirty-two statues,
                    standing round the old throne of that famous monarch, to King Bhoja of Dhârâ to
                    discourage him from sitting down on it. This work is ascribed to Kshemankara,
                    and was probably composed in the time of Bhoja (who died in 1053) from older
                    stories in the Maharashtra dialect. The original text has, however, undergone
                    many modifications, and is now known in several different recensions. Of about
                    the same date are two great storehouses of fairy tales, composed entirely in
                    ślokas, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Vrihat-kathâ,</hi> or “great story,” by
                    Kshemendra, also called Kshemankara, who wrote c. 1020-40, under King Ananta,

                    on her son’s death. Both these works are based on a work in the Paisâchî

                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Law</hi><hi rend="italic">(Dharma).—</hi> Among the
                    technical treatises of the later Vedic period, certain portions of the
                    Kalpa-sûtras, or manuals of ceremonial, peculiar to particular schools, were
                    referred to as the earliest attempts at a systematic treatment of law subjects.
                    These are the <hi rend="italic">Dharma-sûtras,</hi> or “rules of (religious)
                    law,” also called <hi rend="italic">Sâmayâchârika-sûtras,</hi> or “rules of
                    conventional usage (samaya-achara).” It is doubtful whether such treatises were
                    at any time quite as numerous as the Grihyasutras, or rules of domestic or
                    family rites, to which they are closely allied, and of which indeed they may
                    originally have been an outgrowth. That the number of those actually extant is
                    comparatively small is, however, chiefly due to the fact that this class of
                    works was supplanted by another of a more popular kind, which covered the same
                    ground. The Dharmasutras consist chiefly of strings of terse rules, containing
                    the essentials of the science, and intended to be committed to memory, and to be
                    expounded orally by the teacher—thus forming, as it were, epitomes of class
                    lectures. These rules are interspersed with couplets or “gathas,” in various
                    metres, either composed by the author himself or quoted from elsewhere, which
                    generally give the substance of the preceding rules. One can well understand why
                    such couplets should gradually have become more popular, and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n307/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0307-0288"/> should ultimately have led to the appearance of
                    works entirely composed in verse. Such metrical law-books did spring up in large
                    numbers, not all at once, but over a long period of time, extending probably
                    from about the beginning of our era, or even earlier, down to well-nigh the
                    Mohammedan conquest; and, as at the time of their first appearance the epic
                    impulse was particularly strong, other metres were entirely discarded for the
                    epic śloka. These works are the metrical <hi rend="italic">Dharma-śâstras,</hi>
                    or, as they are usually called, the <hi rend="italic">Smriti,</hi>
                    “recollection, tradition,”—a term which, as we have seen, belonged to the whole
                    body of Sutras (as opposed to the <hi rend="italic">Sruti,</hi> or revelation),
                    but which has become the almost exclusive title of the versified institutes of
                    law (and the few Dharmasûtras still extant). Of metrical Smritis about forty are
                    hitherto known to exist, but their total number probably amounted to at least
                    double that figure, though some of these, it is true, are but short and
                    insignificant tracts, while others arc only different recensions of one and the
                    same work.</p>
                <p>With the exception of a few of these works—such as the <hi rend="italic">Agni·,
                    Yama-,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vishnu-Smritis—</hi> which are ascribed to the
                    respective gods, the authorship of the Smritis is attributed to old rishis, such
                    as Atri, Kanva, Vyasa, Sandilya, Bharadvaja. It is, however, extremely doubtful
                    whether in most cases this attribution is not altogether fanciful, or whether,
                    as a rule, there really existed a traditional connexion between these works and
                    their alleged authors or schools named after them. The idea, which early
                    suggested itself to Sanskrit scholars, that Smritis which passed by the names of
                    old Vedic teachers and their schools might simply be metrical recasts of the
                    Dharma- (or Grihya-) sutras of these schools, was a very natural one, and,
                    indeed, is still a very probable one, though the loss of the original Sutras,
                    and the modifications and additions which the Smritis doubtless underwent in
                    course of time, make it very difficult to prove this point. One could, however,
                    scarcely account for the disappearance of the Dharmasûtras of some of the most
                    important schools except on the ground that they were given up in favour of
                    other works; and is it likely that this should have been done, unless there was
                    some guarantee that the new works, upon the whole, embodied the doctrines of the
                    old authorities of the respective schools? Thus, as regards the most important
                    of the Smritis, the <hi rend="italic">Mâmava-Dharmaiâstra,</hi><note

                    Grihya-sAtra of the MAnava school of the Black Yajus, but no such Dharmasutra
                    has hitherto been discovered, though the former existence of such a work has
                    been made all but certain by Prof. Buhler’s discovery of quotations from a
                    Mânavam, consisting partly of prose rules, and partly of couplets, some of which
                    occur literally in the Manusmriti, whilst others have been slightly altered
                    there to suit later doctrines, or have been changed from the original trishtubli
                    into the epic metre. The idea of an old law-giver Manu Svayambhuva,—“sprung from
                    the self-existent (svayam-bhu)” god Brahman,—reaches far back into Vedic
                    antiquity: he is mentioned as such in early texts; and in Yaska’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Nirukta</hi> a śloka occurs giving his opinion on a point of
                    inheritance. But whether or not the Mânava-Dharmasutra embodied what were
                    supposed to be the authoritative precepts of this sage on questions of sacred
                    law we do not know; nor can it as yet be shown that the Manusmriti, which seems
                    itself to have undergone considerable modifications, is the lineal descendant of
                    that Dharmasutra. It is, however, worthy of note that a very close connexion
                    exists between the Manusmriti and the Vishnuśâstra; and, as the latter is most
                    likely a modern, only partially remodelled, edition of the SAtras of the Black
                    Yajus school of the Kathas, the close relation between the two works would be
                    easily understood, if it could be shown that the Manusmriti is a modern
                    development of the SAtras of another school of the Charaka division of the Black
                    Yajurveda.</p>
                <p>The Manava Dharmśâstra consists of twelve books, the first and last of which,
                    treating of creation, transmigration, and final beatitude, are, however,
                    generally regarded as later additions. In them the legendary sage Bhrigu, here
                    called a Manava, is introduced as Manu’s disciple, through whom the great
                    teacher has his work promulgated. Why this intermediate agent should have been
                    considered necessary is by no means clear. Except in these two books the work
                    shows no special relation to Manu, for, though he is occasionally referred to in
                    it, the same is done in other Smritis. The question as to the probable date of
                    the final redaction of the work cannot as yet be answered. Dr Burnell has tried
                    to show that it was probably composed under the Chalukya king Pulakesi, about
                    500 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> but his argumentation is anything but
                    convincing. From several ślokas quoted from Manu by Varahamihira, in the 6th
                    century, it would appear that the text which the great astronomer had before him
                    differed very considerably from our Manusmriti. It is, however, possible that he
                    referred either to the <hi rend="italic">Briiiat-Manu</hi> (Great M.) or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vriddha-</hi><hi rend="italic">Manu</hi> (old M.), who are often
                    found quoted, and apparently represent one, if not two, larger recensions of the
                    Smriti. The oldest existing commentary on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mânava-Dharmaśâstra</hi> is by Medhatithi, who is first quoted in 1200, and is
                    usually supposed to have lived in the 9th or 10th century. He had, however,
                    several predecessors to whom he refers as <hi rend="italic">pûrve,</hi> “the
                    former ones.”</p>
                <p>Next in importance among Smritis ranks the <hi rend="italic">Yâjnavalkya
                    Dharmaśâstra.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Edited, with a German transl., by F. Stenzler.</p></note> Its origin and
                    date are not less uncertain,—except that, in the opinion of Prof. Stenzler,
                    which has never been questioned, it is based on the Manusmriti, and represents a
                    more advanced stage of legal theory and definition than that work. Yâjnvavalkya,
                    as we have seen, is looked upon as the founder of the Vajasaneyius or White
                    Yajus, and the author of the Satapatha-brahmana. In the latter work he is
                    represented as having passed some time at the court of King Janaka of Videha
                    (Tirhut); and in accordance therewith he is stated, in the introductory couplets
                    of the Dharmaśâstra, to have propounded his legal doctrines to the sages, while
                    staying at Mithilâ (the capital of Videha). Hence, if the connexion between the
                    metrical Smritis and the old Vedic schools be a real one and not one of name
                    merely, we should expect to find in the Ya-jnavalkya-smriti special coincidences
                    of doctrine with the Kâtîya-sutra, the principal Sutra of the Vajasaneyins. Now,
                    some sufficiently striking coincidences between this Smriti and Paraskara’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Kâttya-Grihyasûtra</hi> have indeed been pointed out; and if there
                    ever existed a Dharmasûtra belonging to the same school, of which no trace has
                    hitherto been found, the points of agreement between this and the Dharmaśâstra
                    might be expected to be even more numerous. As in the case of Manu, ślokas are
                    quoted in various works from a <hi rend="italic">Brihat-</hi> and a <hi
                    rend="italic">Vriddha-Yâjnavalkya.</hi> The Yâjnavalkya-smriti consists of three
                    books, corresponding to the three great divisions of the Indian theory of law
                    :—â <hi rend="italic">châra,</hi> rule of conduct (social and caste duties); <hi
                    rend="italic">vyavahâra,</hi> civil and criminal law; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >prâyaśchitta,</hi> penance or expiation. There are two important commentaries
                    on the work :—the famous <hi rend="italic">Mitâksharâ,</hi><note anchored="true"

                    half of the 14th century), who made use of Parasara’s text for the compilation
                    of a large digest of religious law, usually called <hi rend="italic"

                    Parâśara-smriti, consisting of rather less than 600 couplets, there is also
                    extant a <hi rend="italic">Brihat-Parâśarasmriti,</hi> probably an amplification
                    of the former, containing not less than 2980 (according to others even 3300)

                    the most systematic and business-like of all the Smritis. It does not concern
                    itself with religious and moral precepts, but is strictly confined to law. Of
                    this work again there are at least two different recensions. Besides the text
                    translated by Dr Jolly, a portion of a larger recension has come to light in
                    India. This version has been commented upon by Asaliaya, “the peerless ”—a very

                    these works were held to be of the highest authority as laying down the
                    principles of religious and civil duty; but it was not so much any single text
                    as the whole body of the Smriti that was looked upon as the embodiment of the
                    divine law. Hence, the moment the actual work of codification begins in the 11th
                    century, we find the jurists engaged in practically showing how the Smritis
                    confirm and supplement each other, and in reconciling seeming contradictions
                    between them. This new phase of Indian jurisprudence commences with
                    Vijnaneśvara’s <hi rend="italic">Mitâksharâ,</hi> which, though primarily a
                    commentary on Yâjnavalkya, is so rich in original matter and illustrations from
                    other Smritis that it is far more adapted to serve as a code of law than the
                    work it professes to explain. This treatise is held in high esteem all over
                    India, with the exception of the Bengal or Gaudiya school of law, which
                    recognizes as its chief authority the digest of its founder, Jîmûta-vahana,

                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Philosophy.</hi> —The Indian mind shows at all times a
                    strong disposition for metaphysical speculation. In the old religious lyrics
                    this may be detected from the very first. Not to speak of the abstract nature of
                    some even of the oldest Vedic deities, this propensity betrays itself in a
                    certain mystic symbolism, tending to refine and spiritualize the original purely
                    physical character and activity of some of the more prominent gods, and to
                    impart a deep and subtle import to the rites of the sacrifice. The primitive
                    worship of more or less isolated elementary forces and phenomena had evidently
                    ceased to satisfy the religious wants of the more thoughtful minds. Various
                    syncretist tendencies show the drift of religious thought to be towards some
                    kind of unity of the divine powers, be it in the direction of the pantheistic
                    idea, or in that of an organized polytheism, or even towards monotheism. In the
                    latter age of the hymns the pantheistic idea is rapidly gaining ground, and
                    finds vent in various cosmogonic speculations; and in the Brahmana period we see
                    it fully developed. The fundamental conception of this doctrine finds its
                    expression in the two synonymous terms <hi rend="italic">brahman</hi> (neutr.),
                    originally “power of growth,” then “devotional impulse, prayer,” and <hi
                    rend="italic">dtman</hi> (masc.), “breath, self, soul.”</p>
                <p>The recognition of the essential sameness of the individual souls, emanating all
                    alike (whether really or imaginarily) from the ultimate spiritual essence <hi
                    rend="italic">{parama-brahman}</hi> “as sparks issue from the fire,” and
                    destined to return thither, involved some important problems. Considering the
                    infinite diversity of individual souls of the animal and vegetable world,
                    exhibiting various degrees of perfection, is it conceivable that each of them is
                    the immediate efflux of the Supreme Being, the All-perfect, and that each, from
                    the lowest to the highest, could re-unite therewith directly at the close of its
                    mundane existence? The difficulty implied in the latter question was at first
                    met by the assumption of an intermediate state of expiation and purification, a
                    kind of purgatory; but the whole problem found at last a more comprehensive
                    solution in the doctrine of transmigration <hi rend="italic">{samsdra}.</hi>
                    Some scholars have suggested<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> A. E. Gough, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Philosophy of the Upanishads,</hi> p. 24.</p></note> that
                    metempsychosis may have been the prevalent belief among the aboriginal tribes of
                    India, and may have been taken over from them by the Indo-Aryans. This no doubt
                    is quite possible; but even in that case we can only assume that speculative
                    minds seized upon it as offering the most satisfactory (if not the only
                    possible) explanation of the great problem of phenomenal existence. It is
                    certainly a significant fact that, once established in Indian thought, the
                    doctrine of metempsychosis is never again called in question,—that, like the
                    fundamental idea on which it rests, viz., the essential sameness of the
                    immaterial element of all sentient beings, the notion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >samsdra</hi> has become an axiom, a universally conceded principle of Indian
                    philosophy. Thus the latter has never quite risen to the heights of pure
                    thought; its object is indeed jijnâsâ, the search for knowledge; but it is an
                    inquiry (<hi rend="italic">mîmâmsâ)</hi> into the nature of things undertaken
                    not solely for the attainment of the truth, but with a view to a specific
                    object,—the discontinuance of samsara, the cessation of mundane existence after
                    the present life. Every sentient being, through ignorance, being liable to sin,
                    and destined after each existence to be born again in some new form, dependent
                    on the actions committed during the immediately preceding life, all mundane
                    existence thus is the source of ever-renewed suffering; and the task of the
                    philosopher is to discover the means of attaining <hi rend="italic">moksha,</hi>
                    “release” from the bondage of material existence, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >yoga,</hi> “union” with the Supreme Self,—in fact, salvation. It is with a view
                    to this, and this only, that the Indian metaphysician takes up the great
                    problems of life,—the origin of man and the universe, and the relation between
                    mind and matter.</p>
                <p>It is not likely that these speculations were viewed with much favour by the
                    great body of Brahmans engaged in ritualistic practices. Not that the
                    metaphysicians actually discountenanced the ceremonial worship of the old
                    mythological gods as vain and nugatory. On the contrary, they expressly admitted
                    the propriety of sacrifices, and commended them as the most meritorious of human
                    acts, by which man could raise himself to the highest degrees of mundane
                    existence, to the worlds of the Fathers and the Devas. Nevertheless, the fact
                    that these were only higher grades from which the individual self would still be
                    liable to relapse into the vortex of material existence,—that the final goal lay
                    beyond even those worlds, unattainable through aught but a perfect knowledge of
                    the soul’s nature and its identity with the Supreme Self,—this fact of itself
                    was sufficient to depreciate the merit of the sacrificial cult, and to undermine
                    the authority of the sacred rituals. “Know ye that Self,” exhorts one of those
                    old idealists,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Mundaka-upanishad, ii. 2, 5.</p></note> “and have done with other words; for
                    that (knowledge) is the bridge to immortality !” Intense self-contemplation
                    being, moreover, the only way of attaining the all-important knowledge, this
                    doctrine left little or no room for those mediatorial offices of the priest, so
                    indispensable in ceremonial worship; and indeed we actually read of Brahman
                    sages resorting to Kshatriya princes to hear them expound this, the true
                    doctrine of salvation. But, in spite of their anti-hierarchical tendency, these
                    speculations continued to gain ground; and in the end the body of treatises
                    propounding the pantheistic doctrine, the Upanishads, were admitted into the
                    sacred canon, as appendages to the ceremonial writings, the Brahmanas. The
                    Upanishads thus form literally “the end of the Veda,” the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vedânta</hi>; but their adherents claim this title for their doctrines in a
                    metaphorical rather than in a material sense, as “the ultimate aim and
                    consummation of the Veda.” In later times the radical distinction between these
                    speculative appendages and the bulk of the Vedic writings was strongly
                    accentuated in a new classification of the sacred scriptures. According to this
                    scheme they were supposed to consist of two great divisions, —the <hi
                    rend="italic">Karma-kânda, i.e.,</hi> “the work-section,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >or</hi> practical ceremonial (exoteric) part, consisting of the Samhitas and
                    Brahmanas (including the ritual portions of the Aranyakas), and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jnâna-kdnda,</hi> “the knowledge-section,” or speculative
                    (esoteric) part. These two divisions are also called respectively the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pûrva-</hi> (“former”) and <hi rend="italic">Uttara-</hi>
                    (“latter,” or higher<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Mundaka-upanishad, i. 4, 5, where these two divisions are
                    called “the lower <hi rend="italic">(apara)</hi> and the higher <hi
                    rend="italic">(para)</hi> knowledge.”</p></note>) <hi rend="italic">kdnda·,</hi>
                    and when the speculative tenets of the Upanishads came to be formulated into a
                    regular system it was deemed desirable that there should also be a special
                    system corresponding to the older and larger portion of the Vedic writings. Thus
                    arose the two systems—the <hi rend="italic">Pûrva-</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Karma-) mîmâmsâ,</hi> or “former (practical) speculation,” and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Uttara-</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Brahma-) mimdmsd,</hi> usually
                    called the Vedanta philosophy.</p>
                <p>It is not yet possible to determine, even approximately, the time when the
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">Darsanas</hi> (literally “demonstrations”), or
                    systems of philosophy, were first formulated. And, though they have certainly
                    developed from the tenets enunciated in the Upanishads, there is considerable
                    doubt as to the exact order in which these systems succeeded each other. The
                    authoritative <hi rend="italic">exposes</hi> of the systems have apparently
                    passed through several redactions; and, in their present form, these

                <p>Among the different systems, six are generally recognized as orthodox, as being
                    (either wholly or for the most part) consistent with the Vedic religion,—two and
                    two of which are again more closely related to each other than to the rest, viz.
                    :—</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Pûrva-mîmâmsâ (Mimâmsâ),</hi> and (2) <hi rend="italic"

                <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">Nyâya,</hi> and (6) <hi rend="italic">Vaiseshika.</hi></p>
                <p>(1) The <hi rend="italic">(Pûrva) Mimâmsâ</hi> is not a system of philosophy in
                    the proper sense of the word, but rather a system of dogmatic criticism and
                    scriptural interpretation. It maintains the eternal existence of the Veda, the
                    different parts of which are minutely classified. Its principal object, however,
                    is to ascertain the religious (chiefly ceremonial) duties enjoined in the Veda,
                    and to show how these duties must be performed, and what are the special merits
                    and rewards attached to them. Hence arises the necessity of determining the
                    principles for rightly interpreting the Vedic texts, as also of what forms its
                    only claim to being classed among speculative systems, viz., a philosophical
                    examination of the means of, and the proper method for arriving at, accurate
                    knowledge. The foundation of this school, as well as the composition of the
                    Sutras or aphorisms which constitute its chief doctrinal authority, is ascribed
                    to Jaimini. The Sûtras were commented on by Sahara Svamin; and further
                    annotations <hi rend="italic">(vârttika)</hi> thereon were supplied by the great

                    Sankarâchârya) at the Math of Śringeri, where, under the patronage of Bukka,
                    king of Vidyânagara, he composed his numerous works. He sometimes passes under a
                    third name, Vidyâranya-svâmin, adopted by him on becoming a <hi rend="italic"

                <p>(2) The <hi rend="italic">Vedânta</hi> philosophy, in the comparatively primitive
                    form in which it presents itself in most of the Upanishads, constitutes the
                    earliest phase of systematic metaphysical speculation. In its essential features
                    it remains to this day the prevalent belief of Indian thinkers, and enters
                    largely into the religious life and convictions of the people. It is an
                    idealistic monism, which derives the universe from an ultimate conscious
                    spiritual principle, the one and only existent from eternity—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Atman,</hi> the Self, or the <hi rend="italic">Purusha,</hi> the
                    Person, the <hi rend="italic">Brahman.</hi> It is this primordial essence or
                    Self that pervades all things, and gives life and light to them, “without being
                    sullied by the visible outward impurities or the miseries of the world, being
                    itself apart,”—and into which all things will, through knowledge, ultimately
                    resolve themselves. “The wise who perceive him as being within their own Self,
                    to them belongs eternal peace, not to others.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Kutha-upanishad, ii. 5,11-13</p></note> But,
                    while the commentators never hesitate to interpret the Upanishads as being in
                    perfect agreement with the Vedantic system, as elaborated in later times, there
                    is often considerable difficulty in accepting their explanations. In these
                    treatises only the leading features of the pantheistic theory find utterance,
                    generally in vague and mystic though often in singularly powerful and poetical
                    language, from which it is not always possible to extract the author’s real idea
                    on fundamental points, such as the relation between the Supreme Spirit and the
                    phenomenal world,—whether the latter was actually evolved from the former by a
                    power inherent in him, or whether the process is altogether a fiction, an
                    illusion of the individual self. Thus the Katha-upanishad<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>I. 8, 10; IL 6,7.</p></note> offers the
                    following summary :— “Beyond the senses [there are the objects; beyond the
                    objects] there is the mind (manas); beyond the mind there is the intellect
                    (buddhi); beyond the intellect there is the Great Self. Beyond the Great One
                    there is the Highest Undeveloped (avyaktam); beyond the Undeveloped there is the
                    Person (purusha), the all-pervading, characterless (alinga). Whatsoever knows
                    him is liberated, and attains immortality.” Here the Vedantist commentator
                    assures us that the Great Undeveloped, which the Sankhyas would claim as their
                    own primary material principle (pradliana, prakriti), is in reality <hi
                    rend="italic">Mâyâ,</hi> illusion (otherwise called Avidyâ, ignorance, or Śakti,
                    power), the fictitious energy which in conjunction with the Highest Self (Atman,
                    Purusha) produces or constitutes the Îśvara, the Lord, or Cosmic Soul, the first
                    emanation of the Atman, and himself the (fictitious) cause of all that seems to
                    exist. It must remain doubtful, however, whether the author of the Upanishad
                    really meant this, or whether he regarded the Great Undeveloped as an actual
                    material principle or substratum evolved from out of the Purusha, though not, as
                    the Sankhyas hold, coexisting with him from eternity. Besides passages such as
                    these which seem to indicate realistic or materialistic tendencies of thought,
                    which may well have developed into the dualistic Sânkhya and kindred systems,
                    there are others which indicate the existence even of nihilist theories, such as
                    the Bauddhas—the <hi rend="italic">śûnya-vâdins,</hi> or affirmers of a void or
                    primordial nothingness— profess. Thus wo read in the Chliandogya-upanishad<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>vi.’2, 1.</p></note>:—“The
                    existent alone, my son, was here in the beginning, one only, without a second,
                    others say, there was tha non-existent alone here in the beginning, one only,
                    without a second,—and from the nonexistent the existent was born. But how could
                    this be, my son? How could the existent be born from the non-existent? No, my
                    son, only the existent was here in the beginning, one only, without a
                    second.”</p>
                <p>The foundation of the Vedanta system, as “the completion of the Veda,” is
                    naturally ascribed to Vyasa, the mythic arranger of the Vedas, who is said to be
                    identical with Badarayana, the reputed author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brahma·</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Śârîraka·) sûtra,</hi> the authoritative,
                    though highly obscure, summary of the system. The most distinguished interpreter
                    of these aphorisms is the famous Malabar theologian Śankara Achârya (7th or 8th
                    century), who also commented on the principal Upanishads and the Bhagavadgîtâ,
                    and is said to have spent the greater part of his life in wandering all over
                    India, as far as Kashmir, and engaging in disputations with teachers—whether of
                    the Saiva, or Vaishnava, or less orthodox persuasions—with the view of rooting
                    out heresy and re-establishing the doctrine of the Upanishads. His controversial
                    triumphs (doubtless largely mythical) are related in a number of treatises
                    current in South India, the two most important of which are the <hi

                    his own disciple Anandagiri, and the <hi rend="italic">Śankara-vijaya,</hi> by
                    Mâ-dhavâchârya. In Sankara’s philosophy<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    material world has no real existence, but is a mere illusion of the individual
                    soul wrapt in ignorance,—that, therefore, it has only a practical or
                    conventional <hi rend="italic">(vyâvahârika)</hi> but not a transcendental or
                    true <hi rend="italic">(pâramârthika)</hi> reality,—is strictly enforced. To the
                    question why the Supreme Self (or rather his fictitious development, the Highest
                    Lord, or cosmic soul) should have sent forth this phantasmagory this great
                    thinker (with the author of the Sutras<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Brahmnsûtra, iii., 1, 32-34.</p></note>) can return no

                    esteemed. Of numerous other commentaries on the Brahma-sûtras, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Śrî-bhâshya,</hi> by Ramanuja, the founder of the Śrî-Vaishnava
                    sect, is the most noteworthy. This religious teacher, who probably flourished
                    during the first half of the 12th century, caused a schism in the Vedânta
                    school. Instead of adhering to Sankara’s orthodox <hi rend="italic"
                    >advaita,</hi> or non-duality doctrine, he put forth the theory of <hi
                    rend="italic">vîśishtâdvaita, i.e.,</hi> non-duality of the (two) distinct
                    (principles), or, as it is more commonly explained, non-duality of that which is
                    qualified (by attributes). According to this theory the Brahman (which is
                    identical with Vishnu) is neither devoid of form and quality, nor is it all
                    things; but it is endowed with all good qualities, and matter is distinct from
                    it; bodies consist of souls <hi rend="italic">(chit)</hi> and matter <hi
                    rend="italic">(achit)</hi>; and God is the soul. With this theory is combined
                    the ordinary Vaishnava doctrine of periodical descents <hi rend="italic"
                    >(avatdra)</hi> of the deity, in various forms, for the benefit of creatures. In
                    Ramanuja’s system considerable play is also allowed to the doctrine of faith <hi
                    rend="italic">(bhakti).</hi> This phase of Indian religious belief, which has
                    attached itself to the VedAnta theory more closely than to any other, and the
                    origin of which some scholars are inclined to attribute to Christian influence,
                    seems first to make its appearance very prominently in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bhagavadgîtâ,</hi> the episode of the <hi rend="italic">Mahâbhârata,</hi>
                    already referred to, and is even more fully developed in some of the Puranas,
                    especially the Bhagavata. In the <hi rend="italic">Sândilya- (Bhakti-)
                    sûtra,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Text, with

                    systematically propounded in one hundred aphorisms. According to this doctrine
                    mundane existence is due to want of faith, not to ignorance; and the final
                    liberation of the individual soul can only be effected by faith. Knowledge only
                    contributes to this end by removing the mind’s foulness, unbelief. Its highest
                    phase of development this doctrine probably reached in the religious creed of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bhaktas,</hi> a Vaishnava sect founded, towards the end of
                    the 15th century, by Chaitahya, whose followers subsequently grafted the VedAnta
                    speculations on his doctrine. A popular summary of the Vedanta doctrine is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vedânta-sâra</hi> by Sadananda, which has been frequently
                    printed and translated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    and an independent immaterial principle. In opposition to tho Vedanta school,
                    which maintains the eternal coexistence of a spiritual principle of reality and
                    an unspiritual principle of unreality, the Sankhya assumes tho eternal
                    coexistence of a material first cause, which it calls either <hi rend="italic"
                    >mula-Prakiti</hi> (fern.), “chief originant” (Nature), or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pradhâna,</hi> "the principal" cause, and a plurality of spiritual elements or
                    Selves, <hi rend="italic">Purusha.</hi> The system recognizes no intelligent
                    creator (such as tho <hi rend="italic">I&amp;vara,</hi> or demiurgus, of the
                    Vedânta)—whence it is called, <hi rend="italic">nirîśvara,</hi> godless; but it
                    conceives the Material First Cause, itself unintelligent, to have become
                    developed, by a gradual process of evolution, into all the actual forms of the
                    phenomenal universe, excepting the souls. Its first emanation is <hi
                    rend="italic">buddhi,</hi> intelligence; whence springs <hi rend="italic"
                    >ahamkâra,</hi> consciousness; thence five elementary particles <hi

                    elementary particles, five elements. Tho souls have from all eternity been
                    connected with Nature,—having in the first place become invested with a subtile
                    frame <hi rend="italic">(linga-,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sûkshma-,
                    śartra),</hi> consisting of seventeen principles, viz., intelligence,

                    the sake of fruition, connect themselves ever anew with Nature, thus, as it
                    were, creating for themselves ever new forms of material existence; and it is
                    only on his attaining perfect knowledge, whereby the ever-changing modes of
                    intelligence cease to be reflected on him, that the Purusha is liberated from

                    received his instruction from Asuri, the disciple of Kapila, as well as from the

                    Sânkhya, the last of which was the <hi rend="italic">Purusha,</hi> the Yoga
                    adds, as the twenty-sixth, the <hi rend="italic">Nirguna Purusha,</hi> or Self
                    devoid of qualities, the Supreme God of the system. Hence the Yoga is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Seśvara</hi> (theistical) <hi rend="italic">Sânkhya.</hi> But
                    over and above the purely speculative part of its doctrine, which it shares with
                    the sister school, the theistic Sankhya has developed a complete system of
                    mortification of the senses—by means of prolonged apathy and abstraction,
                    protracted rigidity of posture, and similar practices, —many of which are
                    already alluded to in the Upanishads,—with the view of attaining to an ecstatic
                    vision of, and reunion <hi rend="italic">(yoga)</hi> with, the Supreme Spirit.
                    It is from this portion of the system that the school derives the name by which
                    it is more generally known. The authoritative Sutras of the Yoga, bearing the
                    same title as those of the sister school, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sânkhya-pravachana,</hi> but more commonly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yoga-śâstra,</hi> are ascribed to Patanjali, who is perhaps identical with the
                    author of the “great commentary” on Pânini. The oldest commentary on the Sutras,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pâtahjala-bhâshya,</hi> is attributed to no other than
                    Vyâsa, the mythic arranger of the Veda and founder of the Vedânta. Both works
                    have again been commented upon by Vâchaspati-miśra, Vijnâna-bhikshu, and other
                    writers.</p>

                    branches of one and the same school, which supplement each other and the
                    doctrines of which have virtually become amalgamated into a single system of
                    philosophy. The special part taken by each of the two branches in the
                    elaboration of the’system may be briefly stated in Dr Röer’s words :—“To the
                    Nyâya belong the logical doctrines of the forms of syllogisms, terms, and
                    propositions; to the Vaiśeshikas the systematical explanation of the categories
                    (the simplest metaphysical ideas) of the metaphysical, physical, and psychical
                    notions, — which notions are hardly touched upon in the Nyaya-sutras. They
                    differ in their statement of the several modes of proof,—the Nyaya asserting
                    four modes of proof (from perception, inference, analogy, and verbal
                    communication), the Vaiseshikas admitting only the two first ones.” The term
                    Nyaya <hi rend="italic">(ni-âya,</hi> “in-going,” entering), though properly
                    meaning “analytical investigation,” as applied to philosophical inquiry
                    generally, has come to be taken more commonly in the narrower sense of “logic,”
                    because this school has entered more thoroughly than any other into the laws and
                    processes of thought, and has worked out a formal system of reasoning which
                    forms the Hindu standard of logic.</p>
                <p>The followers of these schools generally recognize seven categories <hi
                    rend="italic">(padârtha)</hi>:—substance <hi rend="italic">(dravya),</hi>
                    quality <hi rend="italic">(guna),</hi> action <hi rend="italic">(karma),</hi>
                    generality <hi rend="italic">(sâmânya),</hi> particularity <hi rend="italic"
                    >(viśesha),</hi> intimate relation <hi rend="italic">(sarnavâya),</hi> and
                    non-existence or negation <hi rend="italic">(abhâva).</hi> Substances, forming
                    the substrata of qualities and actions, are of two kinds:— eternal (without a
                    cause), viz., space, time, ether, soul, and the atoms of mind, earth, water,
                    fire, and air; and non-eternal, com prising all compounds, or the things we
                    perceive, and which must have a cause of their existence. Causality is of three
                    kinds :— that of intimate relation (material cause); that of non-intimate
                    relation (between parts of a compound); and instrumental causality (effecting
                    the union of component parts). Material things are thus composed of atoms <hi
                    rend="italic">(anu), i.e.,</hi> ultimate simple substances, or units of space,
                    eternal, unchangeable, and without dimension, characterized only by
                    “particularity <hi rend="italic">(viśesha).”</hi> It is from this predication of
                    ultimate “particulars” that the Vaiseshikas, the originators of the atomistic
                    doctrine, derive their name. The Nyâya draws a clear line between matter and
                    spirit, and has worked out a careful and ingenious system of psychology. It
                    distinguishes between individual or living souls <hi rend="italic"
                    >(jîvâtman),</hi> which are numerous, infinite, and eternal, and the Supreme
                    Soul <hi rend="italic">(Paramâtman),</hi> which is one only, the seat of eternal
                    knowledge, and the maker and ruler <hi rend="italic">(Îśvara)</hi> of all
                    things. It is by his will and agency that the unconscious living souls
                    (soul-atoms, in fact) enter into union with the (material) atoms of mind,
                    &amp;c., and thus partake of the pleasures and sufferings of mundane existence.
                    On the Hindu syllogism compare Prof. Cowell’s notes to Colebrooke’s <hi

                <p>The original collection of <hi rend="italic">Nyâya-sâtras</hi> is ascribed to
                    Gotama, and that of the <hi rend="italic">Vaiśeshika-sûtras</hi> to Kanada. The
                    etymological meaning of the latter name seems to be “little-eater,
                    particle-eater,” whence in works of hostile critics the synonymous terms <hi
                    rend="italic">Kana-bhuj</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kana-bhaksha</hi> are
                    sometimes derisively applied to him, doubtless in allusion to his theory of
                    atoms. He is also occasionally referred to under the name of Kâśyapa. Both
                    sutra-works have been interpreted and supplemented by a number of writers, the
                    commentary of Viśvanâtha on the Nyâya and that of Śankara-miśra on the
                    Vaiśeshika Sûtras being most generally used. There are, moreover, a vast number
                    of separate works on the doctrines of these schools, especially on logic. Of

                    six “limbs of the Veda,” or auxiliary sciences, the study of which was deemed
                    necessary for a correct interpretation of the sacred Mantras, and the proper
                    performance of Vedic rites. Linguistic inquiry, phonetic as well as grammatical,
                    was indeed early resorted to both for the purpose of elucidating the meaning of
                    the Veda, and with the view of settling its textual form. The particular work
                    which came ultimately to be looked upon as the “vedanga” representative of
                    grammatical science, and has ever since remained the standard authority for

                    comprehensive grasp of linguistic facts, and a penetrating insight into the
                    structure of the vernacular language, this work stands probably unrivalled in
                    the literature of any nation,—though few other languages, it is true, afford
                    such facilities as the Sanskrit for a scientific analysis. Panini’s system of
                    arrangement differs entirely from that usually adopted in our grammars, viz.,
                    according to the so-called parts of speech. As the work is composed in aphorisms
                    intended to be learnt by heart, economy of memory-matter was the author’s
                    paramount consideration. His object was chiefly attained by the grouping
                    together of all cases exhibiting the same phonetic or formative feature, no
                    matter whether or not they belonged to the same part of speech. For this purpose
                    he also makes use of a highly artificial and ingenious system of algebraic
                    symbols, consisting of technical letters <hi rend="italic">(anu-bandha),</hi>
                    used chiefly "with suffixes, aud indicative of the changes which the roots or
                    stems have to undergo in word-formation.</p>
                <p>It is self-evident that so complicated and complete a system of linguistic
                    analysis and nomenclature could not have sprung up all at once and in the
                    infancy of grammatical science, but that many generations of scholars must have
                    helped to bring it to that degree of perfection which it exhibits in Panini’s
                    work. Accordingly we find Panini himself making reference in various places to
                    ten different grammarians, besides two schools, which he calls the “eastern <hi
                    rend="italic">(prânchas)</hi>” and “northern (<hi rend="italic">udanchas</hi>)”
                    grammarians. Perhaps the most important of his predecessors was Sakatayana,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>son of Nakata, whence he is
                    also called Sakatângaja.</p></note> also mentioned by Yaska—the author of the
                    Nirukta, who is likewise supposed to have preceded Panini—as the only grammarian
                    <hi rend="italic">(vaiyâ-karana)</hi> who held with the etymologists <hi
                    rend="italic">(nairukta)</hi> that all nouns are derived from verbal roots.
                    Unfortunately there is little hope of the recovery of his grammar, which would
                    probably have enabled us to determine somewhat more exactly to what extent
                    Panini was indebted to the labours of his predecessors., There exists indeed a

                    called Dâkshîputra, after his mother Dâkshî. As his’birthplace the village
                    Śalâtura is mentioned, which was situated some few miles north-west of the
                    Indus, in the country of the Gandhâras, whence later writers also call him
                    Śâlâturîya, the formation of which name he himself explains in his grammar.
                    Another name sometimes applied to him is Śâlanki. In the <hi rend="italic"

                    attempted to put his date back to ante-Buddhist times (about the 7th century
                    B.C.), Prof. Weber holds that Panini’s grammar cannot have been composed till
                    some time after the invasion of Alexander the Great. This opinion is chiefly
                    based on the occurrence in one of the Sutras of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >yavanânî,</hi> in the sense of “the writing of the Yavanas (Ionians),” thus
                    implying, it would seem, such an acquaintance with the Greek alphabet as it
                    would be impossible to assume for any period prior to Alexander’s Indian
                    campaign (326 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> But, as it is by no means

                    alphabet, it is scarcely expedient to make the word the corner-stone of the
                    argument regarding Panini’s age. If Patanjali’s “great commentary” was written,
                    as seems highly probable, about the middle of the 2nd century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> it is hardly possible to assign to Panini a later
                    date than about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Though this grammarian
                    registers numerous words and formations as peculiar to the Vedic hymns, his
                    chief concern is with the ordinary speech <hi rend="italic">(bhâshâ)</hi> of his
                    period and its literature; and it is noteworthy, in this respect, that the rales
                    he lays down on some important points of syntax (as pointed out by Profs.
                    Bhandarkar and Kielhorn) are in accord with the practice of the Brahmanas rather
                    than with that of the later classical literature.</p>
                <p>Pânini’s Sûtras continued for ages after to form the centre of grammatical
                    activity. But, as his own work had superseded those of his predecessors, so many
                    of the scholars who devoted themselves to the task of perfecting his system have
                    sunk into oblivion. The earliest of his successors whose work has come down to
                    us (though perhaps not in a separate form), is Katyayana, the author of a large
                    collection of concise critical notes, called <hi rend="italic">Vârttika,</hi>
                    intended to supplement and correct the Sutras, or give them greater precision.
                    The exact date of this writer is likewise unknown; but there can be little doubt
                    that he lived at least a century after Panini. During the interval a new body of
                    literature seems to have sprung up,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>F. Kielhorn, <hi rend="italic">Kâtyâyana und Patanjali,</hi>

                    as the Sarvanukrama) is attributed, is still doubted by some scholars.<note

                    works usually assign a second name Vararuchi to the writers (for there are at
                    least two) who bear it. The Kathasaritsagara makes the author of the Varttikas a
                    fellow-student of Pânini, and afterwards the minister of King Nanda; but, though
                    this date might have fitted Katyayana well enough, it is impossible to place any
                    reliance on the statements derived from such a source. Katyayana was succeeded
                    again, doubtless after a considerable interval, by Patanjali, the author of the

                    incidentally supplies regarding the literature and manners of the period, this
                    is, from an historical and antiquarian point of view, one of the most important
                    works of the classical Sanskrit literature. Fortunately the author’s date has
                    been settled by synchronisms implied in two passages of his work. In one of them
                    the use of the imperfect—as the tense referring to an event, known to people
                    generally, not witnessed by the speaker, and yet capable of being witnessed by
                    him—is illustrated by the statement, “The Yavana besieged Saketa,” which there
                    is reason to believe can only refer to the Indo-Bactrian king Menander (144-c.
                    124 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> who, according to Strabo, extended his rule
                    as far as the Yamunâ.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    sacrificing for Push-pamitra,”—this prince (178-c. 142 B.C.), the founder of the
                    Sunga dynasty, being known to have fought against the Greeks. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 10</hi> We thus get the years 144-142 B.C. as the probable
                    time when the work, or part of it, was composed. Although Patanjali probably
                    gives not a few traditional grammatical examples mechanically repeated from his
                    predecessors, those hero mentioned are fortunately such as, from the very nature
                    of the case, must have been made by himself. The Mahâbhâshva is not a continuous
                    commentary on Pânini’s grammar, but deals only with those Sûtras (some 1720 out
                    of a total of nearly 4000) on which Katyayana had proposed any Varttikas, the
                    critical discussion of which, in connexion with the respective Sutras, and with
                    the views of other grammarians expressed thereon, is the sole object of
                    Patanjali’s com-mentatorial remarks. Though doubts have been raised as to the
                    textual condition of the work, Prof. Kielhorn has clearly shown that it has
                    probably been handed down in as good a state of preservation as any other
                    classical Sanskrit work. Patanjali is also called Gonardiya,—which name Prof.
                    Bhandarkar takes to mean “a native of Gonarda,” a place, according to the same
                    scholar, probably identical with Gonda, a town some 20 miles north-west of
                    Oudh,—and Gonikaputra, or son of Gonika. Whether there is any connexion between
                    this writer and the reputed author of the Yogaśâstra is doubtful. The
                    Maliabhashya has been commented upon by Kaiyata, in his <hi rend="italic"

                    in the later homonymic vocabularies the words are usually arranged according to
                    the alphabetical order of the final (or sometimes the initial) letter, and then
                    according to the number of syllables, Sâsvata’s principle of arrangement —viz.,
                    the number of meanings assignable to a word—seems to be more primitive. The work

                    whilst in the former the words are distributed in sections according to

                    are arranged according to their final letter, without regard to the number of

                    the (homonymous) <hi rend="italic">Nânârtha-sangraha,</hi> being quoted by
                    Vardhamâna (1140 A.D.). of more uncertain date is Purushottama Deva, who wrote
                    the <hi rend="italic">Trikânâa-śesha,</hi> a supplement to the Amarakosha,
                    besides the <hi rend="italic">Hârâvali,</hi> a collection of uncommon words, and
                    two other short glossaries. Of numerous other works of this class the most
                    important is the <hi rend="italic">Medinî,</hi> a dictionary of homonyms,
                    arranged in the first place according to the finals and the syllabic length, and
                    then alphabetically. Two important dictionaries, compiled by native scholars of
                    the present century, are the <hi rend="italic">Sabdakalpadruma</hi> by
                    Radhakanta Deva, and the <hi rend="italic">Vdchaspatya,</hi> by Taranatha
                    Tarka-vachaspati. A full account of Sanskrit dictionaries is contained in the
                    preface to the first edition of H. H. Wilson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary,</hi> reprinted in his <hi rend="italic">Essays on Sanskrit
                    Literature,</hi> vol. iii.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Prosody</hi><hi rend="italic">(Chhandas).—</hi> The
                    oldest treatises on prosody have already been referred to in the account of the
                    technical branches of the later Vedic literature. Among more modern treatises
                    the most important are the <hi rend="italic">Mrita-sanjîvanî,</hi> a commentary
                    on Pingala’s Sutra, by Halayudha (perhaps identical with the author of the
                    glossary above referred to); the <hi rend="italic">Vritta-ratnâkara,</hi> or
                    “jewel-mine of metres,” in six chapters, composed before the 13th century by
                    Kedara Bhatta, with several commentaries; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chhando-manjarî,</hi> likewise in six chapters, by Gangadasa. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Srutabodha,</hi> ascribed, probably wrongly, to the great
                    Kalidasa, is a comparatively insignificant treatise, dealing only with the more
                    common metres, in such a way that each couplet forms a specimen of the metre it
                    describes. The <hi rend="italic">Vritta-darpana</hi> treats chiefly of Prakrit
                    metres. Sanskrit prosody, which is probably not surpassed by any other either in
                    variety of metre or in harmoniousness of rhythm, recognizes two classes of
                    metres, viz., such as consist of a certain number of syllables of fixed
                    quantity, and such as are regulated by groups of breves or metrical instants,
                    this latter class being again of two kinds, according as it is or is not bound
                    by a fixed order of feet. A pleasant account of Sanskrit poetics is given in
                    Colebrooke’s <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> vol. ii.; a more complete and
                    systematic one by Prof. Weber, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Stud.,</hi> vol. viii.</p>
                <p>VI. Music <hi rend="italic">(Sangîta).—</hi> The musical art has been practised
                    in India from early times. The theoretic treatises on profane music now extant
                    are, however, quite modern productions. The two most highly esteemed works are
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sangîta-ratnâkara</hi> (“jewel-mine of music ”), by
                    Sarngadeva, and the <hi rend="italic">Sangîta-darpana</hi> (“mirror of music”),
                    by Damodara. Each of these works consists of seven chapters, treating
                    respectively of—(1) sound and musical notes <hi rend="italic">(svara)</hi>; (2)
                    melodies <hi rend="italic">(rdga)</hi>; (3) music in connexion with the human
                    voice <hi rend="italic">(prakirnaka)</hi>; (4) musical compositions <hi
                    rend="italic">(prabandha);</hi> (5) time and measure <hi rend="italic"
                    >(tdla)</hi>; (6) musical instruments and instrumental music <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vddya)</hi>; (7) dancing and acting <hi rend="italic">(nritta</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">nritya).</hi> The Indian octave consists like our own of seven
                    chief notes <hi rend="italic">(svara)</hi>; but, while with us it is subdivided
                    into twelve semi-tones, the Hindu theory distinguishes twenty-two intervals <hi
                    rend="italic">(kruti,</hi> audible sound). There is, however, some doubt as to
                    whether these <hi rend="italic">śrutis</hi> are quite equal to one another,—in
                    which case the intervals between the chief notes would be unequal, since they
                    consist of either two or three or four <hi rend="italic">śrutis,—</hi> or
                    whether, if the intervals between the chief notes be equal, the <hi
                    rend="italic">śrutis</hi> themselves vary in duration between quarter-, third-,
                    and semi-tones. There are three scales <hi rend="italic">(grâma),</hi> differing
                    from each other in the nature of the chief intervals (either as regards actual
                    duration, or the number of srutis or sub-tones). Indian music consists almost
                    entirely in melody, instrumental accompaniment being performed in unison, and
                    any attempt at harmony being confined to the continuation of the key-note. A
                    number of papers, by various writers, have been reprinted with additional
                    remarks on the subject, in Sourindro Mohun Tagore’s <hi rend="italic">Hindu
                    Music,</hi> Calcutta, 1875. Compare also “Hindu Music,” reprinted from the <hi

                    subject of this description—involving such nice distinctions as regards the
                    various kinds of poetic composition, the particular subjects and characters
                    adapted for them, and the different sentiments or mental conditions capable of
                    being both depictured and called forth by them— could not but be congenial to
                    the Indian mind. H. H. Wilson, in his <hi rend="italic">Theatre of the
                    Hindus,</hi> has given a detailed account of these theoretic distinctions with
                    special reference to the drama, which, as tho most perfect and varied kind of
                    poetic production, usually takes an important place in the theory of literary
                    composition. The <hi rend="italic">Bharata-śâstra</hi> has already been alluded
                    to as probably the oldest extant work in this department of literature. Another
                    comparatively ancient treatise is the <hi rend="italic">Kâvyâdarśa,</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ed. with commentary, by

                    “mirror of poetry,” in three chapters, by Dandin, the author of the novel
                    Dasakumaracharita, who probably flourished not long after Kalidasa (whose
                    Prakrit poem Setubandha he quotes) in the 6th century. The work consists of
                    three chapters, treating—(1) of two different local styles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(rîti)</hi> of poetry, the Gaudi and the Vaidarbhi (to which later critics add
                    four others, the Pânchâlî, Magadhî, Lati, and Avantika); (2) of the graces and
                    ornaments of style, as tropes, figures, similes; (3) of alliteration, literary
                    puzzles, and twelve kinds of faults to be avoided in composing poems. Another
                    treatise on rhetoric, in Sutras, with a commentary entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kâvyâlankâra-vritti,</hi> is ascribed to Vamana. Prof. Cappeller, to whom we
                    owe an edition of this work, is inclined to fix it as late as the 12th century;
                    but it may turn out to be somewhat older. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kâvyâlankâra,</hi> by the Kashmirian Rudrata, must have been composed prior to
                    the 11th century, as a gloss on it (by Nami), which professes to be based on
                    older commentaries, was written in 1068. Dhananjaya, the author of the <hi

                    dramaturgy, appears to have flourished in the 10th century. In the concluding
                    stanza he is stated to have composed his work at the court of King Munja, who is
                    probably identical with the well-known Malava prince, the uncle and predecessor
                    of King Bhoja of Dhârâ. The Daśarûpa was early commented upon by Dhanika,
                    possibly the author’s own brother, their father’s name being the same (Vishnu).
                    Dhanika quotes Rajasekhara, who is supposed to have flourished about 1000

                    earlier. The <hi rend="italic">Sarasvatî-kanthâbharana,</hi> “the neck-ornament

                    Bhoja himself (11th century), probably as a compliment by some writer patronized

                    chapters, treating of the following subjects :—(1) the nature of poetry; (2) the
                    sentence; (3) poetic flavour (rasa); (4) the divisions of poetry; (5) the
                    functions of literary suggestion; (6) visible and audible poetry (chiefly on

                    a much later period that the medical practice advanced beyond a certain degree
                    of empirical skill and pharmaceutic routine. From the simultaneous mention of
                    the three humours (wind, bile, phlegm) in a vârttika to Panini (v. 1, 38), some
                    kind of humoral pathology would, however, seem to have been prevalent among
                    Indian physicians several centuries before our era. The oldest existing work is

                    have received from Dhanvantari, the Indian AEsculapius, whose name, however,
                    appears also among the “nine gems” (c. 550 A.D.). It consists of six chapters,

                    arrangement, as well as some slight attention paid in it to surgery, betokening
                    an advance upon Charaka. Both works are, however, characterized by great
                    prolixity, and contain much matter which has little connexion with medicine. The

                    the Arabs. But even though Greek influence may be traced in this as in other

                    rend="italic">Z. D. M. G.,</hi> 1880, p. 465.</p></note> at any rate, that both
                    Charaka and Susruta were known to the Arab Razi (c. 932 A.D.), and to the author
                    of the Fihrist (completed 987 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and that their
                    works must therefore have existed, in some form or other, at least as early as
                    the 9th century. Among the numerous later medical works the most important
                    general compendiums are Vagbhata’s <hi rend="italic">Ashtânga-hridaya,</hi> “the
                    heart of tho eight-limbed (body of medical science),” and Bliava Misra’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Bhâva-prakâśa</hi>; while of special treatises may be mentioned
                    Madhava’s system of nosology, the <hi rend="italic">Rugviniśchaya,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Mâdhâva-nidâna,</hi> and Sarngadhara’s compendium of therapeutics,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sârngadhara-samhitâ.</hi> Materia medica, with which India
                    is so lavishly endowed by nature, is a favourite subject with Hindu medical
                    writers,—the most valued treatise being the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Râja-nighantu,</hi> by the Kashmirian Narahari. The best general view of this
                    branch of Indian science is continued in T. A. Wise’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentary on Hindu Medicine,</hi> 1845, and in his <hi rend="italic">History
                    of Medicine,</hi> vol. i., 1867; but the whole subject, including the principal
                    original works, still awaits a critical investigation.</p>
                <p>IX. <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy and Mathematics.</hi> —Hindu astronomy may be
                    broadly divided into a pre-scientific and a scientific period. While the latter
                    clearly presupposes a knowledge of the researches of Hipparchus and other Greek
                    astronomers, it is still doubtful whether the earlier astronomical and
                    astrological theories of Indian writers were entirely of home growth or partly
                    derived from foreign sources. From very ancient (probably Indo-European) times
                    chronological calculations were based on the synodical revolutions of the
                    moon,—the difference between twelve such revolutions (making together 354 days)
                    and the solar year being adjusted by the insertion, at the time of the winter
                    solstice, of twelve additional days. Besides this primitive mode the Rigveda
                    also alludes to the method prevalent in post-Vedic times, according to which the
                    year is divided into twelve <hi rend="italic">(sâvana</hi> or solar) months of
                    thirty days, with a thirteenth month intercalated every fifth year. This
                    quinquennial cycle <hi rend="italic">(yuga)</hi> is explained in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jyotisha,</hi> regarded as the oldest astronomical treatise. An
                    institution which occupies an important part in those early speculations is the
                    theory of the so-called lunar zodiac, or system of lunar mansions, by which the
                    planetary path, in accordance with the duration of the moon’s rotation, is
                    divided iuto twenty-seven or twenty-eight different stations, named after
                    certain constellations <hi rend="italic">(nakshatra)</hi> which are found
                    alongside of tho ecliptic, and with which the moon (masc.) was supposed to dwell
                    successively during his circuit. The same institution is found in China and
                    Arabia; but it is still doubtful<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the Hindus, as some scholars hold, or the Clialdseans, as Prof. Weber thinks,
                    are to be credited with the invention of this theory. The principal works of
                    this period are hitherto known from quotations only, viz., the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gârgi Samhitâ,</hi> which Prof. Kern would fix at c. 50 B.C., the <hi

                <p>The new era, which the same scholar dates from c. 250 A.D., is marked by the

                    arithmetical and algebraic) computations; and the respective chapters of

                    still unsettled; but, even if this was the case, algebraic science seems to have
