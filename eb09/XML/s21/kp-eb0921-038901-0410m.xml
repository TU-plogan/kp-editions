                    Catelet, in the French department of Aisne (Picardy), it becomes navigable by
                    the junction of the St Quentin Canal, below Catelet, and passes by Cambray,
                    Denain (where it receives the Selle), Valenciennes, at the mouth of the Rouelle,
                    Condé, at the mouth of the Haisne or Henne, and Chateau l’Abbaye, at the mouth
                    of the Scarpe. Entering Belgium between Mortagne and Hollain, it continues by
                    Fontenoy, Tournay, and Oudenarde to Ghent, where it is joined by the Lys from
                    the left, and by the canals which unite this town with Sas and Bruges. At Ghent
                    the tide rises 3 ½ feet and lasts for four hours; and it would ascend much
                    farther were it not for sluices. But the river, instead of proceeding straight
                    towards the sea, as it appears to have done perhaps as late as the time of
                    Charlemagne, makes a great bend towards the east to Dendermonde (the mouth of
                    the Dender) and Antwerp, whence it again turns northwest and loses itself in the
                    estuaries among the islands of</p>
                <p>Zealand. The whole of the lowlands to the north of Ghent are so intersected with
                    canals, and the natural channels are so intermingled with those partially or
                    entirely artificial, that it is impossible to discover with certainty what has
                    been the real history of the lower course of the Scheldt.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bylandt, Belpaire, Renard, and Wauvermans
                    impugn, and Des Roches, Vifquain, Van Raemdonck and Verstraete maintain, the
                    existence within historic times of a direct main-river channel from Ghent
                    northward to the sea.</p></note> The Hont or Western Scheldt, the principal
                    estuary by which nearly all Belgium commerce is conveyed, was probably opened up
                    by a storm in 1173, and about 1058 must have been a mere narrow creek. The
                    Eastern Scheldt, which then received most of the river, has gradually diminished
                    in importance, and since the construction of the railway bridge across it
                    between the mainland and South Beveland in 1867 has become completely obstructed
                    with sands. At Antwerp the depth at high water is 49 feet.</p>
                <p>Between 1648 and 1792 the Dutch closed the mouths of the Scheldt against foreign
                    commerce. The emperor Joseph of Austria, at that time ruler of Antwerp,
                    protested against this action in 1783, but in 1784, by the treaty of
                    Fontainebleau, he recognized, in return for concessions of territory and 9⅜
                    million florins, the right of the Dutch to adhere to the terms of the peace of
                    Westphalia. In 1792 by conquest of Dumouriez, and in 1795 by treaty between
                    France and Holland, the Scheldt was declared open. During the union of Holland
                    and Belgium the question naturally lay in abeyance. When Belgium became
                    independent (1839) Holland so far resumed her exclusive policy, but in 1863 the
                    dues which she was allowed to levy by the treaty of separation were capitalized
                    by Belgium paying 17,141,640 florins, a sum which was largely repaid to Belgium
                    by twenty other countries who felt they had an interest in the free navigation
                    of the Scheldt. Great Britain’s share was 8,782,320 francs.</p>
