                <p><label type="entry">SALUTATIONS, or greetings</label>, are customary forms of
                    kindly or respectful address, especially on meeting or parting or on occasions
                    of ceremonious approach. Etymologically the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >salutation</hi> (Lat. <hi rend="italic">salutatio,</hi> “wishing health ”)
                    refers to words spoken, but the conventional gestures are even more purposeful,
                    and both should be considered together. The principal modes of saluting, when
                    classified, fall into a few groups, with well-defined meanings, the examination
                    of which explains the practice of any particular tribe or nation.</p>
                <p>Forms of salutation frequent among savages and barbarians may last on almost
                    unchanged in civilized custom, or may be found in modified shapes, while in
                    other cases they may have disappeared altogether and been replaced by new
                    greetings. The habit of affectionate clasping or embracing is seen at the
                    meetings of the rude Andamaners and Australians, or where the Fuegians in
                    friendly salute hug “like the grip of a bear.”<note anchored="true"

                    in old Semitic and Aryan custom :—“Esau ran to meet him (Jacob) and embraced
                    him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they wept” (Gen. xxxiii. 4); so,

                    head, hands, and shoulders <hi rend="italic">(Odyss.,</hi> xxi. 223):—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">κλαίον άρ αμϕ Οδυσηιιi δαϯϕρονιι χϵίρϵ βαλοντϵ,</hi><hi

                    ϵκυσσϵν.</hi></p>
                <p>The embrace continues habitual through later ages, and, though in modern times a
                    good deal restricted, it still marks the meetings of near kinsfolk and lovers.
                    But the kiss, associated with it in passages like those just cited, has no such
                    universality. The idea of the kiss being an instinctive gesture is negatived by
                    its being unknown over half the world, where the prevailing salute is that by
                    smelling or sniffing (often called by travellers “rubbing noses”), which belongs
                    to Polynesians, Malays, Burmese and other Indo-Chinese, Mongols, &amp;c.,
                    extending thence eastward to the Eskimo and westward to Lapland, where Linnaeus
                    saw relatives saluting by putting their noses together.<note anchored="true"

                    Tour in Lapland,</hi> vol. i. p. 315.</p></note> This seems the only appearance
                    of the habit in Europe. On the other hand the kiss, the salute by tasting,
                    appears constantly in Semitic and Aryan antiquity, as in the above cases from
                    the book of Genesis and the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> or in Herodotus’s
                    description of the Persians of his time kissing one another—if equals on the
                    mouth, if one was somewhat inferior on the cheek (Herod., i. 134). In Greece in
                    the classic period it became customary to kiss the hand, breast, or knee of a
                    superior. In Rome the kisses of inferiors became a burdensome civility (Martial,
                    xii. 59):—</p>
                <p>“Te vicinia tota, te pilosus Hircoso premit osculo colonus.”</p>
                <p>The early Christians made it the sign of fellowship: “greet all the brethren with
                    an holy kiss” (1 Thess. v. 26; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Rom. xvi. 16,
                    &amp;c.); and this may even now be seen among Anabaptists, who make an effort to
                    retain primitive Christian habit. It early passed into more ceremonial form in
                    the kiss of peace given to the newly baptized and in the celebration of the
                    Eucharist<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bingham, <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquities of the Chr. Church,</hi> bk. xii. c. 4, xv. c.
                    3.</p></note>; this is retained by the Oriental Church. After a time, however,
                    its indiscriminate use between the sexes gave rise to scandals, and it was
                    restricted by ecclesiastical regulations—men being only allowed to kiss men, and
                    women women, and eventually in the Roman Church the ceremonial kiss at the
                    communion being only exchanged by the ministers, but a relic or cross called an
                    <hi rend="italic">osculatorium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pax</hi> being carried
                    to the people to be kissed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The latter term has supplied the Irish language with its term for a kiss,

                    rend="italic">Revue Celtique,</hi> vol. vi. p. 43.</p></note> While the kiss has
                    thus been adopted as a religious rite, its original social use has continued.
                    Among men, however, it has become less effusive, the alteration being marked in
                    England at the end of the 17th century by such passages as the advice to Sir
                    Wilfull by his London-bred brother:—“in the country, where great lubberly
                    brothers slabber and kiss one another when they meet; ... ’T is not the fashion
                    here.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Congreve’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Way of the World,</hi> Act iii.</p></note> The kiss on both cheeks
                    between parents and children on Continental railway platforms now surprises the
                    undemonstrative Englishman, who, when servants sometimes kiss his hand in
                    southern Europe, is even more struck by this relic of servile ages. Court
                    ceremonial keeps up the kiss on the cheek between sovereigns and the kissing of
                    the hand by subjects, and the pope, like a Roman emperor, receives the kiss on
                    his foot. A curious trace which these osculations have left behind is that when
                    ceasing to be performed they are still talked of by way of politeness: Austrians
                    say, “küss d’Hand !” and Spaniards, “beso a Vd. las manos!” “I kiss your
                    hands!”</p>
                <p>Strokings, pattings, and other caresses have been turned to use as salutations,
                    but have not a wide enough range to make them important. Weeping for joy, often
                    occurring naturally at meetings, is sometimes affected as a salutation; but this
                    seems to be different from the highly ceremonious weeping performed by several
                    rude races when, meeting after absence, they renew the lamentations over those
                    friends who have died in the meantime. The typical case is that of the
                    Australians, where the male nearest of kin presses his breast to the new
                    comer’s, and the nearest female relative, with piteous lamentations, embraces
                    his knees with one hand, while with the other she scratches her face till the
                    blood drops.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Grey, <hi
                    rend="italic">Journals,</hi> vol. ii. p. 255.</p></note> Obviously this is no
                    joy-weeping, but mourning, and the same is true of the New Zealand <hi
                    rend="italic">tangi,</hi> which is performed at the reception of a distinguished
                    visitor, whether he has really dead friends to mourn or not.<note

                    >New Zealand,</hi> p. 221.</p></note> Cowering or crouching is a natural gesture
                    of fear or inability to resist that belongs to the brutes as well as man; its
                    extreme form is lying prostrate face to ground. In barbaric society, as soon as
                    distinctions are marked between master and slave, chief and commoner, these
                    tokens of submission become salutations. The sculptures of Egypt and Assyria
                    show the lowly prostrations of the ancient East, while in modern Dahomey or Siam
                    subjects crawl before the king, and even Siberian peasants grovel and kiss the
                    dust before a noble. A later stage is to suggest, but not actually perform, the
                    prostration, as the Arab bends his hand to the ground and puts it to his lips or
                    forehead, or the Tongan would touch the sole of a chief’s foot, thus
                    symbolically placing himself under his feet. Kneeling prevails in the middle
                    stages of culture, as in the ceremonial of China; Hebrew custom sets it rather
                    apart as an act of homage to a deity (1 Kings xix. 18; Isa. xlv. 23); mediaeval
                    Europe distinguishes between kneeling in worship on both knees and on one knee
                    only in homage, as in the <hi rend="italic">Poke of Curtasye</hi> (15th
                    century):—</p>
                <p>“Be curtayse to god, and knele doun On bothe knees with grete deuocioun;</p>
                <p>To mon pou shalle knele opon pe ton, pe toper to py self pou liable alon.”</p>
                <p>Bowing, as a salute of reverence, appears in its extreme in Oriental custom, as
                    among the ancient Israelites: “bowed himself to the ground seven times” (Gen.
                    xxxiii. 3).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                    Egyptian bow with one hand to the knee; Wilkinson, <hi rend="italic">Anc.

                    801.</p></note> The bowing salutation, varying in Europe from something less
                    than the Eastern salaam down to the slightest inclination of the head, is
                    interesting from being given mutually, the two saluters each making the sign of
                    submission to the other, which would have been absurd till the sign passed into
                    mere civility. Uncovering is a common mode of salutation, originally a sign of
                    disarming or defencelessness or destitution in the presence of a superior.
                    Polynesian or African chiefs require more or less stripping, such as the
                    uncovering to the waist which Captain Cook describes in Tahiti.<note

                    customs in Tylor, <hi rend="italic">Early History of Mankind,</hi> ch.

                    the Western world, done in a frequent, demonstrative way by such as make a show’
                    of politeness, and who by being “free of cappe and full of curtesye” pay cheaply
                    social debts; but modern society has moderated this bowing and scraping (the
                    scrape is throwing back the right leg as the body is bent forward), as well as
                    the curtseys <hi rend="italic">(courtoisie)</hi> of women. Eastern nations are
                    apt to see disrespect in baring the head, but insist on the feet being
                    uncovered; the importance attached to entering barefoot is well known to English
                    officials in India; Burmah was agitated for years by “the great shoe<pb

                    to conform to native custom, rather than their own, by taking off their shoes to
                    enter the royal presence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    antiquity as a legal act symbolic of the parties joining in compact, peace, or
                    friendship; this is well seen in marriage, where the hand grasp was part of the
                    ancient Hindu ceremony, as was the “dextrarum junctio” in Rome, which passed on
                    into the Christian rite. In the classic world we see it passing into a mere
                    salutation, as where the tiresome acquaintance met by Horace on his stroll along
                    the Via Sacra seizes his hand (Hor., <hi rend="italic">Sat.,</hi> i. 9):—</p>
                <p>“Arreptaque manu, ‘Quid agis, dulcissime rerum</p>
                <p>Giving the right hand of fellowship (Gal. ii. 9) passed naturally into a
                    salutation throughout Christendom, and spread, probably from Byzantium, over the
                    Moslem world. The emphatic form of the original gesture in “striking hands” is
                    still used to make the greeting more hearty. The variety called in English
                    “shaking hands” (Germ. <hi rend="italic">Hände-schütteln)</hi> only appears to
                    have become usual in the Middle Ages.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    been especially English traders and missionaries who of late years have
                    introduced shaking hands far and wide in the world, so that even such rude
                    peoples as Australians and Hottentots, Eskimo and Fuegians, unite in practising
                    this modern civilized custom.</p>
                <p>As to words of salutation, it is found even among the lower races that certain
                    ordinary phrases have passed into formal greetings. Thus among the Tupis of
                    Brazil, after the stranger’s silent arrival in the hut, the master, who for a
                    time had taken no notice of him, would say “<hi rend="italic">Ere-ioubé?”</hi>
                    that is, “Art thou corne?” to which the proper reply was, “Yes, I am come!”<note

                    rend="italic">Reise in Sud-Afrika.</hi></p></note> Among cultured nations,
                    salutations are apt to be expressions of peace and goodwill, as in the Biblical
                    instances, “Is it well with thee?” (2 Kings iv. 26); “Peace to thee, and peace
                    to thine house,” &amp;c. (1 Sam. xxv. 6; see Ezra iv. 17). Such formulas run on
                    from age to age, and the latter may be traced on to the Moslem greeting, <hi
                    rend="italic">Salam 'alaikum!</hi> “The peace be on you,” to which the reply is
                    <hi rend="italic">Wa-'alaikum as-salám!</hi> “And on you be the peace <hi

                    fellow-believers, for it is usually held that it may not be used by or to an
                    infidel. From an epigram of Meleager <hi rend="italic">(Anth.,</hi> ed. Jacobs,

                    live for ever!” (Dan. iii. 9), represents a series of phraseswhich continue
                    still in the <hi rend="italic">Vivat rex!</hi> “Long live the king !” The Greeks

                    wish health; at a later time άσπάζομαι, “I greet!” came into fashion. The Romans
                    applied <hi rend="italic">Salve!</hi> “Be in health!” especially to meeting, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Vale!</hi> “Be well!” to parting. In the modern civilized
                    world, everywhere, the old inquiry after health appears, the “How do you do?”
                    becoming so formal as often to be said on both sides without either waiting for
                    an answer. Hardly less wide in range is the set of phrases “Good day!” “Good
                    night !”&amp;c., varying according to the hour, and translating into every
                    language of Christendom. Among other European phrases, some correspond to our
                    “welcome!” and “farewell!” while the religious element enters into another
                    class, exemplified by our “Good-bye!” (“God be with you!”), and French <hi
                    rend="italic">Adieu!</hi> Attempts have been made to shape European greetings
                    into expressions of orthodoxy, or even tests of belief, but they have had no
                    great success. Examples are a Protestant German salutation “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Lobe Jesum Christum !"</hi> answered by <hi rend="italic">“In Ewigkeit,
                    Amen!”</hi> and the formula which in Spain enforces the doctrine of the
                    Immaculate Conception, “<hi rend="italic">Ave Maria purisima !”</hi> answered by
                    <hi rend="italic">“Sin pecado coneebida!”</hi> On the whole, though the
                    half-meaningless forms of salutation may often seem ridiculous, society would
                    not carry them on so universally unless it found them useful. In fact, they
                    serve the substantial purpose of keeping up social intercourse, and establishing
                    relations between the parties in an interview, of which their tone may strike
                    the key note. Montaigne, a master of the courtesy of an age more ceremonious
                    than ours, truly asserts their importance, “C’est au demourant une très utile
                    science que la science de l’entregent.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. b.</hi> T.)</p>
