                <p><label type="entry">SAWS</label>. Blades of steel with serrated edges have been
                    used from time immemorial to rend or divide substances of various kinds,
                    including metals and stone; but the principal modern use of the saw is to divide
                    wood. Modern saws are of the finest steel, but the ancients used bronze saws,
                    and among uncivilized nations saws have been made with flakes of flint imbedded
                    in a wooden blade, and held in place by means of bitumen (see Grimshaw, <hi
                        rend="italic">History, &amp;c., of Saws),</hi> while obsidian has been used
                    by the Mexicans, and shark’s teeth and even notched shells form the saws of
                    certain savage islanders. The pyramid-builders in Egypt cut granite and other
                    hard stones by means of bronze saws set with jewels (see vol. xx. p. 124).</p>
                <p>Space would fail to describe minutely the various adaptations of the saw to
                    mechanical uses. It is indispensable to the carpenter, the
                    furniture-manufacturer, the watchmaker, and manipulator of metals. It is one of
                    the most trustworthy tools of the surgeon’s case, while without it the dentist
                    would of necessity drop back to the barbarous customs of a past century. Iron,
                    horn, pearl, india-rubber, and the thousand and one conveniences of civilized
                    life are dependent upon this useful instrument, which is but an exaggeration
                    after all of the sharpest of knives, whose edge when examined under the
                    microscope exhibits an array of saw teeth so minute as to present a smooth plane
                    to the unassisted eye. As the chief use of the tool is to saw wood, the enormous
                    timber industry of America has given an impetus to the improvement of the saw
                    and its manufacture, which has no parallel elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Saws may be classified as (1) straight (reciprocating in action), having a flat
                    blade and straight edge, making a plane cut, or (2) circular or disk-like,
                    cutting at right angles to the motion, or (3) cylindrical or barrel-shaped, with
                    a convex edge cutting parallel to its axis, or (4) band-saws, being a continuous
                    ribbon or band running upon an upper and lower pulley, making a plane or curved
                    cut, with a straight edge parallel to the axis of motion. The oldest and
                    commonest, with the widest range of adaptability, is the straight saw, with
                    reciprocating rectilinear blade. In this class is included the ordinary hand-saw
                    with its varying range of uses from fine to coarse and from rip to cross-cut,
                    and with teeth of forms as various as are the different duties which it is
                    calculated to perform. The teeth are long or short, cutting one way or both ways
                    according to the “pitch” or “set” which may be given, and which should be
                    adapted to both the kind and character of the timber to be sawn. The “pitch” of
                    a saw-tooth is the angle of the point with reference to the blade, and is found
                    by subtracting the back angle from the front, 60° being the generic angle of
                    saw-teeth, which, however, may be variously placed. From the smallest hand-saw
                    to the largest “mill-saw” the same general rules apply. In the largest saws of
                    this class may be named the “pit-saw,” used in the earliest manufactures of
                    lumber or timber, and worked by one person standing over the log and drawing
                    upward while another in the pit below follows with the downward or cutting
                    thrust. From the pit-saw we advance to the “gate-saw” used in the earlier
                    adaptation of motive power to the cutting of timber, thence to the
                        “muley-saw,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>According to some writers the term “muley” (or mulay) is derived
                            from the German “Miihlsage,” mill-saw, but, as this form of saw, when
                            introduced, differed only from the ordinary mill-saws long in use in the
                            manner in which it was hung (free from strain), the name may have been
                            given to signify “hornless, indicating the absence of the ponderous gate

                    sustain the heavy thrusts which they are expected to endure, and are
                    consequently of “heavy gauge,” this being based upon the different sizes of

                    4-gauge saw is much thicker than an 8-gauge, &amp;c. From the necessity for more
                    rapid production grew the ‘ ‘ gang-saw," a modification of the gate, differing
                    from it only in length and thickness (less than one-third the thickness of the
                    ordinary gate-saw and but about two-thirds its length). A large number of these,
                    varying from 2 to 40, are strained in a gate or frame, at such distances apart
                    as the thickness of lumber demands, and the log is wholly made into boards in
                    one operation, Of the reciprocating class of saws is the “cross-cut,” used for
                    cutting across the grain of the timber or wood to be converted into shorter
                    lengths. The length, breadth, “pitch,” and “set” of saws vary according to the
                    use which is to be made of them and the kind of timber which is to be
                    manipulated. In a cross-cut saw the cutting edge strikes the fibre at right
                    angles to its length, and while its pitch is but slight (if any) it must sever
                    from each side before dislodging the sawdust. “A slitting or ripping saw has the
                    cutting edge about at a right angle to the fibre of the wood, severing it in one
                    piece,—the throat of the tooth wedging out the piece.” In slitting saws the
                    “rake” is all in front, in the cross-cut on the side.</p>
                <p>The circular saw is of comparatively recent origin, its introduction dating from
                    1790, when Brunel first announced the principle. At first only circular saws of
                    small diameter were used; but, from the small “buzz-saw” of the watchmaker and
                    fine metal worker, or the ripping saw of the planing-mill or carpenter shop,
                    where small diameters have to be divided, the circular saw has passed to the
                    saw-mill, where, in diameters of from 12 to 30 inches, it is the heedful
                    instrument for edging or ripping the lumber which drops from the log in an
                    imperfect condition, requiring finer manipulation to prepare it for market; or
                    in diameters of from 40 to 84 inches it may be found as the main saw of the mill
                    for rending the logs as they come from the forest into shapes and sizes adapted
                    for the various purposes of the builder. It is capable of dividing logs into
                    boards one inch thick or upwards at as high a rate as 60,000 superficial feet in
                    a day of twelve hours, while a straight (muley or gate) saw would give only 5000
                    to 8000 feet. In the chief lumber sections of the United States saws of 60
                    inches diameter are in most common use; upon the Pacific coast saws of 8 feet
                    diameter are not unknown. Attempts to work large circular saws in nests or gangs
                    have not hitherto proved successful, but three, four, or five saws of 30 inches
                    diameter hung on a single shaft or “arbor” may be used to trim and divide the
                    boards or planks thrown off from a log.</p>
                <p>Barrel saws, for the manufacture of staves for barrels, pails, or tubs, are in
                    the form of a straight-sided barrel with both heads removed, and the stave ends
                    of one head serrated.</p>
                <p>For the manufacture of veneers, where valuable timber is to be economically
                    manipulated, we have the segment-saw, constructed by bolting segments of
                    saw-blades upon the outer rim of a castiron centre, forming a circular saw of
                    the desired diameter, but with a cutting edge of so light a gauge as to waste
                    but little of the valuable timber to bo sawed, the cast-iron centre insuring the
                    requisite stiffness and strength. With these saws veneers scarcely thicker than
                    a sheet of paper may be cut, the width being according to the size of the log;
                    such saws are often from 80 to 100 inches in diameter.</p>
                <p>Circular saws of the larger size are often constructed with “inserted” teeth. A
                    disk of steel of suitable size, having slots cut in its periphery of the exact
                    size and shape of the tooth which is to be inserted, may have these teeth
                    removed as often as the wear upon them may require, without reducing the
                    diameter of the plate. The teeth of lumber saws have to be sharpened with the
                    file at least three or four times in twelve hours’ work, and a saw of five feet
                    in diameter is rapidly reduced in size with a great loss of efficiency. In the
                    insert tooth plate new teeth cost only about three cents (l½ d.) each, and the
                    saw plate remains of its original diameter. Inserted teeth are of various forms
                    and shapes, from that of the ordinary saw tooth, held in place by a rivet at the
                    root of the tooth, to a “chisel point” held by an ingenious system of
                    wedging.</p>
                <p>Band-saws have for many years been used for continuous and rapid cutting in the
                    planing mill or other wood-working establishment, where scrolls or fancy lines
                    and curves were to be followed, requiring great flexibility of the saw-blade, of
                    late, and notably within the past two years (1884-85), successful endeavours
                    have been made to adapt them to lumber manufacture. The band-saw is a continuous
                    blade or ribbon running over pulleys above and below, forming a “steel belt”
                    whose serrated edge is always “in the cut.” These saws are usually from a half
                    inch in width (for shop work) to six and eight inches wide for the heavier work
                    of the saw-mill, and in the latter have a cutting capacity of from 30,000 to
                    40,000 superficial feet in twelve hours. They are extremely thin (usually
                    16-gauge), and the kerf produced ‘is so much less than that of the upright or
                    the circular that a saving of at least 20 per cent. of timber is claimed in
                    their use.</p>
                <p>Saws used by surgeons, butchers, and in all branches of manufacture are but
                    modifications of one of the varieties above described, and do not demand more
                    extended description.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Saw-Mills</hi> are factories for the conversion of forest trees
                    into lumber and timber. The earliest form of saw-mill was unquestionably the
                    saw-pit, still found in a modified form in shipbuilders’ yards, the log being
                    raised on trestle horses instead of one of the sawyers being sunk in the pit.
                    Saws were run by windmill-power as early as the 13th century; and the use of
                    water-power soon followed. The primitive water saw-mill consisted of a wooden
                    pitman attached to the shaft of the water-wheel, the log to be sawed being
                    placed on rollers sustained by a framework over the wheel, and being fed forward
                    on the rollers by means of levers worked by hand. Good authorities mention
                    saw-mills running by water-power in Germany as early as 1322. In 1663 an attempt
                    to establish a mill in England was abandoned owing to the opposition of the
                    sawyers, and no further attempt was made till 1768, when a mill was erected at
                    Limehouse, but was soon destroyed by a mob. North America, with its vast
                    forests, may be aptly termed the home of saw-mills. As early as 1634 a saw-mill
                    was erected at the falls of the Piscataqua, near the line dividing Maine from
                    New Hampshire. This was no doubt the pioneer of the vast array of mills which
                    subsequently made Maine famous as a lumber-producing State for many years. From
                    about the same date several mills were erected along the Atlantic coast of
                    America, a description of one being that of all. In these mills the saw was
                    attached by a long pitman from the wheel shaft to a ponderous gate, running in
                    wooden slides upon two heavy posts, crossed above by a beam connecting the two
                    sides of the mill-frame. The mill-carriage on which the log lay was pushed
                    towards the saw by a rack and pinion, &amp;c., moved by a feed-wheel. The daily
                    capacity of these mills was from 500 to 1500 superficial feet. The first great
                    improvement upon this class of mills was in the introduction of two or more saws
                    to the gate, the general character of the methods remaining the same. With the
                    demand for more rapid production came improvements in the “gang” feature, and
                    the wonder of the age was the “Yankee gang,” so arranged, by placing half the
                    saws facing in one direction and the other half in the opposite, that two logs
                    were worked up in one movement of the carriage, or, as in the “slabbing” gang,
                    the outsides or slabs were cut from one log, which was then turned upon its
                    flattened sides to the other set of saws which cut it into boards. The “stock”
                    gang, “pony” gang, “slabbing” gang, and “Yankee” gang are favourites with
                    saw-mill proprietors, because of the uniform character of the lumber produced,
                    and the saving of timber realized from the use of saws of scarcely one-third the
                    thickness of the gate, muley, or circular.</p>
                <p>Gang-saws are seldom thicker than 14-gauge, and are successfully worked at
                    18-gauge, making a saw-kerf or waste of but <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 8</hi> inch, whereas the ordinary gate, muley, or circular
                    takes <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi> inch. The
                    muley was introduced later than the gang, and was received with great favour,
                    entering into more general use because of its comparative cheapness and
                    adaptability where the sawyer had not to deal with large quantities of lumber.
                    The muley mill dispensed with the ponderous gate and heavy posts of the
                    saw-frame. While the lower portion of the mill is arranged much as in the use of
                    the gate-saw, with the addition of necessary slides, the upper end of the saw is
                    guided in a strong iron frame pendent from the weigh-beam overhead. On each side
                    of this frame are slides in which arc placed boxes, attached by a noddle pin and
                    strap to the upper end of the saw, keeping the tool in line with the cut, and
                    the cutting is accomplished wholly by the downward thrust, the motion of the
                    crank beneath imparting a forward motion to the blade in its cutting functions
                    and a retreating motion as it rises from the cut. By an ingenious arrangement of
                    the slides an increased oscillation may be imparted, the object being to cause
                    the saw-teeth to hug the timber closer on the downward or cutting thrust, and to
                    recede and run clear of the timber on the upward motion, thus decreasing the
                    friction. Muley-saws are usually run at a speed of 300 revolutions of the
                    driving wheel per minute, and the daily capacity may be stated at about 5000
                    superficial feet.<pb break="no"

                    saw-mills until 1835, after which year steam was rapidly substituted, until at
                    the present time it is as difficult to find a water-power saw-mill as it is to
                    find a gate or muley.</p>
                <p>The use of the circular as the main saw of a mill is of comparatively recent
                    origin, the experimental point in its introduction having been passed only about
                    the year 1855. Since that time it has rapidly reached the highest efficiency.
                    Driven by engines of from 25 to 100 horse-power the circular saw-mill, under
                    proper management, turns out from 20,000 feet per day for smaller to 50,000 and
                    60,000 feet per day for larger mills, in addition to running the double-edgers
                    and trimming saws, requisite for trimming off the rough edges' and bad ends of
                    the lumber produced.</p>
                <p>The modern saw-mill stands upon the banks of a river or pond, at an elevation
                    usually of twelve feet from the level of the land to the saw-floor. The logs are
                    floated from the forest (often many hundred miles distant from the mill) down
                    the river, in lengths as desired. Piling driven at convenient distances in the
                    water serves to hold the long pieces of timber, which, secured to the piles by
                    heavy chains, form a strong “boom,” floating into which the logs are penned or
                    “boomed” until required. From the rear end of the mill, at the second story or
                    saw-floor, a “jack ladder” is constructed of heavy timber, the lower ends
                    resting in the bottom of the stream upon a bed of timber heavily weighted. Upon
                    the sides of the jack ladder are laid ribbons of iron forming a track for the
                    log car, which, strongly constructed and with its top cross sections or “bunks”
                    heavily studded with /\-headed bolts, is run under the water at a depth to allow
                    the log to float over it in such manner that, as the chain running to the
                    “bull-wheel” in the mill is wound up, the spikes of the car catch upon the
                    under-side of the log or logs, which thus load themselves and are hauled up the
                    incline to the mill floor. Here they are rolled upon skids leading to the
                    saw-carriage, and are soon running rapidly their course of manufacture. Loaded
                    upon the “head-blocks,” by a quick motion of a lever upon the standard, the
                    “setter” inserts an iron “dog,” which holds the log firmly in place ready for
                    advancing to the saw. This is accomplished by one of several methods :—(1) by
                    rack and pinion worked by “cone feed,” in which a belt is moved upon two
                    parallel cones to impart a more rapid or a slower motion to the pinion shaft;
                    (2) by “rope feed,” a rope, usually of wire, being attached to each end of the
                    mill carriage, and passing over pulleys in the floor to a drum beneath, so
                    arranged as to be under control of the sawyer in its feeding movement or in
                    reversal to “gig” the carriage back to its first position; or (3) by “steam
                    feed.” This is the more modern and rapid means employed, and is sometimes termed
                    “lightning feed.” A steam cylinder of 8 or 10 inches diameter is laid upon the
                    floor of the mill beneath the saw-carriage, its piston connecting with the
                    carriage. Steam being admitted to the driving end of the cylinder (the length of
                    which is according to the length of timber to be sawed, sections being added or
                    removed at pleasure) the saw carriage is driven with lightning speed, both in
                    the cutting feed and reversing “gig.” Thirty ordinary cuts per minute, on 12
                    inches feed to the revolution of the saw, may be attained with this adaptation.
                    As the limit of capacity for work with a circular saw is practically the ability
                    of the operators to remove the lumber, 60,000 to 70,000 feet per day is no
                    unusual cut, while a rate of 100,000 feet per day has been maintained (for a
                    short period) by a single circular. The lumber as it drops from the saw falls
                    upon “live rolls,” a series of iron or wooden rollers connected by chain belts,
                    which carry it within reach of the “edger,” who rapidly passes that portion
                    which requires “edging” or splitting through the “double-edger,” to a carriage
                    or truck on which it is pushed to the piling ground, or, in some mills, to
                    another series of live rolls which take it to the front of the “trimmer,” an
                    ingenious arrangement of table, beneath which are several saws which advance or
                    recede at the operator’s pleasure, cutting the lumber to even and uniform
                    lengths, or trimming off such defects as may exist in the end of the piece.
                    Ordinary lengths are 12, 14, 16, and 18 feet, and by use of the trimmer all
                    superfluous ends are removed, leaving each piece of uniform length with its
                    fellows. The waste of the log, consisting of the “slabs” and edgings, are
                    carefully gone over, and such as are suitable for that purpose go to the “lath”
                    machines, where they are cut into strips four feet in length, 3/8 inch thick,
                    and 1½ inches wide, for lath and plaster work. In the sawing of logs,
                    imperfections are often discovered in the timber, unfitting it for ordinary
                    uses, and in many mills it is customary to saw such timber into “cants” of
                    usually six inches thickness. These cants are turned over to a “butting saw,”
                    where they are cut into lengths of 16 inches (in some localities 18 inches) and
                    turned over to the shingle mill to be manufactured into shingles. Shingles are
                    tapering pieces 3/8 inch thick at one end, and inch at the other, and are used
                    as a roof covering in lieu of slating or tiles. They are laid in uniform
                    courses, with 4½ to 5 inches of the butt end laid to the weather, and are good
                    for from 20 to 30 years’ wear upon a roof. An adjunct to the circular saw is
                    often found in a top or upper saw, overhanging the main circular a little in
                    advance of its track, for the purpose of enabling larger logs to be handled than
                    the diameter of an ordinary circular will permit. The upper saw cuts into the
                    top of the log in a line with the cut of the lower or main saw, thus increasing
                    the depth of the cut. In California, where logs of 8 and 10 feet diameter are
                    not unusual (larger logs being quartered by the use of gunpowder or other
                    explosive, timber as much as 20 and even 25 feet in diameter being found in the
                    redwood forests), an ingenious arrangement of four saws placed one higher than
                    the other, some horizontal and others vertical, permits the handling of huge
                    trees which until recently were not considered available. A thoroughly modern
                    saw-mill embraces all which has been said regarding the circular, with the
                    addition of the “gang” feature, for, while a majority of the saw-mills of North
                    America are single “circulars,” many of them have a rotary upon each side of the
                    mill floor, the log-jack being in the centre of the building rolling its logs
                    either to the right hand or the left. The larger mills have in addition to the
                    rotaries from one to four gangs. In these cases the log usually goes first to
                    the circular, where the slabs of two sides are removed, leaving a flat cant,
                    which is then transferred to the gangs. These mills are fully equipped with all
                    the modern patent improvements. The logs are drawn from the water by an endless
                    chain running in a V-shaped log slide, the chains being provided either with
                    spikes or concave chairs which hold the log from slipping back. One log follows
                    the other in endless succession. O11 its arrival at the log deck on the mill
                    floor, the manipulation of a lever causes an arm or arms to rise through the
                    floor against the side of the log, which is partially raised and thrown with
                    considerable force upon the skids leading to the saw carriage. When one log has
                    been sawed, another is loaded by the simple touch of a lever in the hands of the
                    sawyer, causing arms to rise in the skids under the log, which is thrown upon
                    the carriage ready for the saw. When the first slab has been removed, the
                    sawyer’s touch of a lever brings through the floor the “nigger,” a piece of
                    strong timber, iron-bound and with sharp teeth or spikes protruding from its
                    front face. Its motion tends slightly forward as it advances to a height of five
                    or six feet above the floor, its spiked surface catching the side or face of the
                    log, turning it instantly to any desired position. If the log is simply to be
                    “canted” for the gang the two opposite sides or slabs are removed, and as the
                    last cut is complete a hook thrown over the rear end of the cant prevents its
                    return with the saw carriage and it drops upon rolls which move it so far out of
                    the way of the returning carriage with its fresh load as is necessary to start
                    it in an opposite direction to the gang which is to complete its manufacture.
                    Until now, and until it shall emerge from the gang, no hand of man has
                    necessarily touched the log. Machinery guided by human intelligence has done all
                    the work. When the log reached the carriage it was dogged, not with the
                    old-fashioned lever dog driven by a mallet, but by the simple movement of a
                    lever. It was brought to its proper position before the saw by nicely adjusted
                    set works, which graduated its position to one-eighth of an inch. After the slab
                    was removed, if another cut was required the same set works moved it forward
                    with lightning quickness, leaving it at the exact point, to a nicety, requisite
                    for the production of just the thickness desired for the next piece. From the
                    water to the pile in the millyard hands have necessarily been employed in actual
                    handling of the product only at the edger and the trimmer, and in assorting the
                    qualities upon the tram-car which removes it from the mill. Machinery, guided by
                    human intelligence, has done all the heavy work. A mill answering closely to our
                    description was recently burned at Bay City, Michigan, the yearly production of
                    which for several years past has been 40,000,000 feet of lumber, besides
                    shingles, lath, pickets, &amp;c., cut from the slabs and waste. The total
                    production of the sawmills of the United States approximates 26,000,000,000 feet
                    annually.</p>
                <p>The “band” saw-mill is rapidly working its way into public favour because of the
                    economy attending its use. The band saw is a long ribbon of steel, six to eight
                    inches in width, running over large pulleys above and below, the upper pulley
                    running almost vertically above the lower, the saw acting as a belt between the
                    two and as the driving power to the upper wheel. These saws are very thin and
                    have a manufacturing capacity of from 30,000 to 40,000 feet per day, with the
                    consumption of 25 to 40 per cent. less power than is required for the ordinary
                    circular saw of the same daily capacity for work. The main advantage found in
                    the use of the band-saw is in the saving of timber (20 per cent.). The set works
                    do not differ from those of rotary mills, and either cone, rope, or steam feed
                    may be used in connexion with it.</p>
                <p>A useful adjunct to the many saw-mills, which produce more waste than can be
                    consumed in raising the necessary steam, is the “slab-burner” or “hell,” a large
                    circular brick furnace often 50 feet in height by 25 feet internal diameter,
                    erected . conveniently near the saw-mill, into which by chain carriers leading
                    to an opening at a sufficient height from the bottom, the sawdust,<pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Shingle Mills.—</hi> A standard shingle is four inches wide,
                    and all computations of quantity are based upon that width, although the
                    individual shingle may be six or eight inches wide or as much as 18 inches, in
                    the latter case counting 4½ shingles. A shingle mill differs from a saw-mill in
                    the adaptations of machinery. Saws of 16-gauge, 40 inches in diameter, are most
                    commonly employed. In cases where shingle manufacture is carried on in connexion
                    with the saw-mill, the process of preparing the blocks has already been
                    described. A majority of the shingles manufactured, however, are made in mills
                    built for the special purpose. Logs suitable, usually of a medium quality, are
                    placed before a “bolting” or “drag” saw, which severs them into the required
                    length. The block is then stripped of its bark and sap by splitting off a
                    section of the outer circumference to the heart wood, with axes; it is next
                    quartered, and the inside section of heart, which is never sound, removed; and
                    then it goes to the machine for manufacture. The machines are sometimes
                    horizontal, sometimes vertical, but all work upon the same principle, viz., that
                    of a tilting table, allowing a thick butt and a thin point to be alternately
                    taken. The shingles as they drop from the saw are rough-edged, and require to be
                    “jointed,” generally upon a rapidly revolving wheel, upon the face of which are
                    secured four well-balanced knives, which, as the shingle is pressed against
                    them, eat away the imperfect edge with great rapidity, leaving a straight smooth
                    edge, which when laid upon a roof makes a good joint with its fellows. The
                    edging or jointing process is often performed with small saws in place of the
                    wheel-jointer. The shingles are usually packed in bunches containing the
                    equivalent of one quarter thousand 4-inch pieces, and are more used for roof
                    covering than any other material in the United States or Canada. (G. W. H.)</p>
