                    brief handwriting which are intended to enable a person to write legibly at the
                    rate of speech. (For the ancient Latin and Greek tachygraphy, see the last part
                    of the article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Palaeography.)</hi> In the 10th century
                    all practical acquaintance with the shorthand systems of Greece and Rome faded
                    completely away, and not till the beginning of the 17th can the art be said to
                    have revived. But even during that interval systems of writing seem to have been
                    practised which for speed approximated to modern shorthand.<note anchored="true"

                        >Shorthand in English-speaking Countries.—</hi> England was the birthplace
                    of modern shorthand, and at the present time there is no country in Europe,
                    except perhaps Germany and German Switzerland, where the art is so extensively
                    practised as in England. The first impulse to its cultivation may possibly be
                    traced to the Reformation. When the principles of that movement were being
                    promulgated from the pulpit, a desire to preserve the discourses of the preacher
                    naturally suggested the idea of accelerated writing. It is certainly striking
                    that in the early systems so many brief arbitrary signs are provided to denote
                    phrases common in the New Testament and Protestant theology. Up to the present
                    time (1886) not less than 483 professedly distinct systems of English shorthand
                    have been published, and doubtless many more have been invented for private use.
                    It is impossible here to notice even by name more than a very few of them.
                    Indeed, if we reject all those systems which are imitations or reproductions of
                    earlier ones, and systems which are so unpractical as to be little better than
                    elegant toys, and a multitude of utterly worthless catchpenny publications, only
                    a few remain. In Dr Timothy Bright’s<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            the other letters of the alphabet by a straight line with a hook,
                            circle, or tick added at the beginning. Each alphabetic sign placed in
                            various positions, and having some additional mark at the end, was used
                            to indicate arbitrarily chosen words beginning with <hi rend="italic">a,
                                b, c, d,</hi> &amp;c. There were four slopes given to each letter
                            and twelve ways of varying the base, so that forty-eight words could be
                            written under each letter of the alphabet if necessary. Thus the sign
                            for <hi rend="italic">b</hi> with different terminal marks and written
                            in four different directions signified a number of words commencing with
                                <hi rend="italic">b</hi>; 537 such signs had to be learned by heart.
                            By adding certain external marks these signs were applied to other
                            words: thus by writing a dot in one of two positions with respect to a
                            sign the latter was made to represent either a synonym or a word of
                            opposite meaning. Under <hi rend="italic">air</hi> are given as synonyms

                            each letter in their appropriate situations, so as to distinguish the

                    The first shorthand system worthy of the name which, so far as is known,
                    appeared in England is that of John Willis, whose <hi rend="italic">Art of

                    alphabetic signs, and the confused laborious contrivances by which he denotes
                    prefixes and terminations, involving the continual lifting of the pen, would
                    seem to render his method almost as slow as longhand. Of the 201 systems which
                    intervene between J. Willis’s and Isaac Pitman’s phonography (1837) nearly all
                    are based, like Willis’s, on the alphabet, and may be called a, b, c systems.
                    But seven are, like phonography, strictly phonetic, viz., those by Tiffin
                    (1750), Lyle (1762), Holdsworth and Aldridge (1766), Roe (1802), Phineas Bailey
                    (1819), Towndrow (1831), and De Stains (1839). Of the 281 systems which have
                    appeared since phonography a very large proportion are merely imitations of that
                    system, or proceed on the same lines.</p>
                <p>A few general remarks apply largely to all the a, b, c systems. Each letter is
                    designated by a straight line or curve (vertical, horizontal, or sloping),
                    sometimes with the addition of a hook or loop. <hi rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">q</hi> are rejected, <hi rend="italic">k</hi> being
                    substituted for hard <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q, s</hi>
                    for soft <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> Signs are provided for <hi rend="italic">ch,
                        sh, th. G</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j</hi> are classed under one sign,
                    because in some words <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is pronounced as <hi
                        rend="italic">j,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">giant, gem.</hi> Similarly
                    each of the pairs f, <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italic">z</hi> has only one sign. A few authors make the signs for <hi
                        rend="italic">j</hi>, <hi rend="italic">v, z</hi> heavier than those for <hi
                        rend="italic">g, f, s.</hi> Some class <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">b, t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> each under one sign.
                    The stenographic alphabet is therefore— <hi rend="italic">a, b, d,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">e, f (v), g (j), h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p,r, s (z), t, u, w,
                        x,y, ch, sh th.</hi> Letters which are not sounded may be omitted. <hi
                        rend="italic">Gh, ph</hi> may be counted as <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in such
                    words as <hi rend="italic">cough, Philip;</hi> but the <hi rend="italic">th</hi>
                    in <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> is never distinguished from the <hi
                        rend="italic">th</hi> in <hi rend="italic">them.</hi> Thus the a, b, c
                    systems are largely phonetic with respect to consonant-sounds; it is rather with
                    regard to the vowels that they disregard the phonetic principle. No attempt is
                    made to provide adequately for the many vowel-sounds of the language. Thus the
                    signs for <hi rend="italic">like</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lick,</hi> for <hi
                        rend="italic">rate</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rat,</hi> &amp;c., are the
                    same. In the case of vowel-sounds denoted by two letters, that vowel is to be
                    written which best represents the sound. Thus in <hi rend="italic">meat</hi> the
                        <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is selected, but in <hi rend="italic">great</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> In some a, b, c systems, including the best of
                    them (Taylor’s), a dot placed anywhere does duty for all the vowels. This
                    practice is, of course, a fruitful source of error, for <hi rend="italic"
                        >pauper</hi> and <hi rend="italic">paper, gas</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >goose,</hi> and hundreds of other pairs of words would according to this
                    plan be written alike. In the early systems of Willis and his imitators the
                    vowels are mostly written either by joined characters or by lifting the pen and
                    writing the next consonant in a certain position with respect to the preceding
                    one. Both these plans are bad; for lifting the pen involves expenditure of time,
                    and vowels expressed by joined signs and not by marks external to the word
                    cannot be omitted, as is often necessary in swift writing, without changing the
                    general appearance of the word and forcing the eye and the hand to accustom
                    themselves to two sets of outlines, vocalized and unvocalized. In the better a,
                    b, c systems the alphabetic signs, besides combining to denote words, may also
                    stand alone to designate certain short common words, prefixes, and suffixes.
                    Thus in Harding’s edition of Taylor’s system the sign for <hi rend="italic"
                        >d,</hi> when written alone, denotes <hi rend="italic">do, did,</hi> the
                    prefixes <hi rend="italic">de-, des-,</hi> and the terminations <hi
                        rend="italic">-dom, -end, -ened, -ed.</hi> This is a good practice if the
                    words are well chosen and precautions taken to avoid ambiguities. Numbers of
                    symbolical signs and rough word-pictures, and even wholly arbitrary marks, are
                    employed to denote words and entire phrases. Symbolical or pictorial signs, if
                    sufficiently suggestive and not very numerous, may be effective; but the use of
                    "arbitraries” is objectionable because they are so difficult to remember. In
                    many shorthand books<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n862/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0862-0837"/> the student is recommended to form additional
                    ones for himself, and so of course make his writing illegible to others. The <hi
                        rend="italic">raison d'être</hi> of such signs is not far to seek. The
                    proper shorthand signs for many common words were so clumsy or ambiguous that
                    this method was resorted to in order to provide them with clearer and easier
                    outlines. For the purpose of verbatim reporting the student is recommended to
                    omit as a rule all vowels, and decipher his writing with the aid of the context.
                    But, when vowels are omitted, hundreds of pairs of words having the same
                    consonant skeleton (such as <hi rend="italic">minister</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">monastery, frontier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">furniture,
                        libel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">label)</hi> are written exactly alike. This
                    is one of the gravest defects of the a, b, c systems.</p>
                <p>John Willis’s system was largely imitated but hardly improved by Edmond Willis
                    (1618), T. Shelton (1620), Witt (1630), Dix (1633), Mawd (1635), and Theophilus
                    Metcalfe (1635). T. Shelton’s system, republished a great many times down to
                    1687, was the one which Samuel Pepys used in writing his diary.<note

                    metre (206 pages, 2 3/8 × 1 1/2 inches) was engraved according to Shelton’s
                    system by Thomas Cross. Metcalfe’s <hi rend="italic">Radio-Stenography,</hi> or

                    exist. The inefficiency of the early systems seems to have brought the art into
                    some contempt. Thus Thomas Heywood, a contemporary of Shakespeare, says in a

                    his <hi rend="italic">Pen pluck'd from an Eagle's Wing.</hi> The alphabet was
                    largely taken from Rich’s. But in his <hi rend="italic">Art's Advancement</hi>
                    (1682) only six of Rich’s letters are retained, and in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Plume Volante</hi> (1707) further changes are made. Initial vowels are
                    written by their alphabetic signs, final vowels by dots in certain positions
                        (<hi rend="italic">a, e</hi> at the beginning; <hi rend="italic">i, y</hi>
                    at the middle <hi rend="italic">; o, u</hi> at the end), and medial vowels by
                    lifting the pen and writing the next consonant in those same three positions
                    with respect to the preceding one. Mason employed 423 symbols and arbitraries.
                    He was the first to discover the value of a small circle for <hi rend="italic"
                        >s</hi> in addition to its proper alphabetic sign. Mason’s system was
                    republished by Thomas Gurney in 1740, a circumstance which has perpetuated its
                    use to the present day, for in 1737 Gurney was appointed shorthand-writer to the
                    Old Bailey, and early in the 19th century W. B. Gurney was appointed
                    shorthand-writer to both Houses of Parliament. Gurney reduced Mason’s
                    arbitraries to about a hundred, inventing a few specially suitable for
                    parliamentary reporting. The Gurneys were excellent writers of a cumbrous
                    system. Thomas Gurney’s <hi rend="italic">Brachygraphy</hi> passed through at
                    least eighteen editions, but the sale of the book has now almost ceased.</p>
                <p>In 1767 was published at Manchester a work by John Byrom, sometime fellow of
                    Trinity College, Cambridge, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Universal English
                        Shorthand,</hi> distinguished for its precision, elegance, and systematic
                    construction. Byrom had died in 1763. Having lost his fellowship by failing to
                    take orders, he made a living by teaching shorthand in London and Manchester,
                    and among his pupils were Horace Walpole, Lord Conway, Charles Wesley, Lord
                    Chesterfield, the duke of Devonshire, and Lord Camden. Shorthand, it is said,
                    procured him admission to the Royal Society. He founded a stenographic club, to
                    the proceedings of which his journal,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Byrom’s private journal and literary remains have been
                            published by the Chetham Society of Manchester. See, too, a paper by J.
                            E. Bailey in the <hi rend="italic">Phonetic Journal,</hi> 1875, pp. 109,
                            121.</p></note> written in shorthand, is largely devoted. In the
                    strangers’ gallery of the House of Commons in 1728 Byrom dared to write
                    shorthand from Sir R. Walpole and others. In 1731, when called upon to give
                    evidence before a parliamentary committee, he took shorthand notes, and,
                    complaints being made, he said that if those attacks on the liberties of
                    shorthand men went on he "must have a petition from all counties where our
                    disciples dwell, and Manchester must lead the way.” Thomas Molyneux popularized
                    the system by publishing seven cheap editions between 1793 and 1825.
                    Modifications of Byrom’s system were issued by Palmer (1774), Nightingale
                    (1811), Adams (1814), Longmans (1816), Gawtress (1819), Kelly (1820), Jones
                    (1832), and Roffe (1833). Byrom’s method received the distinction of a special
                    Act of Parliament for its protection (15 Geo. II. c. 23, for twenty-one years
                    from 24th June 1742). To secure lineality in the writing and facility in
                    consonantal joinings he provided two forms for <hi rend="italic">b, h,j, ιv, x,
                        sh, th,</hi> and three for <hi rend="italic">l, A, e, i, o, u,</hi> he
                    represented by a dot in five positions with respect to a consonant. Practically
                    it is impossible to observe more than three (beginning, middle, and end). With
                    all its merits, the system lacks rapidity, the continual recurrence of the loop
                    seriously retarding the pen.</p>
                <p>In 1786 was published <hi rend="italic">An Essay intended to establish a Standard
                        for a Universal System of Stenography,</hi> by Samuel Taylor (London). This
                    system did more than any of its predecessors to establish the art in England and
                    abroad. Equal to Byrom’s in brevity, it is simpler in construction. No letter
                    has more than one sign, except <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> which has two.
                    Considering that five vowel places about a consonant were too many, Taylor went
                    to the other extreme and expressed all the vowels alike by a dot placed in any
                    position. He directs that vowels are not to be expressed except when they sound
                    strong at the beginning and end of a word. Arbitraries he discarded altogether;
                    but Harding, who re-edited his system in 1823, introduced a few. Each letter
                    when standing alone represents two or three common short words, prefixes and
                    suffixes. But the list was badly chosen: thus <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    represents <hi rend="italic">my</hi> and <hi rend="italic">many,</hi> both of
                    them adjectives, and therefore liable to be confounded in many sentences. To
                    denote <hi rend="italic">in</hi> and <hi rend="italic">on</hi> by the same sign
                    is evidently absurd. Taylor’s system was republished again and again. The<pb

                    (London, 1865) and A. Janes (London, 1882). In Harding’s edition (1823 and at
                    least twelve times since) the vowels are written on an improved plan, the dot in
                    three positions representing <hi rend="italic">a, e, i,</hi> and a tick in two
                    positions <hi rend="italic">o</hi>, <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> Several other
                    persons brought out Taylor’s system, in particular G. Odell, whose book was
                    re-edited or reprinted not less than sixty-four times, the later republications
                    appearing at New York. The excellence of Taylor’s method was recognized on the
                    Continent: the system came into use in France, Italy, Holland, Sweden, Germany,
                    Portugal, Roumania, Hungary, &amp;c. In England at the present day no method
                    excepting Pitman’s phonography is more popular than Taylor’s, although the
                    systems which have appeared since Taylor’s are far more numerous than those
                    which preceded it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Universal Stenography</hi> of William Mavor (1780 and nine
                    times since) is a very neat system, and differs from Taylor’s in the alphabet
                    and in a more definite method of marking the vowels. <hi rend="italic">A, e,
                        i,</hi> are indicated by commas, o, <hi rend="italic">u, y,</hi> by dots, in
                    three places with respect to a letter, namely beginning, middle, and end. Other
                    systems by J. H. Lewis (1812) and Moat (1833) are still used to a small
                    extent.</p>
                <p>The vast mass of a, b, c systems are strikingly devoid of originality, and are
                    mostly imitations of the few that have been mentioned. Nearly all may be briefly
                    described as consisting of an alphabet, a list of common words, prefixes and
                    suffixes expressed by single letters, a list of arbitrary and symbolical signs,
                    a table showing the best way of joining any two letters, a few general rules for
                    writing, and a specimen plate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Pitman’s phonography, on account of its enormous diffusion in Great Britain and
                    the colonies, and in America, its highly organized and original construction,
                    and its many inherent advantages, merits a more extended notice than has been
                    given to the systems already mentioned. In 1837 Isaac Pitman, then teacher of a
                    British school at Wotton-under-Edge and an excellent writer of Taylor’s system,
                    composed at the invitation of Samuel Bagster a short stenographic treatise of
                    his own, which Bagster published under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Stenographic Sound-Hand.</hi> The price was fixed at fourpence, for the
                    author had determined to place shorthand within the reach of everybody. He had
                    won the friendship of the Bible publisher by voluntarily verifying the half a
                    million references in the <hi rend="italic">Comprehensive Bible,</hi> and Mr
                    Bagster for nine years published Mr Pitman’s shorthand books. In 1840 a second
                    edition appeared in the form of a penny plate bearing the title <hi
                        rend="italic">Phonography,</hi> the principal feature of the system being
                    that it was constructed on a purely phonetic basis. The name of Bagster helped
                    the enterprise, and the author was indefatigable in spreading the knowledge of
                    his system by lectures and gratuitous teaching through the penny post, then just
                    established. In December 1841 the first number of what is now known as the <hi
                        rend="italic">Phonetic Journal</hi> appeared at Manchester in a lithographed
                    form. It was then called the <hi rend="italic">Phonographic Journal,</hi> and
                    subsequently in turn the <hi rend="italic">Phonotypic Journal,</hi> the <hi
                        rend="italic">Phonetic News,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Phonetic
                        Journal.</hi> The chief instruction books issued by the author at the
                    present time from his press at the Phonetic Institute, Bath, are the <hi
                        rend="italic">Phonographic Teacher,</hi> a little sixpenny book for
                    beginners, of which 1,030,000 copies have been published; the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Manual of Phonography</hi> (470th thousand), in which the art is
                    sufficiently developed for the purpose of correspondence, private memoranda, and
                    easy reporting; and the <hi rend="italic">Phonographic Reporter</hi> (133d
                    thousand). The weekly circulation of the <hi rend="italic">Phonetic Journal</hi>
                    is about 20,000 copies. A part of it is printed in the phonographic character
                    from movable types. The system has been warmly taken up in America, where it has
                    been republished in more or less altered forms, especially by the author’s
                    brother Benn Pitman, and by Messrs A. J. Graham, J. E. Munson, E. Longley, and
                    Eliza B. Burns. A large number of periodicals lithographed in phonography are
                    published in England and America. The <hi rend="italic">Shorthand Magazine,</hi>
                    monthly, has existed since 1864. Of standard English books printed or
                    lithographed in phonography may be mentioned, besides the Bible, New Testament,
                    and Prayer Book, <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress, The Vicar of
                        Wakefield, Pickwick Papers, Tom Brown’s School-Days,</hi> Macaulay’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Essays</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Biographies, Gulliver’s
                        Travels,</hi> Blackie’s <hi rend="italic">Self-culture,</hi> Bacon’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Essays,</hi> and a long list of tales and selections. Numerous
                    societies have been formed in all English-speaking countries for the
                    dissemination of phonography. The largest is the Phonetic Society with 3350
                    members, who have all certificates of a knowledge of the art and engage to teach
                    through the post gratuitously. Most important towns in the United Kingdom have a
                    phonographic association. London has three. Phonography has been adapted to
                    several foreign languages, but not so successfully as Gabelsberger’s German
                    system. Mr T. A. Reed’s <hi rend="italic">French Phonography</hi> (1882) is
                    intended only for English phonographers who wish to report French speeches.
                    Other adaptations to French are by A. J. Lawson and J. R. Bruce. A society for
                    the adaptation of phonography to Italian was organized at Rome in 1883 by G.
                    Francini, who has published his results (Rome, 1883, 1886). Phonography adapted
                    to Spanish by Parody (Buenos Ayres, 1864) is practised by half the stenographers
                    employed in the senate and chamber at Buenos Ayres. It has been adapted to Welsh
                    by R. H. Morgan (Wrexham, 1876), and to German by C. L. Driesslein (Chicago,
                    1884). Phonography is steadily driving all other English systems out of the
                    field. Mr T. A. Reed stated in the <hi rend="italic">Phonetic Journal,</hi>
                    1883, p. 62, that of the 61 writers employed by the <hi rend="italic">Times,
                        Standard, Telegraph, Morning Post,</hi> and the Press Association 31 were
                    using phonography, 18 Taylor’s, 5 Gurney’s (<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    Mason’s), 4 Lewis’s, and 3 other systems; of the 67 members composing the
                    Institute of Shorthand Writers, chiefly practitioners in the law courts, 26 were
                    using phonography, 29 Taylor’s, 7 Gurney’s (<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    Mason’s), 3 Mavor’s, and 2 Lewis’s; while of the 80 members of the London
                    Shorthand Writers’ Association, chiefly employed in business offices, at least
                    five-sixths were phonographers. According to a recent (1882) history of
                    shorthand, of 291 professional stenographers in London 134 used phonography, 89
                    Taylor’s, 35 Gurney’s, 8 Lewis’s, 8 Mavor’s, and 17 other systems (Byrom’s,
                    Graham’s, Moat’s, &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>The main features of Pitman’s system must now be described. The alphabet of
                    consonant-sounds is— <hi rend="italic">p, b; t, d; ch</hi> (as in <hi
                        rend="italic">chip), j; k, g</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">gay); f, v;
                        th</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">thing), dh</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic"
                        >them); s,z∙, sh, zh</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">vision); m, n, ng</hi>
                    (as in <hi rend="italic">thing); l, r; w, y, h.</hi> The sounds <hi
                        rend="italic">p, t, ch, k</hi> are represented respectively by the four
                    straight strokes</p>
                <p>∖l∕-; and the corresponding voiced sounds <hi rend="italic">b, d, j, g</hi> by
                    exactly the same signs respectively written heavy. <hi rend="italic">F, th</hi>
                    (as in <hi rend="italic">thing), s,</hi><hi rend="italic">sh</hi> are indicated
                    by 0 respectively; the same signs written heavy and tapering to the ends are
                    used for <hi rend="italic">v, dh, z, zh</hi> respectively. <hi rend="italic">M,
                        n, l, r</hi> are denoted by &lt;-x×—A respectively. <hi rend="italic">R</hi>
                    is also represented by written upwards and in a more slanting direction than the
                    sign for <hi rend="italic">ch.</hi> The signs for <hi rend="italic">sh</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">l</hi> may be written up or down when in combination, but
                    standing alone <hi rend="italic">sh</hi> is written downwards and <hi
                        rend="italic">l</hi> upwards. The signs for <hi rend="italic">w, y, h</hi>
                    are all written upwards. <hi rend="italic">H</hi> has also 7 down. <hi
                        rend="italic">Ng, mp</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">mb), rch</hi> (or <hi
                        rend="italic">rj), lr,</hi> are represented by the signs for <hi
                        rend="italic">n, m, r, l</hi> respectively written heavy. Signs are provided
                    for the Scotch guttural <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic"
                        >loch),</hi> the Welsh <hi rend="italic">U</hi>, and the French nasal <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi>, <hi rend="italic">S</hi> is generally written by a

                    happiest devices in the whole history of shorthand. The halving of a light
                    stroke—that is, writing it half length—implies the addition of <hi rend="italic"
                        >t</hi>; the halving of a heavy stroke that of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the
                    vowel placed after (or under) the halved stroke being read between the consonant

                    By this means very brief signs are provided for hosts of syllables ending in <hi
                        rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and for a number of
                    verbal forms ending in <hi rend="italic">ed,</hi> thus — '~ <hi

                    combining the hook, the circle, and the halving principle, two or three
                    together, exceedingly brief signs are obtained for a number of consonantal
                    series consisting of the combination of a consonant with one or more of the
                    sounds <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, <hi rend="italic"

                    or circle, we are easily led to a way of distinguishing in outline between such
                    words as Γ^° <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> and i V <hi rend="subscript">
                        t</hi><hi rend="italic">coffee, ∖ pen</hi> and ∖i×. <hi rend="italic">penny,
                        race</hi> and <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> 0 <hi rend="italic">racy,</hi>
                    &amp;c. This distinction limits the number of possible readings of an
                    unvocalized outline. A large hook at the end of a stroke indicates the addition
                    of <hi rend="italic">-shon</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">in fashion, action,</hi>
                    &amp;c.). This hook easily combines with the circle 5, as in <hi rend="italic"
                        >actions, ∖</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 5</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >positions.</hi> The circle <hi rend="italic">s</hi> made large indicates
                        <hi rend="italic">ss</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sz,</hi> as in ∖j <hi

                    vowel between <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (z) may be
                    marked inside the circle, as in <hi rend="italic">exercise, %G&gt;
                        subsistence.</hi> The circle <hi rend="italic">s</hi> lengthened to a loop
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">st,</hi> as in sZ&lt;ψ, <hi rend="superscript">
                        x</hi> ≤ <hi rend="italic">post,</hi> while a longer loop indicates <hi
                        rend="italic">str,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">muster, minster.</hi> The
                    loop may be continued through the consonantal stroke and terminate in a circle
                    to denote <hi rend="italic">sts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">strs,</hi> as in
                    V&gt; <hi rend="italic">boasts, minsters.</hi> The loop written on the left or
                    lower side of a straight stroke implies the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> hook and so
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">nst,</hi> as in ⅛= <hi rend="italic">against,</hi> J
                        <hi rend="italic">danced.</hi> A curve (or a straight stroke with a final
                    hook) written double length implies the addition of <hi rend="italic">tr,
                        dr,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">thr,</hi> as in ∖ <hi rend="subscript">
                        s</hi><hi rend="italic">father, f'" letter, ^*</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> d</hi><hi rend="italic">kinder, fender,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">render.</hi> This practice is quite safe in the case of
                    curves, but a straight stroke should not be lengthened in this way when there is
                    danger of reading it as a double letter. The lineal consonant-signs may stand
                    alone to represent certain short and common words as in many of the old a, b, c
                    systems, with this difference, that in the old systems each letter represents
                    several words, but in phonography, in almost every case, only one. By writing
                    the horizontal strokes in two positions with respect to the line (above and on)
                    and the others in three positions (entirely above, resting on, and passing
                    through the line) the number is nearly trebled, and very brief signs are
                    obtained for some seventy or eighty common short words (e.g., <hi rend="italic"
                        >be, by, in, if, at, it, my, me,</hi> &amp;c. ). A few very common
                    monosyllables are represented by their vowel-marks, as . <hi rend="italic"
                        >the</hi> (remnant of C). <hi rend="italic">of</hi> (remnant of <hi
                        rend="italic">), on</hi> (remnant of ).</p>
                <p>A certain number of longer words which occur frequently are contracted, generally
                    by omitting the latter part, sometimes a middle part of the word, as in <hi
                        rend="italic">% {ksp) expect,</hi> L (<hi rend="italic">djr) danger,</hi><hi
                        rend="superscript"> c d-</hi> (⅛i∙⅛ (<hi rend="italic">krk sk)
                        characteristic, (nd f t) indefatigable.</hi> The connective phrase <hi
                        rend="italic">of the</hi> is intimated by writing the words between which it
                    occurs near to each other. <hi rend="italic">The</hi> is often expressed by a
                    short slanting stroke or tick joined to the preceding word and generally struck
                    downwards, thus <hi rend="italic">in the, for the.</hi></p>
                <p>Three principles which remain to be noticed are of such importance and advantage
                    that any one of them would go far to place phonography at the head of all other
                    systems. These are the principles of positional writing, similar outlines, and
                    phraseography. (1) The first slanting stroke of a word can generally be written
                    so as either to lie entirely above the line, or rest on the line, or run through
                    the line, thus—2≥∣,∖∣ , In the case of words composed wholly of horizontal
                    strokes the last two positions</p>
                <p>(on and through the line) coincide, as . These three positions are called first,
                    second, and third respectively. The first is specially connected with
                    first-place vowels (<hi rend="italic">ā, ă; aw, ŏ; î; oi),</hi> the second with
                    second-place vowels (<hi rend="italic">ē, ĕ; ō, ŭ</hi>), and the third with
                    third-place vowels <hi rend="italic">(ee, ĭ; ōō, ŏŏ; ou).</hi> In a fully
                    vocalized style position is not employed, but in the reporting style it is of
                    the greatest use. Thus the outline <hi rend="italic">(tm)</hi> written above the
                    line (<hi rend="underline">L—.</hi>) must be read either <hi rend="italic"
                        >time</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tom;</hi> when written resting on the line
                    (l^) <hi rend="italic">tome</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tame;</hi> when struck
                    through the line ((__) <hi rend="italic">teem,</hi><hi rend="italic">team,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">tomb.</hi> By this method the number of possible readings
                    of an unvocalized outline is greatly reduced. That word in each positional group
                    which occurs the most frequently need not be vocalized, but the others should.
                    In the case of dissyllables it is the accented vowel which decides the position;
                    thus <hi rend="italic">methoúght</hi> should be written first position (.7ΞL ),
                    m <hi rend="italic">éthod</hi> second position(<hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>
                    ~7'). (2) Another way of distinguishing between words having the same consonants
                    but different vowels is to vary the outline. The possibility of variety of
                    outline arises from the fact that many consonant-sounds have duplicate or even
                    triplicate signs, as we have seen. For instance, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> has
                    two lineal signs and a hook sign, and so each of the words <hi rend="italic"
                        >carter, curator, creature,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">creator</hi> obtains
                    a distinct outline. A few simple rules direct the student to a proper choice of
                    outline, but some difference of practice obtains among phonographers in this
                    respect. Lists of outlines for words having the same consonants are given in the
                    instruction books; the <hi rend="italic">Reporter's Assistant</hi> contains the
                    outline of every word written with not more than three strokes, and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Phonographic Dictionary</hi> gives the vocalized outline of
                    every word in the language. Aided by a true phonetic representation of sounds,
                    by occasional vocalization, variety of outline, and the context, the
                    phonographic verbatim reporter should never misread a word.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phonography is so legible that the
                            experiment of handing the shorthand notes to phonographic compositors
                            has often been tried with complete success. A speech of Richard Cobden,
                            on the Corn Laws, delivered at Bath on 17th September 1845, and
                            occupying an hour and a quarter, was reported almost verbatim, and the
                            notes, with a few vowels filled in, handed to the compositors of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Bath Journal,</hi> who set them up with the usual
                            accuracy. A notice of the occurrence appeared the next day in the <hi
                                rend="italic">Bath Journal,</hi> and was immediately transferred to
                            the columns of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and other newspapers.
                            Mr. Reed has tried the same experiment with equal success, the notes
                            being handed to the compositors in their original state <hi

                            printing-office at Bath more type-setting is done from shorthand copy
                            than from longhand. Of course it is generally unadvisable to print a
                            speech verbatim, but much time would be saved if the reporter could
                            write his copy in the “corresponding" or less brief and more vocalized
                            style of phonography. Compositors could acquire the faculty of reading
                            phonography in a very short time.</p></note> (3) Lastly, phraseography.
                    It has been found that in numberless cases two or more words may be written
                    without lifting the pen. A judicious use of this practice promotes legibility,
                    and the saving of time is very considerable. Words written thus should be
                    closely connected in sense and awkward joinings avoided. Such phrases are <hi
                        rend="italic">I am, I have, you are,</hi> rv~v <hi rend="italic">you may,
                        [&gt; it would, it would not, &lt;s''''we are, we have, c×∖^we have not,

                <p>For the sake of obtaining a good phraseogram for a common phrase, it is often
                    advisable to omit some part of the consonant outline. Thus the phrase <hi

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0865-0840"/> Of the numerous systems published since the
                    invention of phonography the principal are A. M. Bell’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Stenophonography (</hi> Edinburgh, 1852), Professor J. D. Everett’s
                    (London, 1877), Pocknell’s <hi rend="italic">Legible Shorthand</hi> (London,
                    1881), and J. M. Sloan’s adaptation of the French system of Duployé (1882). Of
                    these Professor Everett’s must be pronounced much the best. The author claims to
                    have adhered to the phonetic principle more strictly than Mr Pitman. Thus he
                    distinguishes the <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in <hi rend="italic">home, comb,</hi>
                    from that in <hi rend="italic">so,</hi> and treats <hi rend="italic">ur, er</hi>
                    as a diphthong. The alphabet is very like Mr Pitman’s in construction, light and
                    heavy sounds being represented by light and heavy strokes. The chief feature of
                    the system is that all vowels are marked in. This is done by joined signs, by
                    lengthening the preceding consonant, by separating the preceding from the
                    following consonant, by lifting the pen and writing the one consonant attached
                    to the other, and by intersection. Mr Pocknell, in his somewhat bewildering
                    system, seeks (like Mr Melville Bell) to provide a method of indicating whether
                    a consonant is preceded or followed by a vowel or vowels. To this end he gives
                    to each consonant three linear signs (two curves and a straight line), the
                    requisite number of signs being made up by using three lengths of stroke. The
                    selection of the right sign is determined by the <hi rend="italic">length</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">class</hi> of the words represented. Much energy is
                    devoted to indicate where a vowel stands, but not to what it is. The vowels,
                    when expressed, are disjoined, as in phonography and most systems. Though Mr
                    Bell’s too elaborate classification of vowels is adopted, the phonetic method of
                    representing consonants is frequently discarded in favour of the alphabetic.
                    Thus, no sign is provided for <hi rend="italic">zh</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic"
                        >vision),</hi> and the barbarous <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> (as in <hi
                        rend="italic">bright)</hi> is often retained “for the sake of legibility.”
                    Mr Pocknell goes back to the antiquated device of pictorial and arbitrary signs.
                    The Sloan-Duployan system has been vigorously propagated; but it does not
                    provide alphabetic characters for all the vowels and consonants in the language,
                    contents itself with representing not actual but “approximate” sounds, does not
                    always indicate the order in which the characters should be read, recommends the
                    frequent omission of consonants and syllables at the “discretion” of the
                    student, avoids angles, and introduces three slopes, instead of one, between the
                    perpendicular and the horizontal, and therefore is not likely to meet with
                    general acceptance.</p>
                <p>A considerable number of American systems, as well as systems based on Taylor’s
                    and Gurney’s, were issued during the early days of the republic. Since the
                    introduction of phonography into the States in 1845, the dissemination of the
                    art has gone steadily forward, and its use since 1880 has been greatly on the
                    increase, shorthand being now taught in a large number of schools. From
                    elaborate statistics given in Mr Rockwell’s <hi rend="italic">Circular of
                        Information</hi> it appears that during 1882 10,197 persons received
                    instruction in schools and classes and 2273 by correspondence. But these figures
                    probably bear no proportion to the number of persons studying without a teacher.
                    In almost every case phonography, or a modification of it, was selected for
                    instruction. American shorthand societies are very numerous, most of them having
                    been formed since 1880. Two are devoted to the Stolzean system. Of the fourteen
                    shorthand magazines which Mr Rockwell enumerates eleven are phonographic.</p>
                <p>In nine cases out of ten phonography will be found admirably adapted to the
                    purposes of verbatim reporting. But to be legible it must be written with care.
                    This necessity arises from its brevity and its use of light and heavy, halved
                    and double-length strokes. Hence a clumsy scribe may find a longer system, such
                    as Gurney’s, answer his purpose better. A theoretical knowledge of most systems
                    may be gained in a few hours. Pitman’s method is not so easily acquired, but an
                    intelligent person can master its details in a few weeks. Shorthand writing is,
                    however, mainly a matter of practice. Few can make any considerable use of it
                    with less than six months’ assiduous practice. The average rate of public
                    speaking is very slightly over 120 words a minute. Some speakers average 150.
                    The slowest utterance is now and then exchanged for a rapid flow of words, and
                    180 or 200 words a minute is no uncommon speed in certain styles of speech such
                    as the conversational,—a speed which many persons would never acquire.<note

                            a well-known American divine preaching at Westminster Abbey. The sermon
                            was carefully timed, and the words in the printed report counted. The

                    words a minute. The best method of practice in the early period is to write at
                    dictation from a book; in public speaking the frequent pauses help the writer to
                    regain lost time. The student should write on ruled paper, which checks the
                    tendency to a large sprawling hand when following a rapid speaker. Taylor’s,
                    Gurney’s, and Lewis’s systems can be written without lines, but Pitman’s only at
                    a disadvantage. Ink is preferable to pencil.</p>
                <p>Shorthand was first employed officially in the service of Parliament in 1802,
                    when a resolution was passed that “the evidence given before all committees
                    inquiring into the election of members should or might be reported by a person
                    well skilled in the art of writing shorthand,” and shortly afterwards W. B.
                    Gurney was appointed shorthand-writer in this capacity to both Houses of
                    Parliament. In 1813 a further resolution was passed by both Houses that the
                    official writer "should attend by himself or sufficient deputy when called upon
                    to take minutes of evidence at the bar of this House or in committees of the
                    same.” The lucrative office of shorthand-writer to both Houses of Parliament is
                    still held by the Gurney family. Of course most of the work is done by deputy.
                    Some of the most efficient members of Messrs Gurney’s staff are phono-graphers;
                    others use Taylor’s system. The amount of evidence given in the course of a
                    tolerably long day’s sitting may amount to 400 or 500 folios (72 words make a
                    folio), which would occupy from 12 to 15 columns of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Times</hi> in small type. The whole must often be transcribed and delivered
                    to the printers in the course of the night, and copies, damp from the press, are
                    in the hands of the members and "parties” at the beginning of the sitting on the
                    following day. Since parliament abolished election-committees and committed to
                    judges the duty of inquiring into petitions against the return of a member, an
                    official shorthand writer has to be in attendance upon the judge appointed to
                    hear any particular case. He has often a small staff of assistants. Messrs
                    Gurney or their representatives are also required to attend the sittings of the
                    House of Lords as a court of appeal to take the judgments of the law lords.
                    Finally, Government shorthand-writers are often employed in taking notes of
                    important state-trials and inquiries conducted by the various departments of
                    Government, as well as of the proceedings of Royal Commissions, whenever the
                    evidence of witnesses is taken.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>There is no full official report of the debates in the

                            moment of all strangers, including representatives of the press, by an
                            order of the House as a whole. On seven occasions of note resolutions
                            have been passed prohibiting the reporting of the proceedings of the
                            House of Commons, the last on 25th March 1771. But times have changed,
                            and members now frequently complain that their speeches are not
                            reported. To supply the deficiencies of the newspapers arrangements have
                            been made by the House with Mr Hansard for the special reporting of
                            debates in committee and those occurring at an early hour in the
                            morning, which are given only in the most summary form in the daily

                    (Frankfort, 1679, and several times afterwards until 1743) was an adaptation of
                    T. Shelton’s English system. Mosengeil (1797) first practically introduced short
                    hand writing into Germany in an adaptation of the Taylor-Bertin method.
                    Reischl's (1808) is a modification of Mosengeil's. On Horstig’s (1797) are based
                    those of an anonymous writer (Nuremberg, 1798), Heim (1820), Thon (1825), an
                    anonymous author (Tübingen, 1830), Nowack (1830), Ineichen (1831), an anonymous
                    author (Munich, 1831), and Binder (1855). Mosengeil published a second system
                    (1819) in which Horstig’s alphabet is used. On the Mosengeil-Horstig system are
                    based Berthold’s (1819) and Stark’s (1822). On Danzer’s (1800), a close
                    imitation of Taylor’s, is based that of Ellison v. Nidlef (1820). Other systems
                    are those of Leichtlen (1819); J. Brede (1827); Nowack (1834), a system in which
                    the ellipse is employed as well as the circle; Billharz (1838); Cämmerer (1848),
                    a modification of Selwyn’s phonography (1847); Schmitt (1850); Fischbäck (1857),
                    a reproduction of Taylor’s; and that of an anonymous author (1872), based on
                    Horstig, Mosengeil, and Heim. Nowack, in his later method of 1834, makes a new
                    departure in avoiding right or obtuse angles, and in endeavouring to approximate
                    to ordinary writing. This system Gabelsberger considered to be the best which
                    had appeared down to that date. F. X. Gabelsberger’s <hi rend="italic">Anleitung
                        zur deutsche Redezeichenkunst</hi> (Munich, 1834) is the most important of
                    the German systems. The author, an official attached to the Bavarian ministry,
                    commenced his system for private purposes, but was induced to perfect it on
                    account of the summoning of a parliament for Bavaria in 1819. Submitted to
                    public examination in 1829, it was pronounced satisfactory, the report stating
                    that pupils taught on this system executed their trial specimens with the
                    required speed, and read what they had written, and even what others had
                    written, with ease and certainty. The method is based on modifications of
                    geometrical forms, designed to suit the position of the hand in ordinary
                    writing. The author considered that a system composed of simple geometrical
                    strokes forming determinate angles with each other was unadapted to rapid
                    writing. He does not recognize all the varieties of sound, and makes some
                    distinctions which are merely orthographical. Soft sounds have small, light, and
                    round signs, while the hard sounds have large, heavy, and straight signs. The
                    signs too are derived from the current alphabet, so that one can find the former
                    contained in the latter. Vowels standing between consonants are not literally
                    inserted, but symbolically indicated by either position or shape of the
                    surrounding consonants, without however leaving the straight writing line. The
                    proceedings of the chambers in Austria, Bavaria, Baden, Wurtemberg, Saxony,
                    Saxe-Weimar, Coburg-Gotha, Silesia, and the Rhine provinces are reported solely
                    by writers of this method, and half the stenographers in the German reichstag
                    use it. There are in Germany and Austria more than 540 societies containing over
                    20,000 members devoted to it. It is officially taught in all the middle class
                    schools of Bavaria, Saxony, and Austria. It has been adapted to foreign
                    languages to such an extent that legislative proceedings are reported by it in
                    Prague, Agram, Pesth, Sophia, Athens, Copenhagen, Christiania, Stockholm, and
                    Helsingfors. On Gabelsberger’s system is based that of W. Stolze (1840). There
                    are nearly 400 Stolzean associations with over 8000 members. The system is
                    officially used in the Prussian, German, and Hungarian parliaments, in the last
                    two along with Gabelsberger’s. Faulmann (Vienna, 1875) attempted in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Phonographie</hi> to combine the two methods. While
                    Gabelsberger’s system has remained unchanged in principle, Stolze's has split
                    into two divisions, the old and the new. These contain many smaller factions,
                        <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Velten’s (1876) and Adler’s (1877). Arends’s
                    (1860) is copied from the French system of Fayet. Roller’s (1874) and Lehmann’s
                    (1875) are offshoots of Arends’s. Many other methods have appeared and as
                    rapidly been forgotten. The schools of Gabelsberger and Stolze can boast of a
                    very extensive shorthand literature. Gabelsberger’s system has been adapted to
                    English by A. Geiger (Dresden, 1860 and 1873), who adhered too closely to the
                    German original, and more successfully by H. Richter (London, 1886), and
                    Stolze’s by G. Michaelis (Berlin, 1863).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">French.—</hi> The earliest French system worthy of notice is
                    that of Coulon de Thévenot (1777), in which the vowels are disjoined from the
                    consonants. The methods practised at the present day may be divided into two
                    classes, those derived from Taylor’s English system, translated in 1791 by T. P.
                    Bertin, and those invented in France. The latter are (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                    Coulon de Thévenot’s; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) systems founded on the
                    principle of the inclination of the usual writing,—the best known being those of
                    Fayet (1832) and Sénocq (1842); and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) systems derived
                    from the method of Conen de Prépéan (5 editions from 1813 to 1833). Prévost, who
                    till 1870 directed the stenographic service of the senate, produced the best
                    modification of Taylor. Many authors have copied and spoilt this system of
                    Prévost. The best known are Plantier (1844) and Tondeur (1849). Zeibig thinks
                    well of A. Delaunay’s improvements on Prévost’s system. On Conen’s are based
                    those of Aimé-Paris (1822), Cadrès-Marmet (1828), Potel (1842), the Duployé
                    brothers (1868), Guénin, &amp;c. Among amateur writers the Duployan method is
                    best known, owing largely to vigorous pushing, but the profession class it among
                    the least efficient of all. Of the forty writers in the official service of
                        parliament<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n867/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0867-0842"/> twenty-two use Provost’s and those founded on
                    it (all based ultimately on Taylor’s), while ten employ methods based on
                    Conen’s.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spanish.—</hi> The father of Spanish stenography was Don
                    Francisco de Paula Marti, whose system, first published in 1803, still holds its
                    ground against all rivals. The alphabet is a combination of Taylor’s and
                    Coulon’s. By decree of 21st November 1802 a public professorship of shorthand
                    was founded in Madrid, Marti being the first professor. Founded on Marti’s
                    system are those of Serra y Ginesta (1816) and Xamarillo (1811). Of the
                    thirty-two Spanish systems enumerated by Zeibig many are merely imitations or
                    reproductions of Marti’s, and adaptations of Gabelsberger’s, Stolze’s, and
                    Pitman’s systems. That of Garriga y Marii (1863) has attained some popularity in
                    Spain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Portuguese.—</hi> Marti’s son carried his father’s system to
                    Portugal, where shorthand is still entirely unknown except in the parliament and
                    the courts. Of the twenty reporters in the senate and chamber at Buenos Ayres
                    ten use Pitman’s phonography, six Marti’s, and the rest Garriga’s. A shorthand
                    society was organized in Buenos Ayres in 1880. The systems used in the Brazilian
                    chambers are those of Silva Velho (1852) and Garriga. The reporters in the
                    assembly of Venezuela use Marti’s method.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Italian.—</hi> Italian translations and adaptations of Taylor’s
                    system succeeded one another in considerable numbers from Amanti (1809) to
                    Bianchini (1871). Delpino’s (1819) is the best. The Gabelsberger-Noe system
                    (1863) is the only other which has gained many followers. Since 1885 the debates
                    of the senate have been partly reported by the Michela stenographic machine with
                    fair results.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dutch.—</hi> J. Reijncr’s Dutch method (1673) was an adaptation
                    of Shelton’s and Bussuijt’s (1814) of Conen’s system. Sommerhausen and Bossaert
                    (1829) received prizes from the Government for their productions. The twelve
                    stenographers employed in the parliament use the system of Cornells Steger
                    (1867), president of the bureau, who translated Taylor’s work and has written a
                    history of shorthand. Gabelsberger’s system was transferred to Dutch by Rietstap
                    (1869) and Stolze’s by Reinbold (1881).</p>
                <p>Adaptations of Gabelsberger’s method have come into use in the remaining
                    countries of Europe, superseding all others.</p>
                <p>Numerous mechanical reporting machines have been invented. The best is by Michela
                    mentioned above. For a description of such machines see <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phonetic Journal</hi> for 1881, p. 274; 1884, pp. 12, 34, 35; 1885, pp. 52,
                    268, 278, 291, 447; 1886, p. 22. They take as long to learn as a shorthand
                    system, cannot easily be carried about, are liable to get out of order, and make
                    a noise.</p>
