                <p><label type="entry">ST JOHN’S</label>, the capital of Newfoundland, is situated
                    on the eastern shore of the island, 60 miles north of Cape Race, in 47° 33' 33"
                    N. lat. and 52° 45' 10" W. long, (see vol. xvii., plate V.). It is 10° 52' east
                    of Halifax, and stands on what is nearly the most eastern point of America,
                    —Cape Spear, 5 miles south of St. John’s, alone projecting a little farther
                    towards the Old World. It is 1000 miles nearer than New York to England, and but
                    1640 from the coast of Ireland. The approach to the harbour of St John’s
                    presents one of the most picturesque views along the coast of America. In a
                    lofty iron-bound coast a narrow opening occurs in the rocky wall, guarded on one
                    side by Signal Hill (520 feet) and on the other by South Side Hill (620 feet),
                    with Fort Amherst lighthouse on a rocky promontory at its base. The entrance of
                    the Narrows is about 1400 feet in width, and at the narrowest point, between
                    Pancake and Chain Rocks, the channel is not more than 600 feet wide. The Narrows
                    are half a mile in length, and at their termination the harbour trends suddenly
                    to the west, thus completely shutting out the swell from the ocean. Vessels of
                    the largest tonnage can enter at all periods of the tide. The harbour is a mile
                    in length and nearly half a mile in width. At its head is a dry dock, recently
                    completed at a cost of $550,000; it is 600 feet in length, 83 in breadth, and 26
                    in depth, capable of admitting the largest steamers afloat. The city is built on
                    sloping ground on the northern side of the harbour, on the southern side of
                    which the hills rise so abruptly from the water that there is only room for a
                    range of warehouses and oil-factories. Three principal streets, winding and
                    irregular, follow the sinuosities of the harbour and of one another the whole
                    length of the city, and these are intersected by a number of cross-streets.
                    Water Street, the principal business locality, presents a very substantial,
                    though not handsome, appearance, the houses being of stone or brick. Shops,
                    stores, and counting-houses occupy the ground floor, while many of the merchants
                    and shopkeepers live in the upper stories. Fish-stores, warehouses, and wharves
                    project from behind on the side next the harbour. The city, three-fourths of
                    which are still of<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0193-0176"/> wood, is rapidly extending in several directions,
                    and in recent years many dwelling-houses of an improved description have been
                    erected. There is an abundant supply of excellent water, brought in pipes from a
                    lake 5 miles off. Epidemics are rare, and the city is very healthy. Of the
                    public buildings the most important are Government House, a substantial and
                    spacious building erected in 1828 by the Imperial Government; the colonial
                    building (1847), containing the chambers of the legislature and Government
                    offices; the athenaeum (1877), containing a public hall, library, reading-room,
                    savings bank, museum, &amp;c. The foundation of a new post-office was laid in
                    the same year. The churches are—the Church of England and Roman Catholic
                    cathedrals, St Thomas’s and St Mary’s (Church of England), St Patrick’s, three
                    Methodist churches, St Andrew’s Presbyterian church, and the Congregational
                    church. The manufacture of seal and cod oils has long been carried on upon an
                    extensive scale. Of late years other manufactures have been introduced, and have
                    made considerable progress. There are three iron-foundries, two large
                    machine-shops, two boot and shoe factories, a nail-factory, three
                    furniture-factories, two tobaccofactories, soap-works, two tanneries, and a
                    large and well-equipped factory for the manufacture of cables, ropes, twines,
                    nets, seines, &amp;c. The export trade in fish of various kinds, fish oils, seal
                    oil, and seal skins is very large; the greater part of all the imports into
                    Newfoundland also arrives at St John’s. The city is not yet (1886) incorporated,
                    the Colonial Board of Works having charge of all civil affairs. The population,
                    which in 1780 was 1605, had in 1801 increased to 3420, in 1812 to 7075, in 1835
                    to 15,000, and in 1874 to 23,890, and in 1884 it was 28,610 (Roman Catholics,
                    17,693; Episcopalians, 5741; Methodists, 3715; Presbyterians, 973;
                    Congregationalists, 465; other denominations, 23). The census last mentioned
                    also shows the population of the whole island and Labrador to be 197,589, being
                    an increase of 36,209 since 1874, or at the rate of about 22 per cent. in ten
                    years. The population of the Atlantic coast of Labrador, which is under the
                    jurisdiction of Newfoundland, was 4211,—1347 being Eskimo.</p>
