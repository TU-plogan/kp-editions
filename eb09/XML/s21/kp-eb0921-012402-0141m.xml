                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Observance of the Sabbath.—</hi> The later Jewish Sabbath,
                    observed in accordance with the rules of the Scribes, was a very peculiar
                    institution, and for <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ed one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> ost marked distinctions between the Hebrews and other nations, as
                    appears in a striking way from the fact that on this account alone the Romans
                    found themselves compelled to exe <hi rend="italic">m</hi> pt the Jews from all
                    military service. The rules of the Scribes enumerated thirty-nine main kinds of
                    work forbidden on the Sabbath, and each of these prohibitions gave rise to new
                    subtilties. Jesus’s disciples, for example, who plucked ears of corn in passin
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi> throu <hi rend="italic">g</hi> h a field on the holy
                    day, had, accordin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> to Rabbinical casuistry, violated
                    the third of the thirty-nine rules, which forbade harvesting; and in healin <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> the sick Jesus Himself broke the rule that a sick <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> an should not receive medical aid on the Sabbath unless his
                    life was in dan <hi rend="italic">g</hi> er. In fact, as our Lord puts it, the
                    Rabbinical theory see <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ed to be that the Sabbath was not
                    made for <hi rend="italic">m</hi> an but man for the Sabbath, the observance of
                    which was so <hi rend="italic">m</hi> uch an end in itself that the rules
                    prescribed for it did not require to be justified by appeal to any lar <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> er principle of reli <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ion or
                    humanity. The precepts of the law were valuable in the eyes of the Scribes
                    because they were the seal of Jewish particularis <hi rend="italic">m</hi>, the
                    barrier erected between the world at lar <hi rend="italic">g</hi> e and the
                    exclusive community of Jehovah’s <hi rend="italic">g</hi> race. For this purpose
                    the most arbitrary precepts were the most effective, and none were more so than
                    the complicated rules of Sabbath observance. The ideal of the Sabbath which all
                    these rules ai <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ed at realizin <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    was absolute rest from everythin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> that could be called
                    work; and even the exercise of those offices of humanity which the strictest
                    Christian Sabbatarians re <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ard as a service to God, and
                    therefore as specially appropriate to His day, was looked on as work. To save
                    life was allo <hi rend="italic">w</hi> ed, but only because danger to life
                    “superseded the Sabbath.” In like manner the special ritual at the temple
                    prescribed for the Sabbath by the Pentateuchal law was not re <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> arded as any part of the hallowin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> of the sacred
                    day; on the contrary, the rule was that, in this re <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    ard, “Sabbath was not kept in the sanctuary.” Strictly speakin <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi>, therefore, the Sabbath was neither a day of relief to toilin <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> humanity nor a day appointed for public <hi rend="italic"
                    >w</hi> orship; the positive duties of its observance were to wear one’s best
                    clothes, eat, drink, and be <hi rend="italic">g</hi> lad (justified fro <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> Isa. lviii. 13). A <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ore directly
                    reli <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ious element, it is true, was introduced by the
                    practice of attendin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> the syna <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    o <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ue service; but it is to be remembered that this
                    service was primarily regarded not as an act of worship but as a <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> eetin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> for instruction in the law.
                    So far, therefore, as the Sabbath existed for any end outside itself it was an
                    institution to help every Jew to learn the law, and from this point of view it
                    is re <hi rend="italic">g</hi> arded by Philo and Josephus, who are accustomed
                    to seek a philosophical justification for the peculiar institutions of their
                    reli <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ion. But this certainly was not the leadin <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> point of view with the mass of the Rabbins;<note

                    >m</hi> ust either have been entirely different from the Sabbath of the Scribes,
                    or else must have been a <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ere day of idleness and

                    inconceivable, for, thou <hi rend="italic">g</hi> h <hi rend="italic">m</hi> any
                    of the reli <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ious ideas of the old Hebre <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> s were crude, their institutions were never arbitrary and
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> eanin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> less, and when they spo

                    they <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ust have had in view some reli <hi rend="italic"

                    they paid <hi rend="italic">w</hi> orship to Jehovah.</p>
                <p>Indeed, that the old Hebrew Sabbath was quite different from the Rabbinical
                    Sabbath is de <hi rend="italic">m</hi> onstrated in the trenchant criticis <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> which Jesus directed a <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ainst the
                    latter (Matt. xii. 114; Mark ii. 27). The <hi rend="italic">g</hi> eneral
                    position which He takes up, that “the Sabbath is made for man and not <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> an for the Sabbath,” is only a special application of the
                    wider principle that the law is not an end in itself but a help towards the
                    realization in life of the <hi rend="italic">g</hi> reat ideal of love to God
                    and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> an, which is the su <hi rend="italic">m</hi> of all
                    true reli <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ion. But Jesus further <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> aintains that this view of the law as a whole, and the interpretation of
                    the Sabbath law which it involves, can be historically justified fro <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> the Old Testament. And in this connexion He introduces two
                    of the main <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ethods to which historical criticism of the
                    Old Testa <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ent has recurred in modern times: He appeals
                    to the oldest history rather than to the Pentateuchal code as provin <hi

                    with the doctrine of the Scribes— regarding the Sabbath as an arbitrary sign
                    between Jehovah and Israel, entering into details as to particular acts that are
                    forbidden, and enforcing the observance by severe penalties, so that it no
                    longer has any religious value, but appears as a mere legal constraint—are
                    post-exilic (Exod. xvi. 23-30, xxxi. 12-17, xxxv. 1-3; Num. xv. 32-36); while
                    the older laws only demand such cessation from daily toil, and especially from
                    agricultural labour, as among all ancient peoples naturally accompanied a day
                    set apart as a religious festival, and in particular lay weight on the fact that
                    the Sabbath is a humane institution, a holiday for the labouring classes (Exod.
                    xxiii. 12; Deut. v. 13-15). As it stands in these ancient laws, the Sabbath is
                    not at all the unique thing which it was made to be by the Scribes. “The Greeks
                    and the barbarians,” says Strabo (x. 3, 9), “have this in common, that they
                    accompany their sacred rites by a festal remission of labour.” So it was in old
                    Israel: the Sabbath was one of the stated religious feasts, like the new moon
                    and the three great agricultural sacrificial celebrations (Hosea ii. 11); the
                    new moons and the Sabbaths alike called men to the sanctuary to do sacrifice
                    (Isa. i. 14); the remission of ordinary business belonged to both alike (Amos
                    viii. 5), and for precisely the same reason. Hosea even takes it for granted
                    that in captivity the Sabbath will be suspended, like all the other feasts,
                    because in his day a feast implied a sanctuary.</p>
                <p>This conception of the Sabbath, however, necessarily underwent an important
                    modification in the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when the local
                    sanctuaries were abolished, and those sacrificial rites and feasts which in
                    Hosea’s time formed the essence of every act of religion were limited to the
                    central altar, which most men could visit only at rare intervals. From this time
                    forward the new moons, which till then had been at least as important as the
                    Sabbath and were celebrated by sacrificial feasts as occasions of religious
                    gladness, fall into insignificance, except in the conservative temple ritual.
                    The Sabbath did not share the same fate, but with the abolition of local
                    sacrifices it became for most Israelites an institution of humanity divorced
                    from ritual. So it appears in the Deuteronomic decalogue, and presumably also in
                    Jer. xvii. 19 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> In this form the institution was able
                    to survive the fall of the state and the temple, and the seventh day’s rest was
                    clung to in exile as one of the few outward ordinances by which the Israelite
                    could still show his fidelity to Jehovah and mark his separation from the
                    heathen. Hence we understand the importance attached to it in the exilic
                    literature (Isa. lvi. 2 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> lviii. 13), and the
                    character of a sign between Jehovah and Israel ascribed to it in the post-exilic
                    law. This attachment to the Sabbath, beautiful and touching so long as it was a
                    spontaneous expression of continual devotion to Jehovah, acquired a less
                    pleasing character when, after the exile, it came to be enforced by the civil
                    arm (Nell, xiii.), and when the later law even declared Sabbath-breaking a
                    capital offence. But it is just to remember that without the stern discipline of
                    the law the community of the second temple could hardly have escaped
                    dissolution, and that Judaism alone preserved for Christianity the hard-won
                    achievements of the prophets.</p>
                <p>The Sabbath exercised a twofold influence on the early Christian church. On the
                    one hand, the weekly celebration of the resurrection on the Lord’s day could not
                    have arisen except in a circle that already knew the week as a sacred division
                    of time; and, moreover, the manner in which the Lord’s day was observed was
                    directly influenced by the synagogue service. On the other hand, the Jewish
                    Christians continued to keep the Sabbath, like other points of the old law.
                    Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H.E.,</hi> iii. 27) remarks that the</p>
                <p>Ebionites observed both the Sabbath and the Lord’s day; and this practice
                    obtained to some extent in much wider circles, for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apostolical Constitutions</hi> recommend that the Sabbath shall be kept as a
                    memorial feast of the creation as well as the Lord’s day as a memorial of the
                    resurrection. The festal character of the Sabbath was long recognized in a
                    modified form in the Eastern Church by a prohibition of fasting on that day,
                    which was also a point in the Jewish Sabbath law (comp. Judith viii. 6).</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Paul had quite distinctly laid down from the first days of
                    Gentile Christianity that the Jewish Sabbath was not binding on Christians (Rom.
                    xiv. 5 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Gal. iv. 10; Col. ii. 16), and controversy
                    with Judaizers led in process of time to direct condemnation of those who still
                    kept the Jewish day <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Co. of Laodicea, 363 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> Nay, in the Roman Church a practice of fasting on
                    Saturday as well as on Friday was current before the time of Tertullian. The
                    steps by "which the practice of resting from labour on the Lord’s day instead of
                    on the Sabbath was established in Christendom and received civil as "well as
                    ecclesiastical sanction will be spoken of in <hi rend="smallcaps">Sunday;</hi>
                    it is enough to observe here that this practice is naturally and even
                    necessarily connected with the religious observance of the Lord’s day as a day
                    of worship and religious gladness, and is in full accordance with the principles
                    laid down by Jesus in His criticism of the Sabbath of the Scribes. But of course
                    the complete observance of Sunday rest was not generally possible to the early
                    Christians before Christendom obtained civil recognition. For the theological
                    discussions whether and in what sense the fourth commandment is binding on
                    Christians, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Decalogue,</hi> vol. vii. p. 17.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Origin of the Sabbath.—</hi> As the Sabbath was originally a
                    religious feast, the question of the origin of the Sabbath resolves itself into
                    an inquiry why and in what circle a festal cycle of seven days was first
                    established. In Gen. ii. 1-3 and in Exod. xx. 11 the Sabbath is declared to be a
                    memorial of the completion of the work of creation in six days. But it appears
                    certain that the decalogue as it lay before the Deuteronomist did not contain
                    any allusion to the creation (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Decalogue,</hi> vol. vii.
                    p. 16), and it is generally believed that this reference was added by the same
                    post-exilic hand that wrote Gen. i. 1-ii. 4a. The older account of the creation
                    in Gen. ii. 4b <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> does not recognize the hexaemeron, and
                    it is even doubtful whether the original sketch of Gen i. distributed creation
                    over six days. The connexion, therefore, between the seven days’ week and the
                    work of creation is now generally recognized as secondary. The week and the
                    Sabbath were already known to the writer of Gen. i., and he used them to give
                    the framework for his picture of the creation, which in the nature of things
                    could not be literal and required some framework. At the same time, there was a
                    peculiar appropriateness in associating the Sabbath with the doctrine that
                    Jehovah is the Creator of all things; for we see from Isa. xl.-lxvi. that this
                    doctrine was a mainstay of Jewish faith in those very days of exile which gave
                    the Sabbath a new importance for the faithful.</p>
                <p>But, if the week as a religious cycle is older than the idea of the week of
                    creation, we cannot hope to find more than probable evidence of the origin of
                    the Sabbath. At the time of the exile the Sabbath was already an institution
                    peculiarly Jewish, otherwise it could not have served as a mark of distinction
                    from heathenism. This, however, does not necessarily imply that in its origin it
                    was specifically Hebrew, but only that it had acquired distinguishing features
                    of a marked kind. What is certain is that the origin of the Sabbath must be
                    sought within a circle that used the week as a division of time. Here again we
                    must distinguish between the week as<pb break="no"

                    sacred to Saturn, and that its observance is to be derived from an ancient
                    Hebrew worship of that planet. In truth there is no evidence of the worship of
                    Saturn amon <hi rend="italic">g</hi> the oldest Hebrews; Arnos v. 26, where
                    Chiun (Kaiwan) is taken by many to <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ean Saturn, is of

                    Delitzsch in II. Bawl., 32, 16. The value of this isolated and uncertain
                    testimony cannot be placed very high, and it seems to prove too much, for it is
                    practically certain that the Babylonians at the time of the Hebrew exile cannot
                    have had a Sabbath exactly corresponding in conception to what the Hebrew
                    Sabbath had become under very special historical circumstances. What we do know
                    from a calendar of the intercalary month Elul II. is that in that month the 7th,
                    14th, 19th, 21st, and 28th days had a peculiar character, and that certain acts
                    were forbidden on them to the king and others. There is the greatest uncertainty
                    as to the details (compare the very divergent renderings in <hi rend="italic"

                    Sabbaths, are certainly not “days of rest of the heart,” and to all appearance
                    are unlucky days, and expressly designated as such.<note anchored="true"

                    are exactly opposite in character to the Hebrew Sabbath, which Hosea describes

                    ”—The grammatical inflexions of the word “Sabbath” show that it is a feminine
                    form, properly <hi rend="italic">shab-bat-t</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >shabbāt-t,</hi> from שבת II. The root has nothing to do with resting in the
                    sense of enjoying repose; in transitive forms and applications it means to
                    “sever,” to “put an end to,” and intransitively it means to “desist,” to “come
                    to an end.” The grammatical form of <hi rend="italic">shabbath</hi> suggests a
                    transitive sense, “the divider,” and apparently indicates the Sabbath as
                    dividing the month. It may mean the day which puts a stop to the week’s work,
                    but this is less likely. It certainly cannot be translated “the day of
                    rest.”</p>

                    grew unpruned, and even the natural produce was not gathered in. That this law
                    was not observed before the captivity we learn from Lev. xxvi. 34 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi>; indeed so long as the Hebrews were an agricultural
                    people with little trade, in a land often ravaged by severe famines, such a law
                    could not have been observed. Even in later times it was occasionally productive
                    of great distress (1 Mac. vi. 49, 53; Jos., <hi rend="italic">Antt.,</hi> xiv.
                    16, 2). In the older legislation, however, we already meet with a seven years’
                    period in more than one connexion. The release of a Hebrew servant after six
                    years’ labour (Exod. xxi. 2 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; Deut. xv. 12 sq.) has
                    only a remote analogy to the Sabbatical year. But in Exod. xxiii. 10, 11 it is
                    prescribed that the crop of every seventh year (apparently the self-sown crop)
                    shall be left for the poor, and after them for the beasts. The difference
                    between this and the later law is that the seventh year is not called a Sabbath,
                    and that there is no indication that all land was to lie fallow on the same
                    year. In this form a law prescribing one year’s fallow in seven may have been
                    anciently observed. It is extended in ver. 11 to the vineyard and the olive oil,
                    but here the culture necessary to keep the vines and olive trees in order is not
                    forbidden; the precept is only that the produce is to be left to the poor. In
                    Deuteronomy this law is not repeated, but a fixed seven years’ period is
                    ordained for the benefit of poor debtors, apparently in the sense that in the
                    seventh year no interest is to be exacted by the creditor from a Hebrew, or that
                    no proceedings are to be taken against the debtor in that year (Deut. xv. 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.).</hi> (W. R. S.)</p>
