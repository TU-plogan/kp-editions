                    but best appears in the excellence of his many works, which extend over most
                    branches of learning known in his time. And his learning was exceeded by his
                    manifold virtues. His love of truth and justice was made more conspicuous by the
                    darkness of the corruption amid which he lived. When the rësh gäluthä (“prince
                    of the captivity,” the highest dignitary of the Jews in Babylonia, and to some
                    extent of those of the whole world) attempted to wrest judgment in a certain

                    Purnbadithä were desirable. A specimen of a legal decision by David b. Zakkai
                    signed on the authority of Rab Se'adyah Gaon is to be found in Frankel - Gratz,

                    of Sürä in a threatening manner, Se'adyah refused it, fearless of consequences.
                    David b. Zakkai, the rësh gäluthä, deposed him and chose another gaon in his
                    stead. A reconciliation took place some years afterwards, and Se'adyah was
                    reinstated in his old dignity. And, although his health had been fatally
                    undermined by the behaviour of the rësli gäluthä and his son, Se'adyah, when his
                    former opponent died, was indefatigable in his endeavours to have this very son
                    of his once mortal enemy placed on the throne of his fathers. But the new prince
                    of the captivity enjoyed his dignity for little more than half a year. He left
                    behind him a boy, twelve years of age, whom Se'adyah took into his own house and
                    treated in every respect as his own child. This learning and these virtues
                    endeared Se'adyah not merely to his contemporaries but also to the best men of
                    succeeding ages. Behayye b. Yoseph (the author of the <hi rend="italic">Hoboth
                    Hallebabotlι),</hi> Rashi, Se'adyah (the author of the commentary on Daniel in

                    questioned. Even Ibn 'Ezra defers more to him than to any other authority. To
                    this day Jewish and Christian scholars alike express for him the highest
                    admiration.</p>
