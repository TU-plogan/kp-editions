                <p><label type="entry">SANTÁL PARGANÁS, <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi></label>, a
                    British district in the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, forming the southern
                    portion of the Bhágalpur division, and lying between 23° 48' and 25° 19' N.
                    lat., and between 86° 30' and 87° 58' E. long. The total area of the district is
                    5456 square miles; it is bounded on the north by the districts of Bhágalpur and
                    Purniah, on the east by Maldah, Murshidabad, and Bírbhúm, on the south by
                    Bardwán and Mánbhúm, and on the west by Hazáribagli and Bhágalpur. Three
                    distinct types of country are represented within the area of the Santál
                    Parganás: in the east a sharply defined belt of hills stretches for about a
                    hundred miles from the Ganges to the Naubil River; west of this point a rolling
                    tract of long ridges with intervening depressions covers an area of about 2500
                    square miles; while the third type is exemplified by a narrow strip of flat
                    alluvial country about 170 miles long, lying for the most part along the loop
                    line of the East Indian Railway. The Rajmahal Hills are the only range of any
                    importance in the district, and occupy an area of 1366 square miles; but they
                    nowhere exceed 2000 feet in height. Several other hill ranges occur, which are
                    with few exceptions covered almost to their summits with dense jungle; they are
                    all difficult of access; there are, however, numerous passes through all the
                    ranges. Coal and iron are found in almost all parts of the country, but the coal
                    is of such inferior quality that all attempts to work it have failed. Wild
                    animals, including tigers, leopards, bears, hyaenas, deer, and wild pig, with a
                    variety of small game, are common almost everywhere. The climate varies: the
                    alluvial tract has the damp heat and moist soil characteristic of Bengal, while
                    the undulating and hilly portions are swept by the hot westerly winds of Behar,
                    and are very cool in the winter months. The average annual rainfall is over 50
                    inches. The district is traversed on the east by the loop line, and on the west
                    by the chord line, of the East Indian Railway; the total length of railway is
                    about 130 miles.</p>
                <p>The census of 1881 disclosed a total population in the Santál Parganás of
                    1,568,093 (males 785,330, females 782,763); Hindus numbered 847,590, Mohammedans
                    108,899, and Christians 3057. The total number of persons belonging to the
                    aboriginal tribes was 605,517, of whom the great majority (537,546) were
                    Santáls.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n316/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0316-0297"/> For an account of this interesting tribe, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">India,</hi> vol. xii. p. 778. The population is almost entirely
                    rural; only two towns contain over 5000 inhabitants each, viz., Deoghar, which
                    is the only municipality, with a population of 8015, and Shaliebgunge with 6512.
                    The administrative headquarters are at Naya Dumka.</p>
                <p>Rice forms the staple crop of the Santal Parganás, and is largely grown in the
                    alluvial strip of country which runs along the eastern boundary of the district,
                    other crops are millets, wheat, barley, maize, various pulses and oil-seeds,
                    jute, flax, sugar-cane, cotton, and indigo. The district is singularly destitute
                    of any local manufactures: iron is roughly smelted by Kol settlers from Chutia
                    Nagpur; coarse cloth is woven as a domestic manufacture, and bell-metal utensils
                    are made to a small extent; indigo is also manufactured. The trade is carried on
                    by means of permanent markets. Exports consist chiefly of rice, Indian corn, oil
                    seeds, tasar-silk cocoons, lac, Small-sized timber, and hill bamboos; while
                    European piece goods, salt, and brass or bell-metal utensils for household use
                    compose the bulk of the imports. In 1883-84 the gross revenue of the district
                    amounted to £45,437, of which the land-tax yielded £22,556.</p>
                <p>The Santáls have been known to the British since the latter part of the 18th
                    century. In 1832 two Government officials were deputed to demarcate with solid
                    masonry pillars the present area of the Daman-i-Koh, or skirts of the hills. The
                    permission to Santáls to settle in the valleys and on the lower slopes of the
                    Daman stimulated Santal immigration to an enormous extent. The Hindu
                    money-lender soon made his appearance amongst them, and led to the rebellion of
                    1855-56. The insurrection was not quelled without bloodshed, but it led to the
                    establishment of a form of administration congenial to the immigrants; and a
                    land settlement has since been carried out on conditions favourable to the
                    occupants of the soil.</p>
