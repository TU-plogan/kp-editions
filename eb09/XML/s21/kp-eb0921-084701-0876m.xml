                    4' N. lat. and 2° 17' and 3° 14' W. long., and is bounded N. by Cheshire and an
                    interpolated portion of Flint, E. by Stafford, S.E. by Worcester, S. by
                    Hereford, S.W. by Radnor, W. by Montgomery, and N.W. by Denbigh. The total area
                    in 1880 was 844,565 acres, or about 1319 square miles.</p>
                <p>Towards the west Shropshire partakes of the hilly scenery of the neighbouring
                    Wales, from which several ranges are continued into it. South of the Severn on
                    the borders of Montgomery the Breidden Hills of Lower Silurian formation rise
                    abruptly in three peaks, of which Cefn-y-Castell, about 1300 feet high, is in
                    Shropshire; and in the south-west there is a broad range of rough rounded hills
                    known as Clun Forest, extending from Radnor. South and west of the Severn there
                    are four other principal chains of hills extending from south-west to
                    north-east—the Long Mynd (1674 feet), to the west of Church Stretton, of
                    Cambrian formation; the Caradoc Hills, a little to the north, which cross the
                    Severn, terminating in the isolated sugarloaf peak of the Wrekin (1320 feet);
                    the Wenlock Edge, to the east of Church Stretton, a sharp ridge extending for 20
                    miles, and in some places rising above 1000 feet; and the Clee Hills, near the
                    south-eastern border (Brown Clee Hill, 1805 feet; Titterstone Clee Hill, 1750
                    feet). The remainder of the county is for the most part pleasantly undulating,
                    finely cultivated, and watered by numerous rivulets and streams. It may be said
                    to lie in the basin of the Severn, which enters the county near its centre from
                    Montgomery, and flows eastwards to Shrewsbury, after which it turns
                    south-eastwards to Ironbridge, and then continues in a more southerly direction
                    past Bridgnorth, entering Worcester near Bewdley. It is navi gable to Shrewsbury
                    and has connexion with the Donington, the Shropshire Union, the Shrewsbury, the
                    Birmingham and Liverpool, and the Chester and Ellesmere Canals. Its principal
                    tributaries within the county are—from the right the Meol (which receives the
                    Rea), the Cound, the Mor, and the Borle, and from the left the Vyrnwy (dividing
                    Shropshire from Montgomery), the Perry, the Tern (which receives the Roden), the
                    Bell, and the Worf. The Dee touches the north-western boundary of the county
                    with Denbigh. In the south the Teme, which receives the Clun, the Onny, and the
                    Corve, flows near the borders of Hereford, which it occasionally touches and
                    intersects. Of the numerous lakes and pools the largest is Ellesmere (116 acres)
                    near the borders of Denbigh. The Severn forms the boundary between the Old and
                    the New Red Sandstone formations, which constitute the principal strata of the
                    county. The Old Red Sandstone rocks lying to the south and west of the river are
                    bounded and deeply interpenetrated by Cambrian and Silurian strata. There are
                    five separate coal-fields within the county,—the Forest of Wyre, Coalbrookdale,
                    Shrewsbury, Clee Hills, and Oswestry. The Forest of Wyre field on the borders of
                    Worcester rests directly on the Devonian rocks, and has a great thickness of
                    measures, but comparatively few workable seams. The Coalbrookdale embraces an
                    area of 28 square miles, and is triangular in form, with its base resting on the
                    Severn and its northern apex at Newport. On its western side it is bounded
                    partly by a great fault, which brings in the New Red Sandstone, and partly by
                    the Silurian strata; on its eastern side it passes beneath the Permian strata;
                    and it is supposed that the productive measures are continued towards South
                    Staffordshire. Its general dip is eastwards, and the strata have a vertical
                    thickness of over 1000 feet. The organic remains include fishes, crustaceans,
                    and molluscs. Mingled with the coal strata are several valuable courses of
                    ironstone. The original quantity of coal in the field is estimated to have been
                    about 43 million tons, of which there are about 12 millions now remaining.
                    Neither the Shrewsbury nor the Clee Hills fields are of much value. The Oswestry
                    field is small, but has some workable seams adjoining the extensive field of
                    Denbigh. In 1884 850,000 tons of coal, valued at £286,000, were raised in
                    Shropshire from fifty-five collieries, while 198,700 tons of iron were obtained
                    valued at £109,285. Iron-casting forms one of the most important industries of
                    the county. Lead mining is carried on with some success on the Stiperstones,
                    3788 tons of lead ore being raised in 1884. The other principal minerals are
                    iron pyrites (500 tons in 1884, valued at £250), barytes (4939 tons, worth
                    £7395), and fire-clay (56,000 tons, worth £8475). There are also a large number
                    of stone and lime quarries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> With the exception of iron, the
                    manufactures of the county are comparatively unimportant. Bricks and tiles,
                    earthen and china ware, and tobacco pipes are largely made in various districts.
                    At Shrewsbury there are linen, yarn, and thread mills, and in several districts
                    small paper-mills.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> There is much fertile land suitable for all
                    kinds of culture, the richest soil being that in the vicinity of the Severn,
                    including the Vale of Shrewsbury. Much of the hilly ground, including Wenlock
                    Edge and the Clee Hills, admits of tillage; but a portion of the western
                    mountainous region is of comparatively small value even for the pasturage of
                    sheep. Out of a total area of 844,565 acres there were 716,599 in 1885 under
                    culture, of which 150,085 were under corn crops, 61,101 under green crops,
                    426,859 under permanent pasture, 71,470 under rotation grasses, and 6978 fallow.
                    The area under woods in 1881 was 45,641 acres, and in 1885 the area under
                    orchards was 4015. Of corn crops the areas under wheat and barley were in 1885
                    nearly equal, 53,161 and 53,300 acres respectively, while that under oats
                    amounted to 34,445 acres, rye to 848, beans 4648, and pease 3683. Nearly
                    five-sixths of the area under green crops were occupied by turnips and swedes,
                    which covered 47,119 acres, the area under potatoes being 6874, and that under
                    mangold wurzel 4355. Horses in 1885 numbered 32,323, of which 19,377 were used
                    solely for purposes of agriculture; cattle<pb break="no"

                    sheep (mainly Shropshire) 438,664; pigs 61,067; and poultry 369,890. In the
                    northern districts Cheshire cheese is largely made. According to the latest <hi
                    rend="italic">Landowners' Return for England</hi> Shropshire was divided among
                    12,119 owners, possessing 791,941 acres at an annual value of £1,484,833, or an
                    average value of about £1, 16s. 8d. per acre. There were 7281 proprietors or
                    about 60 per cent. who possessed less than 1 acre, and 19,675 acres were common
                    land. The following possessed over 8000 acres each—Earl of Powis, 26,986; Duke
                    of Cleveland, 25,604; Earl Brownlow, 20,233; Duke of Sutherland, 17,495; Lord
                    Hill, 16,290; Lord Forester, 14,891; Lord Windsor, 10,846; Earl of Bradford,
                    10,515; Sir V. R. Corbet, 94S9; W. O. Foster, 8547; W. L. Childe, 8430; Lord

                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> Shropshire comprises 14
                    hundreds and the municipal boroughs of Bridgnorth (population, 5885 in 1881),
                    Ludlow (5035), Oswestry (7847), Shrewsbury (26,478), and Wenlock (18,442). For
                    parliamentary purposes the county, which was formerly shared between North and
                    South Shropshire, was in 1885 divided into four separate divisions,—Mid
                    (Wellington), North (Newport), South (Ludlow), and West (Oswestry), each
                    returning one member. At the same time the boroughs of Bridgnorth, Wenlock, and
                    Ludlow were merged in the county divisions to which they severally belong; but
                    Shrewsbury continues to return one member. Shropshire contains also the
                    following urban sanitary districts :—Broseley (population, 4458 in 1881), Dawley
                    (9200), Ellesmere (1875), Madeley (9212), Much Wenlock (2321), Newport (3044),
                    Wellington (6217), and Whitchurch and Dodington (3756). The county has one court
                    of quarter sessions, and is divided into nineteen special sessional divisions.
                    All the boroughs have separate courts of quarter sessions and commissions of the
                    peace. The county contains 252 civil parishes with parts of six others.
                    Ecclesiastically it is in the dioceses of Hereford, Lichfield, and St Asaph. The
                    population (240,959 in 1861) in 1881 was 248,014 (124,157 males and 123,857
                    females). The number of persons to an acre was 0·29 and of acres to a person
                    3·41.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> The British tribes inhabiting
                    Shropshire at the time of the Romans were named by them the Ordovices and the
                    Cornavii. It was within its boundaries that Caractacus (Caradoc) struggled
                    against Vespasian in 51 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> A connected chain of
                    military works was erected by him over the southern and western districts of the
                    county, the most important fortresses being Caer Caradoc (where he is said to
                    have made his last stand), occupying a commanding position in the forest of
                    Clun, and the earthwork of Hên Dinas at Old Oswestry, consisting of four or five
                    concentric circles, still well marked. The Roman Watling Street entered
                    Shropshire near Weston-under-Lizard in Stafford and passed in an oblique line to
                    Leintwardine in Hereford. Various other Roman roads diverged from it in
                    different directions. Wroxeter, a little to the west of the Wrekin, occupies the
                    site of the ancient Roman city Uriconium, of which a portion of the wall,
                    originally 3 miles in circumference, still remains. Explorations made on the
                    site of the city have revealed many interesting features of its construction,
                    and have led to the discovery of an immense variety of remains. By some
                    authorities the Roman Mediolanum is placed near Drayton and Rutunium near Wem;
                    but the evidence in both cases is doubtful. Throughout Shropshire there are many
                    remains of Roman camps. Under the Romans it was included in the province of
                    Flavia Caesariensis. After their departure it was annexed to the kingdom of the
                    Saxons by Offa, who about 765 caused Watt’s dyke to be erected to guard against
                    the incursions of the Welsh, and later erected parallel with it, 2 miles to the
                    west, the entrenchment known as Offa’s dyke, which, extending from the Wye near
                    Hereford to the parish of Mold in Flintshire, forms in some places a
                    well-defined boundary between Shropshire and Montgomery. The greater part of the
                    history of Shropshire is included under that of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Shrewsbury</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> There are several important old
                    ecclesiastical ruins, including Wenlock priory, once very wealthy, said to have
                    been founded by St Milburg, grand-daughter of Penda, king of the Mercians, as a
                    college for secular priests, and changed into a priory for Cluniac monks by
                    Roger de Montgomery about 1080; Lilleshall abbey, for Augustinian canons,
                    founded in the reign of Stephen; Shrewsbury abbey, founded in 1083 in honour of
                    St Peter and St Paul; Buildwas abbey, one of the finest ruins in the county,
                    founded in 1135 for Cistercians by Roger de Clinton, bishop of Chester; and
                    Haughmond abbey, for Augustinian canons, founded by William Fitzalan about 1138.
                    Other remains of less consequence are those of the convent of White Ladies or St
                    Leonard’s, a Norman structure, said to have been founded in the reign of Richard
                    I. or John; slight traces of Worabridge priory, for Augustinian canons, founded
                    before the reign of Henry I.; Alberbury priory, for Benedictines, founded by
                    Fulk Fitzwarin between 1220 and 1230; and Chirbury priory, founded towards the
                    close of the 12th century. The castles of Bridgnorth (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bridgenorth),</hi> Ludlow, and Shrewsbury are referred to in the notices of
                    these towns, and in addition to these may be mentioned Clun Castle, which after
                    a long siege was taken and burnt by the Welsh prince Rees about 1196, and
                    Boscobel House, near which Charles II. is said to have been sheltered in an
                    oak.</p>
