                    E. long., with a total area of 4005 square miles. It is bounded on the N. by the
                    Lálitpur district of the North-Western Provinces and the native states of
                    Bijáwar, Panná, and Charkhári; on the E. by Panná and Damoh district; on the S.
                    by Narsinhpur district and the native state of Bhopal; and on the W. also by
                    Bhopal. Ságar district is an extensive, elevated, and in parts tolerably level
                    plain, broken in places by low hills of the Vindhyan sandstone. It is traversed
                    by numerous streams, chief of which are the Sunar, Beás, Dhupan, and Bina, all
                    flowing in a northerly direction towards the valley of the Ganges. In the
                    southern and central parts the soil is black, formed by decaying trap; to the
                    north and east it is a reddish-brown alluvium. Iron ore of excellent quality is
                    found and worked at Hirapur, a small village in the extreme north-east. The
                    district contains several densely wooded tracts, the largest of which is the
                    Ramna teak forest preserve in the north. Roads are the only means of
                    communication; of these the total length is 134 miles, 50 being returned as
                    first class. The climate is moderate; the average temperature is 75°, and the
                    average rainfall is about 46 inches.</p>
                <p>By the census of 1881 the population numbered 564,950 (294,795 males and 270,155
                    females). Hindus numbered 498,071, Mohammedans 25,396, Buddhists and Jains
                    16,432, Christians 1034, and aboriginals 19,144. The only town except the
                    capital (sec below) with a population exceeding 10,000 is Garhakota, which
                    contains 11,414 inhabitants. Of the total area only 1396 square miles are
                    cultivated, and of the portion lying waste 1220 are returned as cultivable.
                    Wheat forms the principal crop, which is produced in large quantities all over
                    the district; other products are food grains, rice, oil-seeds, cotton, and
                    sugar-cane. Cattle and buffaloes are bred to a large extent both for draught and
                    carnage, and also<pb break="no"

                    manufacture of ghee. The revenue of Sagar district in 1883-84 amounted to
                    £68,376, of which the land-tax contributed £44,429.</p>
                <p>By a treaty concluded with Baji Rao in 1818, the greater part of the present
                    district was made over to the British. During the mutiny of 1857 the whole
                    district was in the possession of the rebels, excepting the town and fort, in
                    which the Europeans were shut up for eight months, till relieved early in the
                    following year by Sir Hugh Rose. The rebels were totally defeated and order was
                    again restored by March 1858. Sagar was formed into a separate district of the
                    Central Provinces in 1861.</p>
