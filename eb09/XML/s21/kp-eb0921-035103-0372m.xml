                <p><label type="entry">SAXONY</label> is the name successively given in German
                    history to a mediaeval duchy in northern Germany, to a later electorate which
                    afterwards became the present kingdom of Saxony (described below), and to a
                    ducal province of Prussia. The last was formed directly out of part of the
                    second in 1815, but the connexion between the first and second, as will be seen
                    from the present article, is neither local nor ethnographical but political.</p>
                <p>The Saxons (Lat. <hi rend="italic">Saxones,</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sachsen),</hi> a tribe of the Teutonic stock, are first mentioned by Ptolemy as
                    occupying the southern part of the Cimbrian peninsula between the Elbe, Eider,
                    and Trave, the district now known as Holstein. The name is most commonly derived
                    from “sahs,” a short knife, though some authorities explain it as meaning
                    “settled,” in contrast to the Suevi or “wandering” people. By the end of the 3d
                    century, when we hear of a “Saxon Confederation” embracing the Cherusci, Chauci,
                    and Angrivarii, and perhaps corresponding to the group of tribes called
                    Ingsevones by Tacitus, the chief seat of the nation had been transferred south
                    of the Elbe to the lands on both sides of the Weser now occupied by Oldenburg
                    and Hanover. The Saxons were one of the most warlike and adventurous of the
                    Teutonic peoples, and they not only steadily extended the borders of their home,
                    but made colonizing and piratical excursions by sea far and wide. In 287 they
                    assisted the Menapian Carausius to make himself master of Romanized Britain,
                    where he assumed the title of Augustus; and on the Continent they came into
                    collision with the Roman empire under both Julian and Valentinian, the latter of
                    whom defeated them in 373 so far south as Deutz, opposite Cologne. Their
                    settlements along the coast of France extended to the mouth of the Loire, and,
                    though these were soon absorbed by the Franks, their expeditions to England
                    finally resulted in the foundation of lasting kingdoms (Essex, Sussex, Wessex)
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">England,</hi> vol. viii. pp. 268 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.).</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Though the
                    Saxons were not the first to effect the foundation of a Teutonic kingdom in
                    England, they were the first to attempt it; and hence their name was applied (as
                    it still is) by the Celtic inhabitants of the British islands to all Teutonic
                    settlers. A similar general use of the name survives in Transylvania, where the
                    German inhabitants are called “Saxons,” although only a small proportion of them
                    trace their descent from the Saxon branch of the Teutonic family.</p></note>
                    About the beginning of the 5th century part of the Flemish coast became known as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Litus Saxonium,</hi> from the settlements of this people.
                    The Saxons who remained in Germany (Alt-Sachsen or Old Saxons) gradually pushed
                    their borders further and further until they approached the Rhine, and touched
                    the Elbe, the North Sea, and the Harz Mountains. In 531 they joined their
                    neighbours the Franks in a successful expedition against the Thuringians, and
                    received as their spoil the conquered territory between the Harz and the
                    Unstrut. Their settlements here were, however, forced to acknowledge the
                    supremacy of the Franks, and from this period may be dated the beginning of the
                    long strife between these two peoples which finally resulted in the subjugation
                    of the Saxons. During the reigns of the weak Merovingian kings who succeeded
                    Lothair I. on the Frankish throne, the Saxons pushed into northern Thuringia,
                    afterwards known as the Alt-Mark. Pippin the Short obtained a temporary
                    advantage over them in 753 and imposed a tribute of three hundred horses, but
                    their final conquest was reserved for Charlemagne. At this time the Saxons did
                    not form a single state under one ruler, but were divided into the four
                    districts of Westphalia to the west of the Weser, Eastphalia chiefly to the east
                    of that river, Engern or Angria along both banks, and Nordalbingia in Holstein.
                    The gaus were independent, each having an ealdorman of its own; and they only
                    combined in time of war or other emergency to choose a herzog, or common leader.
                    The people were divided into the “frilinge” or “frone,” who possessed the land,
                    the “liti” or “lazzi,” a semi-freed class, and the serfs, who had no rights. The
                    “edilinge” were the chiefs, but had no political advantages over the “frilinge.”
                    Their religion was a simple type of northern heathenism. See <hi

                <p>In 772 Charlemagne, induced partly by a desire to protect his kingdom from the
                    incursions of hostile neighbours and partly by a proselytizing spirit, began the
                    subjugation of the Saxons. The war, waged on both sides with the utmost
                    ferocity, lasted in a series of campaigns with but brief intervals for
                    thirty-one years. Repeatedly conquered and baptized, the Saxons rose again and
                    again in revolt as soon as Charlemagne withdrew his troops, threw off their
                    forced allegiance to Christianity, and under various leaders, of whom Wittekind
                    or Widukind is the most famous, struggled fiercely to regain their independence.
                    Charlemagne was too strong and his measures too relentless. On one occasion he
                    butchered 4500 captives in cold blood, as a revenge and a warning. Wittekind
                    surrendered and was baptized in 785; and after what is called the Second Saxon
                    War, which broke out in 792, resistance died away about 803. The Saxons were
                    allowed<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n373/mode/1up"

                    After 803 the laws were made milder, and no tribute except tithes was demanded.

                    secured by transplanting colonies of Saxons to other parts of the kingdom, and
                    introducing Frankish colonies to take their place in Saxony. The land now
                    gradually became an integral portion of the kingdom of the Franks.<note

                    Saxons. It is also almost the only relic of their dialect</p></note> Under Louis
                    the German, to whom Saxony had fallen at the treaty of Verdun in 843, it was
                    harassed by the inroads of the Normans and Slavs on either side, and, in order
                    to cope with these, herzogs or dukes were appointed about 850 to keep the Saxon
                    Mark, a narrow territory in Nordalbingia, on the west bank of the Elbe. These
                    herzogs, remembering their predecessors or their ancestors (Ludolf, the first
                    duke of Saxony, is said to have been a descendant of Wittekind), rapidly
                    extended their power beyond the mark over the rest of Saxony, and thus founded
                    the powerful duchy of Saxony. Otto the Illustrious, who succeeded his brother
                    Bruno as duke in 880, added Thuringia to the duchy, and attained such a pitch of
                    power that he was offered the crown of Germany in 911. He refused the honour on
                    the score of old age, but his son Henry the Fowler accepted it in 919, and
                    founded the line of Saxon emperors which expired with Henry II. the Pious in
                    1024. Otto the Great, son of Henry I., bestowed the duchy of Saxony upon Hermann
                    Billing or Billung, in whose family it remained till 1106. The power and
                    influence of Saxony during this period depended partly on the favour of the
                    emperors, but chiefly on the sagacity and energy of the successive dukes. The
                    Saxons were hostile to the Franconian emperors who succeeded the Saxon house,
                    and in 1073 they rose in revolt against Henry IV. They were at first successful,
                    but in 1075, at the battle of Langensalza, they were defeated by the emperor.
                    The rebels were severely punished, though Otto of Nordheim, one of their
                    leaders, was made administrator of the duchy. Taking advantage of Henry IV.’s
                    troubles with the pope, they again rebelled and espoused the cause of Rudolf of
                    Swabia; but in 1087, on the resignation of Hermann of Luxemburg, whom they had
                    chosen king, they made peace once more with the emperor. Magnus was the last
                    duke of the Billing line. The emperor Henry V. now (1106) presented the lapsed
                    duchy to Lothair, count of Supplinburg, who rapidly became the most powerful
                    prince in Germany, and in 1125 was placed on the imperial throne by the
                    influence of the papal party. Two years after his elevation he assigned the
                    duchy of Saxony to his powerful son-in-law Henry the Proud, who was already duke
                    of Bavaria and had inherited the private possessions of the Billings in Saxony,
                    in right of his mother, who was a daughter of Magnus. Henry had aspired to be
                    emperor in 1138, and his successful rival Conrad III., wishing to reduce his
                    power, alleged that it was unlawful for one prince to hold two duchies, and
                    ordered him to resign Saxony. On his refusal, the emperor immediately declared
                    both duchies to be forfeited. Henry died before the ensuing war was ended, and
                    Conrad compromised matters by appointing his opponent’s young son, afterwards
                    known as Henry the Lion, to the duchy of Saxony, compensating Albert the Bear,
                    the former imperial candidate, with the independence of the North Mark of
                    Saxony, afterwards called Brandenburg (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Prussia,</hi>
                    vol. xx. p. 2). In 1155 Henry received Bavaria from his cousin and personal
                    friend the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and thus became second only to the
                    emperor in power. He added considerably to the extent of Saxony by conquest
                    among the Wends, east of the Elbe, where the boundary had always been a
                    fluctuating one. But Henry was not only powerful, he was also arrogant, and
                    incurred the jealousy of the other princes, so that, when he quarrelled with the
                    emperor and his lands were declared forfeited in 1180, he had no allies to
                    assist him in his resistance. Westphalia, the principal part of Saxony, went to
                    the archbishop of Cologne, the Saxon Palatinate to the landgrave of Thuringia,
                    and other portions to other princes. A small district round Lauenburg, north of
                    the Elbe, was assigned with the title of duke of Saxony to Bernhard of Ascania,
                    son of Albert the Bear. Henry was reduced to submission in 1181; but his duchies
                    could not be restored, and he was forced to content himself with Brunswick and
                    Lüneburg. The duchy of Saxony was never restored in the old sense, in which it
                    had been one of the four principal duchies of the empire, and embraced the
                    territories now occupied by Westphalia, Oldenburg, Hanover, the Harz, and parts
                    of Mecklenburg and Holstein. The new creation never rose to any importance.
                    Bernhard of Ascania (1181-1212), before his accession as duke of Saxony, had
                    held Anhalt and Wittenberg, to the southeast of Saxony, and separated from it by
                    the Mark of Brandenburg; and when his grandsons John and Albert II. divided
                    their inheritance in 1260 the latter placed his seat at Wittenberg, and two tiny
                    duchies arose—Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. Saxe-Lauenburg was now the
                    only part of the great duchy which retained the name; while Saxe-Wittenberg, the
                    nucleus of the later electorate, transferred the name to entirely new soil. Both
                    duchies claimed the electoral privileges, including the office of grand marshal
                    (Erzmarschall), which had belonged to the original duke of Saxony, but the
                    Golden Bull of 1356 confirmed the claims of Wittenberg. Rudolph II. (about 1370)
                    is the first duke who formally styles himself elector <hi rend="italic"
                    >(princeps elector).</hi> The small electorate was made still smaller in 1411 by
                    the formation of Anhalt into a separate principality. In 1422 the Ascanian line
                    became extinct with Albert III., and in 1423 the emperor Sigismund conferred
                    their lands and titles upon Frederick, margrave of Meissen, and landgrave of
                    Thuringia, to whom he was deeply indebted both for money and assistance in the
                    Hussite wars. The new and more honourable style of elector of Saxony superseded
                    Frederick’s other titles, and the term Saxony gradually spread over all his
                    other possessions, which included the country now known under that name. The
                    early history of the electorate and kingdom of Saxony is thus the early history
                    of the Mark of Meissen, the name of which now lingers only in a solitary town on
                    the Elbe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A different
                    and considerably later use of the name Saxony may be conveniently mentioned
                    here, for, though not based upon any political or ethnographical considerations,
                    it is frequently referred to in German history. When Maximilian (1493-1519)
                    formed the ten great imperial administrative circles, that part of the empire to
                    the east of the Weser and north of the Erzgebirge was divided between the
                    circles of Lower and Upper Saxony. The former, occupying the north-west of this
                    territory, included the Harz principalities, Magdeburg, Brunswick, Mecklenburg,
                    Bremen, and Holstein; the latter, besides Thuringia, the electorate of Saxony
                    and Brandenburg, embraced the conquered Slavonic lands to the east and north,
                    including Lusatia and Pomerania. The lands which still preserve the name of
                    Saxony are thus all within the limits of these circles.</p></note><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0374-0353"/> Among the mountains of Lusatia, in the south of
                    the Saxon province of Bautzen, there exist to this day about 50,000 Wends,
                    possessing characteristics and speaking a language of their own. These curious
                    people are the relics of a vast Slavonic horde which, appearing on the borders
                    of the kingdom of the Hermunduri or Thuringians about the 4th century, pressed
                    into their territories on the downfall of that kingdom in the 6th century, and
                    settled themselves between the Spree and the Saale. They were known as the Sorbs
                    or Sorabi, and the country, which included the whole of the modern kingdom of
                    Saxony, was called Sorabia. Warlike and persistent, their influence has never
                    been obliterated, and, though conquered, their stock has neither been
                    exterminated nor absorbed. They were skilled in agriculture and cattle-breeding,
                    and soon improved the fertile soil of their new settlements. Some writers are
                    disposed to recognize their influence in the strong bent to agricultural and
                    industrial pursuits which has ever since characterized the inhabitants of this
                    part of Germany; and less doubtful traces have been left in the popular
                    superstitions and legends, and in the local names. For more than a hundred years
                    after their first collision with the German kingdom the Sorbs repulsed all
                    attacks, but in 928 Henry the Fowler, the first Saxon emperor, crossing the
                    Elbe, devastated the land of the Daleminzians, and built the strong castle of
                    Misnia or Meissen, which thenceforward formed the centre of a gradually
                    increasing mark against the heathen. For two hundred years the office of
                    margrave of Meissen was not hereditary, but in 1123 Count Conrad of Wettin
                    obtained the succession for his house, and founded a line of princes whose
                    descendants still occupy the throne. It is said, though on very doubtful
                    grounds, that Conrad was a scion of the family of the old Saxon hero Wittekind.
                    In 1156, when Conrad abdicated and set the pernicious example of dividing his
                    lands among his sons, his possessions extended from the Neisse and the
                    Erzgebirge to the Harz and the Saale. During these two centuries the state of
                    the country had but slowly improved. The Sorbs had been reduced to a condition
                    of miserable serfdom, and the best land was in the hands of Frankish peasants
                    who had been attracted by its fertility. Agriculture was encouraged by the
                    ecclesiastics, especially by Bishop Benno, who occupied the see of Meissen
                    (founded in 961) about the time of the conquest of England by the Normans. In
                    the reign of otto the Rich (1157-1190) the first silver mines were discovered,
                    and the famous mining town of Freiberg founded. Trade also received its first
                    encouragement; the great fairs of Leipsic were protected; and roads were made
                    and towns fortified with the produce of the mines, Otto’s grandson, Henry the
                    Illustrious (1221-1288), whose mother Jutta was a Thuringian princess, reunited
                    most of Conrad’s lands by inheriting part of Thuringia (the rest went to the
                    duke of Brabant) and the Pleissnerland, as the district on both banks of the
                    upper course of the Pleisse was called. He too lost the chance of founding a
                    magnificent kingdom in the heart of Germany, by subdividing his territories,
                    which stretched in a compact mass from the Werra to the oder and from the
                    mountains of Bohemia to the Harz. The consequences of this policy of
                    subdivision, which was followed by his successors, were bitter family feuds and
                    petty wars, seriously hampering the development of the country. Frederick the
                    Grave (1324-1347) was the last prince of the house of Wettin who was sole ruler
                    of all the ancestral lands of his house. The next powerful figure is Frederick
                    the Warlike, who became margrave in 1381. Besides the Mark he possessed the
                    Osterland, the territory to the north-west of the present kingdom, stretching
                    from the Saale at Weissenfels to the Elbe at Torgau, and embracing the plain of
                    Leipsic. Frederick, in whose reign the university of Leipsic was founded, had
                    acquired his surname by his energetic support of Sigismund, especially in the
                    Hussite wars. As we have seen, that emperor’s desire to attach to himself so
                    powerful an ally led him to bestow the vacant electoral duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg
                    upon the margrave in 1423. Despite the troublous state of public affairs, the
                    internal prosperity of the land had steadily advanced. Most of the chief towns
                    had by this time been founded,—Leipsic, Erfurt, Zwickau, and Freiberg being the
                    most conspicuous. Chemnitz had begun its textile industry. The condition of the
                    peasants was still far below that of the burghers of the towns; many of them
                    were mere serfs. The church retained the high pitch of power which it had early
                    attained in Meissen, and religious institutions were numerous all over the most
                    fertile districts. In spite of fresh discoveries of silver, the pecuniary wants
                    of the princes had to be occasionally supplied by contributions called “bedes”
                    from the nobles and ecclesiastics, who were summoned from time to time to meet
                    in a kind of diet.</p>
                <p>Frederick’s new dignities as elector, combined with his personal qualities, now
                    made him one of the most powerful princes in Germany ·, had the principle of
                    primogeniture been established in the country as he left it, Saxony and not
                    Brandenburg might have been the leading power in the empire to-day. He died in
                    1428, just in time to escape the grief of seeing his lands cruelly ravaged by
                    the Hussites in 1429 and 1430. The division of territory between his two sons,
                    Frederick the Mild (1428-1464) and William, once more called forth destructive
                    internecine wars (the “Bruderkrieg ”), in which the former for a time forgot his
                    surname. It was in 1455, during this war, that the knight Kunz von Kaufungen
                    carried into execution his bold, though only momentarily successful, plan of
                    stealing the two young sons of the elector Frederick. Ernest and Albert, the two
                    princes in question, succeeded to their father’s possessions in 1464, and for
                    twenty years ruled peacefully in common. The land rapidly prospered during this
                    respite from war. Trade made great advances, encouraged by an improved coinage,
                    which was one of the consequences of the silver discoveries on the Schneeberg.
                    Several of the powerful ecclesiastical principalities were at this time held by
                    members of the Saxon electoral house, so that the external influence of the
                    electorate corresponded to its internal prosperity. Matters were not suffered to
                    continue thus. The childless death of their uncle William in 1482 bequeathed
                    Thuringia to the two princes, and the younger Albert insisted upon a division of
                    the common possessions. In August 1485 the Partition of Leipsic took place,
                    which resulted in the foundation of two Saxon lines, the Ernestine and the
                    Albertine. The lands were never again united. Ernest divided the lands into two
                    portions, and Albert chose. Apart from the electoral duchy of Wittenberg, which
                    necessarily went to Ernest as the elder brother, the lands were divided into
                    Thuringia, half of the Osterland, and Naumburg and the Voigtland on the one
                    hand, and Meissen and the remaining parts of eastern Saxony on the other. To
                    Ernest’s deep chagrin, Albert chose Meissen, the old ancestral lands of the
                    Wettins. The former only survived his vexation a year.</p>
                <p>The electorate remained at first with the Ernestine line. Ernest was succeeded by
                    his son Frederick the Wise (1486-1525), one of the most illustrious princes in
                    German history. Under his rule Saxony was perhaps the most influential member of
                    the German empire; and on the death of Maximilian the imperial crown itself was
                    offered to him, but he vindicated his character by refusing it. In this reign
                    Saxony became the cradle of the Reformation. The elector’s wise tolerance and
                    subsequent protection and hearty support of Luther are well known to every
                    reader. He is said to have remained unmarried out of love to his brother John,
                    who succeeded him. He died during the horrors of the Peasants’ War. John
                    (1525-1532) was an even more enthusiastic favourer of the Reformed doctrines,
                    and shared the leadership of the Schmalkald League with Philip of Hesse. His
                    son, John Frederick the Magnanimous (1532-1547), might with equal propriety have
                    been surnamed the Unfortunate. He took part in the Schmalkald War, but in 1547
                    was captured at Mühlberg by the emperor Charles V., and forced to sign the
                    capitulation of Wittenberg. This deed transferred the electorate and nearly all
                    the Saxon lands to the Albertine line, whose astute representative had taken the
                    imperial side. Only a few scattered territories in Thuringia were reserved for
                    John Frederick’s sons, and on these were afterwards founded the Ernestine
                    duchies of Weimar, Gotha, Ac. For the second time in the history of the Saxon
                    electorate, the younger line on a division ultimately secured the highest
                    dignity, for the Wittenberg line had been junior to the Lauenberg line. The
                    Albertine line is now the royal line of Saxony.</p>
                <p>The Albertine Maurice became elector after the capitulation of Wittenberg. He was
                    the grandson of the founder of his house, and had been preceded on the throne of
                    Meissen by his uncle George (1500-1539) and by his father Henry (1539-1541).
                    George was a zealous Roman Catholic, and had vainly endeavoured to stem the
                    Reformation in<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n375/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0375-0354"/> his dominions; Henry was an equally devoted
                    Protestant. Maurice (1541-1553) was also a Protestant, but he was too astute to
                    permit his religion to blind him to his political interests. His ruling motive
                    seems to have been ambition to increase his personal power and the consequence
                    of his country. He refused to join the Schmalkald League with the other
                    Protestant princes, and made a secret treaty with the emperor instead. By
                    invading the Ernestine lands in John Frederick’s absence during the Schmalkald
                    War, he forced that prince to return hastily from the Danube, and thus weakened
                    the army opposed to the emperor. Though he was compelled to retreat before his
                    indignant and surprised kinsman, his fidelity to the emperor was rewarded, as we
                    have seen, at the capitulation of Wittenberg. All the lands torn from the
                    Ernestines were not, however, assigned to Maurice; he was forced to acknowledge
                    the suzerainty of Bohemia over the Voigtland and the Silesian duchy of Sagan,
                    and to renounce his own superiority over the Reuss dominions. The Roman Catholic
                    prelates were moreover reinstated in the three great bishoprics of Meissen,
                    Merseburg, and Naumburg-Zeitz. Recognizing as a Protestant sovereign that the
                    best alliance for securing his new possessions was not with the Roman Catholic
                    emperor but with the other Protestant princes, Maurice now began to withdraw
                    from the former and to conciliate the latter. In 1552, suddenly marching against
                    the emperor at Innsbruck, he extorted from him the peace of Passau, which
                    accorded religious freedom throughout Germany. Thus, at the close of his life
                    (he died of a wound in battle in 1553), Maurice came to be regarded as the
                    champion of German national and religious freedom. Amid the distractions of
                    outward affairs, Maurice had not neglected the internal interests of Saxony. To
                    the already conspicuous educational advantages in the country he added the three
                    grammar schools (Fürstenschulen) at Pforta, Grimma, and Meissen; and for
                    administrative purposes, especially for the collection of the taxes which had
                    now become practically annual, he divided the country into the four “circles” of
                    the Electorate, Thuringia, Leipsic, and Meissen. In 1542 the first coal mine was
                    opened. Over two hundred convents were suppressed in Saxony; Leipsic,
                    Wittenberg, Jena, and Erfurt had each a university; books began to increase, and
                    the Saxon dialect became the ruling dialect of German in virtue of Luther’s
                    translation of the Bible. Augustus I. (1553-1586), brother of Maurice, was one
                    of the best domestic rulers that Saxony ever had. He increased the area of the
                    country by the “circles” of Neustadt and the Voigtland, and by parts of
                    Henneberg and the silver-yielding Mansfeld, and he devoted his long reign to the
                    development of its resources. He visited all parts of the country himself, and
                    personally encouraged agriculture; he introduced a more economical mode of
                    mining and smelting silver; he favoured the importation of finer breeds of sheep
                    and cattle; and he brought foreign weavers from abroad to teach the Saxons.
                    Under him lace-making began on the Erzgebirge, and cloth-making flourished at
                    Zwickau. He was the first to fortify the Königstein, the one fortress in modern
                    Saxony, and he built other castles. With all his virtues, however, Augustus was
                    an intolerant Lutheran, and used very severe means to exterminate the
                    Calvinists; in his electorate he is said to have expelled one hundred and eleven
                    Calvinist preachers in a single month. Under his son Christian I. (1586-1591)
                    the chief power was wielded by the chancellor Crell, who strongly favoured
                    Calvinism, but, when Christian II. (1591-1611) came to the throne a mere child,
                    Crell was sacrificed to the Lutheran nobles. The duke of Weimar was made regent,
                    and continued the persecution of crypto-Calvinism, in spite of the breach •with
                    the Reformed imperial diet which this course involved. Christian II. was
                    succeeded by his brother John George I. (1611-1656), under whom the country was
                    devastated by the Thirty Years’ War. John George was an amiable but weak prince,
                    totally unfitted to direct the fortunes of a nation in time of danger. He
                    refused the proffered crown of Bohemia, and, when the Bohemian Protestants
                    elected a Calvinist prince, he assisted the emperor against them with men and
                    money. The Restitution Edict, however, in 1629, opened his eyes to the emperor’s
                    projects, and he joined Gustavus Adolphus. Saxony now became the theatre of war.
                    The first battle on Saxon soil was fought in 1631 at Breitenfeld, where the
                    bravery of the Swedes made up for the flight of the Saxons. Wallenstein entered
                    Saxony in 1632, and his lieutenants Holk and Gallas plundered, burned, and
                    murdered through the length and breadth of the land. After the death of Gustavus
                    Adolphus at the battle of Lützen, not far from Leipsic, in 1632, the elector,
                    who was at heart an imperialist, detached himself from the Swedish alliance, and
                    in 1635 concluded the peace of Prague with the emperor. By this peace he was
                    confirmed in the possession of Upper and Lower Lusatia, a district of 180 square
                    miles and half a million inhabitants, which had already been pledged to him as a
                    reward for his services against the Bohemians. Lusatia had once belonged to
                    Conrad of Meissen, whose descendants, however, had lost it to Brandenburg at the
                    beginning of the 14th century. Saxony had now to suffer from the Swedes a
                    repetition of the devastations of Wallenstein. No other country in Germany was
                    so terribly scourged by this terrible war. Immense tracts were rendered
                    absolutely desolate, and whole villages vanished from the map; the people were
                    tortured to reveal their treasures, or from wanton brutality; famine was
                    followed by plague; civilization was thrown back and barbarism revived. In eight
                    years the population sank from three to one and a half millions. When the war
                    was at length ended by the peace of Westphalia in 1648, Saxony found that its
                    influence had begun to decline in Germany. Its alliance with the Catholic party
                    deprived it of its place at the head of the Protestant German states, which was
                    now taken by Brandenburg. John George’s will made the decline of the electorate
                    even more inevitable by detaching from it the three subsidiary duchies of
                    Saxe-Weissenfels, Saxe-Merseburg, and Saxe-Zeitz in favour of his younger sons.
                    By 1746, however, these lines were all extinct, and their possessions had
                    returned to the main line. Saxe-Neustädt was a short-lived branch from
                    Saxe-Zeitz, extinct in 1714. The next three electors, who each bore the name of
                    John George, had uneventful reigns. The first made some efforts to heal the
                    wounds of his country; the second wasted the lives of his people in foreign wars
                    against the Turks; and the third was the last Protestant elector of Saxony. John
                    George IV. was succeeded by his brother Frederick Augustus I., or Augustus the
                    Strong (1694- 1733). This prince was elected king of Poland as Augustus II. in
                    1697, but any weight which the royal title might have given him in the empire
                    was more than counterbalanced by the fact that he, though the ruler of an almost
                    exclusively Protestant electorate, became a Roman Catholic in order to qualify
                    for the new dignity. The connexion with Poland was disastrous for Saxony. In
                    order to defray the expenses of his wars with Charles XII., which resulted from
                    his Polish policy, Augustus pawned and sold large districts of Saxon territory,
                    while he drained the electorate of both men and money. For a year before the
                    peace of Altranstädt in 1706, when Augustus gave up the crown of Poland, Saxony
                    was occupied by a Swedish army, which had to be supported at an expense of
                    twenty-<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n376/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0376-0355"/> three million thalers. The wars and extravagance
                    of the elector-king, who regained the Polish crown in 1709, are said to have
                    cost Saxony a hundred million thalers. From this reign dates the privy council
                    (Geheimes Kabinet), which lasted till 1830. The caste privileges of the estates
                    (Stände) were increased by Augustus, a fact which tended to alienate them more
                    from the people, and so to decrease their power. Böttger made his famous
                    discovery in 1710, and the manufacture of porcelain was begun at Meissen, and in
                    this reign the Moravian Brethren made their settlement at Herrnhut (1722).
                    Frederick Augustus II. (1733-1763), who succeeded his father in the electorate,
                    and was afterwards elected to the throne of Poland as Augustus III., was an
                    indolent prince, wholly under the influence of Graf von Brühl. Brühl was an
                    incompetent statesman and an extravagant financier, who yet contrived to amass
                    large sums for his private purse. Under his ill-omened auspices Saxony sided
                    with Prussia in the First Silesian War, and with Austria in the other two. It
                    gained nothing in the first, lost much in the second, and in the third, the
                    Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), again became the scene of war and suffered renewed
                    miseries. The country was deserted by its king and his minister, who retired to
                    Poland. By the end of the war it had lost 90,000 men and a hundred million
                    thalers; its coinage was debased and its trade ruined; and the whole country was
                    in a state of frantic disorder. The elector died seven months after his return
                    from Poland; Brühl died twenty-three days later. The elector’s son and
                    successor, Frederick Christian, survived his father only two months, leaving a
                    son, Frederick Augustus III. (1763-1827), a boy of thirteen. Prince Xaver, the
                    elector’s uncle, was appointed guardian, and he set himself to the sorely-needed
                    work of healing the wounds of the country. The foundation of the famous school
                    of mining at Freiberg, and the improvement of the Saxon breed of sheep by the
                    importation of merino sheep from Spain, were due to his care. Frederick assumed
                    the government in 1768, and in his long and eventful reign, which saw the
                    electorate elevated to the dignity of a kingdom, though deprived of more than
                    half its area, he won the surname of the Just. As he was the first king of
                    Saxony, he is usually styled Frederick Augustus I. The first ten years of his
                    active reign passed in peace and quiet; agriculture, manufactures, and
                    industries were fostered, economical reforms instituted; and the heavy public
                    debt of forty million thalers was steadily reduced. In 1770 torture was
                    abolished. When the Bavarian succession fell open in 1777, Frederick Augustus
                    joined Prussia in protesting against the absorption of Bavaria by the Austrian
                    emperor, and Saxon troops took part in the bloodless “potato-war.” The elector
                    commuted his claims in right of his mother, the Bavarian princess Maria Antonia,
                    for six million florins, which he spent chiefly in redeeming Saxon territory
                    that had been pawned to other German states. When Saxony joined the Fürstenbund
                    in 1785, it had an area of 15,185 square miles and a population of nearly
                    2,000,000, but its various parts had not yet been combined into a homogeneous
                    whole, for the two Lusatias, Querfurt, Henneberg, and the ecclesiastical
                    foundations of Naumburg and Merseburg had each a separate diet and government,
                    independent of the diet of the electorate proper. In 1791 Frederick declined the
                    crown of Poland, although it was now offered as hereditary even in the female
                    line. He remembered how unfortunate for Saxony the former Polish connexion had
                    been, and he mistrusted the attitude of Russia towards the proffered kingdom.
                    Next year saw the beginning of the great struggle between France and Germany.
                    Frederick’s conduct throughout was perhaps more pusillanimous than self-seeking,
                    but it entailed its own punishment. His first policy was one of selfish
                    abstention, and from 1793 until 1796, when he concluded a definite treaty of
                    neutrality with France, he limited his contribution to the war to the bare
                    contingent due from him as a prince of the empire. When war broke out in 1806
                    against Napoleon, 22,000 Saxon troops shared the defeat of the Prussians at
                    Jena, but the elector immediately afterwards snatched at Napoleon’s offer of
                    neutrality, and abandoned his former ally. At the peace of Posen (11th December
                    1806) Frederick entered the Confederation of the Rhine, assuming the title of
                    king of Saxony, and promising a contingent of 20,000 men to Napoleon.</p>
                <p>No change followed in the internal affairs of the new kingdom, except that Roman
                    Catholics were admitted to equal privileges with Protestants. Its foreign policy
                    was dictated by the will of Napoleon, of whose irresistibility the king was too
                    easily convinced. In 1807 his submission was rewarded with the duchy of Warsaw
                    and the district of Cottbus, though he had to surrender some of his former
                    territory to the new kingdom of Westphalia. The king of Saxony’s faith in
                    Napoleon was momentarily shaken by the disasters of the Russian campaign, in
                    which 21,000 Saxon troops had shared, and in 1813 he began to lean towards an
                    alliance with Austria. Napoleon’s victory at Lützen (May 2, 1813), however,
                    suddenly restored all his awe for that great general, and the Saxon king and the
                    Saxon army were once more at the disposal of the French. After the battle of
                    Bautzen, Napoleon’s headquarters were successively at Dresden and Leipsic.
                    During the decisive battle at the latter town in October 1813, the popular Saxon
                    feeling was displayed by the desertion of the Saxon troops to the side of the
                    allies. Frederick was taken prisoner in Leipsic, and the government of his
                    kingdom was assumed for a year by the Russians, who promptly turned its
                    resources against its late French ally. Saxony was now regarded as a conquered
                    country. Nothing but Austria’s vehement desire to keep a powerful neighbour at a
                    distance from her boundaries, preserved it from being completely annexed by the
                    Prussians, who had succeeded the Russians in the government. As it was, the
                    congress of Vienna assigned the northern portion, consisting of 7800 square
                    miles, with 864,404 inhabitants to Prussia, leaving 5790 square miles, with a
                    population of 1,182,744 to Frederick, who was permitted to retain his royal
                    title. He was forced to acquiesce in the dismemberment of his kingdom, and to
                    console himself with the reflexion that his share, though the smaller half, was
                    richer, more populous, and more beautiful than the other.</p>
                <p>From the partition in 1815 to the war of 1866 the history of Saxony is mainly a
                    narrative of the slow growth of constitutionalism and popular liberty within its
                    limits. Its influence on the general history of Europe ceased when the old
                    German empire was dissolved. In the new empire it is too completely overshadowed
                    by Prussia to have any objective importance by itself. Frederick lived twelve
                    years after the division of his kingdom. The commercial and industrial interests
                    of the country continued to be fostered, but only a few of the most unavoidable
                    political reforms were granted. The fact that some of these had not been granted
                    before is more significant than that they were granted now. Religious equality
                    was extended to the Reformed Church in 1818, and the separate diet of Upper
                    Lusatia abolished. Frederick Augustus was succeeded by his septuagenarian
                    brother Antony (1827-1836), to the great disappointment of the people, who had
                    expected a more liberal era under Prince Frederick Augustus, the king’s nephew.
                    Antony announced his intention of following the lines laid down by his
                    predecessor. He accorded at first only a few trifling reforms, which were far
                    from removing the popular discontent, while he retained the unpopular minister
                    Einsiedel and continued the encouragement of the Roman Catholics. The old feudal
                    arrangement of the diet, with its inconvenient divisions, was retained, and the
                    privy council continued to be the depository of power. An active opposition
                    began to make itself evident in the diet and in the press, and in 1830 riots in
                    Leipsic and Dresden impressed the king with the necessity of concession.
                    Einsiedel was cashiered, Prince Frederick Augustus assumed as co-regent, and
                    a<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n377/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0377-0356"/> constitution promised. After consultation with
                    the diet the king promulgated a new constitution on September 4, 1831, which is
                    the basis of the present government. An offer from Metternich of Austrian arms
                    to repress the discontent by force had been refused. The feudal estates were
                    replaced by two chambers, largely elective, and the privy council by a
                    responsible ministry of six departments. Bernhard von Lindenau was the head of
                    the first responsible cabinet, and the first constitutional assembly sat from
                    January 27, 1833, till October 30, 1834. While Saxony’s political liberty was
                    thus enlarged, its commerce and credit were stimulated by the construction of
                    railways. Antony had died in 1836, and Frederick Augustus II. (1836-1854) became
                    sole king. Growing interest in politics produced dissatisfaction with the
                    compromise of 1831, and the liberal opposition grew in numbers and influence.
                    The burning questions were the publicity of legal proceedings and the freedom of
                    the press; and on these the Government sustained its first crushing defeat in
                    the lower or second chamber in 1842. Lindenau resigned in 1843. Religious
                    considerations as to the recognition of the German Catholics and a new
                    constitution for the Protestant Church began to mingle with purely political
                    questions, and Prince John, as the supposed head of the Jesuit party, was
                    insulted at a review of the communal guards at Leipsic in 1845. The military
                    rashly interfered, and several innocent spectators were shot. The bitterness
                    which this occurrence provoked was intensified by a political reaction which was
                    initiated about the same time under Von Könneritz. Warned by the sympathy
                    excited in Saxony by the revolutionary events at Paris in 1848, the king
                    dismissed his reactionary ministry, and a liberal cabinet took its place in
                    March 1848. The disputed points were now conceded to the couutry. The privileges
                    of the nobles were curtailed; the administration of justice was put on a better
                    footing; the press was unshackled; publicity in legal proceedings was granted;
                    trial by jury was introduced for some special cases; and the German Catholics
                    were recognized. The feudal character of the first chamber was abolished, and
                    its members made mainly elective from among the highest tax-payers, while an
                    almost universal suffrage was introduced for the second chamber. The first
                    demand of the overwhelmingly democratic diet returned under this reform bill was
                    that the king should accept the Frankfort constitution. Frederick, alleging the
                    danger of acting without the concurrence of Prussia, refused, and dissolved the
                    diet. A public demonstration at Dresden in favour of the Frankfort constitution
                    was prohibited as illegal on May 2, 1849. This at once awoke the popular fury.
                    The mob seized the town and barricaded the streets; Dresden was almost destitute
                    of troops; and the king fled to the Kbnigstein. The rebels then proceeded to
                    appoint a provisional Government, consisting of Tzschirner, Heubner, and Todt,
                    though the true leader of the insurrection was the Russian Bakunin. Meanwhile
                    Prussian troops had arrived to aid the Government, and after two days’ fierce
                    street fighting the rising was quelled. The bond with Prussia now became closer,
                    and Frederick entered with Prussia and Hanover into the temporary “alliance of
                    the three kings.” He was not sincere, however, in desiring to exclude Austria,
                    and in 1850 accepted the invitation of that power to send deputies to Frankfort.
                    The first chamber immediately protested against this step, and refused to
                    consider the question of a pressing loan. The king retorted by dissolving the
                    diet and summoning the old estates abolished in 1848. When a quorum, with some
                    difficulty, was obtained, another period of retrograde legislation set in. The
                    constitution of the chambers has never been restored to the basis of 1848. The
                    king himself was carried away with the reactionary current, and the people
                    remained for the time indifferent. Von Beust became minister for both home and
                    foreign affairs in 1852, and under his guidance the policy of Saxony became more
                    and more hostile to Prussia and friendly to Austria. Saxony was not, however,
                    able to withdraw from the customs union, which indeed conferred the very highest
                    benefit on its trade and manufactures.</p>
                <p>The sudden death of the king, by a fall from his carriage in Tyrol, left the
                    throne to his brother John (1854-1873), a learned and accomplished prince, whose
                    name is known in German literature as a translator and annotator of Dante. His
                    brother’s ministers kept their portfolios, but their views gradually became
                    somewhat liberalized with the spirit of the times. Beust, however, still
                    retained his federalistic and philo-Austrian views. When war was declared
                    between Prussia and Austria in 1866, Saxony declined the former’s offer of
                    neutrality, and, when a Prussian force crossed the border, the Saxon army under
                    the king and the crown prince joined the Austrians in Bohemia. The entire
                    kingdom, with the solitary exception of the Kbnigstein, was occupied by the
                    Prussians. On the conclusion of peace Saxony lost no territory, but had to pay a
                    war indemnity of ten million thalers, aud was compelled to enter the
                    North-German Confederation. Its army and its postal and telegraph system were
                    placed under the control of Prussia, and its representation at foreign courts
                    was entrusted to the Prussian embassies. Beust was forced to resign; and liberal
                    measures in both church and state were actively carried through. John was
                    succeeded in 1873 by his elder son Albert (born 1828), who had won distinction
                    as a general in the wars of 1866 and 1870. Under this prince the general course
                    of politics has presented nothing of special importance, except perhaps the
                    steady spread of the doctrines of social democracy, which has flourished
                    especially in Saxony. As a loyal member of the new German empire, Saxony has
                    gradually transferred its sympathies from its old ally Austria to its new leader
                    Prussia. In 1877 Leipsic was chosen as the seat of the supreme court of law for
                    the empire.</p>
                <p>The political history of the parts of Saxony left by the capitulation of
                    Wittenberg to the Ernestine line, which occupy the region now generally styled
                    Thuringia (Thüringen), is mainly a recital of partitions, reunions, redivisions,
                    and fresh combinations of territory among the various sons of the successive
                    dukes. The principle of primogeniture was not introduced until the end of the
                    17th century, so that the Protestant Saxon dynasty, instead of building up a
                    single compact kingdom for itself, has split into four petty duchies, of no
                    political influence whatever. In 1547 the ex-elector John Frederick the
                    Magnanimous was allowed to retain Weimar, Jena, Eisenach, Gotha, Henneberg, and
                    Saalfeld. Altenburg and a few other districts were added to the Ernestine
                    possessions by the treaty of Naumburg in 1554, and other additions were made
                    from other sources. John Frederick, who had retained and transmitted to his
                    descendants the title of duke of Saxony, forbade his sons to divide their
                    inheritance; but his wishes were respected only until after the death of his
                    eldest son in 1565. The two survivors then founded separate jurisdictions at
                    Weimar and Coburg, though arrangements were made to exchange territories every
                    three years. In 1596 Saxe-Coburg gave off the branch Saxe-Eisenach; and in 1603
                    Saxe-Weimar gave off Saxe-Altenburg, the elder Weimar line ending and the
                    younger beginning with the latter date. By 1638 Weimar had absorbed both Coburg
                    and Eisenach; Altenburg remained till 1672. John, duke of Saxe-Weimar, who died
                    in 1605, is regarded as the common ancestor of the present Ernestine lines. In
                    1640 his three surviving sons ruled the duchies of Weimar, Eisenach, and Gotha.
                    Eisenach fell in in 1644 and Altenburg in 1672, thus leaving the dukes of
                    Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Gotha to become the ancestors of tho modern ruling houses.
                    Saxe-Weimar was still repeatedly divided; in 1668 a Saxe-Marksuhl appears, and
                    about 1672 a Saxe-Jena and a new Saxe-Eisenach. All these, however, were extinct
                    by 1741, and their possessions returned to the main line, which had adopted the
                    principle of primogeniture in 1719. The present grand-duchy of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach</hi> is separately noticed.</p>
                <p>Saxe-Gotha was even more subdivided; and the climax was reached about 1680, when
                    Gotha, Coburg, Meiningen, Romhild, Eisenberg, Hildburghausen, and Saalfeld were
                    each the capital of a duchy. By the beginning of 1825 only the first three of
                    these and Hildburghausen remained, the lands of the others having been divided
                    after much quarrelling. In that year the Gotha line expired, and a general
                    redistribution of the lands of the “Nexus Gothanus,” as this group of duchies
                    was called, was arranged on 12th November 1826. The duke of Hildburghausen gave
                    up his lands entirely for Altenburg and became duke of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Saxe-Altenburg;</hi> the duke of Coburg exchanged Saalfeld for Gotha and became
                    duke of <hi rend="smallcaps">Saxe-Coburg-Gotha;</hi> and the duke of <hi

                <p>The kingdom of Saxony, the history of which has been traced above, is the third
                    constituent of the German empire in point of population, and the fifth in point
                    of area. With the exception of the two small exclaves of Ziegelhein in
                    Saxe-Altenburg and Leibschwitz on the borders of Reuss, Saxe-Weimar, and
                    Saxe-Altenburg, it forms a compact whole of a triangular shape, its base
                    extending from north-east to south-west, and its apex pointing north-west. It
                    lies between 50° 10' and 51° 29' N. lat. and between 11° 53' and 15° 4' E. long.
                    The total area is 5789 square miles (about half the size of Belgium), or 2·7 per
                    cent. of tho entire empire; its greatest length is 130 miles, and its greatest
                    breadth 93 miles. Its frontiers have a circuit of 760 miles. On the south it is
                    bounded by Bohemia, on the west by Bavaria and the Thuringian states, and on the
                    remaining sides by Prussia. Except on the south, where the Erzgebirge forms at
                    once the limit of the kingdom and of the empire, the boundaries are entirely
                    political. For administrative purposes tho kingdom of Saxony is divided into the
                    four districts of Bautzen in the south-east, Dresden in the north-east, Leipsic
                    in the north-west, and Zwickau in the south-west.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> Saxony belongs almost entirely to the
                    central mountain region of Germany, only the districts along the north border
                    and around Leipsic descending into the great North-European plain. The average
                    elevation of the country is not, however, great; and it is more properly
                    described as hilly than as mountainous. The ordinary estimates return one-fifth
                    of the area as<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n378/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0378-0357"/> plain, two-fifths as hill country, and two-fifths
                    as mountain land. The slope is very regularly from south-east to north-west, in
                    the direction of the shorter axis. The chief mountain range is the Erzgebirge,
                    stretching for 90 miles along the south border, and reaching in the Fichtelbergs
                    (3979 feet and 3953 feet) the highest elevation in the kingdom. The west and
                    south-west half of Saxony is more or less occupied by the ramifications and
                    subsidiary groups of this range, one of which is known from its position as the
                    Central Saxon chain, and another lower group still farther north as the Oschatz
                    group. The south-east angle of Saxony is occupied by the mountains of Upper
                    Lusatia (highest summit 2600 feet), which form the link between the Erzgebirge
                    and Riesengebirge in the great Sudetic chain. North-west from this group, and
                    along both banks of the Elbe, which divides it from the Erzgebirge, extends the
                    picturesque mountain region known as the Saxon Switzerland. The action of water
                    and ice upon the soft sandstone of which the hills here are chiefly composed has
                    produced remarkable formations of deep gorges and isolated fantastic peaks,
                    which, however, though both beautiful and interesting, by no means recall the
                    characteristics of Swiss scenery. The highest summit attains a height of 1830
                    feet; but the more interesting peaks, as the Lilienstein, Königstein, and the
                    Bastei, are lower. With the trifling exception of the south-east of Bautzen,
                    which sends its waters by the Neisse to the Oder, Saxony lies wholly in the
                    basin of the Elbe, which has a navigable course of 72 miles from south-east to
                    north-west through the kingdom. Comparatively few of the numerous smaller
                    streams of Saxony flow directly to the Elbe, and the larger tributaries only
                    join it beyond the Saxon borders. The Mulde, formed of two branches, is the
                    second river of Saxony; others are the Black Elster, the White Elster, the
                    Pleisse, and the Spree. There are no lakes of any size, but mineral springs are
                    very abundant. The best known is at Bad Elster in the Voigtland.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of Saxony is generally healthy. It
                    is mildest in the valleys of the Elbe, Mulde, and Pleisse, and severest in the
                    Erzgebirge, where the district near Johanngeorgenstadt is known as Saxon
                    Siberia. The average temperature, like that of central Germany as a whole,
                    varies from 48° to 50° Fahr.; in the Elbe valley the mean in summer is from 62°
                    to 64°, and in winter about 30°; in the Erzgebirge the mean temperature in
                    summer is from 55° to 57°, and in winter 23° or 24°. The Erzgebirge is also the
                    rainiest district, 27½ to 33½ inches falling per annum; the amount decreases as
                    we proceed northwards, and Leipsic with an annual fall of 15½ to 21½ inches
                    enjoys the driest climate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soil,—</hi> Saxony is one of the most fertile parts of Germany;
                    and in regard to the productive occupation of its soil it stands among the most
                    advanced nations of the world. Only 1 per cent. of the total area is waste or
                    unused. According to the returns for 1883, 557 per cent. of the area is under
                    agriculture, 11·7 in pasture and meadow, 27·4 under forest, and 4·2 occupied by
                    buildings, roads, and water. The lowest lands are the most productive, and
                    fertility diminishes as we ascend towards the south, until on the bleak crest of
                    the Erzgebirge cultivation ceases altogether. Saxon agriculture, though dating
                    its origin from the Wends, has received its full development only in the present
                    century. Long fettered by antiquated customs, the land was subdivided into small
                    parcels and subjected to vexatious rights. But in 1834 a law was passed
                    providing for the union of the scattered lands belonging to each proprietor, and
                    that may be considered the dawn of modern Saxon agriculture, which has now
                    reached a very high pitch of excellence. It has been fostered both publicly and
                    privately, and a special official secretary assists the minister of the interior
                    in attending to this branch of national prosperity. In 1883 the agricultural
                    lands in Saxony were divided among 192,000 farmers or proprietors, of whom only
                    758 held 250 acres and upwards, 28,200 between 25 and 250 acres, and the rest
                    less than 25 acres. The small proprietors held 287 per cent. of the total area,
                    the middle class 57·2, and the large owners 14·1. The richest grain districts
                    are near Meissen, Grimma, Bautzen, Döbeln, and Pirna. The chief crop is rye, but
                    oats are hardly second to it. Wheat and barley are grown in considerably less
                    quantity. Very large quantities of potatoes are grown, especially in the
                    Voigtland. Beet is chiefly grown as feeding stuff for cattle, and not for sugar.
                    Flax (8270 acres in 1883) is grown in the Erzgebirge and Lusatian mountains,
                    where the manufacture of linen was at one time a flourishing domestic industry.
                    Saxony owes its unusual wealth in fruit to the care of the paternal elector
                    Augustus (1553-1586), who is said never to have stirred abroad without fruit
                    seeds for distribution among the peasants and farmers. Enormous quantities of
                    cherries, plums, and apples are annually borne by the trees round Leipsic,
                    Dresden, and Colditz. The cultivation of the vine in Saxony is respectable for
                    its antiquity, though the yield is insignificant. Wine is said to have been
                    grown here in the 11th century; the Saxon vineyards, chiefly on the banks of the
                    Elbe near Meissen and Dresden, occupied 2515 acres in 1883.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Live Stock.—</hi> According to returns made for 1883 Saxony
                    contained 126,886 horses, 651,329 cattle, 149,037 sheep, 355,550 pigs, and
                    116,547 goats. The breeding of horses is carried on to a very limited extent in
                    Saxony, more than nine-tenths of the horses required being imported.
                    Cattle-rearing, which has been an industry since the advent of the Wends in the
                    6th century, has attained very considerable importance on the extensive pastures
                    of the Erzgebirge and in the Voigtland. Sheep-farming has considerably declined
                    within the last few decades, as in most parts of northern Germany. While other
                    classes of domestic animals have retained very much the same proportion to the
                    number of the human population, sheep have decreased from one to every six
                    inhabitants in 1861 to one to every twenty in 1883. In 1765 the regent Prince
                    Xaver imported 300 merino sheep from Spain, and so improved the native breed by
                    this new strain that Saxon sheep were eagerly imported by foreign nations to
                    improve their flocks, and “Saxon electoral wool” became one of the best brands
                    in the market. The high level was not long maintained; flock-masters began to
                    pay more attention to quantity than to quality of wool, and the Saxon wool has
                    accordingly deteriorated. In 1868 no less than 1,166,130 lbs. of wool were
                    offered for sale in the wool markets of Saxony, of which Leipsic and Dresden are
                    the chief; in 1884 only 276,843 lbs. were offered. Swine furnish a very large
                    proportion of the flesh-diet of the people. Geese abound particularly round
                    Leipsic and in Upper Lusatia, poultry about Bautzen. Bee-keeping flourishes on
                    the heaths on the right bank of the Elbe; in 1883 there were 53,756 bee-hives in
                    Saxony. Game is not now very abundant; hares and partridges are shot in the
                    plains to the north-west.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forests.—</hi> The forests of Saxony are extensive, and have
                    long been well cared for both by Government and by private proprietors. The
                    famous school of forestry at Tharandt was founded in 1811. The Voigtland is the
                    most densely wooded portion of the kingdom, and next comes the Erzgebirge. About
                    8,379,200 acres, or 85 per cent. of the whole forest land, were planted with
                    coniferous trees; and about 1,439,700 acres or 15 per cent. with deciduous
                    trees, among which beeches aud birches are the commonest. About 30 per cent. of
                    the total belongs to Government.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The mineral wealth of Saxony is very
                    considerable; and its mines are among the oldest in Germany. Silver was raised
                    in the 12th century, and argentiferous lead is still the most valuable ore
                    mined; tin, iron, and cobalt rank next; and coal is one of the chief exports.
                    Copper, zinc, and bismuth are also worked. Saxon mines now produce about 6 per
                    cent. of the gross quantity, and about 8 per cent. of the aggregate value of
                    metals raised in Germany. The country is divided into four mining districts
                    :—Freiberg, where silver and lead are the chief products; Altenberg, where tin
                    is mainly raised; Schneeberg, yielding cobalt, nickel, and ironstone; and
                    Johanngeorgenstadt, with ironstone and silver mines. There are in all 236 mines,
                    but in 1883 only 150 of these were in operation, employing 8615 hands. In 1870
                    253 mines employed 9132 hands. The total value of metal raised in Saxony in 1883
                    was £288,200; in 1870 it was £314,916. Coal is found principally in two
                    fields,—one near Zwickau, and the other in the circle of Dresden. Brown coal or
                    lignite is found chiefly in the north and north-west, but not in sufficiently
                    large quantities to be exported. The number of coalmines is steadily decreasing,
                    though the numbers of miners and the gross produce are both on the increase. The
                    following table shows the output in tons since the years named :—</p>

                <p>Peat is especially abundant on the Erzgebirge. Immense quantities of bricks are
                    made all over the country. Excellent sandstone for building is found on the
                    hills of the Elbe; in 1883 266 quarries employed 1348 hands. Fine porcelain clay
                    occurs near Meissen, and coarser varieties elsewhere. A few precious stones are
                    found among the southern mountains. Saxony has no salt-mines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industries.—</hi> The Central-European position of Saxony has
                    fostered its commerce; and its manufactures have been encouraged by the abundant
                    water-power throughout the kingdom. Nearly one-half of the motive power used in
                    Saxon factories is supplied by the streams, of which the Mulde, in this respect,
                    is the chief. The early foundation of the Leipsic fairs, and the enlightened
                    policy of the rulers of the country, have also done much to develop its
                    commercial and industrial resources. Next to agriculture, which supports about
                    20 per cent. of the population, by far the most important industry is the
                    textile. Saxony carries on 26 per cent. of the whole textile industry in
                    Germany, a share far in excess of its proportionate population. Prussia, which
                    has more than nine times as many inhabitants, carries on 45 per cent., and no

                    engaged in this industry in 1882, by far the largest proportion in any German
                    state except Reuss (älterer Linie), which had 36 per cent. so engaged. The chief

                    Meerane, and Hohenstein in the south of Zwickau, and Camenz, Pulsnitz, and
                    Bischofswerda in the north of Dresden. The centre of the cotton manufacture
                    (especially of cotton hosiery) is Chemnitz; cotton-muslins are made throughout
                    the Voigtland, ribbons at Pulsnitz and its neighbourhood. Woollen cloth and
                    buckskin are woven at Camenz, Bischofswerda, and Grossenhain, all in the
                    north-east, woollen and half-woollen underclothing at Chemnitz, Glauchau,
                    Meerane, and Reichenbach; while Bautzen and Limbach produce woollen stockings.
                    Linen is manufactured chiefly in the mountains of Lusatia, where the looms are
                    still to some extent found in the homes of the weavers. The coarser kinds only
                    are now made, owing to the keen English competition in the finer varieties.
                    Damask is produced at Gross-Schönau and Neu-Schönau. Lace-making, discovered or
                    introduced by Barbara Uttmann in the latter half of the 16th century, anil now
                    fostered by Government schools, has long been an important domestic industry
                    among the villages of the Erz Mountains. Straw-plaiting occupies 6000 hands on
                    the mountain slopes between Gottleuba and Lockwitz. Waxcloth is manufactured at
                    Leipsic, and artificial flowers at Leipsic and Dresden. Stoneware and
                    earthenware are made at Chemnitz, Zwickau, Bautzen, and Meissen, porcelain
                    (“Dresden china”) at Meissen, chemicals in and near Leipsic. Döbeln, Werdau, and
                    Lossnitz are the chief seats of the Saxon leather trade; cigars are very
                    extensively made in the town and district of Leipsic, and hats and pianofortes
                    at Leipsic, Dresden, and Chemnitz. Paper is made chiefly in the west of the
                    kingdom, but does not keep pace with the demand. Machinery of all kinds is
                    produced, from the sewing-machines of Dresden to the steam-locomotives and
                    marine-engines of Chemnitz. The last-named place, though the centre of the
                    iron-manufacture of Saxony, has to import every pound of iron by railway. The
                    leading branch is the machinery used in the industries of the country—mining,
                    papermaking, and weaving. The very large printing trade of Leipsic encourages
                    the manufacture of printing-presses in that city. In 1883-84 Saxony contained
                    744 active breweries and 683 distilleries. The tendency in this branch of
                    industry is to extinguish the smaller establishments, and to form large
                    joint-stock companies. The smelting and refining of the metal ores is also an
                    important industry. The chief smelting works, at Freiberg, employed 1377 hands
                    in 1883.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trade.—</hi> Leipsic, with its famous and still frequented
                    fairs, is the focus of the trade of Saxony. The fur trade between eastern and
                    western Europe and the book-trade of Germany centre here. Chemnitz, Dresden,
                    Plauen, Zwickau, Zittau, and Bautzen are the other chief commercial cities. The
                    principal exports are wool, woollen, cotton, and linen goods, and the other
                    produce of the factories and of the mines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The roads of Saxony are numerous and good.
                    In 1883 there were 2304 miles of road in the kingdom. Saxony was the first
                    German state to encourage and develop a railway system, and, although at first
                    private enterprise led the way, the Saxon lines are now almost exclusively in
                    the hands of Government. The first railway, between Leipsic and Althen, was
                    opened on April 24, 1837. In 1837 there were 9 miles of state railway; in 1840,
                    71 miles; in 1850, 250; in 1870, 685; in 1880, 1184; and in 1884, 1355 miles,
                    which, together with 75 miles of private line, mostly worked by the state,
                    employed 24,400 hands. There are no canals in Saxony, and the only navigable
                    river is the Elbe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> In 1880 the population of Saxony was
                    2,972,805, or 6½ per cent. of the total population of the German empire, on 2·7
                    per cent. of its area. The provisional returns of the census of 1885 gave a
                    population of 3,179,168. With the exception of the free towns, Saxony is the
                    most densely peopled member of the empire, and its population is increasing at a
                    more rapid rate than is the case in any of the larger German states. In 1880
                    Saxony had 513 5 inhabitants per square mile, nearly three times as many as
                    Bavaria; Prussia had 202·8, and the average for the empire was 216·7. More than
                    half (56 per cent.) of the people live in communities of over 2000 inhabitants.
                    The following table shows the distribution of the population among the four
                    administrative districts. It will be noticed that the industrial district of
                    Zwickau is the most densely peopled.</p>

                <p>The growth of the population since 1815, when the kingdom received its present
                    limits has been as follows:—in 1815,1,178,802; in 1830, 1,402,066; in 1840,
                    1,706,275; in 1864, 2,344,094; and in 1875, 2,760,586.</p>
                <p>The number of marriages per 1000 inhabitants is between 8 and</p>
                <p>9; the birth-rate is 43, and the death-rate 30 per thousand. The annual increase
                    of the population, on the average of the five years between 1875 and 1880, is at
                    the rate of 1·48 per cent. The death-rate in Saxony is the highest in Germany,
                    but its birth-rate is also the highest, except in the small state of Reuss
                    (älterer Linie). In 1883, out of 132,209 births, 16,990, or 12·8 per cent., were
                    illegitimate, and 4935, or 3·7 per cent., were still-born, and. these rates
                    represent tolerably accurately the average of the last few years. In the
                    relative number of suicides (311 per 1,000,000 inhabitants) Saxony ranks highest
                    among the European states (see Morselli, <hi rend="italic">Int. Sci. Ser.,</hi>
                    vol. xxxvi.). In 1884 1114 persons, of whom 861 were males, committed suicide.
                    In the same year 17,706 persons were punished as vagrants.</p>
                <p>The preponderating industrial activity of Saxony fosters the tendency of the
                    population to concentrate in towns; with the exception of the free towns and
                    Anhalt, no German state has so large a proportion of urban population, <hi
                    rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> inhabitants residing in communities of 2000 persons
                    and upwards. In the empire as a whole 41·4 per cent. of the population is urban
                    in this sense; in Saxony the proportion rises to 56·6 per cent. The largest
                    towns are Dresden (245,515 inhabitants), the capital since the middle of the
                    16th century, Leipsic (170,076), and Chemnitz (110,693). Eighteen other towns,
                    chiefly in the manufacturing district of Zwickau, have over 10,000 inhabitants,
                    and thirty-five between 5000 and 10,000. The main results of the industrial
                    census of 1882, which shows an increase of population since 1880 of 42,000, are
                    summarized in the following table, which gives the number of persons (including
                    wives, families, and dependants) supported by the several occupations, and the

                    remainder, including the royal family, are mostly Roman Catholics. According to
                    the religious census of 1880, 2,886,806 were Evangelicals, 74,333 Roman
                    Catholics, 1467 German Catholics, 620 Anglicans, 453 Greek Catholics, 6518 Jews,

                    1393 places of worship in 1884. Its head is the minister “de evangelicis” so
                    long as the king is Roman Catholic; and its management is vested in the
                    Evangelical Consistory at Dresden. Its representative assembly, consisting of

                    it on a level with the Lutherans. By the peace of Prague, which transferred
                    Upper Lusatia to Saxony in 1635, stipulations were made in favour of the Roman
                    Catholics of that region, who are ecclesiastically in the jurisdiction of the

                    districts are managed by an apostolic vicariate at Dresden, under the direction
                    of the minister of public worship. Two nunneries in Bautzen are the only
                    conventual establishments in Saxony, and no others may be founded. Among the

                    organization of which resembles that already described in detail under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Prussia.</hi> There are nearly 4000 elementary and preparatory
                    schools; and education is compulsory. Of 8856 recruits in 1883-84 only 13 (·15
                    per cent.) were unable to read and write. Saxony is particularly well-equipped
                    with technical schools, the textile industries being especially fostered by
                    numerous schools of weaving, embroidery, lace-making, &amp;c.; but the mining

                    Leipsic enjoys a world-wide reputation; not less the art-collections at
                    Dresden.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Constitution.—</hi> Saxony is a constitutional monarchy and a
                    member of the German empire, with four votes in the federal council and
                    twenty-three in the reichstag. The constitution rests on a law promulgated on
                    4th September 1831, and subsequently amended. The crown is hereditary in the
                    Albertine Saxon line, with reversion to the Ernestine line, of which the duke of
                    Saxe-Weimar is now the head. The king enjoys a civil list of 2,940,000 marks or
                    £147,000, while the apanages of the crown, including the payments to the other
                    members of the royal house, amount to £15,670 more. The legislature
                    (Ständeversammlung) is bicameral,— the constitution of the co-ordinate chambers
                    being finally settled by a law of 1868 amending the enactment of 1831. The first
                    chamber consists of the adult princes of the blood, five hereditary members from
                    among the nobility, representatives of the Lutheran and Roman Catholic Churches,
                    a representative of Leipsic university, twelve representatives of proprietors
                    with landed property of an annual value of at least £150, elected for life, and
                    ten representatives of the same class nominated for life by the crown, the chief
                    magistrates of the eight principal towns, and five other life members, chosen
                    without any restrictions by the king. The second chamber consists of thirty-five
                    members from the towns and forty-five from the country, elected for six years.
                    All male citizens twenty-five years old and upwards who pay one thaler (3s.) per
                    annum in taxes have the suffrage; and all above thirty years of age who pay 10
                    thalers in annual taxes are eligible as members of the diet. The chambers must
                    be convened at least once every two years; and extraordinary meetings take place
                    at every change of ruler and on other special occasions. One-third of the
                    members of the second chamber retire at the end of every period of two years.
                    With the exception of the hereditary and some of the ex-officio members of the
                    first chamber, the members of the diet are entitled to an allowance (12s.) for
                    their daily expenses, as well as their travelling expenses. The executive
                    consists of a responsible ministry (Gesammtministerium), with the six
                    departments of justice, finance, home affairs, war, public worship and
                    education, and foreign affairs. The minister of the royal household does not
                    belong to the cabinet. The constitution also provides for the formation of a
                    kind of privy council (Staatsrath), consisting of the cabinet ministers and
                    other members appointed by the king.</p>
                <p>For administrative purposes Saxony is divided into four Kreishauptmannschaften or
                    governmental departments, subdivided into fifteen Amtshauptmannschaften and one
                    hundred and sixteen Aemter. The cities of Dresden and Leipsic form departments
                    by themselves. The supreme court of law for both civil and criminal cases is the
                    Oberlandes-Gericht at Dresden, subordinate to which are seven other courts in
                    the other principal towns and one hundred and five inferior tribunals. The
                    German imperial code was adopted by Saxony in 1879. Leipsic is the seat of the
                    imperial supreme court.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Finance.—</hi> The Saxon financial period embraces a space of
                    two years. For 1884-5 the “ordinary” budget showed an income of £3,496,000,
                    balanced by the expenditure, which included a reserve fund of £29,400. The chief
                    sources of income were taxes (£1,377,293, including £899,975 of direct taxes),
                    state-railways (£1,357,890), and the public forests and domains (£359,171).
                    Lotteries brought in £232,270, and the royal porcelain manufacture £17,500. The
                    chief expenditure was on the interest (£1,135,681) and sinking fund (£410,000)
                    of the national debt. The “extraordinary” budget, applying exclusively to public
                    works, showed an income and expenditure tallying at £882,800. The national debt,
                    incurred almost wholly in making and buying railways, amounted on 1st January
                    1885 to £32,670,300, mostly paying interest at the rate of 4 per cent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Army.—</hi> The Saxon army is modelled on that of Prussia. It
                    forms the 12th army corps in the imperial German army, and consists of the 23rd
                    and 24th divisions, with headquarters at Dresden and Leipsic respectively. On
                    its peace-footing the Saxon contingent includes 20,500 infantry, 4180 cavalry,
                    and 3000 artillery; in war it has 75,800 infantry, 6680 cavalry, and 8050
                    artillery.</p>
                <p>The statistical information in the above article has been derived chiefly from

                    Sachsen</hi> (Dresden, 1875-86) and the <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift des
                    Königlichen Sächsischen statistischen Bureau</hi> (Dresden, 1855-85). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Staatshandbuch für das Königreich Sachsen</hi> is an annual
                    official register. Engelhardt's <hi rend="italic">Vaterlandskunde für Schule und
                    Haus im Königreich Sachsen</hi> (Dresden, 3d ed. by Flathe, 1877) contains a
                    comprehensive account of the country and its resources; and Daniel's <hi
                    rend="italic">Handbuch der Geographie</hi> (Leipsic, 1881) clearly summarizes
                    the principal points. The standard history of Saxony is Böttiger's <hi

                    Gotha, 3d ed., edited and continued by Flathe, 1867-73). Brandes’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Grundriss der Sächsischen Geschichte</hi> (Leipsic, 1860) is a
                    succinct but somewhat dry summary. Other leading works on the subjects are

                    vols., Leipsic, 2d ed., continued by Bulau, 1862-63); Meynert, <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">Sächsische Geschichte</hi> (2 vols., Leipsic, 1810-12); and
                    Weisse, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Kursächsischen Staaten</hi> (7 vols.,
                    Leipsic, 1802-12). The publication of the <hi rend="italic">Codex Diplomaticus
                    Saxonias Regiae</hi> was begun in 1864 under the care of Gersdorf, and has been
                    continued under Posse and Emerisch. Posse has also published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die Markgrafen von Meissen und das Haus Wettin bis zu Konrad dem Grossen</hi>
                    (Leipsic, 1881); and Emerisch is the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Neue Archiv
                    für Sächsische Geschichte</hi> (Leipsic, 6 vols.), which contains full
                    information as to works on the history of the country. Weber’s older <hi

                    is Von Braun’s <hi rend="italic">Monatlicher Auszug aus der Geschichte des
                    Kur-und Fürstlichen Hauses Sachsens</hi> (6 vols., Langensalza, 1778-81). See
