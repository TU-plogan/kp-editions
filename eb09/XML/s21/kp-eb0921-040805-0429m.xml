                    at Göttingen and Leipsic, he attracted some attention by a book on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Griechen und Römer</hi> (1797), which was praised by Heyne. This
                    work was soon followed by his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Poesie der
                    Griechen und Römer.</hi> At Jena, where he lectured as a privat-docent at the
                    university, he contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> many striking
                    critical articles, and a number of lyrical poems which were afterwards included
                    in a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Gedichte.</hi> Here also he wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucinde,</hi> an unfinished romance, which was held by some of the
                    best of his contemporaries to be of a deeply immoral tendency, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Alαrcos,</hi> a tragedy, in which he attempted without much
                    success to combine romantic and classical elements. In 1802 he went to Paris,
                    where he edited <hi rend="italic">Europa,</hi> lectured on philosophy, and
                    carried on Oriental studies, some results of which he embodied in a well-known
                    book, <hi rend="italic">Geber die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier.</hi> In 1803
                    he and his wife joined the Roman Church, and from this time he became more and
                    more opposed to the principles of political and religious freedom. He went to
                    Vienna in 1808, and in the following year was engaged as imperial court
                    secretary at the headquarters of the archduke Charles. At a later period he was
                    for some time councillor of legation in the Austrian embassy at the Frankfort
                    diet, but in 1818 he returned to Vienna. Meanwhile he had published two series
                    of lectures, <hi rend="italic">Ueber die neuere Geschichte</hi> (1811) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Geschichte der alten und neuen Literatur</hi> (1815). After his
                    return to Vienna from Frankfort he edited <hi rend="italic">Concordia,</hi> and
                    began the issue of his <hi rend="italic">Sämmtliche Werke.</hi> He also
                    delivered lectures, which were republished in his <hi rend="italic">Philosophie
                    des Lebens</hi> (1828) and in his <hi rend="italic">Philosophie der
                    Geschichte</hi> (1829). He died on the 11th January 1829 at Dresden, where he
                    was delivering the course of lectures which appeared in 1830 under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophische Vorlesungen, insbesondere über die Philosophie der
                    Sprache und des Wortes.</hi> His own collection of his works included ten
                    volumes, and to this number five volumes were added after his death. A permanent
                    place in the history of German literature belongs to Friedrich Schlegel and his
                    brother August Wilhelm as the critical leaders of the Romantic school, which
                    derived from them most of its governing ideas as to the characteristics of the
                    Middle Ages, and as to the methods of literary expression. In their writings,
                    too, there is the fullest and most impressive statement of the mystical
                    spiritual doctrines of the Romantic school. Of the two brothers, August Wilhelm
                    did the highest permanent service to his countrymen by his translations from
                    Shakespeare and Calderon. The best of Friedrich’s works is his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geschichte der alten und neuen Literatur,</hi> in which was presented for the
                    first time a systematic account of the development of European literature as a
                    whole.</p>
                <p>Friedrich Schlegel’s wife, Dorothea, a daughter of Moses Mendelssohn, was born at
                    Berlin about the year 1770, and died at Frankfort in 1839. She was an eccentric
                    but remarkably clever woman, and wrote or edited several works, issued by her
                    husband,— the unfinished romance <hi rend="italic">Florentin</hi> (1801), the
                    first volume of the <hi rend="italic">Sammlung romantischer Dichtungen des
                    Mittelalters</hi> (2 vols., 1804), and <hi rend="italic">Bother und Maller</hi>
                    (1805). By her first marriage she had a son, Philip Veit, who became one of the
                    most eminent painters of his day in Germany.</p>
