                            &amp;c.), the analogy of which seems to exclude the idea that it is
                            softened from “heard of God.” It seems rather to mean “name
                            of</p><p>El,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> “manifestation of God’s power
                            or will.” Compare the title Shem Baal, “name of Baal,” given to Astarte
                            on the epitaph of Eshmunazar.</p></note> a seer and “judge” of</p>
                <p>Israel in the time of the Philistine oppression. His history, as told in the
                    first book of Samuel (compare Psalm xcix. 5; Ecclus. xlvi. 13 <hi rend="italic"
                        >sq.),</hi> is too familiar to call for repetition here, and a critical
                    estimate of his place in Hebrew history has been given in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Israel,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 403. There remain, however, one or two points of
                    detail which may be noticed here. His birthplace was Ramah, or, as it is called
                    in the Hebrew text of 1 Sam. i. 1, Ha-Ramathaim (Ramathem, 1 Macc. xi. 34;
                    Arimathaea, Mat. xxvii. 57); the identity of the two names is supported by the
                    Septuagint, which has Arimathaim for Ramah in several passages. Ramah, which
                    appears in 1 Kings xv. 17 as a stronghold on the frontier of the kingdoms of
                    Ephraim and Judah, is probably identical with the modern El-Râm, about 5 miles
                    north of Jerusalem, on a hill on the east side of the main road to Shechem and
                    the north. Ramah was also the place where Samuel usually resided in his later
                    days, and from which he made a yearly circuit through a very limited district in
                    the immediate neighbourhood, “judging Israel” (1 Sam. vii. 16). None of the
                    cities which he visited is more than a few miles from Ramah. Ramah, according to
                    1 Sam. i. 1 (where the text is to be corrected by the Septuagint), was a town in
                    the district of Zuph, belonging to the tribe of Ephraim (comp. 1 Sam. ix. 5 and
                    1 Sam. x. 2, where the grave of Rachel lies on the frontier between Ephraim and
                    Benjamin; a different localization is given in Gen. xxxv. 19, 20, unless the
                    identification of Bethlehem and Ephrath there is a later gloss). The original
                    text of 1 Sam. i. 1 does not seem to say explicitly that Samuel’s father was an
                    Ephrathite <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> of the tribe of Ephraim), though his
                    city was Ephrathite; and 1 Chron. vi. 28, 33 [vi. 13, 18] makes him a Levite,
                    apparently because a post-exile family of singers traced their stock from him.
                    The old accounts certainly represent Samuel even as a child as doing priestly
                    service at Shiloh, girt with the ephod and wearing the priestly robe <hi
                        rend="italic">(mĕ'îl,</hi> E. V. “coat,” 1 Sam. ii. 18 <hi rend="italic"
                        >sq.),</hi> but at that early date priesthood was by no means confined to
                    Levites, and the story certainly implies that it was not by birth but only by
                    his mother’s vow that he was dedicated to the service of the sanctuary. On
                    Samuel’s relation to the prophets, see vol. xix. p. 815. Compare also <hi
