                    Atlantic; under the latter come the sea laws of Wisby, which reflect the customs
                    of the mariners of the North Sea and of the Baltic.</p>
                <p>The earliest collection of such usages which was received in England is described
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Black Book of the Admiralty</hi> as the “Laws of
                    Oléron,” whilst the earliest known text is contained in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liber Memorandorum</hi> of the corporation of the City of London, preserved in
                    the archives of their Guildhall. These laws are in an early handwriting of the
                    14th century, and the title prefixed to them is <hi rend="italic">La Charte
                    d'Oleroun des Juggementz de la Mier.</hi> How and in what manner these
                    “Judgments of the Sea” came to be collected is not altogether certain. Cleirac,
                    a learned advocate in the parliament of Bordeaux, in the introduction to his
                    work on <hi rend="italic">Les Us et Coustumes de la Mer,</hi> first printed at
                    Bordeaux in 1647, states that Eleanor, duchess of Guienne (the consort of Louis
                    VII. of France, but subsequently divorced from him and married to Henry II. of
                    England), having observed during her visit to the<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0609-0584"/> Holy Land, in company with Louis, that the
                    collection of customs of the sea contained in <hi rend="italic">The Book of the
                    Consulate of the Sea</hi> (see vol. vi. p. 317) was held in high repute in the
                    Levant, directed on her return that a record should be made of the judgments of
                    the maritime court of the island of Oléron (at that time a peculiar court of the
                    duchy of Guienne), in order that they might serve as law amongst the mariners of
                    the Western Sea. He states further that Richard I. of England, on his return
                    from the Holy Land, brought back with him a roll of those judgments, which he
                    published in England and ordained to be observed as law. It is probable that the
                    general outline of Cleirac’s account is correct, as it accords with a memorandum
                    on the famous roll of 12 Edw. III., “De Superioritate Maris Angliae,” which,
                    having been for many years carefully preserved in the archives of the Tower of
                    London, is now deposited in the Public Record Office. According to this
                    memorandum, the king’s justiciaries were instructed to declare and uphold the
                    laws and statutes made by the kings of England, in order to maintain peace and
                    justice amongst the people of every nation passing through the sea of England:
                    “Quae quidem leges et statuta per dominum Ricardum, quondam regem Angliae, in
                    reditu suo a Terra Sancta correcta fuerunt, interpretata, declarata, et in
                    Insula Oleron publicata, et nominata in Gallica lingua La Leye Olyroun.”</p>
                <p>The earliest version of these Oléron sea laws, which, according to the memorandum
                    above mentioned, were received in England in the latter part of the 12th
                    century, comprised certain customs of the sea which were observed in the wine
                    and the oil trade, as carried on between the ports of Guienne and those of
                    Brittany, Normandy, England, and Flanders. No English translation seems to have
                    been made before the <hi rend="italic">Rutter of the Sea,</hi> printed in London
                    by Thomas Petyt in 1536, in which they are styled “the Lawes of ye Yle of
                    Auleron and ye Judgementes of ye See.” French was, in fact, a tongue familiar to
                    the English High Court of Admiralty down to the reign of Henry VI. A Flemish
                    text, however, appears to have been made in the latter part of the 14th century,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Purple Book of Bruges,</hi> preserved in the archives of
                    Bruges, in a handwriting somewhat later than that of the <hi rend="italic">Liber
                    Memorandorum.</hi> Prefixed to this Flemish version is the title, “Dit es de
                    Coppie van den Rollen van Oleron van den Vonnesse van der Zee.” Certain changes,
                    however, have been made in the <hi rend="italic">Purple Book of Bruges</hi> in
                    the names of the ports mentioned in the original Gascon text. For instance,
                    Sluys is in several places substituted for Bordeaux, just as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rutter of the Sea</hi> London replaces Bordeaux. That these sea
                    laws were administered in the Flemish maritime courts may be inferred from two
                    facts. First, a Flemish translation of them was made for the use of the maritime
                    tribunal of Damme, which was the chief Flemish entrepôt of the wine trade in the
                    13th century. The text of this translation has been published by Adriaen Verwer
                    under the title of the <hi rend="italic">Judgments of Damme.</hi> In the second
                    place, there is preserved in the archives of the senate of Dantzic, where there
                    was a maritime court of old, famous for the equity of its judgments, an early
                    manuscript of the 15th century, which contains a Flemish reproduction of the
                    Judgments of Oléron headed “Dit is Twater Recht in Vlaenderen.” So far there can
                    be no doubt that the Judgments of Oléron were received as sea laws in Flanders
                    as well as in England in the 14th century. Further inquiry enables us to trace
                    them as they followed the course of the wine trade in the North Sea and the
                    Baltic Sea. Boxhorn, in his <hi rend="italic">Chronyk van Zeelande,</hi> has
                    published a Dutch version of them, which Van Leeuwen has reproduced in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Batavia Illustrata,</hi> under the title of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laws of West-Capell</hi> in Zealand. Verwer has also pub lished a Dutch text of
                    them in his <hi rend="italic">Nederlant's See-Rechten,</hi> accompanied by
                    certain customs of Amsterdam, of which other MSS. exist, in which those customs
                    are described as usages of Stavoren, or as usages of Enkhuizen, both ports of
                    active commerce in the 15th century. Of these customs of Amsterdam, or, as they
                    were more generally styled, “Ordinances of Amsterdam,” further mention is made
                    below.</p>
                <p>A new and enlarged collection of sea laws, purporting to be an extract of the
                    ancient laws of Oléron, made its appearance in the latter part of the 15th
                    century in <hi rend="italic">Le Grant Routier de la Mer,</hi> printed at
                    Poitiers in France by Jan de Marnef, at the sign of the Pelican. The titlepage
                    is without a date, but the dedication, which purports to be addressed by its
                    author Pierre Garcie <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Ferrande to his godson, is
                    dated from St Gilles on the last day of May 1483. It contains forty-seven
                    articles, of which the first twenty-two are identical with articles of the
                    “Judgments of the Sea,” in the <hi rend="italic">Liber Memorandorum,</hi> the
                    remaining articles being evidently of more recent origin. A black-letter edition
                    of this work in French, without a date, is preserved in the Bodleian Library at
                    Oxford, and to the last article this colophon is appended: “Ces choses
                    précédentes sont extraictes du très utille et profittable Roolle Doloyron par le
                    dict Pierre Garcie alias Ferrande.” An English translation is printed in the
                    appendix to <hi rend="italic">A View of the Admiral Jurisdiction,</hi> published
                    in 1661 by Dr John Godolphin, in which the laws are described as “an Extract of
                    the Ancient Laws of Oléron rendered into English out of Garsias alias Ferrand.”
                    Although this new text had the recommendation of an advocate who had filled the
                    office of judge of the Admiralty Court during the Commonwealth and been
                    appointed king’s advocate-general by Charles II., it seems to have been
                    superseded in a short time by Cleirac’s <hi rend="italic">Us et Coustumes de la
                    Mer,</hi> to which was appended the following clause of authentication: “Tesmoin
                    le Seel de l'Isle d’Oléron, estably aux contracts de la dite Isle, le jour du
                    Mardy apres la Feste Sainct André l’an mille deux cens soixant-six.” Cleirac
                    does not inform us from what source or under what circumstances he procured his
                    text, nor on what authority he has adopted in certain articles readings at
                    variance with those of Garcie, whilst he retains the same number of articles, to
                    wit, fortyseven. The clause of authentication cannot be accepted as a warranty
                    above suspicion, as the identical clause of authentication with the same date is
                    appended to the early Norman and Breton versions of the rolls, which contain
                    only twenty-six articles. Cleirac’s version, however, owing probably to the
                    superior style in which it was edited, and to the importance of the other
                    treatises on maritime matters which Cleirac had brought together for the first
                    time in a single volume, seems to have obtained a preference in England over
                    Garcie’s text, as it was received in the High Court of Admiralty during the
                    judgeship of Sir Leoline Jenkyns, and an English translation of it was
                    introduced into the English translation of the <hi rend="italic">Black Book of
                    the Admiralty</hi> made by John Bedford, the deputy registrar of the High Court,
                    and dedicated to Sir Leoline Jenkyns. It seems to have been Bedford’s intention
                    to print this translation under the title of “Sea Laws”; but the manuscript
                    passed into the hands of Sir Leoline Jenkyns, who gave it to the College of
                    Advocates in 1685. The <hi rend="italic">Black Book</hi> itself, which was
                    missing for a long time from the Admiralty registry, has recently been
                    discovered and has been replaced in the archives of the Admiralty Court. Of
                    these two versions of the sea laws of Oléron the earlier obtained a wide-world
                    reception, for it was translated into Castilian <hi rend="italic">(Fuero de

                <p>The parent stock of the Wisby sea laws would appear to have been a code preserved
                    in the chancery of Lübeck, drawn up in the Old Saxon tongue, and dated 1240.
                    This code contains amongst many others certain articles on maritime law which
                    are identical with articles in the Gothland sea laws, Gothland being the island
                    of which Wisby was the chief port. This collection comprises sixty-six articles,
                    and it is now placed beyond a doubt by recent researches, especially of
                    Professor Schlyter of Lund, that these Gothland sea laws are a compilation
                    derived from three distinct sources,—a Lübeck, an Oléron, and an Amsterdam
                    source. A Saxon or Low German text of this collection was printed for the first
                    time in L505 at Copenhagen by Godfrey de Gemen, a native of Gouda in Holland,
                    who is reputed to have set up the earliest printing-press in Copenhagen. This
                    print has no title-page, and in this respect resembles the earliest known print
                    of <hi rend="italic">The Consulate of the Sea;</hi> but upon a blank leaf, which
                    occupies the place of a frontispiece in one of two copies of Godfrey de Gemen’s
                    text, both preserved in the royal library at Copenhagen, there has been inserted
                    with a pen in alternate lines of black and red ink the title “Dat hogheste
                    Gotlansche Water-Recht gedrucket to Koppenhaven Anno Domini <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >m.d.v.,”</hi> and there has also been inserted on the first page of the text
                    the introductory title “Her beghynt dat hogheste Water-Recht” (here begins the
                    supreme sea law). Professor Schlyter has discovered a MS. (No. 3123) in the
                    royal library at Copenhagen, which is written on parchment in a hand of the 15th
                    century, and from which it seems probable that Godfrey de Gemen mainly derived
                    his text, as it comprises the same number of articles, containing the same
                    matter arranged in the same order, with this minor difference, that, whilst both
                    the MS. and the print have the simple title “Water-Recht” prefixed to the first
                    article, the MS. has also a similar title prefixed to the fifteenth. Further, as
                    this article together with those that follow it in the MS., appears to be in a
                    handwriting different from that of the articles that precede, the fifteenth
                    article may justly be considered as the first of a distinct series, more
                    particularly as they are numbered in Roman characters, beginning with § 1, and
                    such characters are continued with a single interruption down to the end of the
                    MS. Although, however, the numeration of the articles of this second series is
                    continuous and the handwriting of the MS. from the fifteenth to the sixty-sixth
                    article is unchanged, the text of the series is not continuous, as the fortieth
                    article commences with an introductory clause— “This is the ordinance which the
                    skippers and merchants have resolved amongst themselves as ship law.” There is
                    no difficulty in recognizing the first division of this second series of sea
                    laws as a Low German version of the Judgments of Oléron, transmitted most
                    probably through a Flemish text. This hypothesis would account for the
                    substitution in several articles of Sluys for Bordeaux. On the other hand, the
                    introductory clause which ushers in the fortieth article is identical with the
                    title that is generally prefixed to MSS. of the maritime Ordinances of
                    Amsterdam, and the text of this and of the following articles down to the
                    sixty-fifth inclusive is evidently of Dutch origin and more or less identical
                    with Verwer’s text of the usages of Amsterdam. M. Pardessus, in his valuable <hi
                    rend="italic">Collection de Lois Maritimes,</hi> published in Paris before
                    Professor Schlyter made known the result of his researches, has justly remarked
                    that the provisions of several articles of this last division of the sea laws
                    are inconsistent with the theory that they originated at Wisby. It may be
                    observed that the sixty-sixth article of the MS. is a Lübeck law identical with
                    the first article of the first series, which is of Lübeck origin. No colophon is
                    appended to this final article in the MS. Nevertheless, Godfrey de Gemen’s
                    edition of 1505, which breaks off in the middle of the sixty-sixth article of
                    the MS., has the following colophon :—“Here end the Gothland sea laws, which the
                    community of merchants and skippers have ordained and made at Wisby, that all
                    men may regulate themselves by them. Printed at Copenhagen, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d. m.d.v.”</hi> The question naturally suggests itself, To what MS. was
                    Godfrey de Gemen indebted for this colophon, or is the alternative more probable
                    that he devised it? There is no known MS. of this collection of an earlier date
                    to which an appeal can be made as an authority for this colophon; on the
                    contrary, the only known MSS. of which the date is earlier than Godfrey de
                    Gemen’s print, both of which are in the library of the university of Copenhagen,
                    are without this colophon, and one of them, which purports to have been
                    completed at Nyköping on the Eve of the Visitation of the Virgin in 1494,
                    concludes with a colophon which precludes all idea that anything has been
                    omitted by the scribe, viz., “Here ends this book, and may God send us his
                    grace, Amen.” We are disposed to think that Gemen himself devised this colophon.
                    He was engaged in printing for the first time other collections of laws for the
                    Danish Government, and, as Gothland was at that time a possession of Denmark, he
                    may have thus distinguished the sea laws from another collection, namely, of
                    land laws. Professor Schlyter, however, believes Gemen may have borrowed it from
                    a MS. which is lost, or at all events is not known. There is some support to
                    this view in the fact that in the archives of the guildhall of Lübeck there is
                    preserved a MS. of 1533 which contains a Low German version of the same
                    collection of sea laws, with a rubric prefixed to the first article announcing
                    them to be “the water law or sea law, which is the oldest and highest law of
                    Wisby,” and there are good reasons for supposing that the scribe of this MS.
                    copied his text from a MS. other than the Copenhagen MS. The same observation
                    will apply to a second MS. of a similar character preserved in the library of
                    the gymnasium of Lübeck, which purports to have been written in 1537. But as
                    regards the Wisby sea laws little reliance can be placed on such rubrics or
                    colophons as proofs of the facts recited in them, though they may be valuable as
                    evidence of the reputed origin of the sea laws at the time when the scribe
                    completed the MS. In illustration of this view it may be stated that in the same
                    year in which the more recent of these two MSS. purports to have been
                    completed—namely, 1537—there was printed at Lübeck an enlarged edition of the
                    sea laws consisting of seventy-two articles, being a Low German translation of a
                    Dutch text, in which six additional Dutch laws had been inserted which are not
                    found in the Copenhagen MS., nor have a place in Gemen’s text, yet to this
                    edition is prefixed the title, “This is the highest and oldest sea law, which
                    the community of merchants and shipmasters have ordained and made at Wisby, that
                    all persons who would be secure may regulate themselves by it.” Further, it has
                    an introductory clause to its thirty-seventh article—“This is the ordinance
                    which the community of skippers and merchants have resolved upon amongst
                    themselves as ship law, which the men of Zealand, Holland, Flanders hold, and
                    with the law of Wisby, which is the oldest ship law.” At the end of the
                    seventy-second article there follows this colophon: “Here ends the Gothland sea
                    law, which the community of merchants and mariners have ordained and made at
                    Wisby, that each may regulate himself by it. All honour be to God, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">mdxxxvii.”</hi> Each article of this edition has prefixed to it
                    after its particular number the word “belevinge” (judgment). It would thus
                    appear that the Wisby sea laws<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0611-0586"/> have fared like the Oléron sea laws: they have
                    gathered bulk with increasing years.</p>
                <p>The question remains to be answered, How did this collection of sea laws acquire
                    the title of the “Wisby sea laws” outside the Baltic? for under such title they
                    were received in Scotland in the 16th century, as may be inferred from extracts
                    from them cited in Sir James Balfour’s <hi rend="italic">System, of the more
                    Ancient Laws of Scotland,</hi> which, although not printed till 1754, was
                    completed before his death in 1583. The text of the Wisby sea laws generally
                    current in England is an English translation of a French text which Cleirac
                    published in 1641 in his <hi rend="italic">Us et Coustumes de la Mer,</hi> and
                    is an abbreviated, and in many respects mutilated, version of the original sea
                    laws. This inquiry, however, would open a new chapter on the subject of the
                    northern sea laws, and the civilizing influence which the merchants of Wisby
                    exercised in the 13th century through their factories at Novgorod, linking
                    thereby the trade of the Baltic to that of the Black Sea.</p>
