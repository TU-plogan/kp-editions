                    quarrelling with his family, was in some difficulty. But in 1761 he obtained an
                    appointment at Malta, which also he did not hold long. The most rolling of
                    stones, he appears at St Petersburg, at Warsaw, at Dresden, at Berlin, holding
                    brief commissions as an engineer and rejoicing in romantic adventures. But he
                    came back to Paris at the age of thirty even poorer than he set out. He then
                    passed two years in literary work, supporting himself in an unknown fashion, and
                    in 1768 (for he seems to have been as successful in obtaining appointments as in
                    losing them) he set out for the Isle of France (Mauritius) with a Government
                    commission and remained there three years, returning home in 1771. These
                    wanderings supplied Bernardin with the whole of what may be called his
                    stock-in-trade, for, though he lived more than forty years longer, he never
                    again quitted France. He was very poor, and indeed it is not easy to discover
                    from his biographers what he lived upon, for, though he was an unwearied
                    solicitor of employments and “gratifications,” he received but little, and his
                    touchy and sensitive temperament frequently caused him to quarrel with what
                    little he did receive. On his return from Mauritius he was introduced to the
                    society of D’Alembert and his friends, and continued to frequent it. But he took
                    no great pleasure in the company of any literary man except Rousseau, of whom in
                    Jean Jacques’s last years he saw much, and on whom he formed both his own
                    character and still more his style to a considerable degree. His first work of
                    any importance, the <hi rend="italic">Voyage à l’Ile de France,</hi> appeared in
                    1773 and gained him some reputation. It is the soberest and therefore the least
                    characteristic of his books. The <hi rend="italic">Études de la Nature,</hi>
                    which made his fame and assured him of literary success, did not appear till ten
                    years later, his masterpiece <hi rend="italic">Paid et Virginie</hi> not till
                    1787, and his other masterpiece (which, as much less sentimental and showing not
                    a little humour, some persons may be allowed to prefer), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chaumière Indienne,</hi> not till 1790. In 1792 he married<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0215-0196"/> a very young girl, Félicité Didot. For a short
                    time in 1792 he was superintendent of the Jardin des Plantes and again for a
                    short time professor of morals at the École Normale in 1794. Next year he became
                    a member of the Institute. After his first wife’s death he married, in 1800,
                    when he was sixty-three, another young girl, Désirée de Pelleport, and is said
                    to have been very happy with her. He still continued to publish, and was
                    something of a favourite with Napoleon. On the 21st of January 1814 he died at
                    Éragny near Pontoise, where he had in his last years chiefly lived and where he
                    had a house, so that he cannot have been ill off.</p>
                <p>It has been hinted that Bernardin de Saint-Pierre’s personal character was not
                    entirely amiable; it may be added that his literary character has not in all
                    English eyes sufficed to atone for it. Englishmen, and not Englishmen only, have
                    been found to pronounce <hi rend="italic">Paid et Virginie</hi> gaudy in style
                    and unhealthy, not to say unwholesome, in tone. Perhaps Bernardin is not fairly
                    to be judged by this famous story, in which the exuberant sensibility of the
                    time finds equally exuberant expression. The <hi rend="italic">Chaumière</hi>
                    and some passages in the <hi rend="italic">Études de la Nature</hi> proper may
                    be thought to exhibit the real merits of his style to greater advantage. The
                    historic estimate (the sole estimate that is of much worth in comparative
                    literary criticism) at once disengages the question from its difficulties. Where
                    Bernardin is of merit and importance is in his breaking away from the dull and
                    arid vocabulary and phrase which more than a century of classical writing had
                    brought upon France, in his genuine and vigorous preference of the beauties of
                    nature to the mere charms of drawing-room society, and in the attempt which he
                    made, with as much sincerity as could fairly be expected from a man of his day,
                    to reproduce the aspects of the natural world faithfully. After Rousseau, and
                    even more than Rousseau, Bernardin was in French literature the apostle of the
                    return to nature, and, though in him and his immediate follower, Chateaubriand,
                    there is still much mannerism and unreality, he should not and will not lack the
                    credit due.</p>
                <p>Aimé Martin, disciple of Bernardin and the second husband of his second wife,
                    published a complete edition of his works in 18 volumes (Paris, 1818-20),
                    afterwards increased by additional correspondence, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic"
