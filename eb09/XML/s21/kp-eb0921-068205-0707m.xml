                <p><label type="entry">SERPENTINE</label>, a compact crypto-crystalline or fibrous
                    mineral substance, occurring in rock-masses which commonly present dark green
                    colours, variously mottled and fancifully compared to the markings on certain
                    serpents, whence the name “serpentine.” For a like reason it is sometimes called
                    “ophite,” while Italian sculptors have termed it “ranocchia,” in allusion to its
                    resemblance to the skin of a frog. In consequence of its variegated tints, the
                    stone is frequently cut and polished for ornamental purposes, and is hence
                    popularly called a marble. From true marble, however, it differs in chemical
                    composition, being essentially a hydrated silicate of magnesium, usually
                    associated with certain metallic oxides (such as those of iron, nickel, and
                    chromium) which confer upon the stone its characteristic tints. In some
                    localities serpentine is found in<pb break="no"

                    rocks, while elsewhere it occurs interbedded, usually in lenticular masses,
                    associated with gneiss and crystalline schists. It is noteworthy that the
                    serpentine is frequently crushed and brecciated, exhibiting polished slip-faces
                    which are sometimes striated. The surface of an exposed mass of serpentine is
                    generally barren, whence bosses of the rock are known in the Alps as “monts
                    morts.” The origin of serpentine has been a subject of much dispute. It was
                    pointed out by Sandberger and Tschermak that the alteration of olivine may give
                    rise to this product, and pseudomorphe of serpentine after chrysolite are well
                    known to mineralogists. Professor Bonney and many other geologists regard
                    serpentine as being generally an altered eruptive rock, due to the hydration of
                    peridotites, such as lherzolite; probably it may also result from the
                    decomposition of olivine-gabbro and other rocks rich in magnesian silicates.
                    Augite and hornblende may become altered to serpentine. On the contrary, Dr
                    Sterry Hunt and certain other chemical geologists believe that serpentine has
                    generally been formed as an aqueous sediment, probably precipitated by the
                    reaction of sulphate or chloride of magnesium upon the silicate of lime or
                    alkaline silicates derived from the disintegration of crystalline rocks and
                    found in solution in many natural waters. Serpentine is a rock of rather limited
                    occurrence. Its principal localities in England are Cornwall, especially in the
                    Lizard district, where it occupies a considerable area. The famous scenery of
                    Kynance Cove owes much of its beauty to the vivid colours and brilliant surface
                    of the serpentine. The rock is worked into vases, columns, mantelpieces,
                    &amp;c., and of late years has been used to a limited extent for the decoration
                    of shop-fronts in London. The beauty of the Lizard rock is heightened by the
                    white veins of steatite which traverse it, and in some cases by disseminated
                    crystals of bastite, which glisten with metallic lustre. Much of the Lizard
                    serpentine is of rich red and brown colour. Green serpentine is found near
                    Holyhead in Anglesea. A singularly beautiful variety of mottled red and green
                    tints, with veins of steatite, occurs near Portsoy in Banffshire, Scotland. It
                    is also found with chrome iron ore in the Shetland Islands. The green serpentine
                    of Galway occurs in intimate association with crystalline limestone, forming the
                    rock known as “ophicalcite” or “serpentinous marble.” Such an association is by
                    no means uncommon; but, though the beauty of the serpentine may thus be
                    enhanced, its durability seems to be impaired. On exposure to the weather the
                    carbonate of calcium decomposes more readily than the silicate of magnesium, and
                    hence the stone soon presents a rough eroded surface. The Galway rock comes into
                    the market under the name of “Irish green” or “Connemara marble.” Ophicalcites
                    also occur in Ayrshire, Scotland, and in various parts of the Scottish
                    Highlands; and the green pebbles found in Iona belong to this type of rock.</p>
                <p>On the Continent serpentines are largely worked at Zöblitz and at Waldheim in
                    Saxony. The famous rock of Zöblitz, mentioned by Agricola, is known to have been
                    wrought for between three and four centuries, and is still extensively explored
                    by open quarries and by subterranean galleries. The rock usually presents
                    various shades of green and brown, red being very rare; but its most interesting
                    feature is the frequent presence of pyrope, or Bohemian garnet, which occurs
                    scattered through the rock in dark red grains, that decompose on weathering to a
                    green chloritic product. Very little of the Zöblitz serpentine comes to England,
                    but it is common throughout Germany, and a good deal is sent to Russia and even
                    to the United States. It has been used in the construction of the mausoleum of
                    Prince Albert at Frogmore, and for Abraham Lincoln’s monument at Springfield,
                    Illinois. The best known of the Italian serpentines is the “verde Prato,” which
                    has been quarried for centuries at Monteferrato, near Prato in Tuscany.
                    According to Capacci this serpentine is probably of Eocene age. It has been
                    largely used as a decorative stone in ecclesiastical architecture in Prato,
                    Pistoia, and Florence. A good deal of serpentine is found near Genoa and
                    Levanto. The “verde di Pegli” is obtained from Pegli, not far from Genoa, while
                    the “verde di Genova” is a brecciated serpentinous limestone from Pietra
                    Lavezzara. Serpentine also occurs at various other points of the Apennines, in
                    Elba, and in Corsica. The term “ophiolite” has been vaguely used to include not
                    only serpentines but many of the rocks associated with the Italian serpentines.
                    In like manner the term “gabbro,” derived from a locality near Leghorn, was at
                    one time used as a general name for serpentine and its associates, though now
                    usually restricted to a rock composed essentially of plagioclase and diallage.
                    It is notable that this true gabbro is often found in company with
                    serpentine.</p>
                <p>Serpentine is found in numerous localities in the Alps and in France. An elegant
                    variety is quarried at Épinal in the Vosges, and a beautiful ophicalcite is
                    worked at St Véran and Maurins, in the department of Hautes-Alpes. The
                    serpentine of the Ronda Mountains in Spain has been described by Mr J.
                    Macpherson. In North America serpentine is so extensively distributed that only
                    a few localities can be mentioned. It is found at Syracuse in New York; on
                    Manhattan and Staten Islands; at Hoboken in New Jersey; at Newport, Rhode
                    Island; at Newburyport, Massachusetts; at Westchester, Chester county, and at
                    Texas, Lancaster county, in Pennsylvania. It also occurs between Clear Lake and
                    New Idrea in California. A fine ophicalcite has been obtained from near Milford
                    and New Haven in Connecticut, and a beautiful variety has been worked at Port
                    Henry, Essex county, New York (Dana). The Canadian eozoon occurs in a
                    serpentinous limestone.</p>
