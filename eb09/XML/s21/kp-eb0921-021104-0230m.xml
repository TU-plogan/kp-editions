                    from Paestum to Salerno in 954), begun in 1076 by Robert Guiscard and
                    consecrated in 1084 by Gregory VII. In front is a beautiful quadrangular court
                    (112 by 102 feet), surrounded by arcades formed of twenty-eight ancient pillars
                    mostly of granite; and the middle entrance into the church is closed by a
                    remarkable bronze door of 11th or 12th century Byzantine work. The nave and two
                    aisles end in apses. Two magnificent marble ambos, the larger dating from 1175,
                    several specimens of ancient mosaic, and the tombs of Gregory VII. and Queen
                    Margaret of Durazzo deserve to be mentioned. In the crypt is a bronze statue of
                    St Matthew. The lofty aqueduct, one of whose arches is now used by the railway,
                    is a building of 1320; the present water-supply is provided by a canal formed in
                    1865. A fine port constructed by Giovanni da Procida in 1260 was destroyed when
                    Naples became the capital of the kingdom, and remained blocked with sand till
                    after the unification of Italy. A series of works, especially those decreed in
                    1880, have provided an inner harbour of 40 acres (depth 12 to 22 feet), an outer
                    harbour (22 to 25 feet), and wharves to the extent of 4468 feet. In 1884 180
                    vessels (29,078 tons) entered and 173 (28,069) cleared. Silk and cotton spinning
                    are the principal industries. The population was 19,905 in 1870 and 22,328
                    (commune, 31,245) in 1881.</p>
                <p>A Roman colony was founded at Salerno (Salernum) in 194 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> to keep the Picentines in check, but the city makes no figure in
                    history till after the Lombard conquest. Dismantled by order of Charlemagne, it
                    became in the 9th century the capital of an independent principality, the rival
                    of that of Benevento, and was surrounded by strong fortifications. The Lombard
                    princes, who had frequently defended their city against the Saracens, succumbed
                    before Robert Guiscard, who took the castle after an eight months’ siege and
                    made Salerno the capital of his new territory. The removal of the court to
                    Palermo and the sack of the city by the emperor Henry VI. in 1194 put a stop to
                    its development. The position which the medical school of the Civitas
                    Hinpocratica (as it called itself on its seals) held in mediaeval times has been

                    in Italy, was closed in 1817.</p>
