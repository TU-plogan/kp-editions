                    important groups with respect to the absence, union, or distinction of the sexes
                    and to the associated “secondary sexual characters” which distinctly male and
                    female organisms so frequently and strikingly present, and to follow up that
                    outline of the morphological facts with a brief discussion of the nature and
                    origin of the sexes and of the theory of reproduction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Characters of the Sexes.—</hi> Starting with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Protozoa,</hi> we find indeed that union or conjugation of two or
                    more individuals is of frequent if not universal occurrence; yet, since, at any
                    rate with rare and slight exceptions, no permanent morphological difference can
                    be made out which would entitle us to speak of males or females, the group is
                    generally defined as characterized by the absence of sexual reproduction.
                    Without at present accepting or rejecting this view, it is convenient to
                    postpone its discussion until the origin of sex comes to be considered.</p>
                <p>Passing to the <hi rend="italic">Coelentcra,</hi> we find among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydromedusae</hi> the sexes usually distinct, and this distinction
                    of the sexes has lately been traced back to the apparently asexual colonies from
                    which the gonophores arise. Exceptions, however, occur,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    Tubularia,</hi> which is monoecious. The higher <hi rend="italic">Medusae</hi>
                    are also usually unisexual, and occasionally even show secondary sexual
                    differences, as in the form and length of the prehensile filaments <hi
                    rend="italic">(Aurelia). Chrysaora,</hi> however, is hermaphrodite. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Siphonophora</hi> usually present both sexes within a single
                    colony,—the gonophores themselves being, however, unisexual. In a few cases <hi
                    rend="italic">(Apοlemia uvaria, Diphyes acuminata)</hi> the colony itself is
                    entirely male or female. The <hi rend="italic">Ctemophora</hi> are invariably
                    hermaphrodite; and among the <hi rend="italic">Hexactinia</hi> this is
                    frequently though not generally the case, completely dioecious colonies even
                    occurring <hi rend="italic">(Gerardia).</hi> Among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Octactinia</hi> the sexes are usually distinct, even so far as the colonies are
                    concerned, yet there are many exceptions, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    Corallium,</hi> which has male, female, and hermaphrodite polyps on the same
                    stock. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydrozoa, Corals, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Echinodermata</hi> are very rarely hermaphrodite <hi
                    rend="italic">(Synapta, Amphiura squamata),</hi> but secondary sexual characters
                    are almost unknown. <hi rend="italic">Thyone,</hi> however, has the male orifice
                    on a small protuberance. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Echinodfermata.</hi></p>
                <p>Probably no invertebrate group presents so varied and interesting a series of
                    sexual phenomena as the <hi rend="italic">Vermes.</hi> Thus the <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyzoa</hi> exhibit that remarkable association of
                    hermaphroditism with asexual reproduction which so frequently recurs in
                    organisms of vegetative habit. The Brachiopods also are hermaphrodite, as also
                    are the Oligochretes; the <hi rend="italic">Polychaeta</hi> only exceptionally
                    so; some <hi rend="italic">(Nereidae)</hi> exhibit secondary sexual characters
                    so well marked as to have been mistaken for specific or even generic ones. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Platyhelminthes</hi> with few exceptions are hermaphrodite;
                    the</p>
                <p>Nemerteans (except <hi rend="italic">Borlasia)</hi> are unisexual and
                    occasionally exhibit secondary sexual differences. The Nematodes are very rarely
                    hermaphrodite <hi rend="italic">(Ascaris, Pelodytes),</hi> but present very
                    marked sexual differences, the male being usually recognizable by smaller size
                    and caudal curvature. Spicules or claspers for copulation are also present. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Strongylus</hi> the female is carried by the male in a ventral
                    furrow. The aberrant nematoid <hi rend="italic">Echinorhynchus</hi> is also
                    dioecious. <hi rend="italic">Sagitta</hi> is hermaphrodite; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balanoglossus</hi> unisexual, but without secondary sexual difference. Some of
                    the most striking cases of sexual dimorphism are presented by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rotifera,</hi> where the male is often a fallen representative of
                    the specific type presented by the female, having not only greatly diminished in
                    size but having undergone thorough degeneration in structure, the alimentary
                    canal especially becoming represented by a mere imperforate thread of cells. Nor
                    are such cases of male degeneration by any means confined to this group: a yet
                    more striking instance is presented by the Gephyrean <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bonellia,</hi> in which the oviduct of the large and well-grown female contains
                    a number of almost microscopic ciliated Turbellarian-looking parasites, which
                    have been shown to be the degenerate males. The other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gephyrea</hi> present no such extraordinary dimorphism, while the <hi
                    rend="italic">Discophora</hi> are hermaphrodite. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Polyzoa, Brachiopoda, Annelida, Nemerteans, Planarians, Tapeworm, Sagitta,
                    Leech, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>Among Crustaceans the males are frequently smaller or relatively dwarfish,
                    sometimes attached parasitically to the female, and the sexes are generally
                    distinguishable at least by differences, in the structure of some of the
                    appendages,—generally, however, in evident relation to their respective
                    functions. Among the Copepods the sexes are separate, and a marked tendency to
                    dimorphism is manifested, even among the free-living forms. This is sometimes
                    manifested in a way which suggests the sexual magnificence of the highest
                    animals; thus, for instance, the male <hi rend="italic">Sapphirina</hi> has the
                    brilliance of a gem. "With the appearance of parasitism in the group the
                    reproductive relations become profoundly modified; thus it is the always less
                    active female which first becomes sessile and parasitic; the male occasionally
                    permanently retains freedom, as in the common <hi rend="italic">Nicothoe</hi> of
                    the lobster’s gill; more usually, however, he settles down beside or even upon
                    the female and becomes more or less completely epi-parasitic, undergoing a more
                    thorough degeneration than the female herself. The analogous series from free to
                    parasitic forms furnished by the <hi rend="italic">Ostracoda</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cirripedia</hi> are yet more remarkable in their sexual
                    degeneration, since not only does hermaphroditism become the rule, but
                    “complementary males” (most frequently two to one female) appear. These are
                    utterly degenerate in size and structure, in fact often quite unrecognizable as
                    Cirripedes at all, much less as members of the same species, save for their
                    developmental history and the existence of a few intermediate degrees of
                    degeneration between the normal and the lost Cirripede organization, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., Ibla</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Scalpellum,</hi> where the
                    males of some species still retain cirri and buccal pieces. In some cases at
                    least their male reproductive function seems to be discharged early in larval
                    life, before the exchange of free for sessile habits, their subsequent life
                    apparently even sinking below the level of reproductive activity. A reversal of
                    sex has actually been alleged in some cases, the males having been said to
                    become female. In the Phyllopods the sexes are separate, but parthenogenesis
                    very frequently occurs, as in <hi rend="italic">Daphnia, Apus, &amp;c.</hi>, and
                    even in <hi rend="italic">Apus</hi> tends to replace sexual reproduction very
                    completely. Von Siebold examined thousands of specimens during twelve years
                    without finding a single male; in other years, however, from 10 to 45 per cent.
                    of males have since been found. Besides the usual copulatory modifications of
                    appendages the males of some Phyllopods have more olfactory filaments on the
                    antennae. In Amphipods similar differences have been noted; in Isopods these
                    often become much more marked,—sometimes, as in the classical case of <hi
                    rend="italic">Praniza</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anceus,</hi> reaching a degree
                    of dimorphism without degeneration which is hardly exceeded in the animal
                    kingdom, and which quite naturally led to the separation of the sexes into
                    distinct genera. In the parasitic forms <hi rend="italic">(Bopyridae)</hi> the
                    females degenerate much more thoroughly than the small and active males. The
                    Schizopods exhibit considerable sexual differences. Thus among the males the
                    antennae bear larger olfactory comb-like structures and larger abdominal
                    members; copulatory appendages may also be specialized; while the females, as in
                    many Isopods, &amp;c., have a brood-pouch formed of overlapping ventral
                    lamellae. The different position of the sex-openings and the characteristic
                    forms of the limbs render the sexes easily distinguishable among the Decapods;
                    the crabs have an obviously broader abdomen in the female (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Crustacea).</hi> Among the <hi rend="italic">Arachnida,</hi>
                    the archaic king-crabs already show slight external sex-differences; among the
                    spiders the males have a maxillary pal p specially modified for a copulatory
                    organ, an adaptation which, associated with their often extremely small size, is
                    of great importance in aiding their escape from their larger and ferocious
                    mates. Some species of <hi rend="italic">Theridium</hi> have a stridulating
                    apparatus. The male scorpions on the other hand seem to possess a rather
                    stronger development; in the <hi rend="italic">Acarinae</hi> the smaller males
                    are more distinctly segmented,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n746/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0746-0721"/> possess appendages modified for attachment, and
                    sometimes retain a free habit of life as distinguished from the parasitic
                    females. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Arachnida.</hi></p>
                <p>Among Insects the sexes are distinguished by varying modifications of different
                    parts of the body, and differences in general form and in colour are frequent.
                    The males are generally active and more beautiful, and seem better endowed with
                    sense organs, though usually smaller than the females. The males have also a
                    preeminence or even monopoly in producing sounds, and it is perhaps in relation
                    to this that the psychology of sex can first be said to come within the range of
                    observation. Thus the field-cricket is said to lower the tone of his song while
                    caressing the female with his antennae. In the parasitic forms dimorphism, as
                    might be expected, becomes very marked; in <hi rend="italic">Strepsiptera</hi>
                    the males are free and winged, while the females are blind and wingless, in
                    fact, permanently larval. Similar cases occur in other orders, the glowworm
                    being probably the most familiar instance. In parasitic or abundantly nourished
                    forms parthenogenesis very frequently appears, the extreme case being presented
                    by <hi rend="italic">Cecidomyia,</hi> a fly which exhibits rapid parthenogenetic
                    reproduction in the larval state. The dimorphism of many beetles, in which the
                    male frequently acquires the most extraordinary specializations of external
                    form, has received especial attention from Darwin, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Descent of Man</hi> includes the fullest details. Here it is enough to mention
                    that Reichenau has recently pointed out the coexistence of the larger size and
                    relative inactivity of the male with the presence of these functionless
                    outgrowths. The beautiful sexual dimorphism so common among the Lepidoptera need
                    not be more than mentioned at present; while the very remarkable sexual
                    differentiation of <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera</hi> (bees, ants, sawflies,
                    &amp;c.) may also be assumed to be sufficiently familiar. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Insects, Ants, Bees.</hi> In several orders <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Diρtera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera)</hi> cases of dimorphism occur among the
                    females themselves, or even among the males; as many as three forms of females
                    have been described in certain butterflies.</p>
                <p>The Molluscan series opens with the normally dioecious Lamellibranchs, of which
                    some genera (most species of <hi rend="italic">Ostrea, Peeten,</hi> &amp;c. )
                    are, however, hermaphrodite. The Pteropods, Pulmonates, and Opisthobranchs are
                    hermaphrodite; the Prosobranchs, Heteropods, and Cephalopods unisexual. Though
                    slight differences have been described even in Lamellibranch shells (<hi
                    rend="italic">Unio</hi>), and though the internal anatomy of the essential and
                    accessory organs is of very high complexity, the extraordinary phenomena
                    associated with “hectocotylization” among the Cephalopod are the only marked
                    outward manifestations of that sexual dimorphism which reaches its climax in the
                    Argonaut. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca, Cuttle-fish.)</hi> The Tunicates
                    are usually hermaphrodite; <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> however, is
                    unisexual (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tunicata).</hi></p>
                <p>Among Fishes hermaphroditism is extremely rare <hi rend="italic">(Serranus).</hi>
                    The males are sometimes characterized by the modification of the pelvic limbs as
                    claspers, &amp;c., and are at the reproductive period often readily
                    distinguishable from the females by their brighter colour or other cutaneous
                    changes, such as ruffling of the skin. Male and female rays are readily also
                    distinguishable by their teeth and dermal defences. The hooked jaw of the male
                    salmon gives him a characteristic physiognomy during the breeding season. The
                    carp undergoes a sort of epidermic eruption at the same period; male and female
                    eels, too, are said often to become distinguishable both in colour and shape.
                    Stridulating apparatus may be present, notably in the Siluroids. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ichthyology.)</hi> Among Amphibians the bright dorsal crest of
                    the male newt is perhaps the most striking of sex distinctions, but many male
                    frogs and toads have vocal air sacs, epidermal callosities, and some <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cultripes, Pelobates)</hi> possess a gland under the fore-limb.
                    (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibia.)</hi></p>
                <p>Among the Ophidians the males are smaller, and have longer and more slender
                    tails; the sexes, too, differ sometimes in colour and markings. Male Chelonians,
                    too, have sometimes longer tails and claws and may even give voice. The
                    submaxillary musk-gland of the crocodile is especially active in the breeding
                    season; the lizards have remarkable throat-pouches and crests, which may be
                    epidermic or even correspond to cranial outgrowths, as in the chameleon.</p>
                <p>But it is among Birds and Mammals that the observer of sexual characters finds
                    abundant and remarkable differences extending to the minutest details, and
                    showing how the higher evolution of parental care which the inevitably prolonged
                    embryonic life involves and the wider range of sexual selection have co-operated
                    in modifying the whole organism. As might be expected, the lower mammals show
                    least of this; but as we ascend the adult males become differentiated from the
                    females by the acquirement of secondary sexual characters which are mainly
                    either offensive and defensive aids for battle with each other, or which assist
                    in gaining the admiration of the females; and these may coexist or coincide in
                    very various degrees. Thus scent-glands are of common occurrence from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Insectivora</hi> (perhaps even from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithorhynchus)</hi> upwards. Greater beauty of markings or more vivid colours
                    are acquired,— in many <hi rend="italic">Anthropidae</hi> (baboons, &amp;c.) the
                    latter being of peculiarly crude magnificence. Abundant local growths of hair
                    often appear, most notably in the lion and in many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthropidae.</hi> The development of tusks and horns is also too familiar to
                    need more than passing mention.</p>
                <p>But it is unquestionable that in this as in not a few other respects the birds,
                    rather than the mammals, have reached the highest stages of evolution. For here
                    sexual characters no longer seem merely superadded or supplementary to the
                    apparatus of individual life, but habits and organization alike become
                    thoroughly adapted to these—the sex-differences and the reproductive functions
                    as it were saturating the whole life, and producing so many and marvellous
                    results, in habits and character, in beauty and song, that it is not to be
                    wondered at that the descriptive labours of the professed ornithologist have
                    constantly risen into those of the artist and even the poet. See <hi

                <p>Although our theories of sex may be still vague enough, the greatest step to the
                    solution has been made in the general abandonment by scientific men of the
                    doubtless still popular explanation—in terms of a “natural tendency” for the
                    production of an excess of males or the like. It is now held that “quality and
                    quantity of food, elevation of abode, conditions of temperature, relative age of
                    parents, their mode of life, habits, rank, &amp;c,, are all factors which have
                    to be considered.” The idea that the problem of the nature of sex is capable of
                    being approached by empirical observation of the numbers of different sexes
                    produced under known sets of conditions, and the obvious practical corollary of
                    this, viz., that the proportion of the sexes must therefore be capable of being
                    experimentally modified and regulated, are conceptions which have steadily been
                    acquiring prominence, especially of late. In short, if we can find how sex is
                    determined, we shall have gone far to investigate sex itself.</p>
                <p>One of the most crude attempts has been that of Canestrini, who ascribes the
                    determination of sex to the number of sperms entering the ovum, but this view
                    has been already demolished by Fol and Pflüger. The time of fertilization has
                    also and apparently with greater weight been insisted upon; thus Thury, followed
                    by Düsing, holds that the sex of the offspring depends on the period of
                    fertilization: an ovum fertilized soon after liberation produces a female, while
                    the fertilization of an older ovum produces a male. This view has been carried a
                    step farther by Hensen, who suggests that the same should probably hold true of
                    the spermatozoa, and thus the fertilization of a young ovum by a fresh sperm
                    would have a double likelihood of resulting in a female. There are some
                    observations which support this: thus Thury and other cattle-breeders have
                    claimed to determine the sex of cattle on this principle, and Girou long ago
                    alleged that female flowers, fertilized as soon as they are able to receive
                    pollen, produced a distinct excess of female offspring.</p>
                <p>Great weight has also been laid on the relative age of the parents. Thus
                    Hofacker, so long ago as 1828, and Sadler a couple of years later, independently
                    published a body of statistics (each of about 2000 births) in favour of the
                    generalization (since known as Hofacker’s and Sadler’s law) that when the male
                    parent is the elder the offspring are preponderatingly male: while, if the
                    parents be of the same age, or <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> if the male
                    parent be younger,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n747/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0747-0722"/> female offspring appear in increasing majority.
                    This view has been confirmed by Goehlert, Boulanger, Legoyt, and others; some
                    breeders of horses, cattle, and pigeons have also accepted it Other breeders,
                    however, deny it altogether; moreover, the recent statistics of Stieda and of
                    Berner (taken independently from Alsace-Lorraine and Scandinavia) seem to stand
                    in irreconcilable contradiction. At any rate at present we do not seem justified
                    in ascribing greater importance to the relative age of parents than as a
                    secondary factor, which may probably take its place among those causes
                    influencing nourishment discussed below,</p>
                <p>That good nourishment appears to produce a distinct preponderance of females is
                    perhaps the single result which can at present be regarded as clearly proven and
                    generally accepted. Yet it would be too much to say that unanimity is even here
                    complete; thus, among plants, the experiments of Girou (1823), Haberlandt
                    (1869), and others gave no certain result; those of Heyer (1883) have led him to
                    dispute the validity of the generalization altogether, while Haberlandt (1877)
                    brought evidence for regarding the excess of females as largely due to the
                    greater mortality of the males. The investigations of agricultural observers,
                    especially Meehan (1878), which are essentially corroborated by Düsing (1883),
                    however, leave little doubt that abundant moisture and nourishment tend to
                    produce females. Some of Meehan’s points are extremely instructive. Thus old
                    branches of Conifers overgrown and shaded by younger ones produce only male
                    inflorescences, a fact which may be taken in connexion with Sadebeck’s
                    observation that some fern prothallia, under unfavourable conditions, can still
                    form antheridia but not archegonia. The formation of female flowers on male
                    heads of maize is ascribed by Knop to better nutrition consequent on abundant
                    moisture. The only seriously contradictory observations are thus those of Heyer,
                    and it is therefore reassuring when a detailed scrutiny of his paper shows his
                    ill-conducted experiments (which land him in the conclusion that the organism is
                    not modifiable by its environment at all) to be largely capable of a reversed
                    interpretation. The agency of temperature is also of considerable importance.
                    Thus Meehan finds that the male plants of hazel grow more actively in heat than
                    the female, and Ascherson states that <hi rend="italic">Stratiotes aloides</hi>
                    bears only female flowers north of 52° lat., and from 50° southwards only male
                    ones. Other instances might be given.</p>
                <p>Passing to the animal kingdom we find the case of insects peculiarly clear; thus
                    Mrs Treat showed that if caterpillars were starved before entering the chrysalis
                    state the resultant butterflies or moths were males, while others of the same
                    brood highly nourished came out females. Gentry too has shown for moths that
                    innutritious or diseased food produced males; hence perhaps a partial
                    explanation of the excess of male insects in autumn, although temperature is
                    probably more important. The recent experiments of Yung on tadpoles are also
                    very conclusive. Thus he raised the percentage of females in one brood from 56
                    in those unfed to 78 in those fed with beef, and in another supply from 61 to 81
                    per cent. by feeding with fish; while, when the especially nutritious flesh of
                    frogs was supplied, the percentage rose from 54 to 92. Among mammals the
                    difficulties of proof are greater, but evidence is by no means wanting. Thus an
                    important experiment was long ago made by Girou, who divided a flock of 300 ewes
                    into equal parts, of which the one half were extremely well fed and served by
                    two young rams, while the other was served by two mature rams and poorly fed.
                    The proportion of ewe lambs in the two cases was respectively 60 and 40 per
                    cent. Düsing also states that it is usually the heavier ewes which bring forth
                    ewe lambs.</p>
                <p>Nor does sex in the human species appear to be independent of differences of
                    nutrition. After a cholera epidemic or a war more boys are said to be born, and
                    Düsing also points out that in females with small placenta and little
                    menstruation more boys are found, and even affirms that the number of male
                    children varies with the rise in prices. In towns and in prosperous families
                    there are also more females, while males are more numerous in the country and
                    among the poor. The influence of temperature is also marked: more males are born
                    during the colder months, a fact noted also by Schlechter for horses.</p>
                <p>The best known and probably still most influential theory is that systematized by
                    Girou and known as that of “comparative vigour.” This makes sex of offspring
                    depend on that of the more vigorous parent. But to this view there are serious
                    difficulties: thus consumptive mothers produce a great excess of daughters, not
                    sons as might be expected from the superior health of the father. Still less
                    weight can be attached to that form of the hypothesis which would make sex
                    follow “genital superiority” or “relative ardency” alone. Any new theory has
                    thus to reconcile the arguments in favour of each of the preceding views, and
                    meet the difficulties which beset all. As Starkweather puts it, it must at once
                    account for such facts as “the preponderance of male births in Europe, of
                    females among mulattos and other hybrid races, as also among polygamous animals,
                    and for the equality among other animals. More especially it must suggest some
                    principle of self-adjustment by which not only is the balance of the sexes
                    nearly preserved on the whole, but by which also in cases of special disturbance
                    the balance tends to readjust itself.” Starkweather proceeds to attempt this,
                    and his argument may be briefly summarized. While few maintain any essential
                    equality of the sexes, and still fewer any superiority of the female, the weight
                    of authority has been from the earliest times in favour of the doctrine of male
                    superiority. From the earliest ages philosophers have contended that woman is
                    but an undeveloped man; Darwin’s theory of sexual selection presupposes a
                    superiority in the male line and entailed on that sex; for Spencer the
                    development of woman is early arrested by procreative functions: in short,
                    Darwin’s man is as it were an evolved woman, and Spencer’s woman an arrested
                    man. On such grounds we have a number of theories of sex. Hough thinks males are
                    born when the system is at its best, more females when occupied in growth,
                    reparation, or disease. So, too, Tiedman and others regard every embryo as
                    originally female and remaining female if errested, while Velpau conversely
                    regards embryos as all naturally male, but frequently degenerating to the female
                    state. Starkweather points out some of the difficulties to the view of female
                    inferiority, and lays it down as the foundation of his work that “neither sex is
                    physically the superior, but both are essentially equal in a physiological
                    sense.” But, while this is true of the average, there are many grades of
                    individual differences and deficiencies in detail, involving a greater or less
                    degree of superiority in one or other of every pair. Starkweather’s theory then
                    is “that sex is determined by the superior parent, also that the superior parent
                    produces the opposite sex.” The arguments adduced in favour of this view,
                    however, are scarcely worthy of it, since, save a chapter of
                    pseudo-physiological discussion of vital forces and polarities, of
                    superiority,—nervous, electrical, &amp;c.,— they rest mainly on the vague and
                    shifting grounds of physiognomy and temperament. And when superiority is
                    analysed into its factors,—cerebral development and activity, temperament, state
                    of health, of nutrition, &amp;c.,—soon we find under the appearance of
                    simplicity a law has been obtained not by discovering any real unity under the
                    many<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n748/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0748-0723"/> apparently different factors, but by simply
                    lumping them under a common name. Nor is a rationale given of the affirmed
                    reversal of sex, which Schlechter and other authorities moreover wholly deny.
                    Despite these and other faults and failures the work is interesting and often
                    suggestive, and that not only on account of its theoretic position but its
                    sanguine proposals for the practical control of sex.</p>
                <p>The work of Düsing (1883), while less speculative, is of great importance in
                    respect to the causes which regulate the proportions of the sexes; since,
                    instead of falling back with Darwin on the unexplained operation of natural
                    selection, he seeks to note the circumstances in which a majority of one sex is
                    profitable, and to show that organisms have really the power to produce in such
                    circumstances a majority of one sex,—in short, that disturbances in the
                    proportion of the sexes bring about their own compensation, and further supports
                    these views by calculation and statistical evidence.</p>
                <p>He separates the causes determining sex into those affecting (<hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>) one parent and (δ) both alike. Starting with a minority of one sex, he
                    emphasizes the importance of delayed fertilization, accepting it as a fact that
                    females late fertilized bear most males (this corresponding in man to a scarcity
                    of males among the lower animals). He notes that the firstborn child is most
                    frequently a male, especially among older persons, and thus explains how after a
                    war, when there is a want of males, most male children are born. He ascribes
                    importance to the amount of sexual intercourse. Thus, suppose a minority of
                    females: their fertilization tends to occur more frequently, and thus (if the
                    general statement be correct) they should produce a majority of their own sex;
                    or similarly with males. This is supported by reference to cattle-breeding, and
                    it is interpreted physiologically to involve that young spermatozoa produce a
                    majority of males. Suppose a great majority of males: the chances of early
                    fertilization of the females are of course great, but eggs fertilized early tend
                    to produce females. Or suppose conversely a great minority of males: the chances
                    of early fertilization are small, but old eggs tend to produce males, and either
                    excess will thus become compensated. Or again, the more decided the minority of
                    one sex the more frequent the sexual activity of its individuals, the younger
                    their sexual elements, and consequently the more individuals of that sex are
                    produced. Düsing next takes up as indirect causes equivalent to a minority of
                    individuals—(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) deficient nutrition; just as frequent
                    copulation overstrains the genital organs the same result may arise from the
                    deficient nutrition of the system; hence an ill-fed cow yields a female to a
                    well-fed bull and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>; (b) relative age; the
                    nearer either parent is to the period of greatest reproductive capacity the
                    less, he thinks, is a birth of that sex probable.</p>
                <p>As factors affecting both parents he first discusses variations in nutrition;
                    although means of subsistence may decrease, there is at first no decrease in the
                    number of progeny. But it is necessary to distinguish the reproduction of the
                    species from its multiplication, so that in defective nutrition, though an
                    animal may not reproduce less, it will permanently multiply much less. He agrees
                    with Darwin that the reproductive system is most sensitive to changes of
                    nutrition; gives cases showing the effect of abundant nutrition on reproductive
                    activity, notes the influence of climate, function, &amp;c., and contrasts
                    organisms of high activity, like birds and insects, with parasites. The
                    nutritive relations of the sexes are also contrasted; since females have to give
                    to the embryo more than the male, they are much more dependent on food for
                    vigour of their reproductive capacity, and hence the frequent contrast of their
                    size, &amp;c. Furthermore, animals suit their multiplication to their conditions
                    of nutrition; if food be abundant there is an increase in the number of females,
                    and therefore a further increase in number of individuals of the species; if
                    food, however, be too scarce the more males are produced and the number of the
                    species tends to diminish. Hence the connexion above mentioned between increase
                    of children (especially females) in prosperity and after a good harvest, and the
                    rising proportion of boys during a rise of prices. Similarly for animals: the
                    more food the more females, and the more rapidly the species increases; the less
                    food the more males, and the less rapid the increase. Again, plants on good soil
                    produce more female flowers and more seed with profit to the species; on bad
                    soil male flowers preponderate, mostly perish, and the species tends to
                    disappear. The extreme case of optimum nutrition tends to produce normal
                    parthenogenesis (“thelytokie ”), yielding only females, different in cause and
                    operation from the parthenogenesis resulting from the absence of males
                    (“arrenotokie”).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    Reproduction and Sex.—</hi> If we now at tempt to reach a rational standpoint
                    from which to criticize and compare the innumerable empirical conceptions of
                    sex,— much more if we seek a firm basis for the construction of a really
                    comprehensive theory,—it is evident that such a theory must be addressed not
                    merely to the specialist concerned with problems of reproduction and
                    development, but, while embracing details and anomalies, must be satisfactory
                    alike to the general morphologist and physiologist. We must therefore have
                    before us that conception of the main lines of thought on each of these subjects
                    which has, been outlined under the headings <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Morphology.</hi></p>
                <p>The close coincidence between these two independent developments is especially to
                    be noted. From the vague account of general form and appearance, of habits and
                    temperaments, which made up the descriptive natural history of the past, the two
                    streams of progress, though distinct, are wholly parallel. Thus Buffon furnished
                    a brilliant and synthetic exposition of the oldest view, while one side of their
                    general aspect received new precision at the hands of Linnaeus,—to some extent
                    the other also at the hands of his physiological contemporaries. The anatomical
                    advance of Cuvier is parallel to the detailed study of the functions of the
                    organs, while the great step made by Bichat lay in piercing below the conception
                    of the organ and its function as ultimate, and in seeking to interpret both by
                    reference to the component tissues. The celltheory of Schwann and his successors
                    analysed these tissues a step farther, while the latest and deepest analysis
                    refers all structure ultimately to the substance called protoplasm, and
                    similarly claims to express all function in terms of the construction and
                    destruction, synthesis and analysis, anabolism and katabolism of this. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Physiology, Protoplasm, Morphology.</hi></p>
                <p>Now, since every morphological and physiological fact or theory is in one or
                    other of these few categories, it is evident that we have here the required
                    criterion of theories of reproduction and sex. The question, What is sex? what
                    is meant by male or female? admits of a regular series of answers. The first and
                    earliest is in terms of general aspect, temperament, and habit, and, though
                    crude, empirical, and superficial, it lacks neither unity nor usefulness. At
                    this plane are not only most popular conceptions but many theories like that of
                    Starkweather, which may be mentioned as the most recent. The anatomist contents
                    himself with the recognition of specific organs of sex, or at most with a
                    similarly empirical account of their functions; while the embryologist and
                    histologist will not rest contented without seeking to refer these organs to the
                    tissues of which they are composed and the layer from which they spring, and
                    even reaches and describes the ultimate cellular elements essential to sex,—the
                    ovum and spermatozoon. A parallel physiological interpretation of these is next
                    required, and at this point appear such hypotheses as these of Weismann and
                    others.</p>
                <p>Thus the bewildering superabundance of widely different theories at the present
                    juncture becomes intelligible enough; and, each once classified according to its
                    stage of progress, a detailed criticism would be easy. But this is not enough:
                    the demand for an explanation at once rational and ultimate, to comprehend and
                    underlie all the preceding ones, is only the more urgent. Where shall we seek
                    for it? On the one hand the morphological aspect of such an explanation must
                    interpret the forms of sex cells in terms of those of cells in general, and in
                    terms of the structural properties of protoplasm itself; while its more
                    difficult yet more satisfying physiological aspect must express the mysterious
                    difference of male and female in terms of the life processes of that
                    protoplasm,—in terms,<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0749-0724"/> that is to say, of anabolism and katabolism. Were
                    these steps made a new synthesis would be reached, and from this point it should
                    even next be possible to retrace the progress of the science, and interpret the
                    forms and the functions of tissues and organs, nay, even of the facts of aspect,
                    habit, and temperament, so furnishing the deductive rationale of each hitherto
                    merely empirical order of observed fact and connecting theory.</p>
                <p>While this conception does not admit of development within the present
                    limits,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See paper by
                    Geddes already mentioned at p. 721, footnote.</p></note> a brief abstract of
                    such an interpretation of reproduction and of sex in terms of anabolism and
                    katabolism may be of interest to the reader. The theory of reproduction, in
                    general principle at least, is simple enough. A continued surplus of anabolism
                    involves growth, and the setting in of reproduction when growth stops implies a
                    relative katabolism. This in short is merely a more precise restatement of the
                    familiar antithesis between nutrition and reproduction. At first this
                    disintegration and reintegration entirely exhaust the organism and conclude its
                    individual existence, but as we ascend the process becomes a more and more
                    localized one. The origin of this localization of the reproductive function may
                    best be understood if we figure to ourselves a fragment of the genealogical tree
                    of the evolutionist in greater detail, and bear in mind that this is made up of
                    a continuous alternate series of sex-cell and organism, the organism, too,
                    becoming less and less distinguished from its parent cell until the two
                    practically coincide in the <hi rend="italic">Protozoa,</hi> which should be
                    defined not so much as “organisms devoid of sexual reproduction” but rather as
                    undifferentiated reproductive cells (protosperms or protova, as they might in
                    fact be called), which have not built up round themselves a body. We should
                    note, too, how the continuous immortal stream of Protozoan life (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Protozoa)</hi> is continued by that of ordinary reproductive
                    cells among the higher animals, for the mortality of these does not affect this
                    continuity any more than the fall of leaves does the continued life of the tree.
                    The interpretation of sex is thus less difficult than might at first sight
                    appear. For anabolism and katabolism cannot and do not absolutely balance, as
                    all the facts of rest and motion, nutrition and reproduction, variation and
                    disease, in short of life and death, clearly show. During life neither process
                    can completely stop, but their algebraic sum keeps varying within the widest
                    limits. Let us note the result, starting from the undifferentiated amoeboid
                    cell. A surplus of anabolism over katabolism involves not only a growth in size
                    but a reduction in kinetic and a gain in potential energy, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> a diminution of movement. Irregularities thus tend to disappear;
                    surface tension too may aid; and the cell acquires a spheroidal form. The large
                    and quiescent ovum is thus intelligible enough. Again starting from the amoeboid
                    cell, if katabolism be in increasing preponderance the increasing liberation of
                    kinetic energy thus implied must find its outward expression in increased
                    activity of movement and in diminished size; the more active cell becomes
                    modified in form by passage through its fluid environment, and the flagellate
                    form of the spermatozoon is thus natural enough. It is noteworthy, too, that
                    these physiologically normal results of the rhythm of cellular life, the
                    resting, amoeboid, and ciliate forms, are precisely those which we empirically
                    reach on morphological grounds alone (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Morphology,</hi>
                    vol. xvi. p. 841).</p>
                <p>Given, then, the conception of the cellular life rhythm as capable of thus
                    passing into a distinctly anabolic or katabolic habit or diathesis, the
                    explanation of the phenomena of reproduction becomes only a special field within
                    a more general view of structure and function, nay even of variation, normal and
                    pathological. Thus the generality, use, and nature of the process of
                    fertilization become readily intelligible. The profound chemical difference
                    surmised by so many authors becomes intelligible as the outcome of anabolism and
                    katabolism respectively, and the union of their products as restoring the normal
                    balance and rhythm of the renewed cellular life. Without discussing the details
                    of this, farther than to note how it resumes the speculations of Rolph and
                    others as to the origin of fertilization from mutual digestion, of the
                    reproductive from the nutritive function, we may note how they illustrate on
                    this view that origin of fertilization from conjugation which is the central
                    problem of the ontogeny and phylogeny of sex. The formation of polar vesicles
                    seems thus an extrusion of katabolic (or male) elements, and conversely its
                    analogues in spermatogenesis (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Reproduction).</hi>
                    Passing over such tempting applications as that to the explanation of
                    segmentation and even subsequent developmental changes, it must suffice to note
                    that the constant insistance of embryologists upon the physiological importance
                    of the embryonic layers bears essentially upon their respective predominance of
                    anabolism and katabolism. The passage from ordinary growth to that discontinuous
                    growth which we term asexual reproduction, and from this again to sexuality or
                    the frequent reverse progress, is capable of rational interpretation in like
                    manner: the “alternation of gene rations” is but a rhythm between a relatively
                    anabolic and katabolic preponderance; a parthenogenetic ovum is an incompletely
                    differentiated ovum which retains a measure of katabolic (male) products, and
                    thus does not need fertilization; while hermaphroditism is due to the local
                    preponderances of anabolism or katabolism in one set of reproductive cells or in
                    one period of their life. The reversion of unisexual forms to hermaphrodite
                    ones, or of these to asexual ones, which we have seen in such constant
                    association with high nutrition and low expenditure,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus Marshall Ward has lately drawn attention
                    to the association of parasitism with the disappearance of sexual reproduction
                    in <hi rend="italic">Fungi (Quart. Jour. Micr. Sci.,</hi> xxiv.).</p></note> is
                    no longer inexplicable. The female sex being thus preponderatingly anabolic, the
                    importance of good nutrition in determining it is explained: menstruation is
                    seen to be the means of getting rid of the anabolic surplus in absence of its
                    foetal consumption, while the higher temperature and greater activities of the
                    male sex express its katabolic diathesis. The phenomena of sex, then, are no
                    isolated ones, but express the highest outcome of the whole activities of the
                    organism—the literal blossoming of the individual life. (P. GE.)</p>
