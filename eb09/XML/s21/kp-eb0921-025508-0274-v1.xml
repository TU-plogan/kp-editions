                    Zanzibar, and into Germany from Venezuela, but of the botanical source of these
                    varieties little is at present known. The use of sandalwood dates as far back at
                    least as the 5th century B.c., for the wood is mentioned under its Sanskrit name
                    “chandana” in the <hi rend="italic">Nirukta,</hi> the earliest extant Vedic
                    commentary. It is still extensively used in India and China, wherever Buddhism

                    ceremonies; comparatively poor people often spend as much as 50 rupees on
                    sandalwood for a single cremation. Until the middle of the 18th century India
                    was the only source of sandalwood. The discovery of a sandalwood in the islands
                    of the Pacific led to a considerable trade of a somewhat piratical nature,
                    resulting in difficulties with the natives, often ending in bloodshed, the
                    celebrated missionary John Williams, amongst others, having fallen a victim to
                    an indiscriminate retaliation by the natives on white men visiting the islands.
                    The loss of life in this trade was at one time even greater than in that of
                    whaling, with which it ranked as one of the most adventurous of callings. About
                    the year 1810 as much as 400,000 dollars is said to have been received annually
                    for sandalwood by Kamehameha, king of Hawaii. The trees consequently have become
                    almost extinct in all the well-known islands, except New Caledonia, where the
                    wood is now cultivated. Sandalwood of inferior quality derived from <hi
                        rend="italic">Fusanus acuminatus</hi> was exported from south-west Australia
                    in 1884 to the extent of 2620 tons, valued at an average of about £8 per ton,
                    genuine sandalwood being worth in China from £12 to £40 per ton.</p>
                <p>In India sandalwood is largely used in the manufacture of boxes, fans, and other
                    ornamental articles of inlaid work, and to a limited extent in medicine as a
                    domestic remedy for all kinds of pains and aches. The oil is largely used as a
                    perfume, few native Indian attars or essential oils being free from admixture
                    with it. In the form of powder or paste the wood is employed in the pigments
                    used by the Brahmans for their distinguishing caste-marks.</p>
                <p>During the last few years oil of sandalwood has largely replaced copaiba, both in
                    the United Kingdom and on the Continent, in the treatment of various diseases of
                    the mucous membrane. Three varieties are distinguished in trade—East-Indian,
                    Macassar, and West-Indian. The first-named is derived from <hi rend="italic">S.
                        album,</hi> the second probably from another species of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Santalum,</hi> and the third from a wood imported from Puerto Cabello in
                    Venezuela. <hi rend="italic">Bucida capitata,</hi> a Combretaceous plant, is
                    known in the West Indies as sandalwood; but the odour of the wood as well as of
                    the oil, which is quite distinct from that of the true sandalwood, has more
                    resemblance to that of a <hi rend="italic">Myroxylon.</hi> Inferior qualities of
                    the oil are said to be adulterated in Germany with the oil of red cedar wood <hi
                        rend="italic">(Juniperus virginiana).</hi></p>
                <p>In India sandalwood is produced in the dry tracts of country in Mysore and
                    Coimbatore, north and north-west of the Nilgiri Hills, also farther eastward in
                    the districts of Salem and North Arcot, where the tree grows from the sea-level
                    up to an elevation of 3000 feet. In the first-named district the wood is a
                    Government monopoly and can only be felled by the proper officers, this
                    privilege having been retained since 1770, when it was conferred by treaty with
                    Hyder Ali on the East India Company. The Mysore sandalwood is shipped from
                    Mangalore to the extent of about 700 tons annually, valued at £27,000. In the
                    Madras Presidency—although there is now no monopoly—sandalwood, by the careful
                    management of the forest department, has been made to yield an increasing
                    revenue to the Government, as much as 547½ tons having been furnished by the
                    reserved forests in 1872-3. The tree is propagated by seeds, which, however,
                    must be placed where they are intended to grow, since the seedlings will not
                    bear transplantation, probably on account of deriving their nourishment
                    parasitically by means of tuberous swellings attached to the roots of other
                    plants. The trees are cut down when between eighteen and twenty-five years old,
                    at which period they have attained their maturity, the trunks being then about
                    one foot in diameter. The felling takes place at the end of the year, and the
                    trunk is allowed to remain on the ground for several months, during which time
                    the white ants eat away the valueless sapwood but leave the fragrant heartwood
                    untouched. The heartwood is then sawn into billets about 2 or 2½ feet long.
                    These are afterwards more carefully trimmed at the forest depôts, and left to
                    dry slowly in a close warehouse for some weeks, by which the odour is improved
                    and the tendency of the wood to split obviated. An annual auction of the wood
                    takes place, at which merchants from all parts of India congregate. The largest
                    pieces are chiefly exported to China, the small pieces to Arabia; and those of
                    medium size are retained for use in India. China imported into the treaty ports
                    66,237 piculs (of 133 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        3</hi> lb) of sandalwood in 1872. As much as 700 tons are annually imported
                    into Bombay from the Malabar coast, of which about 450 tons are again exported.
                    The oil, which is distilled chiefly at Mangalore from the roots and chips, is
                    also imported into Bombay to the extent of 12,000 lb annually.</p>

                    and the Philippine Islands. The wood is obtained principally from Madras, in
                    certain parts of which province it is regularly cultivated, coming into the
                    market in the form of irregular billets of heartwood, 3 or 4 feet in length. A
                    fresh surface of the wood has a rich deep red colour, which on exposure,
                    however, assumes a dark brownish tint. Under the influence of alkaline
                    solutions, alcohol, or strong acetic acid, red sandalwood yields up to 16 per
                    cent. of a resinoid body, santalin or santalic acid C <hi rend="subscript">

                    insoluble in cold water; it neutralizes alkalies, and with them forms
                    uncrystallizable salts. In its pure condition santalin forms minute prismatic
                    crystals of a beautiful ruby colour. The wood also contains small proportions of
                    colourless crystalline principles—santal, C <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> H <hi

                    reputation in medicine, and it was valued as a colouring ingredient in many
                    dishes. Now it is a little used as a colouring agent in pharmacy, its principal
                    application being in wool-dyeing and calico-printing. Several other species of
