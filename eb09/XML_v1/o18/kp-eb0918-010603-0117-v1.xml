                <p><label type="entry">OYSTER</label>. The use of this name in the vernacular is
                    equivalent to that of <hi rend="italic">Ostrea</hi> in zoological nomenclature;
                    there are no genera so similar to <hi rend="italic">Ostrea</hi> as to be
                    confounded with it in ordinary language. <hi rend="italic">Ostrea</hi> is a
                    genus of Lamellibranch Molluscs, belonging to the third order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monomya,</hi> the valves of its shell being closed by a single large adductor
                    muscle. The degeneration produced by sedentary habits in all lamellibranchs has
                    in the oyster reached its most advanced stage. The muscular projection of the
                    ventral surface called the foot, whose various modifications characterize the
                    different classes of <hi rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> is almost entirely
                    aborted. The two valves of the shell are unequal in size, and of different
                    shape; the left valve is larger, thicker, and more convex, and on it the animal
                    rests in its natural state. This valve, in the young oyster, is attached to some
                    object on the sea-bottom; in the adult it is sometimes attached, sometimes free.
                    The right valve is flat, and smaller and thinner than the left. In a
                    corresponding manner the right side of the animal’s body is somewhat less
                    developed than the left, and to this exteflt there is a departure from the
                    bilateral symmetry characteristic of lamellibranchs.</p>
                <p>The organization of the oyster, as compared with that of a typical lamellibranch
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Anodon</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca),</hi>
                    is brought about by the reduction of the anterior part of the body accompanying
                    the loss of the anterior adductor, and the enlargement of the posterior region.
                    The pedal ganglia and auditory organs have disappeared with the foot, at all
                    events have never been detected; the labial ganglia are very minute, while the
                    parieto-splanchnic are well developed, and constitute the principal part of the
                    nervous system.</p>
                <p>According to Spengel the pair of ganglia near the mouth, variously called labial
                    or cerebral, represent the cerebral pair and pleural pair of a gastropod
                    combined, and the parieto-splanchnic pair correspond to the visceral ganglia,
                    the commissure which connects them with the cerebro-pleural representing the
                    visceral commissure. Each of the visceral ganglia is connected or combined with
                    an olfactory ganglion underlying an area of specialized epithelium, which
                    constitutes the olfactory organ, the osphradium. This view (which, it may be
                    pointed out, differs from that given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca)</hi>
                    alone admits of a satisfactory comparison between the lamellibranch and the
                    gastropod; if the parieto-splanchnic were merely an olfactory ganglion its
                    connexion by a commissure with its fellow would be an abnormality, and the
                    olfactory ganglion in the lamellibranch would innervate the gills, adductor
                    muscle, mantle, and rectum, parts which in gastropods are innervated from the
                    visceral ganglia. The heart and pericardial chamber in the oyster lie along the
                    anterior face of the adductor muscle, almost perpendicular to the direction of
                    the gills, with which in <hi rend="italic">Anodon</hi> they are parallel. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Anodon</hi> and the majority of lamellibranchs the ventricle
                    surrounds the intestine; in the oyster the two are quite independent, the
                    intestine passing above the pericardium. The renal organs of the oyster were
                    discovered by Hoek to agree in their morphological relations with those of other
                    lamellibranchs.</p>

                <p>The generative organs of the oyster consist of a system of branching cavities on
                    each side of the body lying immediately beneath the surface. All the cavities of
                    a side are ultimately in communication with an efferent duct opening on the
                    surface of the body a little above the line of attachment of the gills. The
                    genital opening on each side is situated in a depression of the surface into
                    which the renal organ also opens. The genital products are derived from the
                    cells which line the cavities of the genital organs. The researches of Hoek have
                    shown that in the same oyster the genital organs at one time produce ova, at
                    another spermatozoa, and that consequently the oyster does not fertilize itself.
                    How many times the alternation of sex may take place in a season is not known.
                    It must be borne in mind that in what follows the species of the European
                    coasts, <hi rend="italic">Ostrea edulis,</hi> is under consideration. The ova
                    are fertilized in the genital duct, and before their escape have undergone the
                    earliest stages of segmentation. After escaping from the genital aperture they
                    find their way into the infra-branchial part of the mantle cavity of the parent,
                    probably by passing through the supra-branchial chamber to the posterior
                    extremity of the gills, and then being conducted by the inhalent current caused
                    by the cilia of the gills into the infra-branchial chamber. In the latter they
                    accumulate, being held together and fastened to the gills by a white viscid
                    secretion. The mass of ova thus contained in the oyster is spoken of by oyster
                    fishers as “white spat,” and an oyster containing them is said to be “sick.”
                    While in this position the ova go through the series of changes figured in vol.
                    xvi. p. 638 (fig. 6). At the end of a fortnight the white spat has become
                    darkcoloured from the appearance of coloured patches in the developing embryos.
                    The embryos having then reached the condition of “trochospheres” escape from the
                    mantle cavity and swim about freely near the surface of the water among the
                    multitude of other creatures, larval and adult, which swarm there. The larvae
                    are extremely minute, about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript">
                    π</hi> inch long and of glassy transparency, except in one or two spots which
                    are dark brown. From the trochosphere stage the free larvae pass into that of
                    “veligers.” How long they remain free is not known; Prof. Huxley kept them in a
                    glass vessel in this condition for a week. Ultimately they sink to the bottom
                    and fix themselves to shells, stones, or other objects, and rapidly take on the
                    appearance of minute oysters, forming white disks <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> inch in
                    diameter. Thè appearance of these minute oysters constitutes what the fishermen
                    call a “fall of spat.” The experiment by which Hoek conclusively proved the
                    change of sex in the oyster was as follows. In an oyster containing white spat
                    microscopic examination of the genital organs shows nothing but a few unexpelled
                    ova. An oyster in this condition was kept in an aquarium by itself for a
                    fortnight, and after that period its genital organs were found to contain
                    multitudes of spermatozoa in all stages of development.</p>
                <p>The breeding season of the European oyster lasts from May to September. The rate
                    of growth of the young oyster is, roughly speaking, an inch of diameter in a
                    year, but after it has attained a breadth of 3 inches its growth is much slower.
                    Prof. Möbius is of opinion that oysters over twenty years of age are rare, and
                    that most of the adult Schleswig oysters are seven to ten years old.</p>
                <p>The development of the American oyster, <hi rend="italic">0. virginiana,</hi> and
                    of the Portuguese oyster, <hi rend="italic">0.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >angulata,</hi> is very similar to that of <hi rend="italic">0.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">edulis,</hi> except that there is no period of incubation within
                    the mantle cavity of the parent in the case of these two species. Hence it is
                    that so-called artificial fertilization is possible; that is to say, the
                    fertilization may be allowed to take place in a tank or aquarium in which the
                    conditions are under control. But if it is possible to procure a supply of spat
                    from the American oyster by keeping the swarms of larvae in confinement, it
                    ought to be possible in the case of the European oyster. All that would be
                    necessary would be to take a number of mature oysters containing white spat and
                    lay them down in tanks till the larvae escape. This would be merely carrying
                    oyster culture a step further back, and instead of collecting the newly fixed
                    oysters, to obtain the free larvae in numbers and so insure a fall of spat
                    independently of the uncertainty of natural conditions.</p>
                <p>Natural beds of oyster occur on stony and shelly bottoms at depths varying from 3
                    to 20 fathoms. In nature the beds are liable to variations, and, although Prof.
                    Huxley is somewhat sceptical on this point, it seems that they are easily
                    brought into an unproductive condition by over-dredging. Oysters do not flourish
                    in water containing less than 3 per cent, salt; and hence they are absent from
                    the Baltic. The chief enemies of oysters are the dog-whelk, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Purpura</hi><hi rend="italic">lapillus,</hi> and the whelk-tingle, <hi
                    rend="italic">Murex erinaceus,</hi> which bore through the shells. Starfishes
                    swallow oysters whole. <hi rend="italic">Cliona,</hi> the boring sponge,
                    destroys the shells and so injures the oyster; the boring annelid <hi
                    rend="italic">Leucodore</hi> also excavates the shell.</p>
                <p>The wandering life of the larvae makes it uncertain whether any of the progeny of
                    a given oyster-bed will settle within its area and so keep up its numbers. It is
                    known from the history of the Liimfjord beds that the larvae may settle 5 miles
                    from their place of birth.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Ostrea</hi> has a world-wide distribution, in
                    tropical and temperate seas; seventy species have been distinguished. Its

                    France. Great Britain has still a few natural beds remaining, and a number of

                <p>The oyster industry is rapidly passing from the hands of the fisherman into those
                    of the oyster culturist. The oyster being sedentary, except for a few days in
                    the earliest stages of its existence, is easily exterminated in any given
                    locality; since, although it may not be possible for the fishermen to rake up
                    from the bottom every individual, wholesale methods of capture soon result in
                    covering up or otherwise destroying the oyster banks or reefs, as the
                    communities of oysters are technically termed. The main difference between the
                    oyster industry of America and that of Europe lies in the fact that in Europe
                    the native beds have long since been practically destroyed, perhaps not more
                    than 6 or 7 per cent, of the oysters of Europe passing from the native beds
                    directly into the hands of the consumer. It is probable that 60 to 75 per cent,
                    are reared from the spat in artificial parks, the remainder having been laid
                    down for a time to increase in size and flavour in shoal waters along the
                    coasts. In the United States, on the other hand, from 30 to 40 per cent, are
                    carried from the native beds directly to market. The oyster fishery is
                    everywhere, except in localities where the natural beds are nearly exhausted,
                    carried on in the most reckless manner, and in all directions oyster grounds are
                    becoming deteriorated, and in some cases have been entirely destroyed. It
                    remains to be seen whether the Government of the States will regulate the oyster
                    fishery before it is too late, or will permit the destruction of these most
                    important reservoirs of food. At present the oyster is one of the cheapest
                    articles of diet in the United States; and, though it can hardly be expected
                    that the price of American oysters will always remain so low, still, taking into
                    consideration the great wealth of the natural beds along the entire Atlantic
                    coast, it seems certain that a moderate amount of protection will keep the price
                    of seed oysters far below European rates, and that the immense stretches of
                    submerged land especially suited for oyster planting may be utilized and made to
                    produce an abundant harvest at much less cost than that which accompanies the
                    complicated system of culture in vogue in France and Holland.</p>
                <p>The most elaborate system of oyster culture is that practised at Arcachon and
                    elsewhere in France, and, to a limited extent since 1865, on the island of Hay
                    ling, near Portsmouth, in England. The young oysters, having been collected in
                    the breeding season upon tiles or hurdles, are laid down in artificial ponds, or
                    in troughs, where the water is supplied to them at the discretion of their
                    proprietors. The oysters are thus kept under control like garden plants from the
                    time they are laid down to that of delivery to commercial control. The numerous
                    modifications of this system are discussed in various recent reports.<note

                <p>The simplest form of oyster culture is the preservation of the natural
                    oyster-beds. Upon this, in fact, depends the whole future of the industry, since
                    it is not probable that any system of artificial breeding can be devised which
                    will render it possible to keep up a supply without at least occasional recourse
                    to seed oysters produced under natural conditions. It is the opinion of almost
                    all who have studied the subject that any natural bed may in time be destroyed
                    by overfishing (perhaps not by removing all the oysters, but by breaking up the
                    colonies, and delivering over the territory which they once occupied to other
                    kinds of animals), by burying the breeding oysters, by covering <pb break="no"

                    opponents of fishery legislation, while denying that oyster-beds have been
                    permanently annihilated by dredging, practically admits that a bed may be
                    reduced to such a condition that the oyster will only be able to recover its
                    former state by a long struggle with its enemies and competition,—in fact that
                    it must re-establish itself much in the same way as they have acquired
                    possession of new grounds in Jutland, a process which, according to his own
                    statement, occupied thirty years (Lecture at the Royal Institution, May 11,
                    1883, printed with additions in the <hi rend="italic">English Illustrated
                    Magazine,</hi> i. pp. 47-55, 112-21).</p></note> The immense oyster-beds in
                    Pocomoke Sound, Maryland, have practically been destroyed by over-dredging, and
                    many of the other beds of the United States are seriously damaged. The same is
                    doubtless true of all the beds of Europe. It has also been demonstrated that
                    under proper restriction great quantities of mature oysters, and seed oysters as
                    well, may be taken from any region of natural oyster-beds without injurious
                    effects. Parallel cases in agriculture and forestry will occur to every one.
                    Möbius, in his most admirable essay <hi rend="italic">Die Auster</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Die Austemwirthschaft,</hi> has pointed
                    out the proper means of preserving natural beds, declaring that, if the average
                    profit from a bed of oysters is to remain permanently the same, a sufficient
                    number of mother oysters must be left in it, so as not to diminish the capacity
                    of maturing. He further shows that the productive capacity of a bed can only be
                    maintained in one of two ways :—(1) by diminishing the causes which destroy the
                    young oysters, in which case the number of breeding oysters may safely be
                    decreased; this, however, is practicable only under such favourable conditions
                    as occur at Arcachon, where the beds may be kept under the constant control of
                    the oyster-culturist; (2) by regulating the fishing on the natural beds in such
                    a manner as to make them produce permanently the highest possible average
                    quantity of oysters. Since the annual increase of half-grown oysters is
                    estimated by him to be four hundred and twenty-one to every thousand full-grown
                    oysters, he claims that not more than 42 per cent, of these latter ought to be
                    taken from a bed during a year.</p>
                <p>The Schleswig-Holstein oyster-beds are the property of the state, and are leased
                    to a company whose interest it is to preserve their productiveness. The French
                    beds are also kept under Government control. Not so the beds of Great Britain
                    and America, which are as a general rule open to all comers,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Connecticut has within a few
                    years greatly benefited its oyster industry by giving to oyster-culturists a fee
                    simple title to the lands under control by them.</p></note> except when some
                    close-time regulation is in force. Prof. Huxley has illustrated the futility of
                    “close-time” in his remark that the prohibition of taking oysters from an
                    oyster-bed during four months of the year is not the slightest security against
                    its being stripped clean during the other eight months. “Suppose,” he continues,
                    “that in a country infested by wolves, you have a flock of sheep, keeping the
                    wolves off during the lambing season will not afford much protection if you
                    withdraw shepherd and dogs during the rest of the year.” The old close-time laws
                    were abolished in England in 1866, and returned to in 1876, but no results can
                    be traced to the action of parliament in either case. Prof. Huxley’s conclusions
                    as regards the future of the oyster industry in Great Britain are doubtless just
                    as applicable to other countries,—that the only hope for the oyster consumer
                    lies in the encouragement of oyster-culture, and in the development of some
                    means of breeding oysters under such conditions that the spat shall be safely
                    deposited. Oyster culture can evidently be carried on only by private
                    enterprise, and the problem for legislation to solve is how to give such rights
                    of property upon those shores which are favourable to oyster culture as may
                    encourage competent persons to invest their money in that undertaking. Such
                    property right should undoubtedly be extended to natural beds, or else an area
                    of natural spawning territory should be kept under constant control and
                    surveillance by Government, for the purpose of maintaining an adequate supply of
                    seed oysters.</p>
                <p>The existing legislation in the United States is thus admirably summarized by

                <p>“The fishery is regulated by the laws of the various States, the Federal
                    Government exercising no control, and consequently the conditions un&lt;ler
                    which the pursuit is followed are many and various. At the present time the laws
                    relating to the oyster fishery may be said to be based upon one of two general
                    principles. The first, the basis for the regulations of most of the States,
                    considers the oyster-beds to be inalienable common property. Laws based upon
                    this principle are generally of a protective nature, and are in reality
                    regulations of the State, made by it in its capacity of guardian of the common
                    property. The second principle assumes the right of the State to dispose of the
                    area at the bottom of its rivers, harbours, and estuaries, and, having disposed
                    of it, to consider the lessee or owner as alone responsible for the success or
                    failure of his enterprises, and t he State in no way called upon to afford him
                    other assistance than protection in legitimate rights. In general terms, under
                    the first principle the beds are held in common; under the second, in severalty.
                    But one State permits the preemption of an unlimited tract of bottom, and the
                    holding of it in fee—the State of Connecticut. Rhode Island leases her ground
                    for a term of years, at $10 per acre; but the person holding an area has no
                    legal power of disposing of it beyond the limits of the lease. Massachusetts,
                    New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia all permit pre-emption of small
                    tracts by individuals for indefinite periods, and on the coast of Long Island
                    the various towns along the shore lease tracts of considerable extent to private
                    cultivators.</p>
                <p>“Various restrictions are also placed upon the time and manner of conducting the
                    fisheries. Some of the States, noticeably Virginia, prohibit entirely the use of
                    the dredge or scrape; others, noticeably New Jersey,prohibit such use in some
                    localities, and permit it in others. All the States, with one exception,
                    prohibit the use of steam vessels or machinery, or fishing by other than their
                    own inhabitants. Connecticut again forms the exception, and quite a large fleet
                    of steam dredging vessels are employed on her beds.</p>
                <p>“The laws of the various States have several common features. All general fishing
                    is suspended during the summer months. No night fishing is permitted. No
                    steamers are allowed to be used. No proprietary rights to particular areas
                    arc-given beyond the right to ‘plant’ a limited number of oysters on bottoms
                    adjoining land owned by the planter, and peace officers and local authorities
                    are charged with execution of laws relating to the fishery. In a few States or
                    localities licences are required to be obtained for each fishing vessel; and in
                    one State. Maryland, a regularpolice force and fleet of vesselsare maintained to
                    support the law. These r egulations are easily evaded, except those relating to
                    the steamers and pre-emption of ground. Naturally, no one will put down oysters
                    without being able to protect them; and steamers are too readily detected to
                    make their illegal employment possible. In Connecticut and Rhode Island, the
                    beds being virtually private property, there is no restriction of the fishery,
                    except that it si&gt;al) not be conducted at night.”</p>
                <p>The method of gathering oysters is simple, and much the same in all parts of the
                    world, the implements in use being nippers or tongs with long handles, rakes,
                    which are simply many-pronged nippers, and dredges. The subjoined account of the
                    American method is abridged from that of Lieutenant Winslow:—</p>
                <p>The character of the vessel or boat used depends in a measure upon the means of
                    the fisherman and the constancy of his employment, and is also influenced by the
                    character of the oyster ground, its location, and the laws governing the
                    fishing. The last-named condition also decides the implement to be used; when
                    permitted, it is the dredge—either the enormous one employed by the steamers,
                    the smaller toothed rake-dredge, or smooth-scrape. When dredging is prohibited,
                    the tongs, or nippers, with two handles, sometimes 30 feet long, are used. The
                    dredges are usually worked by an apparatus termed a “winder,” many forms of
                    which are employed, the best and most recent form being so designed that if,
                    while reeling in, the dredge should “hang,” that is, become immovably fixed by
                    some obstruction on the bottom, the drum is at once automatically thrown out of
                    gearing, and the dredge-rope allowed to run out. Small craft use a more simple
                    and less expensive description of winch, and frequently haul in by hand, while
                    the steam dredgers have powerful machinery adapted for this special purpose. The
                    number of men employed varies with the size of the craft; two, three, and four
                    men are sufficient on board the smaller dredgers, while the larger cany ten and
                    twelve.</p>
                <p>While a great many oysters are transported in the shell to markets distant from
                    the seaboard, the largest part of the inland consumption is of “opened" or
                    “shucked" oysters, and nearly every oyster dealer along the coast employs a
                    larger or smaller number of persons to open the oysters and pack and ship the
                    meats. Some of these establishments are small, having as few as half a dozen
                    people engaged; others are large buildings or sheds, and employ hundreds of
                    “shuekers." After having been removed from their shells and thoroughly washed,
                    the oysters thus dealt with are transferred either to small cans, holding a
                    quart of oysters, or to barrels, kegs, or tubs; when packed in tubs, kegs, or
                    barrels, they’ go in bulk, with a large piece of ice; when packed in the tin
                    cans, the cans are arranged in two rows inside of a long box, a vacant, space
                    being left in the centre, between the rows, in which is placed ft large block of
                    ice. The cans are carefully soldered up before packing, and together with the
                    ice are laid in sawdust. Oysters packed in this way can, in cool weather, be
                    kept a week or more, and sent across the continent, or "to the remote western
                    towns.</p>
                <p>The steaming process is that by which the “cove " oysters are prepared. The term
                    “cove” is applied to oysters put up in cans, hermetically sealed, and intended
                    to be presei ved an "indefinite time. The trade in coves is confined principally
                    to the Chesapeake region, and the process of preparing them is as follows. The
                    oysters, usually the smaller sizes, are taken from the vessels and placed in
                    cars of iron frame-work, 6 or 8 feet long. These cars run on a light iron track,
                    which is laid from the wharf through the “steam-chest” or “steambox” to the
                    shucking shed. As soon as a car is filled with oysters (in the shell) it is run
                    into the steam-chest, a rectangular oak box, 15 to 20 feet long, lined with
                    sheet iron and fitted with appliances for turning in steam; the doors, which wo
                    k vertically and shut closely, are then let down, the steam admitted, and the
                    oysters <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n121/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0121-0110"/> left for ten or fifteen minutes. The chest is
                    then opened and the cars run into the β'∣ucking shed, their places in the chest
                    being immediately occupied by other cars. In the shed the cars are surrounded by
                    the shuckers <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> each provided with a knife and a can
                    arranged so as to hook to the’upperbarof the iron frame-work of the car. The
                    steaming having caused the oyster shells to open more or less widely, there is
                    no difficulty in getting out the meats, and the cars are very rapidly emptied.
                    The oysters are then washed in iced water and transferred to the “fillers’”
                    table. The cans, having been filled, are removed to another part of the room and
                    packed in a cylindrical, iron crate or basket, and lowered into a large
                    cylindrical kettle, called the “process kettle” or “tub,” where they are again
                    steamed. Afterthis they are placed, crate and all, in the “cooling tub;” and
                    when sufficiently cool to be handled, the cans are taken to the soldering table,
                    and there “capped"—th at is, are hermetically closed. From the “cappers” they
                    are transported to another department, labelled, and packed in boxes for
                    shipment. The whole steaming process will not occupy an hour from the time the
                    oysters leave the vessel until they are ready for shipment.</p>
                <p>The extension of the area of the natural beds is the second step in oyster
                    culture. As is well known to zoologists, and as has been very lucidly set forth
                    by Prof. Möbius in the essay already referred to, the location of oyster banks
                    is sharply defined by absolute physical conditions. Within certain definite
                    limits of depth, temperature, and salinity, the only requirement is a suitable
                    place for attachment. Oysters cannot thrive where the ground is composed of
                    moving sand or where mud is deposited; consequently, since the size and number
                    of these places are very limited, only a very small percentage of the young
                    oysters can find a resting-place, and the remainder perish. Möbius estimates
                    that for every oyster brought to market from the Holstein banks, 1,045,000 are
                    destroyed or die. By putting down suitable “cultch” or “stools” immense
                    quantities of the wandering fry may be induced to settle, and are thus saved. As
                    a fuie the natural beds occupy most of the suitable space in their own vicinity.
                    Unoccupied territory may, however, be prepared for the reception of new beds, by
                    spreading sand, gravel, and shells over muddy bottoms, or, indeed, beds may be
                    kept up in locations for permanent natural beds, by putting down mature oysters
                    and cultch just before the time of breeding, thus giving the young a chance to
                    fix themselves before the currents and enemies have had time to accomplish much
                    in the way of destruction.</p>
                <p>The collection of oyster spat upon artificial stools has been practised from time
                    immemorial. As early as the 7th century, and probably before, the Romans
                    practised a kind of oyster culture in Lake Avernus, which still survives to the
                    present day in Lake Fusaro. Piles of rocks are made on the muddy bottoms of
                    these salt-water lakes, and around these are arranged circles of stakes, to
                    which are often attached bundles of twigs. Breeding oysters are piled upon the
                    rookeries, and their young become attached to the stakes and twigs provided for
                    their reception, where they are allowed to remain until ready for use, when they
                    are plucked off and sent to the market. A similar though ruder device is used in
                    the Poquonnock river in Connecticut. Birch trees are thrown into the water near
                    a natural bed of oysters, and the trunks and twigs become covered with spat; the
                    trees are then dragged out upon the shore by oxen, and the young fry are broken
                    off and laid down in the shallows to increase in size. In 1858 the method of the
                    Italian lakes were repeated at St Brieuc under the direction of Prof. P. Coste,
                    and from these experiments the art of artificial breeding as practised in France
                    has been developed. There is, however, a marked distinction between oyster
                    culture and oyster breeding, as will be shown below. The natural beds of France
                    in the Bay of Arcachon, near Auray in Brittany, near Cancale and Granville in
                    Normandy, and elsewhere, are, however, carefully cultivated, as it is necessary
                    that they should be, for the support of the breeding establishments.<note

                <p>More or less handling or “working” of the oysters is necessary both for natural
                    and transplanted beds. The most elaborate is that which has been styled the
                    “English system,” which is carried on chiefly near the mouth of the Thames, by
                    the Whitstable and Colchester corporations of fishermen and others. This
                    consists in laying down beds in water a fathom or more in depth at low water and
                    constantly dredging over the grounds, even during the close time, except during
                    the period when the spat is actually settling. By this means the oysters are
                    frequently taken out of the water and put back again, and it is claimed that in
                    this way their enemies are baffled and the ground put in better condition to
                    receive the spat. As a matter of fact, however, the oysters have not for many
                    years multiplied under this treatment, and the system is practically one of
                    oyster-parking rather than one of oyster-culture. One of the advantages of the
                    frequent handling is that the fishermen, in putting the oysters back, can assort
                    them by sizes, and arrange them conveniently for the final gathering for market
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>American oyster culture, as practised in the “East River” (the western end of
                    Long Island Sound), in eastern Connecticut, and to some extent in Long Island
                    and New Jersey, is eminently successful and profitable, and there seems to be no
                    reason to doubt its permanenc⅛ conducted as it is in close proximity to the
                    natural beds, and with due regard for preservation. In the Long Island Sound
                    alone, in 1879, the labours of 1714 men produced 997,000 bushels, or perhaps
                    250,000,000 of native oysters, valued at $847,925, while all France produced in
                    the following season 375,000, worth about $412,000. There was also a side
                    product of 450,000 bushels (122,000,000) of transplanted oysters, worth
                    $350,000, handled by the same men in the American beds, while France employed an
                    additional force of 28,000 people to produce 305,000,000 artificially bred
                    oysters, worth $3,179,000. The Long Island Sound system consists simply in
                    distributing over the grounds, just before the spawning season, quantities of
                    old oyster shells to which the young oysters become attached, and left
                    undisturbed for from three to five years, when, having reached maturity, they
                    are dredged for use. Spawning oysters are frequently put down in the spring, two
                    months before the ground is shelled; this is done even when the natural beds are
                    near, but is not so essential as when a rather remote piece of bottom is to be
                    colonized.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>An excellent summary of the methods of planting in different parts of the United

                <p>The laying down or temporary deposit of dredged oysters in estuaries on floats or
                    in tanks, to fatten, increase in size, or improve in flavour, is a concomitant
                    of oyster culture, and may be used in connexion with any of the systems above
                    referred to. It is in no sense oyster culture, since it has no relation to the
                    maintenance of the supply. A system of this kind has been practised since the
                    16th century at Marennes and La Tremblade on the west coast of France, where
                    oysters from natural beds are placed in shallow basins communicating with the
                    sea during the spring tides, and where they obtain food which gives them a green
                    colour and a peculiar flavour much esteemed by Parisian epicures.<note

                <p>In England, brood oysters are laid down in fattening beds on the coast of Essex
                    and in the Thames estuary, where they acquire delicacy of flavour, and to some
                    extent, especially in the Thames, the green colour already referred to. Belgium
                    has also, near Ostend, fattening beds supplied with foreign spat, chiefly from
                    England.</p>
                <p>In the United States an extensive business is carried on in laying down seed
                    oysters from the Chesapeake Bay in the estuaries of southern New England and the
                    Middle States.</p>
                <p>Oyster-culturists practise in many places what is called “plumping,” or puffing
                    up oysters for market by exposing them for a short time to the effects of water
                    fresher than that in which they grew. By this process the animal does not
                    acquire any additional matter except the water, which is taken up in great
                    amount, but it loses, a part of its saltness, and, in flavour, becomes more like
                    an oyster from brackish waters.</p>
                <p>There are large oyster reservoirs at Husum in Schleswig-Holstein, and at Ostend,
                    which serve the double purpose of fattening the oysters and of keeping a uniform
                    supply lor the markets at times unsuited to the prosecution of the fisnery.</p>
                <p>The artificial impregnation of oyster eggs has been successfully accomplished by
                    many experimenters, and in 1883 Mr John A. Ryder of the United States Fish
                    Commission succeeded in confining the swimming embryos in collectors until they
                    had formed their shells and become fixed. The utility of this experiment seems
                    to consist in the greater facility which it gives to oyster-culturists in
                    securing a sure supply of spat, independent of the vicissitudes which currents
                    and changes of weather entail upon those who rely upon its deposit under natural
                    conditions. The spat thus secured can be reared either by the American, English,
                    or French systems. It is not probable that the common European species, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ostrea edulis,</hi> can be so readily handled by this method as
                    the Portuguese species, <hi rend="italic">Ostrea angulata,</hi> or the American,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ostrea</hi><hi rend="italic">virginica,</hi> though this can
                    only be determined by trial. For the details of Mr Ryder’s experiment, see the
