                <p><label type="entry">LOYALTY ISLANDS</label>, a group in the South Pacific, about
                    60 miles east of New Caledonia, consisting of Uvea or Uea (the northmost), Lifu,
                    Toka and several small islands, and Mare or Nengone. They are coral islands of
                    comparatively recent elevation, and in no place rise more than 250 feet above
                    the level of the sea. Lifu, the largest, is about 50 miles in length by 25 in
                    breadth. Enough of its rocky surface is covered with a thin coating of soil to
                    enable the natives to grow yams, taro, bananas, &amp;c., for their support;
                    cotton thrives well, and has even been exported in small quantities, but there
                    is no space available for its cultivation on any considerable scale. Fresh
                    water, rising and falling with the tide, is found in certain large caverns, and,
                    in fact, by sinking to the sea-level a supply may be obtained in any part of the
                    island. The popula tion, about 7000, is on the decrease. The island called
                    Neugone by the natives and Mare by the inhabitants of the Isle of Pines is about
                    80 miles in circumference, and contains about 6000 souls. Uvea, the most recent
                    part of the group, consists of a circle of about twenty islets enclosing a
                    lagoon 20 miles in width; the largest is about 30 miles in length, and in some
                    places 3 miles wide, and the next largest is about 12 miles in length. The
                    inhabitants, numbering about 2500, export considerable quantities of cocoa-nut
                    oil.</p>
                <p>The Loyalty islanders are classed as Melanesian; the several islands have each
                    its separate language, and in Uvea the one tribe uses a Samoan and the other a
                    New Hebridean form of speech. Captain Cook passed to the east of New Caledonia
                    without observing the Loyalty group; but it was discovered soon afterwards, and
                    Dumont D’Urville laid down the several islands in his chart. For many years
                    after their discovery the natives had a bad repute as dangerous cannibals.
                    Christianity was introduced into Mare by native teachers from Rarotonga and
                    Samoa; missionaries were settled by the London Missionary Society at Mare in
                    1854, at Lifu in 1859, and at Uvea in 1865; Roman Catholic missionaries also
                    arrived from New Caledonia; and in 1864 the French, considering the islands a
                    dependency of that colony, formally instituted a commandant. An attempt was made
                    by this official to put a stop to the English missions by violence; but the
                    report of his conduct led to so much indignation in Australia and in England
                    that the emperor Napoleon, on receipt of a protest from Lord Shaftesbury and
                    others, caused a commission of inquiry to be appointed, and free liberty of
                    worship to be secured to the Protestant missions. A new persecution of the
                    Christians in Uvea, during 1875, called forth a protest on the part of the
                    English Government, and matters appear to have since improved.</p>
