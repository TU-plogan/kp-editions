                <p><label type="entry">LYCURGUS</label>, a famous Spartan lawgiver. As even the
                    ancients themselves differed so widely in their accounts of Lycurgus that
                    Plutarch could begin his life by saying that he could assert absolutely nothing
                    about him which was not controverted, it is not surprising that modern
                    historical criticism has been disposed to relegate him wholly into the region of
                    pure myth. One tradition would put him as far back as the age of Troy; another
                    would connect him with Homer; while Herodotus implies that he lived in the 10th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is now usual, on the strength of a
                    passage in Thucydides (bk. i. chap. 18), which represents Sparta as having
                    enjoyed a well-established political constitution for as much as four hundred
                    years before the Peloponnesian war, to assign him to the 9th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and to accept him as a real historical person. But
                    as to the character and result of his legislative work there still remain very
                    conflicting opinions, due to the circumstance that such data as we possess are
                    susceptible of exceedingly diverse inferences and interpretations. Plutarch’s
                    life, which is the fullest and most detailed account we have of him, is not
                    merely the compilation at second hand of a late age (2d century), but also
                    abounds in statements which any one with any knowledge of the early growth of
                    political societies feels to be inherently improbable. Grote prefers on the
                    whole to be guided by what may be fairly inferred from the allusions to his
                    legislation in Aristotle, as being one of our earliest sources of information
                    and certainly the most philosophical estimate of his work. With Thirl wall he
                    takes him to have been a real person, and assumes that he was the instrument of
                    establishing good order among the Spartans, hitherto, according to Herodotus,
                    the most lawless of mankind, and of thus laying the foundations of Spartan
                    strength and greatness.</p>
                <p>The traditional story was that when acting as guardian to his nephew, Labotas,
                    king of the Spartans, he imported his new institutions from Crete, in which a
                    branch of the Dorian race had for a considerable period settled themselves. It
                    was said that he had travelled widely, and gathered political wisdom and
                    experience in Egypt and even in India. With the support of the Delphic oracle,
                    which was specially reverenced by Dorians, he was able to accomplish his work
                    and to regulate, down to the smallest details, the entire life of Sparta. He
                    lived to see the fruit of his labour, and, having bound his fellow countrymen to
                    change nothing in his laws till his return, he left then for Delphi, and was
                    never seen by them again. The oracle declared that Sparta would prosper as long
                    as she held fast by his legislation, and upon this a temple was built to his
                    honour, and he was worshipped as a god.</p>
                <p>It was the fashion with writers like Plutarch, from whom our notions of Lycurgus
                    have been mainly derived, to represent the Spartan lawgiver as the author of a
                    wholly new set of laws and institutions. It need hardly be said that any such
                    view has long been abandoned, and that Lycurgus’s work, great as it no doubt
                    was, did not go beyond formulating what already existed in germ, and was in fact
                    the peculiar heritage of the Spartans as members of the Dorian race. It has been
                    contended that the laws of Sparta were the typical Dorian laws, and that Sparta
                    herself was the special representative, politically and socially, of the Dδrian
                    race. It appears, however, to have been the general view of the Greeks
                    themselves that many of her most important institutions, more especially the
                    severity of her military training and of her homediscipline, were peculiar to
                    Sparta, and were by no means shared by such states as Corinth, Argos, Megara,
                    all of Dorian origin. Grote lays great stress on this point <hi rend="italic"
                    >(History of Greece,</hi> chap, vi.), and maintains that it was the singularity
                    of the Spartan laws which made such a deep impression on the Greek mind. The
                    truth indeed seems to be that Sparta’s political organization in its main lines
                    was of the Dorian type, and resembles the pictures given us in the Homeric
                    poems, but that much in her social life and military arrangements was absolutely
                    unique. It is here that in all probability may be traced the genius and
                    foresight of Lycurgus, and he may thus well deserve the credit of having started
                    Sparta on a new career.</p>
                <p>The council of elders <hi rend="italic">(gerousia,</hi> or senate), a distinctive
                    feature of the Hellenic states generally, must have existed at Sparta long
                    before Lycurgus, nor is it at all certain that he fixed its number at
                    twenty-eight, the two kings who sat and voted in it making it up to thirty
                    members. It was elected from the people from candidates who had reached the age
                    of sixty, and a senator once elected was a senator for life. It united the
                    functions of a deliberative assembly and of a court of justice, and it prepared
                    measures which were from time to time submitted to periodical assemblies of the
                    people, which, however, had simply to accept or reject, without any power of
                    amendment or criticism. So far the constitution of Sparta was distinctly
                    oligarchical. The two kings, whose office was hereditary, and whose descent was
                    from the famous family of the Heraclids, had but very limited political powers,
                    and, with some few exceptions, even little more than ordinary senators. They
                    owed their position and prerogatives to the. religious sentiment of the people,
                    which reverenced their noble and quasidivine origin, and accepted them as
                    legitimately the high priests of the nation, and as specially qualified in great
                    emergencies to consult the Delphic oracle and receive its answers. An ample
                    royal domain was assigned to them, and some rather delicate legal matters, such
                    as the bestowment of the hand of an orphan heiress, were entrusted to their
                    discretion. By far the most important of their duties was the command of the
                    army on a foreign expedi-tiou<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n111/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0111-0096"/>, with, however, the assistance of a council of
                    war. In fact they closely resembled at all points the kings of the heroic age,
                    and the honour and reverence in which they were held was far greater than their
                    actual power, which really was curtailed within such narrow limits that it was
                    not possible for them to establish anything like a tyranny or despotism.</p>
                <p>One great check on the kings was a board of magistrates, annually elected by the
                    people, termed ephors, a name not confined to Sparta, whence we may fairly infer
                    that this institution also by no means owed its origin to Lycurgus, A comparison
                    has been suggested between the Spartan ephors and the tribunes at Rome. Both
                    were certainly popular magistrates, and as it was at Rome, so too at Sparta, at
                    any rate in her later days, these magistrates made themselves the great power in
                    the state. There was a form of ancient oaths between the king and the ephors,
                    the king swearing that he would respect the established laws, and the ephors
                    swearing that on that condition he should retain his authority and prerogatives.
                    The unanimous view of antiquity was that it was the special business of the
                    ephors “to protect the people and restrain the kings.” We gather from passages
                    in Thucydides that they had in his time great political influence, and in the
                    time of Aristotle they had attained such a position that he says they did not
                    choose to conform themselves to the strict discipline prescribed to Spartan
                    citizens. Although the king took the command in war, it was for the ephors to
                    say when war should be made, and on what terms peace should be concluded. Any
                    public magistrate, the kings not excepted, was liable to be called to account by
                    them, while they themselves seem to have been irresponsible. Of course the fact
                    that they were annually elected necessitated a general conformity in their
                    policy to the popular will. But so great and arbitrary were their powers that
                    Plato hints that the Spartan constitution might be almost described as a
                    tyranny. Indeed they were to Sparta what the House of Commons is to England,
                    “the moving spring,” as Arnold says <hi rend="italic">{Thucy.,</hi> App. II.),
                    of the whole Spartan government.</p>
                <p>Of the institutions we have described, not one, as we have seen, was peculiar to
                    Sparta, or, it may be inferred, due to Lycurgus. They were indeed all connected
                    by tradition with his name, and we may believe that he did his best to put them
                    on a sound basis, though, as to the ephors, there is reason to think that they
                    formed no part of the original Spartan constitution. One thing is certain that
                    there was a permanence about Lycurgus’s work, whatever it may have been, to
                    which Sparta’s long freedom from revolution was unanimously attributed. She owed
                    this no doubt mainly to her peculiar social customs and usages, and it is here
                    that in the opinion of both Grote and Thirlwall we must specially look for the
                    reforming hand of Lycurgus.</p>
                <p>It was of the first importance that the Spartan should be an efficient soldier.
                    He was a conqueror in the midst of a subject population, to which he stood in
                    the same relation in which the Norman for a time at least stood to the Saxon.
                    This subject population was made up of two classes, the Perioeci (dwellers round
                    the city) and the Helots, the first being freemen and proprietors scattered
                    throughout the townships and villages of Laconia, with some powers of local
                    self-government, but with no voice in the affairs of the state, while the latter
                    were simply serfs, attached to the soil which they cultivated, like the villein
                    of the feudal period, for Spartan proprietors, to whom they paid a rent
                    equivalent, it is said, to half of the entire produce. Their condition, though a
                    humble and in some respects a degraded one, was at least free from the worst
                    incidents of slavery, as they lived with their wives and families, and could not
                    be sold out of the country. Thus they must have felt themselves an integral part
                    of the state, which employed them in military service, and rewarded them from
                    time to time with the gift of freedom. Still, as an oppressed class, they often
                    gave uneasiness to Sparta, and on one memorable occasion, recorded by Thucydides
                    (iv. 80), as many as two thousand of them were treacherously and secretly
                    massacred for reasons of state expediency. There was even a regular and
                    legalized system of thinning their numbers by stealthy assassination, known as
                    the “crypteia,” and carried into effect by young Spartans who were annually
                    commissioned to range the country with daggers for this horrible purpose. If
                    under ordinary circumstances the’frugal and industrious Helot might exist in
                    tolerable comfort and even hope for freedom, he must have been made to feel that
                    it was exceedingly dangerous to be too aspiring, and the inferiority of his
                    condition was clearly marked by a distinctive dress which he dared not lay
                    aside, any more than he might presume to sing any of the national songs of
                    Sparta.</p>
                <p>It was by the toil of the Helots that the Spartan was enabled to live, as we
                    should say, the life of a gentleman, devoting himself to hunting and military
                    exercises along with some slight admixture of mental culture, based mainly on
                    music and poetry. It was not, however, a life of ease and enjoyment. His
                    physical training was proverbially severe. From the age of seven he was put
                    under a rigorous state discipline which inured him to the patient endurance of
                    the most extreme hardships. The ideal at which he was specially taught to aim
                    was a calm passive fortitude, which implied that he lived solely for the state.
                    Spartan youths would compete with each other in submitting themselves to the
                    lash before the altar of the goddess Artemis, and would, it is said, sometimes
                    suffer even to death without any visible emotion. The story that they were
                    habitually trained to theft means that they had licence to roam the country and
                    forage for food, which they were expected to carry off without detection. In
                    every way they were trained to feel themselves at home amid peril and
                    hardship.</p>
                <p>The Spartan woman, whose business it was to be the mother of brave and robust
                    children, was naturally held in great honour, and according to Aristotle had at
                    least in his time great influence on public affairs. The maiden was trained in
                    much the same fashion as the youth, and was exercised in running, wrestling, and
                    boxing, and thus at Sparta there was a much freer intermingling of the sexes
                    than in any other Greek state. In this respect Spartan fashions of life seem to
                    have been altogether peculiar to Spartans. The effect of such a training on the
                    women would as a matter of course be to give them masculine sentiments and
                    aspirations, and we can well understand what regard would be paid to their
                    praise or censure. The position of women in Sparta takes us back to the old
                    heroic ages, and reminds us of many passages in the poems of Homer.</p>
                <p>One of the features of Spartan life, in thorough harmony with its general purpose
                    and tenor, was the public mess, the “syssitia,” according to the Greek phrase.
                    Every citizen was bound to be a member of the mess, which was arranged in a
                    number of joint tables, each providing from his allotment of land a prescribed
                    quota of provisions, with wine and game from the public forests, and the guests
                    being distributed into parties of fifteen persons, and chosen by ballot.
                    Attendance at the mess was strictly enforced, and even the kings were not
                    permitted to excuse themselves. The claims of the state on her citizens, and the
                    duty of obedience to state discipline, were thus kept perpetually present to the
                    Spartan’s mind.</p>
                <p>With trade and industrial occupations, even agriculture, the Spartan had nothing
                    to do, all this being left to the Periceci and Helots. We might have anticipated
                    that such <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n112/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0112-0097"/> would be the case with a military aristocracy.
                    The story that Lycurgus restricted Sparta to an iron coinage cannot well be
                    reconciled with the fact that silver money was not in use among the Greeks till
                    a century after his time.</p>
                <p>The organization of the Spartan army was always greatly admired by the ancients.
                    Xenophon praises its system of tactics for “an admirable simplicity in the midst
                    of seeming intricacy,” and in Thucydides (v. 66) we have it described as based
                    on an elaborate graduation of authority, by means of which the general’s orders
                    were transmitted to the rank and file with the utmost promptitude and accuracy.
                    The strength of the army consisted mainly in infantry, every Spartan being a
                    heavy-armed soldier, and the light troops being made up out of the Perioeci and
                    Helots. The Spartan cavalry never had much repute, and it was always regarded as
                    a decidedly inferior branch of the service. Nor did they seriously apply
                    themselves to sieges or to sea warfare. Though a brave, they were a very
                    cautious and wary people, and all their military operations were conducted with
                    extreme secrecy. It was a fixed principle with them not to engage the same enemy
                    with needless frequency, and not to carry a pursuit further than victory really
                    required. Anything like cowardice was a disgrace which reduced a citizen to the
                    condition of an outcast. “With it or on it” were the words with which the
                    Spartan mother would bid her son return when he left home with his shield to
                    fight for Sparta.</p>
                <p>Lycurgus is fairly described by Grote (ZZ∕.√. <hi rend="italic">of Greece,</hi>
                    chap. 6) as “the founder of a warlike brotherhood rather than the lawgiver of a
                    political community.” The Spartan was to be almost wholly estranged from home
                    ties, and to live only for the state. His training, though admired both by Plato
                    and Aristotle as directed towards a noble ideal, was felt by them to be very
                    imperfect, inasmuch as it cultivated only one side of human virtue and
                    contemplated the circumstances of a camp or a garrison rather than of a state
                    organized on a really perfect basis.</p>
                <p>With the reforms of Lycurgus Plutarch connects a sweeping readjustment of the
                    entire system of landed property, whereby Laconia was parcelled out into 39,000
                    equal lots, 9000 being assigned to Spartan citizens, and the remainder to their
                    free subjects, the Perioeci. It was the fashion with certain ancient writers to
                    assume some such measure in the case of every early legislator or reformer. But
                    it is to be noted that we have no hint of any such repartition of land by
                    Lycurgus till we come to Plutarch, and this fact so much impressed Grote that he
                    utterly rejects the story. All historical evidence, he maintains, points to
                    great inequalities of property among the Spartans from the earliest times, and
                    is therefore irreconcilable with any such belief. Here indeed he seems to be on
                    sure ground, but it may be quite possible that even with equal lots of land
                    there were decided inequalities in wealth. There may have been citizens rich in
                    flocks and herds pastured on common ground, of which, we have reason to believe,
                    there was considerable extent. Plutarch’s account is favoured by the fact that
                    equal distributions of land were often made in early days by conquering peoples.
                    The question is one on which it seems impossible to arrive at a certain and
                    definite conclusion. Possibly, as has been suggested by M. Laveleye, some old
                    tradition of an equality of landed property may have been the origin of the
                    belief that a redivision into equal portions was a part of the system of
                    Lycurgus.</p>
                <p>There was, however, an equality which he certainly did attempt to establish.
                    Every Spartan, rich or poor, had to submit to the same hard discipline and to
                    aim at the same ideal. The attempt was not altogether unsuccessful, though the
                    subsequent history of Sparta shows that several of her citizens fell so far
                    short of it as to disgrace themselves by actual dishonesty in the public
                    service. But we may fairly credit Lycurgus with a work which laid deep the
                    foundations of a very remarkable and at times a truly noble patriotism both in
