                <p><label type="entry">LYCOPHRON</label> was a Greek poet who flourished at
                    Alexandria in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus (285-47 B.c.). He was born at
                    Chalcis in Euboea, and was the son of Lycus. He wrote a number of tragedies,
                    forty-six or sixty-four, and Suidas gives the title of twenty of them. Only a
                    few lines are preserved of these works, which gained him a place in the Pleiad
                    of Alexandrian tragedians. He was entrusted by Ptolemy with the task of
                    arranging the comedies in the Alexandrian library, and out of this work grew his
                    treatise τr∈pι κωμωδίας, in at least eleven books. It seems to have treated of
                    the history of comedy, of the lives of the comic poets, and of various topics
                    subsidiary to the proper understanding of their poems, but nothing has been
                    preserved of the work. One of his poems called <hi rend="italic">Cassandra,</hi>
                    containing 1474 lines of iambic, has been preserved entire. It is in the form of
                    a prophecy uttered by Cassandra, and relates the later fortunes of Troy and of
                    the Greek and Trojan heroes. References to various events of mythic and of later
                    time are introduced, and the poem ends with a reference to Alexander the Great,
                    who was to unite Asia and Europe in his world wide empire. The style, as befits
                    a prophecy, is so enigmatical as to have procured for Lycophron, even among the
                    ancients, the title of the “obscure” (δ σκoτ∈tv0ς). The poem is evidently
                    intended to display the writer’s knowledge of obscure names and uncommon myths;
                    it is full of unusual words of doubtful meaning gathered from the older poets,
                    along with many long-winded compounds coined by the author. It has none of the
                    qualities of poetry, and was probably written not for the enjoyment of the
                    public but as a showpiece for the Alexandrian school. It was very popular in the
                    Byzantine period, and was read and commented on very frequently; the collection
                    of scholia by I. and J. Tzetzes is very valuable, and the MSS. of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cassandra</hi> are numerous. A few neat and well-turned lines
                    which have been preserved from Lycophron’s tragedies show a much better style;
                    they are said to have been much admired by Menedemus of Eretria, although the
                    poet had ridiculed him in a satyric drama. Lycophron is also said to have been a
                    skilful writer of anagrams, a reputation which does not speak highly for his
                    poetical character.</p>
                <p>Two passages of the <hi rend="italic">Cassandra,</hi> 1446-50 and. 1226-82, in
                    which the career of the Roman people and their universal empire are spoken of,
                    could evidently not have been written by an Alexandrian poet of 250 B.c. Hence
                    it has been maintained by Niebuhr and others that the poem was written by a
                    later poet mentioned by Tzetzes, but the opinion of Weicker is generally counted
                    more probable, that these paragraphs are a later interpolation: a prophetic poem
                    is peculiarly liable to have additions inserted, and the Roman rule was the most
                    natural subject to add.</p>
