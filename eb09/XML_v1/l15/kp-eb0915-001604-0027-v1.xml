                <p><label type="entry">LOUIS IV</label>. (or V.), “the Bavarian,” German king and
                    Roman emperor, was born in 1286. He was the son of the duke of Bavaria, and in
                    1314, after the death of the emperor Henry VII., was elected to the throne by
                    five of the electors, the others giving their votes for Frederick, duke of
                    Austria. This double election led to a civil war, in which Frederick was
                    supported by the church and by many nobles, while the inhabitants of the great
                    cities rallied round Louis. In 1322 Louis gained the battle of Mühldorf, taking
                    Frederick prisoner; but the war still went on. Pope John XXII. excommunicated
                    Louis in 1324; whereupon, wishing to bring the conflict to an end, Louis offered
                    to liberate Frederick on condition that he would withdraw his claim to the
                    throne, and restore the cities and imperial lands seized by his party in Swabia.
                    Frederick, finding that the obstinacy of his brother, Duke Leopold, would render
                    it impossible to fulfil these terms, returned to captivity; and Louis was so
                    touched by his magnanimity that he proposed that they should share the
                    responsibilities of government. The plan was tried but did not succeed, and was
                    virtually abandoned before Frederick’s death in 1330. In 1327 Louis had gone to
                    defend his rights in Italy, where he was crowned emperor by Pope Nicholas V.,
                    whom he supported in opposition to Pope John XXII. Returning to Germany in the
                    year of Frederick’s death, he made peace with the house of Austria, but John
                    XXII. refused to be conciliated, and his successor Benedict XII., acting in part
                    under the influence of France, continued the struggle. Irritated by the revival
                    of papal pretensions which no longer commanded respect in Germany, the electors
                    met at Rhense, and on the 15th of July 1338, issued an important declaration to
                    the effect that the emperor derived his right to the German and imperial crowns,
                    not from the pope, but from the electors by whom he was <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0028-0017"/> appointed. As the representative of national
                    independence, Louis might have made himself one of the most popular of the
                    emperors, but he excited bitter jealousies by his grasping and unscrupulous
                    disposition. By his marriage with Margaret, the sister of Count William of
                    Holland, he secured Holland, Zealand, Friesland, and Hainault; and he obtained
                    the mastery of Tyrol by separating the heiress, Margaret Maultasch, from her
                    husband, a son of John, the powerful king of Bohemia, and making her the wife of
                    his own son Louis, to whom (in 1322) he had granted the march of Brandenburg.
                    The enemies he thus created were reinforced by Pope Clement VI., who not only
                    excommunicated him again, but (in 1346) persuaded a party of the electors to
                    appoint a new king. Their choice fell on Charles, margrave of Moravia, the son
                    of King John of Bohemia, who at once made an unsuccessful attempt to recover
                    Tyrol. The outbreak of a new civil war was prevented by the sudden death of
                    Louis at a bear hunt near Munich, on the 11th of October 1347. The conflict
                    between the papacy and the empire was practically closed during the reign of
                    Louis, and he marked an epoch by his encouragement of the cities in opposition
                    to the princes and nobles.</p>
