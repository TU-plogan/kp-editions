                <p><label type="entry">LYRE</label>. Of all musical instruments the lyre has been
                    the most associated with poetry, the recitations of Greeks having been
                    accompanied by it. Yet the lyre was not of Greek origin; no root in the language
                    has been discovered for <hi rend="italic">λυρa,</hi> although the special names
                    bestowed upon varieties of the instrument are Hellenic. We have to seek in Asia
                    the birthplace of the genus, and to infer its introduction into Greece through
                    Thrace or Lydia. The historic heroes and improvers of the lyre were of the
                    Aeolian or Ionian colonies, or the adjacent coast bordering on the Lydian
                    empire, while the mythic masters, Orpheus, Musaeus, and Thamyris, were
                    Thracians. Notwithstanding the Hermes tradition of the invention of the lyre in
                    Egypt, the Egyptians seem to have adopted it themselves from Assyria or
                    Babylonia.</p>
                <p>To define the lyre, it is necessary clearly to separate it from the allied harp
                    and guitar, both, as far as we have record, instruments of as great antiquity.
                    In its primal form the lyre differs from the harp, of which the earliest,
                    simplest notion is found in the bow and bowstring; while the guitar (and lute)
                    can be traced back to the typical “nefer” of the fourth Egyptian dynasty, the
                    fretted finger-board of which, permitting the production of different notes by
                    the shortening of the string, is as different in conception from the lyre and
                    harp as the flute with holes to shorten the column of air is from the syrinx or
                    Pandean pipes. The frame of a lyre consists of a hollow body or sound-chest
                    (∙7χ∈t0v). From this sound-chest are raised two arms (7r7)χ∈ις), which are
                    sometimes hollow, and are bent both outward and forward. They are bound near the
                    top by a crossbar or yoke <hi rend="italic">(ζυγόν, ζύγωμα,</hi> or, from its
                    having once been a reed, <hi rend="italic">κάλαμος).</hi> Another crossbar <hi
                    rend="italic">(μdγaς, {</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >π0λυpL0v),</hi> fixed on the sound-chest, forms the bridge which transmits the
                    vibrations of the strings. The deepest note was the farthest from the player;
                    but, as the strings did not differ much in length, more weight may have been
                    gained for the deeper notes by thicker strings, as in the violin and similar
                    modern instruments, or they were tuned with slacker tension. The strings were
                    never of wire, the drawing of which was unknown to the nations of antiquity, but
                    of gut <hi rend="italic">(χop8η,</hi> whence chord). They were <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0129-0114"/> stretched between the yoke and bridge, or to a
                    tailpiece below the bridge. There were two ways of tuning: one was to fasten the
                    strings to pegs which might be turned <hi rend="italic">(κόλλαβοι.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">κ0λλoτr(ζ')</hi>; the other was to change the place of the string
                    upon the crossbar; probably both expedients were simultaneously employed. It is
                    doubtful whether <hi rend="italic">η χopδoτ0vo&lt;s</hi> meant the tuning key or
                    the part of the instrument where the pegs were inserted. The extensions of the
                    arms above the yoke were known as <hi rend="italic">κέρατα,</hi> horns.</p>
                <p>Tim number of strings varied at different epochs, and possibly in different
                    localities,—four, seven, and ten having been favourite numbers. They were, as
                    already said, used without a finger-board, no Greek description or
                    representation having ever been met with that can be construed as referring to
                    one. Nor was a bow possible, the flat soundboard being an insuperable
                    impediment. The plectrum, however <hi rend="italic">(πληκτpov),</hi> was in
                    constant use at all times. It was held in the right hand to set the upper
                    strings in vibration <hi rend="italic">(κpeκcw, κpoveιv</hi> τω <hi
                    rend="italic">πληκτpω)</hi>; at other times it hung from the lyre by a ribbon.
                    The fingers of the left hand touched the lower strings (^dλλeιv).</p>
                <p>With Greek authors the lyre has several distinct names; but we are unable to
                    connect these with anything like certainty to the varieties of the instrument.
                    Clιelys (χeλυs, “tortoise”) may mean the smallest lyre, which, borne by one arm
                    or supported by the knees, offered in the sound-chest a decided resemblance to
                    that familiar animal. That there was a difference between ]yre and cithara <hi
                    rend="italic">(κιθάρα)</hi> is certain, Plato and other writers separating them.
                    Hermes and Apollo had an altar at Olympia in common because the former had
                    invented the lyre and the latter the cithara. Perhaps the lyre and chelys on the
                    one hand, and the cithara and phorminx on the other, were similar or nearly
                    identical. Apollo is said to have carried a golden phorminx. But lyre has always
                    been accepted as the generic name of the family, and understood to include all
                    varieties. The large lyre was supported by a strong ribbon slung over the
                    player’s shoulder, passing through holes beneath the yoke in the arms of the
                    instrument, and caught by the player’s left hand, the ends hanging in a
                    sash-like fashion. This cithara, or, it may be, phorminx <hi rend="italic"
                    >(φopμaγξ,</hi> “portable lyre ”), is frequently, by the vase painters,
                    delineated as so held, —the plectrum, attached by another ribbon, being
                    represented, when not in use, as pendent, or as interlaced between the
                    strings.</p>
                <p>Passing by the story of the discovery of the lyre from a vibrating tortoise shell
                    by Hermes, we will glance at the real lyres of Egypt and Semitic Asia. The
                    Egyptian lyre is unmistakably Semitic. The oldest representation that has been
                    discovered is in one of the tombs of Beni Hassan, the date of the painting being
                    in the 12th dynasty, that is, shortly before the invasion of the shepherd kings.
                    In this painting, which both Rosellini and Lepsius have reproduced, an undoubted
                    Semite carries a seven or eight stringed lyre of fan-shaped form. The instrument
                    has a four-cornered body and an irregular four-cornered frame above it, and the
                    player carries it horizontally from his breast, just as a modern Nubian would
                    his kissar. He plays as he walks, using both hands, a plectrum being in the
                    right. This ancient lyre, dating 2000 B.c., exists to this day in a remarkable
                    specimen preserved in the Berlin Museum (fig. 3), and is found again in form as
                    well as in manner of holding in the Assyrian lyre of Khorsabad.</p>
                <p>During the rule of the shepherds the lyre became naturalized in Egypt, and in the
                    18th dynasty it is frequently depicted, and with finer grace of form. In the
                    19th and 20th dynasties the lyre is sometimes still more slender, or is quite
                    unsymmetrical and very strong, the horns surmounted by heads of animals as in
                    the Berlin one, which has horses’ heads at those extremities. Prokesch copied
                    one in the ruins of Wadi Haifa, splendid in blue and gold, with a serpent wound
                    round it. The Egyptians always strung their lyres fan-shaped, like the modern
                    Nubian kissar. Their paintings shew three to eight or nine strings, but the
                    painters’ accuracy may not be unimpeachable; the Berlin instrument had fifteen.
                    The three-stringed lyre typified the three seasons of the Egyptian year—the
                    water, the green, and the harvest; the seven, the planetary system from the moon
                    to Saturn. The Greeks had the same notion of the harmony of the spheres.</p>
                <p>There is no evidence as to what the stringing of the Greek lyre was in the heroic
                    age. Plutarch says that Olympus and Terpander used but three strings to
                    accompany their recitation. As the four strings led to seven and eight by
                    doubling the tetrachord, so the trichord is connected with the hexachord or
                    six-stringed lyre depicted on so many archaic Greek vases; We cannot insist on
                    the accuracy of this representation, the vase painters being so little mindful
                    of the complete expression of details; yet we may suppose their tendency would
                    be rather to imitate than to invent a number. It was their constant practice to
                    represent the strings as being damped by the fingers of the left hand of the
                    player, after having been struck by the plectrum which he held in the right
                    hand. Before the Greek civilization had assumed its historic form, there was
                    likely to be great freedom and independence of different localities in the
                    matter of lyre stringing, which is corroborated by the antique use of the
                    chromatic (half-tone) and enharmonic (quartertone) tunings, pointing to an early
                    exuberance, as in language when nations are young and isolated, and perhaps also
                    to an Asiatic bias towards refinements of intonation, from which came the <hi
                    rend="italic">χρόαι,</hi> the hues of tuning, old Greek modifications of
                    tetrachords entirely disused in the classic period. The common scale of
                    Olympus</p>
                <p>[∣≡≡≡≡⅛Ξ≡≡≡≡≡^ remained, a double trichord which had served as the scaffolding
                    for the enharmonic varieties.</p>
                <p>We may regard the Olympus scale, however, as consisting of two tetrachords,
                    eliding one interval in each, for the tetrachord, or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n130/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0130-0115"/> series of four notes, was very early adopted as
                    the fundamental principle of Greek music, and its origin in the lyre itself
                    appears sure. The basis of the tetrachord is the employment of the thumb and
                    first three fingers of the left hand to twang as many strings, the little finger
                    not being used on account of natural weakness. As a succession of three whole
                    tones would form the disagreeable and untunable interval of a tritonus, two
                    whole tones and a half-tone were tuned, fixing the tetrachord in the consonant
                    interval of the perfect fourth. This succession of four notes being in the grasp
                    of the hand was called <hi rend="italic">συλλαβή,</hi> just as in language a
                    group of letters incapable of further reduction is called syllable. In the
                    combination of two syllables or tetrachords the modern diatonic scales resemble
                    the Greek so-called disjunct scale, but the Greeks knew nothing of our
                    categorical distinctions of major and minor. We might call the octave Greek
                    scale minor, according to our descending minor form, were not the keynote in the
                    middle the thumb note of the deeper tetrachord. The upper tetrachord, whether
                    starting from the keynote (conjunct) or from the note above (disjunct), was of
                    exactly the same form as the lower, the position of the semitones being
                    identical. The semitone was a limma <hi rend="italic">{Kι7μμa),</hi> rather less
                    than the semitone of our modern equal temperament, the Greeks tuning both the
                    whole tones in the tetrachord by the same ratio of 8:9, which made the major
                    third a dissonance, or rather would have done so had they combined them in what
                    we call harmony. In melodious sequence the Greek tetrachord is decidedly more
                    agreeable to the ear than the corresponding series of our equal temperament. And
                    although our scales are derived from combined tetrachords, in any system of
                    tuning that we employ, be it just, mean-tone, or equal, they are less logical
                    than the conjunct or disjunct systems accepted by the Greeks. But modern harmony
                    is not compatible with them, and could not have arisen on the Greek melodic
                    lines.</p>
                <p>The conjunct scale of seven notes attributed to Terpander, was long the norm for
                    stringing and tuning the lyre. When the disjunct scale the octave scale
                    attributed to Pythagoras, was admitted, to preserve the time-honoured seven
                    strings one note had to be omitted; it was therefore customary to omit the C,
                    which in Greek practice was a dissonance. The Greek names for the strings of
                    seven and eight stringed lyres, the first note being highest in pitch and
                    nearest the player, were as follows:— <hi rend="italic">Nete, Paranete,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Paramese</hi><hi rend="italic">; Mese, Lichanos,
                    Parhypate,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hypate</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Nete, Paranete, Trite,</hi><hi rend="italic">Paramese</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">; Mese, Lichanos, Parhypate,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hypate,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> the last four from Mese to Hypate being the finger
                    tetrachord, the others touched with the plectrum. The highest string in pitch
                    was called the last, <hi rend="italic">ν^άτη</hi>; the lowest in pitch was
                    called the highest, <hi rend="italic">υπάτη,</hi> because it was, in theory at
                    least, the longest string. The keynote and thumb string was <hi rend="italic"
                    >μίση,</hi> middle; the next lower was <hi rend="italic">λlχavos,</hi> the first
                    finger or lickfinger string; <hi rend="italic">τρίτη,</hi> the third, being in
                    the plectrum division, was also known as <hi rend="italic">oξeιa,</hi> sharp,
                    perhaps from the dissonant quality which we have referred to as the cause of its
                    omission. The plectrum an 1 finger tetrachords together were διαπασών, through
                    all; in the disjunct scale, an octave.</p>
                <p>In transcribing the Greek notes into our notation, the absolute pitch cannot be
                    represented; the relative positions of the semitones are alone determined. We
                    have already quoted the scale of Pythagoras, the Dorian or true Greek succession
                    :—</p>
                <p>⅝Σ⅛⅞≡ ⅛ ≡Ξ≡</p>
                <p>Shifting the semitone one degree upwards in each tetrachord, we have the
                    Phrygian</p>
                <p>Another degree gives the Lydian ⅞≡≡≈⅞≡ ⅜⅜⅛≡1 <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> y <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> —≡-*≡⅛-=-</p>
                <p>which would be our major scale of E were not the keynote A. The names imply an
                    Asiatic origin. We will not pursue further the much debated question of Greek
                    scales and their derivation; it will suffice here to remark that the outside
                    notes of the tetrachords were fixed in their tuning as perfect fourths,—the
                    inner strings being, as stated, in diatonic sequence, or when chromatic two half
                    tones were tuned, when enharmonic two quarter-tones, leaving respectively the
                    wide intervals of a minor and major third, and both impure, to complete the
                    tetrachord. (A. J. H. )</p>
