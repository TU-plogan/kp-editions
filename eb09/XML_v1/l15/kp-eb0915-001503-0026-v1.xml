                    “le Débonnaire”), was born in 778. He succeeded his father Charlemagne in 814,

                    reign he excited high anticipations by the earnestness with which he attacked
                    the abuses that had accumulated during the later years of Charlemagne’s
                    sovereignty. The licentiousness which prevailed at court he sternly suppressed;
                    he punished counts who were proved to have misused their authority; and he
                    sought to reform the manners both of the secular and of the regular clergy. The
                    Saxons and the Frisians, who, although conquered, had never cordially accepted
                    Frankish rule, were conciliated by mild and generous treatment. A period of
                    trouble and confusion, however, was opened in 817, when Louis, anxious to
                    establish the order of succession, declared his eldest son Lothair his
                    successor, and made him co-regent, granting him Austrasia with the greater part
                    of Germany. The younger sons of Louis, Pippin and Louis, received, the former
                    Aquitania, the latter Bavaria, Bohemia, Carinthia, and the subject Slavonic and
                    Avar territories. This arrangement was resented by Bernard, king of Italy, the
                    emperor’s nephew, who forthwith rebelled. He was soon captured, and condemned to
                    the loss of his sight, while his kingdom was transferred to Lothair. After the
                    death of Bernard, the emperor, who was a man of a gentle and sensitive temper,
                    bitterly repented the harsh punishment which he had sanctioned, and, being
                    further depressed by the death of his first wife, he proposed to resign the
                    crown and retire to a monastery. He was induced to abandon this intention, and
                    (in 819) to marry Judith, the beautiful daughter of Count Welf of Bavaria. In
                    829 he made a new division of the empire in favour of Charles (afterwards
                    Charles the Bald), his son by his second wife. The three brothers, deeply
                    dissatisfied, combined to declare war against him, and at Compiègne he was taken
                    prisoner. The empress Judith was condemned to the cloister for alleged
                    infidelity to her husband, and Louis was virtually deposed. Pippin and the
                    younger Louis, suspecting that Lothair meant to usurp exclusive authority,
                    changed their policy, and at a diet in Nimeguen the emperor was restored. Soon
                    afterwards he provoked fresh disturbance by granting Aquitania, the territory of
                    Pippin, to Charles, and in 833 the army of the three brothers confronted that of
                    their father near Colmar. When Louis was negotiating with Pope Gregory IV., who
                    had crossed the Alps in the hope of restoring peace, his troops were persuaded
                    to desert him, and on the Lügenfeld (“the field of lies ”) he was obliged to
                    surrender to his sons. The empress was sent to Italy, her son to the monastery
                    of Prüm, and at Soissons Louis not only abdicated, but made public confession of
                    his sins, a long list of which he read aloud. Again the arrogance of Lothair
                    awoke the distrust of his brothers, and they succeeded in reasserting the rights
                    of the emperor, whose sufferings had excited general sympathy. He went through
                    the ceremony of coronation a second time, and Lothair found it necessary to
                    confine himself to Italy. After the death of Pippin in 838 Louis proposed a
                    scheme by which the whole empire, with the exception of Bavaria, would have been
                    divided between Charles and Lothair, to whom the empress had been reconciled.
                    The younger Louis prepared to oppose this injustice, and he was supported by the
                    people of Aquitania in the interest of Pippin’s sons. A diet was summoned at
                    Worms to settle the dispute, but before it met the emperor died on an island in
                    the Rhine near Mainz, on the 20th of June 840. He had capacities which might
                    have made him a great churchman, but as a secular ruler he lacked prudence and
                    vigour, and his mismanagement prepared the way for the destruction of the empire
                    established by his father. His son Lothair I. succeeded to the imperial
                    title.</p>
