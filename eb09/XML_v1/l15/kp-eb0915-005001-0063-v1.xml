                    rend="smallcaps">Carus),</hi> inore than any of the great Roman writers, has
                    acquired a new interest in the present day. This result is due, not so much to a
                    truer perception of the force and· purity of his style, of the majesty and
                    pathos of his poetry, or of the great sincerity of his nature, as to the
                    recognition of the relation of his subject to many of the questions on which
                    speculative curiosity is now engaged. It would be misleading to speak of him, or
                    of the Greek philosophers whose tenets he expounds, as anticipating the more
                    advanced scientific hypotheses of modern times. But it is in his poem that we
                    find the most complete account of the chief effort of the ancient mind to
                    explain the beginning of things, and to understand the course of nature and
                    man’s relation to it. Physical philosophy in the present day is occupied with
                    the same problems as those which are discussed in the first two books of the <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Perum Natura.</hi> The renewed curiosity
                    as to the origin of life, the primitive condition of man, <hi rend="superscript"
                    > i,</hi> nd his progressive advance to civilization finds an attraction in the
                    treatment of the same subjects in the fifth book. The old war between science
                    and theology, which has been revived in the present generation, is fought,
                    though with different weapons, yet in the same ardent and uncompromising spirit
                    throughout the whole poem, as it is in the writings of living thinkers. In
                    comparing the controversies of the present day with those of which we find the
                    record in Lucretius, we are reminded of the poet’s own description of the war of
                    elements in the world,—</p>
                <p>“Denique, tantopere inter se cum maxima mundi Pugnent membra, pio nequaquam
                    concita bello, Nonne vides aliquam longi certaminis ollis Posse dari finem
                    ?”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“In fine, as the
                    mightiest members of the world are battling fiercely together in an unhallowed
                    feud, seest thou not that some end of the long warfare may be reached by them
                    ?”</p></note></p>
                <p>But this concurrence with the stream of speculation in. the present day is really
                    the least of his permanent claims on the attention of the world. His position
                    both among ancient and modern writers is unique. No one else combines in the
                    same degree the contemplative enthusiasm of a philosopher, the earnest purpose
                    of a reformer and moral teacher, and the profound pathos and sense of beauty of
                    a great poet. He stands alone among his countrymen as much in the ardour with
                    which he observes and reasons on the processes of nature as in the elevation of
                    feeling with which he recognizes the majesty of her laws, and the vivid sympathy
                    with which he interprets the manifold variety of her life. It would have been an
                    instructive study to have traced some connexion between his personal
                    circumstances and the intellectual and moral position which he holds. We
                    naturally ask what influence of teachers in Rome or Athens first attracted him
                    to this study and observation of natural phenomena, what early impressions or
                    experience gave so sombre a colouring to his view of life, how far the delight,
                    so strange in an ancient Roman, which he seems to find in a kind of recluse
                    communion with nature, and the spirit of pathetic or indignant satire in which
                    he treats the more violent phases of passion and the more extravagant modes of
                    luxury, was a recoil from the fascination of pleasures in which his
                    contemporaries and equals freely indulged. We should like also to know how far
                    the serene heights which he professed to have attained procured him exemption
                    from or alleviation of the actual sorrows of life. But such questions, suggested
                    by the strong interest which the impress of personal feeling and character
                    stamped on the poem awakens in the reader, can only be raised; there are no
                    ascertained facts by which they can be settled. There is no ancient poet, with
                    the exception of Homer, of whose history so little is positively known. Unlike
                    Catullus, Horace, Virgil, Cicero, Tacitus, and nearly all the great Roman
                    writers, he is absolutely silent on the subject of his own position and
                    fortunes. Nor is this silence compensated by any personal reference to him in
                    the works of his two eminent contemporaries by whom the social life of their age
                    is so amply illustrated, Cicero and Catullus, although it is certain that each
                    of them read his poem almost immediately after it was given to the world. The
                    great poets of the following ages were influenced by his genius, but they tell
                    us nothing as to his career. So consistently does he seem to have followed the
                    maxim of his master, “Pass through life unnoticed,” and to have realized, in the
                    midst of the excited political, intellectual, and social life of the last years
                    of the republic, the ideal of those “who do not wish to be known even while
                    living.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>" Quoted from

                <p>Our sole information concerning his life is found in the brief summary of Jerome,

                    inaccurately, the accounts contained in the lost work of Suetonius <hi
                    rend="italic">De Kiris Ill·ustribus.</hi> But that work was written about two
                    centuries after the death of Lucretius; and, although it is likely that
                    Suetonius used the information transmitted by earlier grammarians, there is
                    nothing to guide us to the original sources from which the tradition concerning
                    the life of Lucretius was derived. The strange character of the story which has
                    been transmitted to us, and the want of any support to it from external
                    evidence, oblige us to receive it with a certain reserve.</p>
                <p>According to this account the poet was born in the year 94 B.c.; he became mad
                    (“in furorem versus”) in consequence of the administration of a love-philtre;
                    and after composing several books in his lucid intervals, which were
                    subsequently corrected by Cicero, he died by his own hand in the forty-fourth
                    year of his age. The statement of Donatus in his life of Virgil, a work also
                    based on the lost work of Suetonius, that Lucretius died on the 15th of October
                    55 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the same day on which Virgil assumed the <hi
                    rend="italic">toga virHis</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> is
                    inconsistent either with the date assigned for the poet’s birth or with the age
                    at which he is said to have died. A single mention of the poem (which from the
                    condition in which it has reached us may be assumed to have been published
                    posthumously) in a letter of Cicero’s, written early in 54 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> is confirmatory of the date given by Donatus as that of the poet’s
                    death. Similar errors in chronology are common in the summaries of Jerome; and,
                    where there is an inconsistency between the date assigned for the birth of any
                    author and the age at which he is said to have died (as, for instance, in the
                    case of Catullus), there are grounds for believing that the error lies in the
                    first date. Taking the statements of Donatus and of Jerome together, we may
                    consider it probable that Lucretius died in the October of 55 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> in the forty-fourth year of his age, and that he was
                    born either late in the year 99 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> or early in the
                    year 98 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> He would thus be about seven years
                    younger than Cicero, a year or two younger than Julius Caesar, about the same
                    age as Memmius, to whom the poem is dedicated, and about fifteen years older
                    than Catullus and Calvus, the younger poets of his generation, from whom he is
                    widely separated both by his more archaic style and rhythm and by the greater
                    seriousness of his art and the more earnest dignity of his character. The other
                    statements of Jerome have been questioned or disbelieved on the ground of their
                    intrinsic improbability. They have been regarded as a fiction invented in a
                    later time by the enemies of Epicureanism, with the view of discrediting the
                    most powerful work ever produced by any disciple of that sect. It is more in
                    conformity with ancient credulity than with modern science to attribute a
                    permanent tendency to derangement to the accidental administration of any drug,
                    however potent. A work characterized by such strength, consistency, and
                    continuity of thought is not likely to have been composed “per intervalla
                    insaniae.” Donatus, in mentioning the poet’s death, gives no hint of the act of
                    suicide. The poets of the Augustan age, who were deeply interested both in his
                    philosophy and his poetry, are entirely silent about the tragical story of his
                    life, Cicero, by his professed antagonism to the doctrines of Epicurus, by his
                    inadequate appreciation of Lucretius himself, and by the indifference which he
                    shows to other contemporary poets, seems to have been neither fitted for the
                    task of correcting the unfinished work of a writer whose genius was so distinct
                    from his own, nor likely to have cordially undertaken such a task.</p>
                <p>Yet these considerations do not lead to the absolute rejection of the story as a
                    pure invention of a hostile and uncritical age. The evidence afforded by the
                    poem rather leads to the conclusion that the tradition contains some germ of
                    fact. We need not attach any importance to the supposed efficacy of the
                    love-philtre in producing mental alienation, nor are we called upon to think of
                    Lucretius as one liable to recurring fits of insanity, in the ordinary sense of
                    the word. But it is remarkable, as was first observed by Mr Munro, his English
                    editor, that in more than one passage of his poem he writes with extraordinary
                    vividness of the impression produced both by dreams and by waking visions. It is
                    true that the philosophy of Epicurus put great stress on these, as affording the
                    explanation of the origin of supernatural beliefs. But the insistence with which
                    Lucretius returns to the subject, and the horror with which he recalls the
                    effects of such abnormal phenomena, suggest the inference that he himself may
                    have been liable to such hallucinations, which are said to be consistent with
                    perfect sanity, though they may be the precursors either of madness or of a
                    state of despair and melancholy which often ends in suicide.<note

                    dreams, on his task of inquiry and composition, produce the impression of an
                    unrelieved strain of mind and feeling, which may have ended in some extreme
                    reaction of spirit, or in some failure of intellectual power, from the
                    consciousness of which he may, in accordance with examples which he himself
                    quotes, have taken refuge in suicide. But the strongest confirmation of the
                    existence of some germ of fact in the tradition is found in the unfinished
                    condition in which the poem has reached us. The subject appears indeed to have
                    been fully treated in accordance with the plan sketched out in the introduction
                    to the first book. But that book is the only one which is finished in style and
                    in the arrangement of its matter. In all the others, and especially in the last
                    three, the continuity of the argument is frequently broken by passages which
                    must have been inserted after the first draft of the arguments was written out.
                    Thus, for instance, in his account of the transition from savage to civilized
                    life, he assumes at v. 1011 the discovery of the use of skins, fire, &lt;fcc.,
                    and the first beginning of civil society, and proceeds at 1028 to explain the
                    origin of language, and then again returns, from 1090 to 1160, to speculate upon
                    the first use of fire and the earliest stages of political life. These breaks in
                    the continuity of the argument show what might also be inferred from frequent
                    repetitions of lines which have appeared earlier in the poem, and from the rough
                    workmanship of passages in the later books, that the poem could not have
                    received the final revision of the author, and must have been given to the world
                    by some editor after his death. Nor is there any great difficulty in believing
                    that that editor was Cicero. It is not necessary to press the meaning of the
                    word “emendavit” as applied to the task fulfilled by him. Cicero certainly was
                    incapable of “improving” any of the poetry of Lucretius, and the slight mention
                    which he makes of the poem in a letter to his brother (“the poem of Lucretius
                    is, as you describe it, a work not of much genius but of much art”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The reading is so uncertain
                    that it is doubtful whether it is the claim of genius or of art that Cicero
                    refuses to concede. Some interpretations of the passage imply that he conceded
                    both.</p></note>) seems to imply that he was not very capable of appreciating
                    it. But other motives, besides appreciation of the poet’s genius or sympathy
                    with his doctrines, may have induced <pb break="no"

                    successfully performed. It may be remarked further that scepticism as to
                    statements about their lives is less warranted in the case of the great Roman
                    than of the great Greek writers, from the fact that the work of criticism went
                    on at Rome contemporaneously with the progress of original creation, and that
                    the line of grammarians and commentators by whom these statements were
                    transmitted continued unbroken almost from the first beginning of Latin
                    literature.</p>
                <p>We find in the instance of nearly all the other Latin poets, even of the most
                    obscure among them, that their birthplace has been recorded, and it has often
                    been remarked that Latin poetry was an Italian and provincial rather than a
                    purely Roman product. From the absence of any claim on the part of any other
                    district of Italy to the honour of having given birth to Lucretius it is
                    inferred that he was an exception to the rule, and was of purely Roman origin.
                    No writer certainly is more purely Roman in personal character and in strength
                    of understanding. He seems to speak of Rome as his native state in such
                    expressions as “patriai tempore iniquo,” “patrii sermonis egestas,” and “patriis
                    chartis.” His silence on the subject of Roman greatness and glory as contrasted
                    with the prominence of these subjects in the poetry of men of provincial birth
                    such as Ennius, Virgil, and Horace, may be explained by the principle that the
                    familiarity of long-inherited traditions had made the subject one of less wonder
                    and novelty to him. The Lucretian <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> to which he
                    belonged was one of the oldest of the great Roman houses, nor do we hear of the
                    name, as we do of other great family names, as being diffused over other parts
                    of Italy, or as designating men of obscure or servile origin. It seems from the
                    evidence of the name, confirmed by the tone in which he writes, as probable as
                    any such inference can be that Lucretius was a member of the Roman aristocracy,
                    belonging either to a senatorian or to one of the great equestrian families,
                    living in easy circumstances, and familiar with the spectacle of luxury and
                    artistic enjoyment which the great houses of Rome and the great country houses
                    in the most beautiful parts of Italy presented. If the Roman aristocracy of his
                    time had lost much of the virtue and of the governing qualities of their
                    ancestors, they showed in the last years before the establishment of monarchy a
                    taste for intellectual culture which might have made Rome as great in literature
                    as in arms and law, if the republic could have continued. The discussions which
                    Cicero puts in the mouth of Velleius, Cotta, &lt;fcc., indicate the new taste
                    for philosophy developed among members of the governing class during the youth
                    of Lucretius; and we hear of eminent Greek teachers of the Epicurean sect being
                    settled at Rome at the same time, and living on terms of intimacy with them. The
                    inference that Lucretius belonged to this class, and shared in the liberal
                    culture which it received, is confirmed by the tone in which he addresses
                    Memmius, a man of an eminent senatorian family, and of considerable oratorical
                    and poetical accomplishment, to whom the poem is dedicated. His tone to Memmius
                    is quite unlike that in which Virgil or even Horace addresses Maecenas. He
                    addresses him as an equal; he expresses sympathy with the prominent part his
                    friend played in public life, and admiration for his varied accomplishment, but
                    on his own subject claims to speak to him in the tones of authority.</p>
                <p>Although our conception of the poet’s life and circumstances is necessarily vague
                    and meagre, yet his personal force is so remarkable and so vividly impressed on
                    his poem, and his language bears so unmistakably the stamp of sincerity, that we
                    seem able to form a consistent idea of his tastes and habits, his sympathies and
                    convictions, his moral and emotional nature. If we know nothing of the
                    particular experience which determined his passionate adherence to the Epicurean
                    creed and his attitude of spiritual and social isolation from the ordinary
                    course of Roman life and belief, we can at least say that the choice of a
                    contemplative life was not the result of indifference to the fate of the world,
                    or of any natural coldness or even calmness of temperament. In some of his most
                    powerful poetry, as in the opening lines of the second and of the third books,
                    we can mark the strong recoil of a humane and sensitive spirit from the horrors
                    of the reign of terror which he witnessed in his youth, and from the anarchy and
                    confusion which prevailed at Rome during the later years of his life; while his
                    vivid realization of the pains and disappointments of passion, of the
                    unsatisfying nature of all violent emotion, and of the restlessness and
                    weariness of life which excessive luxury entails, suggest at least the inference
                    that he had not been through his whole career so much estranged from the social
                    life of his day as he seems to have been in his later years. Passages in his
                    poem attest his familiarity with the pomp and luxury of city life, with the
                    attractions of the public games, and with the pageantry of great military
                    spectacles. But much the greater mass of the illustrations of his philosophy
                    scattered through the poem indicate that, while engaged in its composition, and
                    in the studies preparatory to it, he must have lived in the country or by the
                    sea-shore, and that he must have passed much of his time in the open air,
                    exercising at once the keen observation of a naturalist and the contemplative
                    vision of a poet. He shows a fellow feeling with the habits and moods of the
                    animals associated with human toil and adventure. He seems to have found a
                    pleasure, more congenial to the modern than to the ancient temperament, in
                    ascending mountains or wandering among their solitudes (vi. 469, iv. 575).
                    References to companionship in these wanderings, and the well-known description
                    of the charm of a rustic meal (ii. 29) enjoyed with comrades amid beautiful
                    scenery and in fine weather, speak of kindly sociality rather than of any
                    austere separation from his fellows.</p>
                <p>Other expressions in his poem <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> iii. 10, &lt;fcc.)
                    imply that he was an ardent student of books, as well as a sympathetic observer
                    of outward phenomena. Foremost among these were the writings of his master
                    Epicurus; but he had also an intimate knowledge and appreciation of the
                    philosophical poem of Empedocles, and at least an acquaintance with the works of
                    Democritus, Anaxagoras, Heraclitus, Plato, and the Stoical writers. Of other
                    Greek prose writers he knew Thucydides and Hippocrates; while of the poets he
                    expresses in more than one passage the highest admiration of Homer, whom he has
                    imitated in several places. Next to Homer Euripides is most frequently
                    reproduced by him. There is an evident struggle between the impulses of his
                    imaginative temperament, prompting him to recognize the supremacy of the great
                    masters in art and poetry, and the influence of the teaching of Epicurus, in
                    accordance with which the old poets and painters of Greece are condemned as the
                    authors and propagators of false ideas both of nature and the gods. But his
                    poetical sympathy was not limited to the poets of Greece. For his own countryman
                    Ennius he expresses an affectionate admiration; and he imitates his language,
                    his rhythm, and his manner in many places. The fragments of the old tragedian
                    Pacuvius and of the satirist Lucilius show that Lucretius had made use of their
                    expressions and materials. In his studies he was attracted by the older writers,
                    both Greek and Roman, in whose masculine temperament and understanding he
                    recognized an affinity with his own. He had a most enthusiastic admiration foι
                    genius, especially when exercised in the investigation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n66/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0066-0053"/> and discovery of truth. His devotion to Epicurus
                    seems at first sight more difficult to explain than his enthusiasm for
                    Empedocles or Ennius. Probably he found in his calmness of temperament, in his
                    natural or acquired indifference to all violent emotion, even in his want of
                    imagination, a sense of rest and of exemption from the disturbing influences of
                    life which the passionate heart of the poet denied himself; while in his
                    physical philosophy he found both an answer to the questions which perplexed him
                    and an inexhaustible stimulus to his intellectual curiosity. The combative
                    energy, the sense of superiority, the spirit of satire, characteristic of him as
                    a Roman, unite with his loyalty to Epicurus to render him not only polemical but
                    intolerant and contemptuous in his tone toward the great antagonists of his
                    system, the Stoics, whom, while constantly referring to them, he does not
                    condescend even to name. With his admiration of the genius of others he combines
                    a strong sense of his own power. He is quite conscious of the great importance
                    and of the difficulty of his task; but he feels his own ability to cope with it.
                    He has the keenest capacity for intellectual pleasure, and speaks of the
                    constant charm which he found both in the collection of his materials and in the
                    exercise of his art. If his mind was overstrained by the incessant devotion to
                    his task of which he speaks, he allows no expression of fatigue or
                    discouragement to escape from him. The ardour of study, the delight in
                    contemplative thought, the “sweet love of the muses,” the “great hope of fame,”
                    all combined to bear him buoyantly through all the difficulties and fatigues of
                    his long and lonely adventure.</p>
                <p>It is more difficult to infer the moral thin the intellectual characteristics of
                    a great writer from the personal impress left by him on his work. Yet it is not
                    too much to say that there is no work in any literature that produces a
                    profounder impression of sincerity. No writer shows a juster scorn of all mere
                    rhetoric and exaggeration. This is one of the main causes of the spell which the
                    poem exercises over us. By no Stoic even could the doctrine of independence of
                    the world, and of the superiority of simplicity over show and luxury, be more
                    forcibly and consistently inculcated. No one shows truer courage, not marred by
                    irreverence, in confronting the great problems of human destiny, or greater
                    strength in triumphing over human weakness. No one shows a truer humanity and a
                    more tender sympathy with natural sorrow. In reverence for the sanctities of
                    human affection, Virgil alone is his equal, nor is it an unlikely surmise that
                    it was to the power of this sentiment, and the influence which it had on his
                    relation with others, that he owed the <hi rend="italic">cognomen</hi> of
                    “Carus”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Martha, <hi rend="italic">Le Poërne de Lucrèce,</hi> p.
                    28</p></note> or the “beloved.”</p>
                <p>The peculiarity of the poem of Lucretius, that which makes it unique in
                    literature, is that it is a reasoned system of philosophy, written in verse. The
                    subject was chosen and the method of exposition adopted, not primarily with the
                    idea of moving and satisfying the imagination, but of communicating truth. The
                    prosaic title <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Herum Natura,</hi> a
                    translation of the Greek τr∈pι &lt;∕&gt;υσεως, implies the subordination of the
                    artistic to a speculative motive. As in the case of nearly all the great works
                    of Roman literary genius, the form of the poem was borrowed from the Greeks. The
                    rise of speculative philosophy in Greece was coincident with the beginning of
                    prose composition, and many of the earliest philosophers gave their thoughts to
                    the world in the prose of the Ionic dialect; others however, and especially the
                    writers of the Greek colonies in Italy and Sicily, expounded their systems in
                    continuous poems composed in the epic hexameter. These writers flourished in the
                    beginning and first half of the 5th century B.c.,—the great awakening time of
                    the intellectual, imaginative, and artistic faculties of the ancient world. The
                    names most famous in connexion with this kind of poetry are those of Xenophanes
                    and Parmenides, the Eleatics, and that of Empedocles of Agrigentum. The last was
                    less important as a philosopher, but greater than the others both as a poet and
                    a physicist. On both of these grounds he had a greater attraction to Lucretius.
                    The fragments of the poem of Empedocles show that the Roman poet regarded that
                    work as his model. In accordance with this model he has given to his own poem
                    the form of a personal address, he has developed his argument systematically,
                    and has applied the sustained impetus of epic poetry to the treatment of some of
                    the driest and abstruses! topics. Many ideas and expressions of the Sicilian
                    have been reproduced by the Roman poet; and the same tone of impassioned
                    solemnity and melancholy seems to have pervaded both works. But Lucretius, if
                    less original as a thinker, was probably a much greater poet than Empedocles.
                    With the speculative enthusiasm of the Greeks he combines, in a remarkable
                    measure, the Italian susceptibility to the charm of nature, and the greater
                    humanity of feeling which belongs to a more advanced stage of human history. But
                    what chiefly distinguishes him from his Greek prototypes is that his purpose is
                    rather ethical than purely speculative. He shares with them the delight in
                    inquiry and discovery; but the zeal of a teacher and reformer is more strong in
                    him than even the intellectual passion of a thinker. His speculative ideas, his
                    moral teaching, and his poetical power are indeed interdependent on one another,
                    and this interdependence is what mainly constitutes their power and interest.
                    But of the three claims which he makes to immortality,—</p>
                <p>“Primum quod magnis doceo de rebus, et artis Religionum animum nodis exsolvere
                    pergo, Deinde quod obscura de re tam lucida pango Carmina musaeo contingens
                    cuncta lepore,—”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“First,
                    by reason of the greatness of my argument, and my purpose to set free the mind
                    from the close drawn bonds of superstitions; next, because on so dark a theme I
                    write such lucid verse, casting over all the charm of poesy.”</p></note> that
                    which he himself regarded as supreme was the second, — the claim of a liberator
                    of the human spirit from the cramping bonds of superstition.</p>
                <p>This purpose is announced by him over and over again, as for instance at the
                    beginning of the argument in the first, second, third, and sixth bocks. The main
                    idea of the poem is the irreconcilable opposition between the truth of the laws
                    of nature and the falsehood of the old superstitions. But it is not merely by
                    the intellectual opposition between truth and falsehood that he is moved. The
                    happiness and the dignity of life are regarded by him as absolutely dependent on
                    the acceptance of the true and the rejection of the false doctrine. The ground
                    of his extravagant eulogies of Epicurus is that he recognized in him the first
                    great champion in the war of liberation, and in his system of philosophy he
                    believed that he had found the weapons by which this war could be most
                    effectually waged. Following in his footsteps, he sets before himself the aim of
                    finally crushing that fear of the gods and that fear of death resulting from it
                    which he regards as the source of all the human ills. Incidentally he desires
                    also to purify the heart from other violent passions which corrupt it and mar
                    its peace. But the source even of these—the passions of ambition and avarice—he
                    finds in the fear of death; and that fear he resolves into the fear of eternal
                    punishment after death.</p>
                <p>The selection of his subject and the order in which it is treated are determined
                    by this motive. Although the title <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n67/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0067-0054"/> of the poem implies that it is a treatise on the
                    “whole nature of things,” the aim of Lucretius is not to treat exhaustively the
                    whole of natural science, recognized in the Epicurean system, but only those
                    branches of it which are necessary to clear the mind from the fear of the gods
                    and the terrors of a future state. In the two earliest books, accordingly, he
                    lays down and largely illustrates the first principles of being with the view of
                    showing that the world is not governed by capricious agency, but has come into
                    existence, continues in existence, and will ultimately pass away in accordance
                    with the primary conditions of the elemental atoms which, along with empty
                    space, are the only eternal and immutable substances. These atoms are themselves
                    infinite in number but limited in their varieties, and by their ceaseless
                    movement and combinations during infinite time and through infinite space the
                    whole process of creation is maintained. In the third book hé applies the
                    principles of the atomic philosophy to explain the nature of the mind and vital
                    principle, with the view of showing that the soul perishes with the body. In the
                    fourth book he discusses the Epicurean doctrine of the “simulacra,” or images,
                    which are cast from all bodies, and which act either on the senses or
                    immediately on the mind, in dreams or waking visions, as affording the
                    explanation of the belief in the continued existence of the spirits of the
                    departed. The fifth book, which has the most general interest, professes to
                    explain the process by which the earth, the sea, the sky, the sun, moon, and
                    stars, were formed, the origin of life, and the gradual advance of man from the
                    most savage to the most civilized condition. All these topics are treated with
                    the view of showing that the world is not itself divine nor directed by divine
                    agency. The sixth book is devoted to the explanation, in accordance with natural
                    causes, of some of the more abnormal phenomena, such as thunderstorms,
                    volcanoes, earthquakes, &amp;c., which are special causes of supernatural
                    terrors.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible, within the limits of this article, to give any detailed
                    account or criticism of an argument which is carried on, with the interruption
                    only of occasional episodes, in which the moral teaching of the poet is
                    enforced, through a poem extending to between six and seven thousand lines.
                    Readers who are especially interested in the science of Lucretius will find the
                    subject clearly treated in chapter v. of Lange’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Materialism.</hi> The consecutive study of the argument produces on most readers
                    a mixed feeling of dissatisfaction and admiration. They are repelled by the
                    dryness of much of the matter, the unsuitableness of many of the topics
                    discussed for poetic treatment, the arbitrary assumption of premisses, the
                    entire failure to establish the connexion between the concrete phenomena which
                    the author professes to explain and these assumptions, and the erroneousness of
                    many of the doctrines which are stated with dogmatic confidence. On the other
                    hand they are constantly impressed by his po∖ver of reasoning both deductively
                    and inductively, by the subtlety and fertility of invention with which he
                    applies analogies, by the clearness and keenness of his observation, by the
                    fulness of matter with which his mind is stored, and by the consecutive force,
                    the precision, and distinctness of his style, when employed in the processes of
                    scientific exposition. The first two books enable us better than anything else
                    in ancient literature to appreciate the boldness and, on the whole, the
                    reasonableness of the ancient mind in forming hypotheses on great matters that
                    still baffle the investigations of science. The third and fourth books give
                    evidence of acuteness in psychological analysis; the fourth and sixth of the
                    most active and varied observation of natural phenomena; the fifth of original
                    insight and strong common sense in conceiving the origin of society and the
                    progressive advance of man to civilization. But the chief value of Lucretius as
                    a thinker lies in his firm grasp of speculative ideas, and in his application of
                    them to the interpretation of human life and nature. It is in this application
                    that the most powerful interest of his poetry lies. All pheno mena, moral as
                    well as material, are contemplated by him in their relation to one great organic
                    whole, which he acknowledges under the name of “Natura daedala rerum,” and the
                    most beneficent manifestations of which he seems to symbolize and almost to
                    deify in the “Alma Venus,” whom, in apparent contradiction to his denial of a
                    divine interference with human affairs, he invokes with prayer in the opening
                    lines of the poem. In this conception of nature are united the conceptions of
                    law and order, of ever-changing life and interdependence, of immensity,
                    individuality, and all-pervading subtlety, under which the universe is
                    apprehended both by his intelligence and his imagination.</p>
                <p>Nothing can be more unlike the religious and moral attitude of Lucretius than the
                    old popular conception of him as an atheist and a preacher of the doctrine of
                    pleasure. It is true that he denies the two bases of all religion, the doctrines
                    of a supernatural government of the world and of a future life. But his
                    arguments against the first are really only valid against the limited and
                    unworthy conceptions of divine agency involved in the ancient religions; his
                    denial of the second is prompted by his vivid realization of all that is meant
                    by the arbitrary infliction of eternal torment after death. His war with the
                    popular beliefs of his time is waged, not in the interests of licence, but in
                    vindication of the sanctity of human feeling. The great and cardinal line of the
                    poem,</p>
                <p>“Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum,”</p>
                <p>is elicited from him as his protest against the wicked and impious sacrifice of
                    Iphigenia by the hand of her father. But in his very denial of a cruel, limited,
                    and capricious agency of the gods, and in his imaginative recognition of an
                    orderly, all-pervading, all-regulating power,—the “Natura daedala rerum,”—we
                    find at least a nearer approach to the higher conceptions of modern theism than
                    in any of the other imaginative conceptions of ancient poetry and art, unless we
                    include the hymn of Cleanthes among the utterances of poets. But his conception
                    even of the ancient gods and of their indirect influence on human life is more
                    worthy than the popular one. They are conceived of by him as living a life of
                    eternal peace and exemption from passion, in a world of their own; and the
                    highest ideal of man is, through the exercise of his reason, to realize an image
                    of this life,</p>
                <p>“Ut nil impediat dignam dis degere vitam.”</p>
                <p>Although they are conceived of as unconcerned with the interests of our world,
                    yet influences are supposed to emanate from them which the human heart is
                    capable of receiving and assimilating. The effect of unworthy conceptions of the
                    divine nature is that they render a man incapable of visiting the temples of the
                    gods in a calm spirit, or of receiving the emanations “divinae nuntia pacis” in
                    peaceful tranquillity.</p>
                <p>“Nec delubra deum placido cum pectore adibis, Nec de corpore quae sancto
                    simulacra feruntur In mentis hominum divinae nuntia pacis Suscipere haec animi
                    tranquilla pace valebis.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“Nor wilt thou approach the temples of the gods with a calm spirit, nor wilt
                    thou be able, in tranquil peace of heart, to receive those images which are
                    borne from their holy bodies into the minds of men, carrying tidings of the
                    divine peace” (vi. 75-78).</p></note></p>
                <p>It is in no iconoclastic spirit that he regards even the temples and solemn rites
                    of the gods, except when he finds the acts of worship tainted with “the foul
                    stain of super·</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n68/mode/1up"

                <p>stition.” Thus he describes with a grave solemnity of feeling the procession of
                    the image of Cybele through the cities of men, and acknowledges the beneficent
                    influence of the truths symbolized by that procession. The supposed “atheism” of
                    Lucretius proceeds from a more deeply reverential spirit than that of the
                    majority of professed believers in all times.</p>
                <p>His moral attitude is also far removed from that either of ordinary ancient
                    Epicureanism or ordinary modern materialism. Though he acknowledges pleasure to
                    be the law of life,—“dux vitae dia voluptas,”—yet he is far from regarding its
                    attainment as the end of life. What man needs is not enjoyment, but “peace and a
                    pure heart.”</p>
                <p>‘ ’ At bene non poterat sine puro pectore vivi.”</p>
                <p>The victory to be won by man is the triumph over fear, ambition, passion, luxury.
                    With the conquest over these nature herself supplies all that is needed for
                    happiness. Self-control and renunciation are the lessons which he preaches with
                    as much fervour and as real conviction as any of the preachers of Stoicism.
                    “Great riches consist in living plainly with a contented spirit ”—</p>
                <p>“Divitiae grandes homini sunt vivere parce Aequo animo.”</p>
                <p>As was mentioned above, it is uncertain whether the short criticism of Cicero
                    (“Lucretii poemata,” &lt;tc.) concedes to Lucretius the gifts of genius or the
                    accomplishment of art. Readers of a later time, who could compare his work with
                    the finished works of the Augustan age, would, if they refused his claim to the
                    full possession of the two necessary constituents of the greatest poets, have
                    certainly disparaged his art rather than his power. But with Cicero it was
                    different. He greatly admired, or professed to admire, the genius of the early
                    Roman poets, while he shows that indifference to the poetical genius of his
                    younger contemporaries which men who have formed their taste for poetry in
                    youth, and whose own intellectual interests have been practical and political,
                    often do to the new ideas and new modes of feeling which an original poet brings
                    into the world. On the other hand, as one who had himself written many verses in
                    his youth, and as one of the greatest masters of style who have ever lived, he
                    could not have been insensible to the immense superiority in rhythmical
                    smoothness which the hexameter of Lucretius has over that of Ennius and
                    Lucilius. And no reader of Lucretius can doubt that he attached the greatest
                    importance to artistic execution, and that he took a great pleasure, not only in
                    propelling “the long roll of his hexameter” to its culminating break at the
                    conclusion of some weighty paragraph, but also in producing the effects of
                    alliteration, assonance, &amp;c., which are so marked a peculiarity in the style
                    of Plautus and the earlier Roman poets. He allows his taste for these tricks of
                    style, which, when used with moderation by writers of a more finished sense of
                    art such as Virgil and even Terence, have the happiest effect, to degenerate
                    into mannerism. And this is the only drawback to the impression of absolute
                    spontaneity which his style produces. But those who recognize in him one of the
                    most powerful and original poetical forces which have appeared in the world
                    feel, when they compare him with the greatest poets of all times, that he was
                    unfortunate in living before the natural rudeness of Latin art—the “traces of
                    the country,” which continued to linger “in rude Latium” down to the time of
                    Horace—had been successfully grappled with. His only important precursors in
                    serious poetry were Ennius and Lucilius, and, though he derived from the first
                    of these an impulse to shape the Latin tongue into a fitting vehicle for the
                    expression of elevated emotion and imaginative conception, he could find in
                    neither a guide to follow in the task he set before himself. He had thus, in a
                    great measure, to discover the way for himself, and to act as the pioneer to
                    those who came after him. The difficulty and novelty of his task enhances our
                    sense of his power. His finest passages are thus characterized by a freshness of
                    feeling and enthusiasm of discovery, as of one ascending, alone and for the
                    first time, the “pathless heights of the Muses.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Avia Pieridum peragro loca, nullius ante
                    Trita solo.”</p></note> But the result of these conditions and of his own
                    inadequate conception of the proper limits of his art is that more than in the
                    case of any other work of genius his best poetry is clogged with a great mass of
                    alien matter, which no treatment in the world could have made poetically
                    endurable. If the distinction suggested by a brilliant living poet and critic
                    between the Titans and the Olympians of literature be a valid one, it is among
                    the former certainly that Lucretius is to be classed.</p>
                <p>The genius of Lucretius, as of all the greatest poets, does not reveal itself as
                    any mere isolated or exceptional faculty, but as the impassioned and imaginative
                    movement of his whole moral and intellectual being. It is the force through
                    which the sincerity and simplicity, the reverence, the courage, the whole heart
                    of the man have found an outlet for themselves. It is also the force from which
                    both his speculative and his observant faculty derive their most potent impulse.
                    His poetical style is as simple, sensuous, and passionate as that of the poets
                    who reproduce only the immediate appearances.and impressions of the world of
                    nature and of human feeling. But it assumes a more majestic and elevated tone
                    from the recognition of the truth that the beauty of the world, the unceasing
                    life and movement in nature, the destructive as well as the beneficent forces of
                    the elements, the whole wonder and pathos of human existence, are themselves
                    manifestations of secret invisible agencies and of eternal and immutable
                    laws.</p>
                <p>The fullest account of the MSS. and of the various editions of Lucretius, and of
                    the influence which he exercised on the later poets of Rome, is to be found in
                    the introductions to the critical and explanatory notes of Mr Munro’s edition of
                    the poet, a work recognized as the most important contribution to Latin
                    scholarship made in England during the present century. For scholars that
                    edition contains all that is needed for the full understanding of the author.
                    For those who are not classical scholars, the work of C. Martha, <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Po'éme de Lucrèce,</hi> may be recommended, as containing an
                    interesting and eloquent estimate of the genius of the poet, and of his moral,
                    religious, and scientific position. Among recent English works on the author, an
                    essay, by Professor Veitch, and one by Mr J. A. Symonds, are especially good.
                    The subject is also discussed at length in chaps, xi,-xiv. of the <hi
