                <p><label type="entry">LYCANTHROPY</label> is a term used comprehensively to
                    indicate a belief, firmly rooted among all savages, and lingering in the form of
                    traditional superstition among peoples comparatively civilized, that men are in
                    certain circumstances transformed temporarily or permanently into wolves and
                    other inferior animals. In the European history of this singular belief, wolf
                    transformations appear as by far the most prominent and most frequently
                    recurring instances of alleged metamorphosis, and consequently in most European
                    languages the terms expressive of the general doctrine have a special reference
                    to the wolf. Examples of this are found in the Greek <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">oboroten</hi>; Scandinavian, <hi rend="italic">hamrammr;</hi>
                    English, <hi rend="italic">turnskin, turncoat)</hi> are sufficiently numerous to
                    furnish some evidence that the class of animals into which metamorphosis was
                    possible was not viewed as a restricted one. It is simply because the old
                    English general terms have been long diverted from their original signification
                    that the word “lycanthropy” has recently been adopted in our language in the
                    enlarged sense in which it has been defined above.</p>
                <p>There are two unfailing characteristics of lycanthropous belief :—(1) there can
                    nowhere be a living belief in contemporary metamorphosis into any animal which
                    has ceased to exist in the particular locality; (2) belief in metamorphosis into
                    the animal most prominent in any locality itself acquires a special prominence.
                    These characteristics apart, the phenomena of lycanthropy exhibit a very
                    considerable diversity in their nature.</p>
                <p>Throughout the greater part of Europe the were-wolf is preferred on the
                    principles just noted. There are old traditions of his existence in England, in
                    Wales, and in Ireland. In southern France, the Netherlands, Germany, Lithuania,
                    Bulgaria, Servia, Bohemia, Poland, and Russia he can hardly be pronounced
                    extinct now. In Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland the bear competes with the
                    wolf for pre-eminence. In Persia the bear is supreme, in Japan the fox; in India
                    the serpent vies with the tiger, in Abyssinia and Bornou the hyaena with the
                    lion, in eastern Africa the lion with the alligator; in western Africa the
                    leopard is perhaps most frequently the form assumed by man, among the Abipones
                    the tiger, among the Arawaks the jaguar, and so on. In none of these cases,
                    however, is the power of transformation limited exclusively to the prominent and
                    dominant animal.</p>
                <p>The most familiar phase of the superstition is also the latest and most
                    sophisticated. It was no belief in mere transformation; the transformation here
                    was accomplished by Satanic agency voluntarily submitted to, and that for the
                    most loathsome ends, in particular for the gratification of a craving for human
                    flesh. “The were-wolves,” writes Richard Verstegan <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Destitution of Decayed Intelligence,</hi> 1628), “are certayne sorcerers, who
                    having annoynted their bodies with an oyntment which they make by the instinct
                    of the devill, and putting on a certayne inchaunted girdle, doe not onely unto
                    the view of others seeme as wolves, but to their owne thinking have both the
                    shape and nature of wolves, so long as they weare the said girdle. And they do
                    dispose themselves as very wolves, in wourry-ing and killing, and most of humane
                    creatures.” Such were the views about lycanthropy current throughout the
                    continent of Europe when Verstegan wrote. France in particular seems to have
                    been infested with were-wolves during the 16th century, and the consequent
                    trials were very numerous. In some of the cases,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    those of the Gandillon family in the Jura, the tailor of Chalons, and Roulet in
                    Angers, all occurring in the year 1598, —there was clear evidence against the
                    accused of murder and cannibalism, but none of association with wolves; in other
                    cases, as that of Gilles Garnier in Dole in 1573, there was clear evidence
                    against some wolf, but none against the accused; in all the cases, with hardly
                    an exception, there was that extraordinary readiness in the accused to confess
                    and even to give circumstantial details of the metamorphosis, which is one of
                    the most inexplicable concomitants of mediaeval witchcraft. Yet, while this
                    lycanthropy fever, both of suspectors and of suspected, was at its height, it
                    was decided in the case of Jean Grenier at Bordeaux, in 1603, that lycanthropy
                    was nothing more than an insane delusion. From this time the <hi rend="italic"
                    >loup-garou</hi> gradually ceased to be regarded as a dangerous heretic, and
                    fell back-into his pre-Christianic position of being simply a “man-wolf-fiend,”
                    as which he still survives among the French peasantry. In Prussia, Livonia, and
                    Lithuania, according to the bishops Glaus Magnus and Majolus, the were-wolves
                    were in the 16th century far more destructive than “true and natural wolves,”
                    and their heterodoxy appears from the assertion that they formed “an accursed
                    college” of those “desirous of innovations contrary to the divine law.” In
                    England, however, where at the beginning of the 17th century the punishment of
                    witchcraft was still zealously prosecuted by James I., the wolf had been so long
                    extinct that that pious monarch was himself able (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Demonologie,</hi> lib. iii.) to regard “warwoolfes” as victims of delusion
                    induced by “a naturali superabundance of melancholie.” Only small creatures,
                    such as the cat, the hare, and the weasel, remained for the malignant sorcerer
                    to transform himself into; but he was firmly believed to avail himself of these
                    agencies. Belief in witch-animals still survives among the uneducated classes in
                    parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>The were-wolves of the Christian dispensation were not, however, all heretics,
                    all viciously disposed towards mankind. “According to Baronius, in the year 617,
                    a number of wolves presented themselves at a monastery, and tore in pieces
                    several friars who entertained heretical opinions. The wolves sent by God tore
                    the sacrilegious thieves of the army of Francesco Maria, duke of Urbino, who had
                    come to sack the treasure of the holy house of Loreto. A wolf guarded and
                    defended from the wild beasts the head of St Edmund the martyr, king of England.
                    St Oddo, abbot of Cluny, assailed in a pilgrimage by foxes, was delivered and
                    escorted by a wolf.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A.
                    de Gubernatis, <hi rend="italic">Zoological Mythology,</hi> 1872, vol. ii. p.
                    145.</p></note> Many of the were-wolves were most innocent and God-fearing
                    persons, who suffered through the witchcraft of others, or simply from an
                    unhappy fate, and who as wolves behaved in a truly touching fashion, fawning
                    upon and protecting their benefactors. Of this sort were the “Bisclaveret” in
                    Marie de France’s poem (c. 1200), the hero of “William and the Were-wolf”
                    (translated from French into English about 1350), and the numerous princes and
                    princesses, knights and ladies, who appear temporarily in beast form in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mahrcheη</hi> of the Aryan nations generally. Nay the power of
                    transforming others into wild beasts was attributed not only to’malignant
                    sorcerers, but also to Christian saints. “Omnes angeli, boni et mali, ex virtute
                    naturali habent <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0103-0090"/> potestatem transmutandi corpora nostra,” was the
                    dictum of St Thomas Aquinas. A Russian story tells how the apostles Peter and
                    Paul turned an impious husband and wife into bears; St Patrick transformed
                    Vereticus, king of Wales, into a wolf; and St Natalis cursed an illustrious
                    Irish family, with the result that each member of it was doomed to be a wolf for
                    seven years. In other tales the divine agency is still more direct, while in
                    Russia, again, men are supposed to become were-wolves through incurring the
                    wrath of the devil.</p>
                <p>There is thus an orthodox as well as a heterodox werewolf; and, if a survey be
                    taken of the lycanthropous beliefs of non-Christian peoples, this distinction
                    among shapechangers will be equally obvious. The gods of ancient mythology,
                    Hindu, Persian, Greek, and Teutonic, had an apparently unlimited power of
                    assuming animal forms. These gods, moreover, constantly employed themselves in
                    changing men and women into beasts, sometimes in punishment of crime, sometimes
                    out of compassion, and sometimes from pure voluptuousness. Thus Kabandha was
                    changed by Indra into a monster, Trisanku by the sons of Vasishtha into a bear,
                    Lycaon by Zeus into a wolf, Callisto into a bear, Io into a heifer; the enemies
                    of Odin became boars, and so on. It is admittedly difficult to trace the
                    original meaning of these legends, but the alleged metamorphosis of a god is at
                    times clearly associated with his worship under the form of the animal he turned
                    into in the region where the metamorphosis was said to have occurred. Indra in
                    the form of a bull encountered the monster Vritra, and released the cows he had
                    stolen; Indra was invoked as a bull, and to him the bull and the cow were sacred
                    among the Hindus. Derketo became a fish near Ascalon; a fish-goddess identified
                    with her was worshipped in Syria, and the fish sacred to her were not eaten.
                    Poseidon, the inventor of horses, was, as a horse, the father of the steeds
                    Arion and Pegasus, and the horse was sacred to him. Jupiter Ammon appeared as a
                    ram in the deserts of Libya; in Libya he had an oracle where the ram was sacred
                    to him, and his image wore ram’s horns. So too metamorphosis by gods is in some
                    cases connected with local traditions. The Arcadians, or beartribe, sprang from
                    the were-bear Callisto; the Lycians, or wolf-tribe, were wolves when they
                    conducted to the river Xanthus the were-wolf Leto, mother ©f the Lycian Apollo.
                    Turning from the gods to the heroes of classical romance, we find traditions
                    more, interesting and more instructive, because they must have some real
                    historical foundation. Yet they also abound in episodes of beast mothers and
                    beast fathers, and also of lycanthropy proper. Cyrus was suckled by a bitch, the
                    Servian hero Milosh Kobilitch by a mare, the Norse Sigurd by a hind, the German
                    Dieterich and the Latin Romulus by wolves; the progenitor of the Merovingian
                    kings was a bull, of the Danish royal race a bear; Sigmund and Sinfiotli in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Volsunga Saga</hi> become wolves, Nagli in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eyrbyggia Saga</hi> a boar. The Berserkir of Iceland asserted
                    their ability to become bears and wolves, and dressed themselves in the skins of
                    these animals; their existence, their garb, and their pretensions are historical
                    facts. In the Sanskrit epic, the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata,</hi> the hero
                    Puloman becomes a wild boar to carry off the wife of Bhrigu; the house of
                    Brabant traced its origin to a transformed swan. Beast-form is, however, in
                    mythology proper far offener assumed for malignant than for benignant ends;
                    indeed the heroes and anthropomorphic gods of the great religious systems are
                    principally distinguished for their victories over the semi-hu <hi
                    rend="subscript"> k</hi> man semi-bestial demons. The bull Indra fights the
                    demon serpent Vritra, and so forth; the Theban Cadmus, the Russian Ivan, the
                    Norse Sigurd, all encounter dragons or serpents, which possess human
                    characteristics. In most of such cases indeed the human as well as the beast
                    form is distinctly attributed to the demon.</p>
                <p>It is because they may after all be properly associated with the undoubted
                    phenomena of modern savage life that these facts of ancient mythology are here
                    alluded to. Among savages there is the most confident belief in
                    metamorphosis,—metamorphosis effected for the most salutary and for the most
                    baneful ends. In the neighbourhood of Tette on the Zambesi every chief is
                    credited with the power of assuming lion shape; every lion is respected as being
                    a transformed chief or the spirit of a chief departed. Moreover, there is a
                    special class of “doctors” or medicine-men, known as “pondoros,” scattered
                    through the villages, who pretend to powers of metamorphosis, and thus are
                    regarded with both respect and dread; their kindly disposition they display by
                    hunting for the community in lion shape, and then bringing home the game. Among
                    the Arawaks of Guiana, the Kandhs of Orissa, and the Jakuns of the Malay
                    peninsula, beast form is said to be assumed by those desiring to avenge
                    themselves justly on enemies. Beast-parents and cases of women alleged to have
                    borne beast children are also familiar to savages. But this is only one side of
                    the picture. The “kanaima-tiger” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> man-jaguar) of
                    Arawak may be possessed by the spirit of a man devoted to bloodshed and
                    cannibalism; “there is,” writes the Rev. Mr Brett, “no superstition more
                    prevalent among the Indians than this, and none which causes more terror.” In
                    Ashango-land, where there are distinct traces of animal worship, a were-leopard
                    was at the time of Du Chaillu’s visit charged with murder and metamorphosis,
                    and, confessing both, was slowly burnt to death, quite in the style of mediaeval
                    Europe. Similar occurrences have been known among the Kols (of Chûtiâ-Nâgpùr)
                    and among the Arabs.</p>
                <p>The expedients supposed to be adopted for effecting change of shape may here be
                    noticed. One of the simplest apparently was the removal of clothing, andin
                    particular of a girdle of human skin, or the putting on of such a girdle,—more
                    commonly the putting on of a girdle of the skin of the animal whose form was to
                    be assumed. This last device is doubtless a substitute for the assumption of an
                    entire animal skin, which also is frequently found. In other cases the body is
                    rubbed with a magic salve. To drink water out of the footprint of the animal in
                    question, to partake of its brains, to drink of certain enchanted streams, were
                    also considered effectual modes of accomplishing metamorphosis. 01aus Magnus
                    says that the Livonian were-wolves were initiated by draining a cup of beer
                    specially prepared, and repeating a set formula. Mr Ralston in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Songs of the Russian People</hi> gives the form of incantation
                    still familiar in Russia. Various expedients also existed for removing the
                    beast-shape. The simplest was the act of the enchanter (operating either on
                    himself or on a victim); another was the removal of the animal girdle. To kneel
                    in one spot for a hundred years, to be reproached with being a were-wolf, to be
                    saluted with the sign of the cross; or addressed thrice by baptismal name, to be
                    struck three blows on the forehead with a knife, or to have at least three drops
                    of blood drawn were also effectual cures. The·last-mentioned was quite essential
                    to the subsistence of the superstition. Its absurdity would have much sooner
                    appeared, but for the theory that, directly the were-wolf was wounded, he
                    resumed his human shape; in every case where one accused of being a were-wolf
                    was taken, he was certain to be wounded, and thus the difficulty of his not
                    being found in beast form was satisfactorily disposed of.</p>
                <p>The foregoing types of lycanthropy, in which the divine or diabolical agency is
                    always emphasized, are presumably less primitive than those cases in which
                    superhuman agency is not so prominent. The following cases, therefore, seem to
                    be more intimately connected with the origin of the belief. (1) The Kandhs
                    believe “natural tigers to kill game only to benefit men, who generally find it
                    but partially devoured and share it; while the tigers which kill men are either
                    Tari (a goddess), who has assumed the form of a tiger for purposes of wrath, or
                    men who, by the aid of a god, have assumed the form of tigers, and are called ‘
                    mleepa tigers.’” A distinction was previously drawn between friendly and hostile
                    lycanthropists<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n104/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0104-0091"/>; here a distinction is drawn between friendly and
                    hostile tigers, and lycanthropy is introduced to explain the cases of hostility.
                    Again (2) in the native literature of modern savages there constantly occur
                    stories of the “Beauty and the Beast” type, so distinctly resembling those of
                    the Aryan <hi rend="italic">Mahrchen</hi> as to indicate identity of origin;
                    but, while in the Aryan story the beast-form of the hero or heroine is generally
                    at last removed, in the savage story the incongruity of the beast-form is
                    scarcely realized, and the Indian lover lives happily with his beaver bride, the
                    Zulu maiden with her frog husband. And (3) in many instances the power or
                    necessity of transformation is ascribed, not to individuals, but to clans or
                    nations. Thus the aboriginal Naga tribes of India seemed to the Aryans to take
                    the form of serpents; the Neuri seemed to the Scythians, and the Hirpini to the
                    Romans, to become wolves, as also did the native Irish of Ossory to the early
                    Christian priests; the Abyssinians credit the Buda caste (blacksmiths and
                    potters of alien stock) with ability to become hyaenas at pleasure; the
                    Berserkr-rage of Iceland is perpetuated in the modern Scandinavian belief that
                    Lapps and Finns can take the form of bears. In mediaeval times Blois had a
                    special celebrity for were-wolves, and persons named Garnier or Grenier were
                    generally assumed to be lycanthropists.</p>
                <p>When we find that these three distinct classes of primitive facts regarding
                    lycanthropy are all referable to a common origin, there seems good reason for
                    regarding that as being in truth the origin of lycanthropous belief. And thus we
                    are led to refer lycanthropy to the more general facts of primitive <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Totemism (&lt;∕.v.),</hi> for the facts recited are as
                    undoubtedly characteristic of the latter as of the former. Where the totem is an
                    animal, it is regarded as the ancestor of the tribe; all animals of its species
                    are revered, and are never willingly killed; however dangerous to life, they are
                    feigned by the tribe to be friendly to them, and hostile only to their enemies.
                    Applying these facts to the foregoing lycanthropous phenomena in order, we
                    observe (1) that the tiger is a totem god among the Kandhs; consequently he
                    reserves his wrath for their enemies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Watusi of East Africa distinctly describe all wild
                    beasts save their own totem-animals as enemy-scouts.</p></note> Individual
                    enemies would, however, be created whenever an individual Kandh had the
                    bloodfeud against another, for then his totem was bound to aid him. Such we saw
                    was in fact the Kandh explanation of the wrath of the totem. The development of
                    sorcery would naturally lead to the utilization of the totem as assistant in it
                    also. The Arawak “kanaima” is both lawful avenger and cruel sorcerer; and from a
                    similar reason probably did the wolf or were-wolf in Europe become a synonym for
                    outlaw. The outlaw was at first simply the peaceless man—the man who preferred
                    vendetta to money composition for injuries,—as he was originally <hi
                    rend="italic">bound</hi> to do, subsequently <hi rend="italic">entitled</hi> to
                    do, and finally <hi rend="italic">prohibited</hi> from, doing. (2) The
                    beast-hero of savage story ceases to be strange when we learn that “a beaver,”
                    “a dog,” “a grizzly bear,” mean respectively a person of a tribe having the
                    animal in question for totem. And so too (3) with the third class of phenomena
                    which contemplates tribes turned into beasts. The Nagas had the serpent for
                    totem; apparently the Hirpini, and the native Irish in many districts, had the
                    wolf; they certainly venerated and worshipped that animal. The Lapps are known
                    to worship the bear. Blois means the “city of wolves.” Doubtless all cases of
                    this sort admit of similar explanation,</p>
                <p>The doctrine of lycanthropy or metamorphosis of living men must be distinguished
                    from the doctrine of metempsychosis or transmigration of souls. It no doubt was
                    usual to conclude that the souls of cataleptic and epileptic patients sojourned
                    temporarily in animals, while the patients were unconscious; but this phase of
                    lycanthropy is too rare and too abnormal to be associated with the origin of the
                    superstition. Transmigration after death, involving the belief in a future
                    state, raises questions as puzzling as does lycanthropy itself, and questions
                    qui'te of a different kind, because in normal lycanthropy the change effected is
                    an actual corporeal one. Mr Tylor therefore throws little light on the origin of
                    lycanthropy when he connects it with metempsychosis. In the form familiar to us
                    it doubtless involves the doctrine of “animism ”—the doctrine that animals,
                    plants, and things are prompted to action by spirits similar to those possessed
                    by men; but, whether lycanthropy is simply à special application of a general
                    doctrine of animism, and is not rather one of the earliest advances from a blind
                    totemism to a general animistic theory, may fairly be questioned. This at least
                    seems plain: animism, apart from totemism, is not itself sufficient to explain
                    lycanthropy, for even animistic beliefs are not developed abnormally, but along
                    lines predetermined by circumstances. Mr Tylor’s views are, however, so
                    cautiously and so suggestively expressed as to deserve close study. Hardly so
                    satisfactory arc the other theories on the subject, which, passing over
                    variations in detail, fall into two classes—the mythological and the
                    rationalistic. On the former view, now upheld by a large school of inquirers,
                    the ancient Aryan myths, and their modern representatives the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mαhrcheη,</hi> are regarded as imaginative descriptions (principally due to the
                    use of metaphorical language) of the great elemental powers and changes of
                    nature. On such a view the occurrence of shape-changing gods and heroes is
                    simple and natural, so long as the persons are purely mythical, because thus far
                    nothing need be deemed strange or unnatural. But the theory breaks down when it
                    ventures on elucidation of historical facts. It seems vain to contend,—although
                    it is contended,—that “the terrible delusion of lycanthropy arose from tlιe mere
                    use of an equivocal word” (λυ∕cos, “wolf,” for λevκ&lt;is, “shining”). Attempt
                    to substantiate in detail this explanation of history is absolutely fatal.
                    “Whence,” it is asked, “came the notions that men were changed into wolves,
                    bears, and birds, and not into lions, fishes, or reptiles?” and the triumphant
                    reply is that the first-named animals were selected for glossiness or luminosity
                    of coat.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir G. W. Cox,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Mythology of the Aryan Nations,</hi> London, 1870, vol. i.
                    pp. 63 note, 231, 363, 459; vol. ii. p. 78 note.</p></note> Consequently, if
                    transformation into the other animals was also believed in, the theory stands
                    self-refuted. Now Hippomenes and Atalanta were for impiety turned into lion and
                    lioness, Cadmus and Harmonia into serpents; and these cases of transformation
                    have almost as intimate an association with the historical belief in men-lions
                    and men-serpents as the case of Lycaon (mythologically = the shiner, the sun)
                    has with lycanthropy. Cognate to the mythological doctrine is the doctrine of
                    the personification as demons of all obstacles which men have encountered in the
                    long struggle for existence,—among these the wilder and more savage animals.
                    This is just a one-sided animism; it is inadequate to explain how the savage
                    beasts so often became mild and gentle men. The rationalistic theories are open
                    to the same objections: to account for divine and benignant lycanthropists they
                    have to be supplemented by the mythological theories; they themselves deal
                    exclusively with the more repulsive characteristics. The most recent exponent of
                    the rationalistic theory is Mr Baring Gould, who rests his case on a proof of
                    the facts that there is “an innate craving for blood implanted in certain
                    natures, restrained under ordinary circumstances, but breaking forth
                    occasionally, <hi rend="italic">accompanied with hallucination,</hi> leading in
                    most cases to cannibalism.” That cannibalism and craving for blood had a natural
                    (though not a necessary) connexion with lycanthropy, if it originated among
                    savages, need not be disputed; but Mr Baring Gould’s instances, drawn from
                    mediaeval European history, are undoubtedly exceptional. Hallucination, however,
                    has been accepted as sufficient explanation of lycanthropy by many eminent
                    authorities, besides Mr Gould, and raises a graver question. Belief in
                    transformation into beasts has been acknowledged as a distinct type of monomania
                    by medical men since the days of Paulus Aegineta (7th century) at least; but
                    even in madness there is method, and insane delusions must reflect the usages
                    and beliefs of contemporaneous society. Here the weakness of the case appears.
                    Mr Gould, for instance, merely states that the victims were rustics, and wolves
                    the chief terror of their homesteads, an explanation valid only on the
                    assumption that the idea of metamorphosis was already familiar, —an assumption,
                    that is, of the whole matter at issue. Besides, it is the popular, not the
                    individual, belief in transformation that is strange; to trace its origin to
                    insane delusion makes it stranger still, for sane men are particularly sceptical
                    regarding the reality of the impressions of the insane. Sane men, moreover,
                    believed in transformation, not only into malignant wolves, but also into
                    harmless cats and hares, which in consequence became malignant and dangerous.
                    How can the rationalistic theory account for a.phenomenon like this? On the
                    whole, there seems little doubt that, whether the origin of lycanthropy rests in
                    totemism or not, Mr <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0105-0092"/> Tylor is right in referring lycanthropous ^
                    insane delusions to an antecedent belief in lycanthropy, instead of ascribing
                    lycanthropy to insane delusions.</p>
                <p>Literature.—In the numerous mediaeval works directed to the study of sorcery and
                    witchcraft, the contemporaneous phases of lycanthropy occupy a prominent pl ∣ce.
                    In addition to the authors who have been already mentioned, the following may be
                    named as giving special attention to this subject :—Wier, be Praestigiis
                    baemonum, Amsterdam, 1563; Bodin, bémonomanie des Sorciers, Paris, 1580; Boguet,
                    biscours des Sorciers, Lyons, 2d ed. 1608; Lancre, Tableau de Γ/neonstance de
                    Mauvais Anges, Paris, 1613; Psellus, be Operatione bxmonum, Paris, 1615; see
                    also Glanvil, Sadducismus Triumphatus, for the English equivalents of
                    lycanthropy. Treatises solely confined to lycanthropy are rare both in mediaeval
                    and in modern times; but a few are well known, as, for instance, those of
                    Bourquelυt and Nynauld, be la Lycanthropie, Paris, 1615; Hartz, be Werwolf,
                    Stuttgart, 1862; Baring Gould, The Book of Were-wolves, London, 1865.
                    Incidentally, however, lycanthropy has engaged the attention of a large number
                    of writers, most of whom theorize regarding its origin. An exhaustive
                    enumeration of these cannot be here attempted; but the following works will be
                    found particularly instructive :—Grimm, butsche Mythologie, vols. ii. and iii.,
                    4th ed., Berlin, 1878; Weicker, Kleine Schriften, vol. iii., Bonn, 1850; waitz,

                    London, 1879. For the medical aspects of lycanthropy, consult the Asylum Journal
                    of Mental Science, vol iii. p. 100 (Dr D. H. Tuke), and authorities there cited.
