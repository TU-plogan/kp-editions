                <p><label type="entry">ISAeUS</label> owes his place in the decade of the Attic
                    orators to his mastery of forensic argument; but his literary significance, in
                    relation to the historical development of Attic prose, is not inferior to that
                    of any other name in the series. The chronological limits of his extant work
                    fall between the years 390-353 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>; and his birth may
                    with probability be placed about 420 B.c. The Plutarchic life describes him as a
                    Chalcidian; Suidas, whom Dionysius follows, as an Athenian. The accounts have
                    been reconciled by supposing that his family sprang from the settlement
                    (κληρουχία) of Athenian citizens among whom the lands of the Chalcidian
                    hippobotae (knights) had been divided about 509 B.c. In 411 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Euboea (except Oreos) revolted from Athens; and it would not have
                    been strange if residents of Athenian origin had then migrated from the hostile
                    island to Attica. Such a connexion with Euboea would explain the non-Athenian
                    name Diagoras which is borne by the father of Isaeus, while the latter is <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n391/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0391-0376"/> said to have been “an Athenian by descent” (<hi

                    rend="italic">γένος).</hi> So far as we know, Isaeus took no part in the public
                    affairs of Athens. “I cannot tell,” says Dionysius, “what were the politics of
                    Isaeus—or whether he had any politics at all.” Those words strikingly attest the
                    profound change which was passing over the life of the Greek cities. It would
                    have been scarcely possible, fifty years earlier, that an eminent Athenian with
                    the powers of Isaeus should have failed to leave on record some proof of his
                    interest in the political concerns of Athens or of Greece. But now, with the
                    decline of personal devotion to the state, the life of an active citizen had
                    ceased to have any necessary contact with political affairs. Professional
                    pursuits, determined by private choice and directed to private ends, could now
                    engross all those energies which would once have been devoted, at least in large
                    measure, to the service of the city. The very fact that almost nothing is known
                    about the life of Isaeus is itself the most suggestive of facts. Already we are
                    at the beginning of that transition which is to lead from the old life of
                    Hellenic citizenship to that Hellenism whose children are citizens of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>There is good authority for the tradition that Isaeus was the pupil of
                    Isocrates,—probably about 393 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when Isocrates was
                    beginning his career as a teacher, and while Isaeus was not yet occupied with
                    his special calling. Internal evidence for such intercourse may be found in the
                    method of handling subject-matter which some extant speeches of Isaeus exhibit.
                    Though not a pupil, Isaeus had certainly been a student of Lysias. A passage of
                    Photius has been understood as meaning that personal relations had existed
                    between Isaeus and Plato; but this view appears to rest on an erroneous
                    construction of the passage in question.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>On this point (as on some others which can be but briefly
                    noticed here) the reader is referred to the detailed treatment of the subject in

                <p>The profession of Isaeus was that of which Antiphon had been the first
                    representative at Athens—that of a λογογράφος, who composed speeches which his
                    clients were to deliver in the law-courts. But, while Antiphon had written such
                    speeches chiefly (as Lysias frequently) for public causes, it was with private
                    causes that Isaeus was almost exclusively concerned. The fact marks the
                    progressive subdivision of labour in his calling, and the extent to which the
                    smaller interests of private life now absorbed the attention of the citizen.</p>
                <p>The most interesting recorded event in the career of Isaeus is one which belongs
                    to its middle period—his connexion with Demosthenes. Born in 384 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Demosthenes attained his civic majority in 366. At
                    this time he had already resolved to prosecute the fraudulent guardians who had
                    stripped him of his patrimony. In prospect of such a legal contest, he could
                    have found no better ally than Isaeus, a master of Attic law, especially where
                    claims to property were at issue, and one who for upwards of twenty years had
                    been eminently successful as a writer of speeches for the law courts. That the
                    young Demosthenes actually resorted to the aid of Isaeus is beyond reasonable
                    doubt. But the pseudo-Plutarch embellishes the story after his fashion. He says
                    that Demosthenes, on coming of age, took Isaeus into his house, and studied with
                    him for four years—paying him the sum of 10,000 drachmas (about £400), on
                    condition that Isaeus should withdraw from a school of rhetoric which he had
                    opened, and devote himself wholly to his new pupil. The real Plutarch gives us a
                    more sober and a more probable version. He simply states that Demosthenes
                    “employed Isaeus as his master in rhetoric, though Isocrates was then teaching,
                    either (as some say) because he could not pay Isocrates the prescribed fee of
                    ten minae, or because he preferred the style of Isaeus for his purpose, as being
                    <hi rend="italic">vigorous and astute” (f&gt;ραστηριον</hi><hi rend="italic">καί
                    πανοΐργον).</hi> It may be observed that, except by the pseudo-Plutarch, a
                    school of Isaeus is not mentioned,—for a notice in Plutarch need mean no more
                    than that he had written a text-book, or that his speeches were read in
                    schools;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plut., <hi

                    pupil named. As to Demosthenes, his own speeches against Aphobos and Onetor
                    (363-62 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> afford the best possible gauge of the
                    sense and the measure in which he was the disciple of Isaeus; the intercourse
                    between them can scarcely have been either very close or very long. The date at
                    which Isaeus died can only be conjectured from his work; it may be placed about
                    350 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>Isaeus has a double claim on the student of Greek literature. He is the first
                    Greek writer who comes before us as a consummate master of strict forensic
                    controversy. He also holds a most important place in the general development of
                    practical oratory, and therefore in the history of Attic prose. Antiphon marks
                    the beginning of that development, Demosthenes its consummation. Between them
                    stand Lysias and Isaeus. The open, even ostentatious, art of Antiphon had been
                    austere and rigid. The concealed art of Lysias had charmed and persuaded by a
                    versatile semblance of natural grace and simplicity. Isaeus brings us to a final
                    stage of transition, in which the gifts distinctive of Lysias were to be fused
                    into a perfect harmony with that masterly art which receives its most powerful
                    expression in Demosthenes. Here, then, are the two cardinal points by which the
                    place of Isaeus must be determined. We must consider, first, his relation to
                    Lysias; secondly, his relation to Demosthenes.</p>
                <p>A comparison of Isaeus and Lysias must set out from the distinction between
                    choice of words (λεξxs) and mode of putting words together (&lt;rυv0ε&lt;ris).
                    In choice of words, <hi rend="italic">diction,</hi> Lysias and. Isaeus are
                    closely alike. Both are clear, pure, simple, concise; both have the stamp of
                    persuasive plainness (d&lt;∕&gt;ε'λεiα), and both combine it with graphic power
                    (έκάργεζα). In mode of putting words together, <hi rend="italic"
                    >composition,</hi> there is, however, a striking difference. Lysias threw off
                    the stiff restraints of the earlier periodic style, with its wooden monotony; he
                    is too foud indeed of antithesis always to avoid a rigid effect; but, on the
                    whole, his style is easy, flexible, and various; above all, its subtle art
                    usually succeeds in appearing natural. Now this is just what the art of Isaeus
                    doesnot achieve. With less love of antithesis than Lysias, and with a diction
                    almost equally pure and plain, he yet habitually conveys the impression of
                    conscious and confident art. Hence he is least effective in adapting his style
                    to those characters in which Lysias peculiarly excelled,— the ingenuous youth,
                    the homely and peace-loving citizen. On the other hand, his more open and
                    vigorous art does not interfere with his moral persuasiveness where there is
                    scope for reasoned remonstrance, for keen argument, or for powerful
                    denunciation. Passing from the formal to the real side of his work, from diction
                    and composition to the treatment of subject-matter, we find the divergence wider
                    still. Lysias usually adheres to a simple four-fold division— proem, narrative,
                    proof, epilogue. Isaeus frequently interweaves the narrative with the
                    proof.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Here he was
                    probably influenced by the teaching of Isocrates. The forensic speech of
                    Isocrates known as the <hi rend="italic">Aegineticus</hi> (Or. xix.), which
                    belongs to the peculiar province of Isaeus, as dealing with a claim to property
                    (ε ’ π&lt;δ&lt;κασiα), affords perhaps the earliest example of narrative and
                    proof thus interwoven. Earlier forensic writers had kept the διηγησzs and <hi
                    rend="italic">πiστeιs</hi> distinct, as Lysias does.</p></note> He shows the
                    most dexterous ingenuity in adapting his manifold tactics to the case in hand,
                    and often “out-generals” (καταστρατηγεί) his adversary by some novel and daring
                    disposition of his forces. Lysias, again, usually contents himself with a merely
                    rhetorical or sketchy proof; Isaeus aims at strict logical demonstration, worked
                    out through all its steps. As Sir William Jones well remarks, Isaeus lays close
                    siege to the understandings of the jury.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This is what Dionysius means when he says that Isaeus
                    differs from Lysias—τ&lt;p μη κατ’ <hi rend="italic">tvθiμ∙ημi τι Keynv</hi><hi

                    “enthymeme” means a rhetorical syllogism with one premiss suppressed (“curtum,”
                    Juv., vi. 449); “epicheireme,” such a syllogism stated in full. <hi

                <p>Such is the general relation of Isaeus to Lysias. What, we must next ask, is the
                    relation of Isaeus to Demosthenes? The Greek critic who had so carefully studied
                    both authors states his own view in broad terms when he declares that “the power
                    of Demosthenes took its seeds and its beginnings from Isaeus.” A closer
                    examination will show that within certain limits the statement may be allowed.
                    Attic prose expression had been continuously developed as an art; the true link
                    between Isaeus and Demosthenes is technical, depending on their continuity.
                    Isaeus had made some original contributions to the resources of the art; and
                    Demosthenes had not failed to profit by these. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >composition</hi> of Demosthenes resembles that of Isaeus in blending terse and
                    vigorous periods with passages of more lax and fluent ease, as well as in that
                    dramatic vivacity which is given by rhetorical question and similar devices. In
                    the versatile disposition of subject-matter, the divisions of “narrative” and
                    “proof” being shifted and interwoven according to circumstances, Demosthenes has
                    clearly been instructed by the example of Isaeus. Still more plainly and
                    strikingly is this so in regard to the elaboration of systematic proof; here
                    Demosthenes invites direct and close comparison with Isaeus by bis method of
                    drawing out a chain of arguments, or enforcing a proposition by strict legal
                    argument. And, more generally, Demosthenes is the pupil of Isaeus, though here
                    the pupil became even greater than the master, in that"faculty of grappling with
                    an adversary’s case point by point, in that aptitude for close and strenuous
                    conflict which is expressed by the words <hi rend="italic">αγών,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lvayωvιos.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> Thus far
                    Isaeus and Demosthenes are related to each other as technical proficients in a
                    progressive a,rt. It might be added that there was some degree of resemblance
                    between the natures of the two men, in so far as the intellectual character of
                    both was marked by a certain vigorous intensity of logic. But it would be as
                    perverse to overstate the debt of Demosthenes to Isaeus as it would be unjust to
                    rest the significance of Isaeus solely or chiefly on his relation to
                    Demosthenes. As Demosthenes holds his unrivalled place in virtue of qualities
                    which no teacher could have communicated, so, too, the writings of Isaeus have
                    the independent value of masterpieces in their own kind.</p>
                <p>The pscudo-Plutarch, in his life of Isaeus, mentions an <hi rend="italic">Art of
                    Rhetoric</hi> and sixty-four speeches, of which fifty were accounted genuine.
                    From a passage of Photius it appears that at least <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> the fifty speeches of recognized authenticity were extant as late as 850
                    A.D. Only eleven, with large part of a twelfth, have come down to us; but the
                    titles of forty-two others are known. <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi></p>
                <p>The titles of the lost speeches confirm the statement of Dionysius that the
                    speeches of Isaeus were exclusively forensic; and only three titles indicate
                    speeches made in public causes. The remainder, concerned with private causes,
                    may be classed under six heads :— (1) <hi rend="italic">κληρικοί</hi> —cases of
                    claim to an inheritance; (2) <hi rend="italic">eπικληρικoi—</hi> cases of claim
                    to the hand of an heiress; (3) <hi rend="italic">διaδικaσiaι—</hi> cases of
                    claim to property; (4) <hi rend="italic">άποστασίου</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    cases of claim to the ownership of a slave; (5) <hi rend="italic">eyyυηs—</hi>
                    action brought against a surety whose principal had made default; (6) <hi
                    rend="italic">avτωμoσia (a,s =</hi><hi rend="italic">παραγραφή)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> a special plea; (7) <hi rend="italic">eφeσιs—</hi> appeal
                    from one jurisdiction to another.</p>
                <p>Eleven of the twelve extant speeches belong to class (1), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >κληρικοί,</hi> or claims to an inheritance. This was probably the branch of
                    practice in which Isaeus had done his most important and most characteristic
                    work. And, according to the ancient custom, this class of speeches would
                    therefore stand first in the manuscript collections of his writings. The case of
                    Antiphon is parallel: his speeches in cases of homicide <hi rend="italic"
                    >{φονικοί)</hi> were those on which his reputation mainly depended, and stood
                    first in the manuscripts. Their exclusive preservation, like that of the
                    speeches made by Isaeus in will-cases, is thus primarily an accident of
                    manuscript tradition, but partly also the result of the writer’s special
                    prestige.</p>
                <p>Six of the twelve extant speeches are directly concerned with claims to an
                    estate; five others are connected with legal proceedings arising out of such a
                    claim. They may be classified thus (the name given in each case being that of
                    the person whose estate is in dispute)</p>

                <p>The speeches of Isaeus supply valuable illustrations to the early history of
                    testamentary law. They show us the faculty of adoption, still, indeed,
                    associated with the religious motive in which it originated, as a mode of
                    securing that the sacred rites of the family shall continue to be discharged by
                    one who can call himself the son of the deceased. But practically the civil
                    aspect of adoption is, for the Athenian citizen, predominant over the religious;
                    he adopts a son in order to bestow property on a person to whom he wishes to
                    bequeath it. The Athenian system, as interpreted by Isaeus, is thus
                    intermediate, at least in spirit, between the purely religious standpoint of the
                    Hindu and the maturer form which Boman testamentary law had reached before the
                    time of Cicero. <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> As to the form of the speeches,
                    it is remarkable for its variety. There are three which, taken together, may be
                    considered as best representing the diversity and range of their author’s power.
                    The fifth, with its simple but lively diction, its graceful and persuasive
                    narrative, recalls the qualities of Lysias. The eleventh, with its sustained and
                    impetuous power, has no slight resemblance to the manner of Demosthenes. The
                    eighth is, of all, the most characteristic, alike in narrative and in argument.
                    Isaeus is here seen at his best. No reader who is interested in the social life
                    of ancient Greece need find Isaeus dull. If the glimpses of Greek society which
                    he gives us are seldom so gay and picturesque as those which enliven the pages
                    of Lysias, they are certainly not less suggestive. Here, where the innermost
                    relations and central interests of the family are in question, we touch the
                    springs of social life; we are not merely presented with scenic details of dress
                    and furniture, but are enabled in no small degree to conceive the feelings of
                    the actors.</p>
                <p>The best manuscript of Isaeus is in the British Museum,—Crippsianus A
                    (=Burneianus 95), which contains also Antiphon, Andocides, Lycurgus, and
                    Dinarchus. The next best is Bekker’s Laurentianus B (Florence), of the 15th
                    century. Besides these, he used Marcianus L (Venice), saec. 14, Vratisiaviensis
                    Z. saec, 14, and two very inferior MSS., Ambrosianus A. 99, P (which he
                    dismissed after Or. i.), and Ambrosianus D. 42, Q (which contains only Or. i.,
                    ii.). Schöraann, in his edition of 1831, generally followed Bekker’s text; he
                    had no fresh apparatus beyond a collation of a Paris MS. R in part of Or. i.;
                    but he had sifted the Aldine more carefully. Baiter and Sauppe (1850) had a new
                    collation of A, and also used a collation of Burneianus 96, M, given by Dobson
                    in vol. iv. of his edition (1828). C. Scheibe (Teubner, 1860) made it his
                    especial aim to complete the work of his predecessors by restoring the correct
                    Attic forms of words; thus <hi rend="italic">(e.g∙)</hi> he gives <hi
                    rend="italic">ηγγva</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ιveγva,</hi> δεδcμεv for <hi
                    rend="italic">δeδiaμev,</hi> and the like,—following the consent of the MSS.,
                    however, in such forms as the accusative of proper names in <hi rend="italic"
                    >-ηv</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">-η,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">(e.g</hi>)
                    the future <hi rend="italic">φανήσομαι</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic"
                    >φavoυμaι,</hi> Ac., and on such doubtful points as &lt;∕&gt;pdτeρes instead of
                    φpατopev, or <hi rend="italic">Έίληθυίας</hi> instead of Eιλeι6υiας.</p>
