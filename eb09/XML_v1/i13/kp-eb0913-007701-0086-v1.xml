                <p><label type="entry">INHERITANCE</label>. lu English law, inheritance, heir, and
                    other kindred words have a meaning very different from that of the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">haeres,</hi> from which they are derived. In Roman law the heir or
                    heirs represented the entire legal personality of the deceased—his <hi
                    rend="italic">universum</hi><hi rend="italic">jus.</hi> In English law the heir
                    is simply the person on whom the real property of the deceased devolves by
                    operation of law if he dies intestate. He has nothing to do as heir with the
                    personal property; he is not appointed by will; and except in the case of
                    coparceners he is a single individual. The Roman <hi rend="italic">haeres</hi>
                    takes the whole estate; his appointment may or may not be by testament; and more
                    persons than one may be associated together as heirs.</p>
                <p>The devolution of an inheritance in England is now regulated by the rules of
                    descent, as altered by the Inheritance Act (3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 106), amended
                    by 22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. 35. 1. The first rule is that inheritance shall descend
                    to the issue of the last “purchaser.” A purchaser in law means one who acquires
                    an estate otherwise than by descent, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by will, by
                    gratuitous gift, or by purchase in the ordinary meaning of the word. This rule
                    is one of the changes introduced by the Inheritance Act, which further provides
                    that “the person last entitled to the land shall be considered the purchaser
                    thereof unless it be proved that he inherited the same.” Under the earlier law
                    descent was traced from the last person who had “seisin” or feudal possession,
                    and it was occasionally a troublesome question whether the heir or person
                    entitled had ever, in fact, acquired such possession. Now the only inquiry is
                    into title, and each person entitled is presumed to be in by purchase unless he
                    is proved to be in by descent, so that the stock of descent is the last person
                    entitled who cannot be shown to have inherited. 2. The male is admitted before
                    the female. 3. Among males of equal degree in consanguinity to the purchaser,
                    the eldest excludes the younger; but females of the same degree take together as
                    “coparceners.” 4. Lineal descendants take the place of their ancestor. Thus an
                    eldest son dying and leaving issue would be represented by such issue, who would
                    exclude their father’s brothers and sisters. 5. If there are no lineal
                    descendants of the purchaser, the next to inherit is his nearest lineal
                    ancestor. This is a new rule introduced by the Inheritance Act. Under the former
                    law inheritance never went to an ancestor,—collaterals, however remote, of the
                    person last seized being preferred even to his father. Various explanations have
                    been given of this seemingly anomalous rule,—Bracton and Blackstone being
                    content to say that it rests on the law of nature, by which heavy bodies
                    gravitate downwards. Another explanation is that estates were granted to be
                    descendible in the same way as an ancient inheritance, which having passed from
                    father to son <hi rend="italic">ex necessitate</hi> went to collaterals on
                    failure of issue of the person last seized. 6. The sixth rule is thus expressed
                    by Mr Joshua Williams in his excellent treatise on <hi rend="italic">The Law of
                    Peal Property:</hi> “The father and all the male paternal ancestors of the
                    purchaser and their descendants shall be admitted before any of the female
                    paternal ancestors or their heirs; all the female paternal ancestors and their
                    heirs before the mother or any of the maternal ancestors or her or their
                    descendants; and the mother and all the male maternal ancestors and her and
                    their descendants before any of the female maternal ancestors or their heirs.”
                    7. A kinsman of the whole blood shall come before the same degree of the half
                    blood. The admission of kinsmen of the half blood into the chain of descent is
                    one of the alterations made by the Inheritance Act. Formerly a relative, however
                    nearly connected in blood with the purchaser through one only and not both
                    parents, could never inherit—a half-brother for example; while relatives of the
                    whole blood, however distant, might inherit to the exclusion of nearer relatives
                    of the half blood. 8. In the admission of female paternal ancestors, the mother
                    of the more remote male paternal ancestor and her heirs shall be preferred to
                    the mother of the less remote male paternal and her heirs; and, in the case of
                    female maternal ancestors, the mother of the more remote male maternal ancestor
                    shall be preferred to the mother of a less remote male maternal ancestor. This
                    rule, following the opinion of Blackstone, settles a point which has been much
                    disputed by text-writers, although its importance was little more than
                    theoretical. 9. When there shall be a total failure of heirs of the purchaser,
                    or when any lands shall be descendible as if an ancestor had been the purchaser
                    thereof, and there shall be a total failure of the heirs of such ancestor, then
                    and in every such case the descent shall be traced from the person last entitled
                    to the land as if he had been the purchaser thereof. This rule is enacted by 22
                    &amp; 23 Vict. c. 35. It would apply to such a case as the following :—Purchaser
                    dies intestate, leaving a son and no other relations, and the son in turn dies
                    intestate; the son’s relations through his mother are now admitted by this rule.
                    If the purchaser is illegitimate, his only relations must necessarily be his own
                    issue. Failing heirs of all kinds, the lands of an intestate purchaser, not
                    alienated by him, would revert by “escheat” to the next immediate lord of the
                    fee, who would generally be the crown. If an intermediate lordship could be
                    proved to exist between the crown and the tenant in fee simple, such
                    intermediate lord would have the escheat. But escheat in any case is a matter of
                    rare occurrence.</p>
                <p>The descent of an estate in tail would be ascertained by such of the foregoing
                    rules as are not inapplicable to it by the necessity of the case. By the form of
                    the entail the estate descends to the “issue” of the person to whom the estate
                    was given in tail,—in other words, the last purchaser. The preceding rules after
                    the fourth, being intended for the ascertainment of heirs other than those by
                    lineal descent, would therefore not apply; and a special limitation in the
                    entail, such as to heirs male or female only, would render unnecessary some of
                    the others. When the entail has been barred, the estate of course descends
                    according to these rules. In copyhold estates descent, like other incidents
                    thereof, is regulated by the custom of each particular manor <hi rend="italic">;
                    e.g.,</hi> the youngest son may exclude the elder sons. How far the Inheritance
                    Act applies to such estates has been seriously disputed. It has been held in one
                    case (Muggleton <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Barnett) that the Inheritance Act,
                    which orders descent to be traced from the last purchaser, does not override a
                    manorial custom to trace descent from the person last seized, but this position
                    has been controverted on the ground that the Act itself includes the case of
                    customary holdings.</p>
                <p>Husband and wife do not stand in the rank of heir to each other. Their interests
                    in each other’s real property are secured by curtesy and dower. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Husband and Wife.</hi></p>
                <p>The personal property of a person dying intestate devolves according to an
                    entirely different set of rules, which will be found under the head of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Intestacy.</hi></p>
                <p>In the law of Scotland the rules of descent differ from the above in several
                    particulars. Descent is traced, as in England before the Inheritance Act, to the
                    person last seized. The first to succeed are the lineal descendants of the
                    deceased, and the rules of primogeni-_ ture, preference of males to females,
                    equal succession of females* (heirs-portioners), and representation of
                    ancestors, are generally the same as in English law. Next to the lineal
                    descendants, and failing them, come the brothers and sisters, and their issue as
                    collaterals. Failing collaterals, the inheritance ascends to the father and his
                    relations, to the entire exclusion of the mother and her relations. Even when
                    the estate has descended from mother to son, it can never again revert to the
                    maternal line. As to succession of brothers, a distinction must be taken between
                    an estate of heritage and an estate of conquest. Conquest is where <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n87/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0087-0078"/> the deceased has acquired the land otherwise than
                    as heir, and corresponds to the English term purchase in the technical sense
                    explained above. Heritage is land acquired by deceased as heir. The distinction
                    is important only in the case when the heir of the deceased is to be sought
                    among his brothers; when the descent is lineal, conquest and heritage go to the
                    same person. And when the brothers are younger than the deceased, both conquest
                    and heritage go to the brother (or his issue) next in order of age. But when the
                    deceased leaves au elder and a younger brother (or their issues), the elder
                    brother takes the conquest, the younger takes the heritage. Again, when there
                    are several elder brothers, the one next in age to the deceased takes the
                    conquest before the more remote; and when there are several younger brothers,
                    the one next to the deceased takes the heritage before the more remote. When
                    heritage of the deceased goes to an elder brother (as might happen in certain
                    eventualities), the younger of the elder brothers is preferred. The position of
                    the father, after the brothers and sisters of the deceased, will be noticed as
                    an important point of difference from the English axioms; so also is the total
                    exclusion of the mother and the maternal line. After brothers and sisters and
                    their issue have been exhausted, the heir is sought among the relations of the
                    father; but even when these are exhausted, the estate, although it should have
                    descended <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi><hi rend="italic">materna,</hi> can
                    never revert to the maternal line. As between brothers and sisters the
                    half-blood only succeeds after the full blood. Half-blood is either
                    consanguinean, as between children by the same father, or uterine, as between
                    children having the same mother. The half-blood uterine is excluded altogether.
                    Half-blood consanguinean succeeds thus: if the issue is by a former marriage,
                    the youngest brother (being nearest to the deceased of the consanguinean)
                    succeeds first; if by a later marriage than that from which the deceased has
                    sprung, the eldest succeeds first.</p>
                <p>In the United States the English law of inheritance has been more completely
                    repudiated than any other portion of our system. Each State has established
                    rules of descent for itself, and the observation of Chief Justice Reeve that the
                    nation “has no general law of descents, which probably has not fallen to the lot
                    of any other county,” is to some extent justified by the great differences in
                    detail between the rules obtaining in the different States. The following are
                    the rules of most general application, as stated in Kent’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries on American Law,</hi> twelfth edition, edited by O. W. Holmes,
                    jun. 1. Real estate shall descend to the lawful descendants of the owner, in the
                    direct line of lineal descent; and if there ba but one person, then to him or
                    her alone; and if more than one person, and all of equal degrees of
                    consanguinity to the ancestor, then to the several persons or tenants in common
                    in equal parts, however remote from the intestate the common degrees of
                    consanguinity may be. 2. When the lawful issue are of unequal degrees of
                    consanguinity to the intestate, the inheritance shall descend to the children
                    and grandchildren, if any be living, and to the issue of such as shall be dead,
                    as tenants in common; but such grandchildren and their descendants inherit only
                    such shares as their parents respectively would have taken if living. These two
                    rules are stated to prevail in all the United States, with some important
                    variations, however, in the case of the first rule. 3. In the absence of
                    descendants the inheritance goes to the parents, either first to the father and
                    next to the mother, or jointly under certain conditions. This canon is described
                    as prevailing “to a considerable extent.” 4. If the intestate dies without issue
                    or parents the estate goes to his brothers and sisters and their
                    representatives. If the relatives are of equal degrees of consanguinity they
                    take in equal parts; but if, of the same degree, some be'dead, leaving issue,
                    and others living, the descendants of those who are dead take only their
                    parents’ share. Collaterals under this rule would be preferred to
                    ascendants—after parents. “It is perhaps universally the rule that brothers and
                    sisters are preferred to grandparents, though the latter stand in an equal
                    degree of kindred” (Kent, vol. iv. p. 401). In some States there is no essential
                    distinction left between the whole and the half-blood, in others the half-blood
                    is postponed, but nowhere is it totally excluded. 5. In default of the
                    foregoing, the inheritance generally goes to grandparents, but in some States
                    (New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina) grandparents are excluded, and in
                    others postponed. 6. Next come uncles and aunts and their descendants, taking
                    <hi rend="italic">per capita</hi> if of equal degree, and <hi rend="italic">per
                    stirpes</hi> if not. 7. If the inheritance came to the deceased on the part of
                    his father, the father’s brothers and sisters would exclude the mother's
                    brothers and sisters, and the mother’s brothers and sisters would have a similar
                    preference in respect of property coming to the deceased <hi rend="italic">ex
                    parte matema.</hi> A similar distinction is observed in some States in applying
                    the fourth rule. 8. On failure of heirs under the preceding rules, recourse is
                    had to the “next-of-kin” as ascertained by the English statute of distributions.
                    In many of the States the harshness of the English rale that natural children
                    have no inheritable blood is greatly mitigated. In Louisiana, if duly
                    acknowledged, they may inherit from both father and mother in the absence of
                    lawful issue.</p>

                    various States of the Union, will be found in a note appended to the first
