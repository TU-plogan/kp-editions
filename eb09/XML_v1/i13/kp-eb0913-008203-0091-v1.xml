                    through family influence, combined with the increasing evidence he gave of
                    remarkable ability, his subsequent promotion was rapid. By Gregory VIII. ho was

                    the instance of his maternal uncle Clement III., made cardinal-deacon of St
                    Sergius and St Bacchus. On the death of Clement (1191), who was succeeded by
                    Celestine III., a member of the rival house of Orsini, Cardinal Lothario was but
                    little employed in church affairs; the unsought leisure which he now possessed
                    he devoted to the composition of three works, two of which have come down to our
                    times. Of these the most remarkable by far is that entitled <hi rend="italic"

                    (January 8,1198), Lothario was without a day’s delay unanimously chosen to
                    succeed him; his ordination to the priesthood (hitherto he had held only
                    deacon’s orders), his episcopal consecration, and his coronation as pope
                    (February 22, 1198), followed one another in rapid succession. The state of
                    Europe and of the known world at that juncture was such as might have suggested
                    even to a less able and energetic man than Innocent the ambition of once more
                    seeking to obtain for the papacy that absolute supremacy, both spiritual and
                    temporal, in the struggle for which his great predecessor Gregory, more than a
                    century before him, had lost his throne, and, one might almost say, his life.
                    The owner of the crown of Naples (Frederick II., born 1197) was an infant,
                    incapable of protecting his dominions from the numerous adventurers by whom they
                    were overrun; the Lombard republics were at deadly feud with one another, or
                    rent by increasing domestic faction; the empire was convulsed by the struggles
                    of the rival claimants to the throne rendered vacant by the death of Henry VI.;
                    in France Philip Augustus since 1180 had been disgusting his subjects with his
                    tyranny and scandalous vice; at Constantinople the cruel and wicked Alexius
                    III., after dethroning his elder brother Isaac Angelus, was struggling to
                    maintain his precarious grasp of the sceptre, while the kingdom of Jerusalem,
                    which half a century before had extended along nearly the whole coast of Syria,
                    was now almost entirely confined to the city of Acre. Innocent’s first care was
                    to deliver Rome itself from the claims to supreme authority asserted by the
                    prefect, who for many years had been nominated by the emperor, but whom now he
                    compelled to swear allegiance to himself, thus for the first time practically
                    establishing the temporal sovereignty of the bishop of Rome over his own city.
                    In another direction the popular rights in connexion with the choice of a
                    “senator” were curtailed. Measures were next taken to free the so-called
                    patrimony of St Peter from the various German adventurers who, professing to
                    hold of the empire, had divided it amongst them. Markwald of Anweiler, duke of
                    Ravenna, was by a papal army driven from the March of Ancona, with which he had
                    been invested, and compelled to withdraw to the south of Italy; Conrad of
                    Lutzenberg, duke of Spoleto, was driven into Germany; Innocent personally
                    visited Reate, Spθleto, Perugia, Todi, and everywhere was welcomed as sovereign
                    and deliverer. His claim to the sovereignty of the duchy of Tuscany as heir of
                    the countess Matilda, Hildebrand’s friend, was successfully asserted next; and
                    on the death of Constantia, widow of Henry VI. of Germany, Innocent, who had
                    been acknowledged by her as liege lord, became, as guardian of the young
                    Frederick II., master of the kingdom of Naples and Sicily. By the help of Walter
                    of Brienne, Diephold of Acerra was compelled to relax his hold of Apulia; and in
                    1202 the death of Markwald at Palermo removed one of the most vigorous of the
                    many troublers of Italian peace. The rivalry between Philip of Swabia, brother
                    of Henry VI., and the Guelph Otto of Brunswick, for the imperial crown, in the
                    next place offered a favourable opportunity for intervention in German politics
                    after the more immediately pressing affairs of Rome and Italy had been settled.
                    The tardy (but not reluctant) decision finally given (March 1201) by Innocent in
                    favour of the Guelph did not indeed avert protracted civil war, resulting in
                    humiliation and disaster both to emperor and pope; yet ultimately the murder of
                    Philip (June 21, 1208) paved the way for the peaceful coronation of Otto in the
                    following year, and the long-continued efforts of Innocent seemed to have met
                    with an absolute success when the new emperor not only ratified previously
                    exacted promises faithfully to maintain the territories, fiefs, and rights of
                    the see of Rome as these had been defined by the see itself, but also renounced
                    even the small share in episcopal elections which had been reserved to the
                    empire in the concordat of Worms. The triumph, it is true, proved a hollow one;
                    Otto soon broke his oath, claiming the kingdom of Apulia as a fief of the
                    empire, and losing no time in commencing a war fur the subjugation of Naples.
                    Nor did his excommunication in 1211 result greatly to the advantage of the
                    papacy, except in so far as it strikingly showed how dangerous to the individual
                    was a collision with the supreme spiritual power. The battle of Bouvines (July
                    27, 1214) finally disposed of the last hopes of Otto, but by it there was left
                    master of the field one who was destined to prove still more formidable in his
                    opposition to ecclesiastical ascendency. The immense influence which the energy,
                    persistence, and political skill of Innocent enabled him to wield throughout the
                    whole duration of his pontificate in the affairs of the empire was equally
                    exemplified in his relations with almost every other state of Christendom. Thus
                    one of his first acts after his accession was to signify his disapproval of the
                    conduct of Philip Augustus of France in dismissing his lawful wife Ingeburga of
                    Denmark. By a rigorous interdict laid upon the kingdom from December 1199 to
                    September 1200, the headstrong and refractory king was at last compelled to take
                    her back with all the honour due to the queen of France. So, when in England
                    King John began to persecute the clergy in consequence of their adherence to the
                    cause of Stephen Langton, the papal nominee to the archbishopric of Canterbury
                    (1207), his own excommunication followed forthwith; the kingdom was laid under
                    an interdict (March 24, 1208), his subjects released from their allegiance, and
                    his throne offered to any conqueror, with effects which again were far from
                    being such as Innocent had anticipated, but which could not fail to impress the
                    minds of the men of that time with a new and deep sense of the vigour and
                    far-reaching power of the vicars of Christ. In Castile, in Portugal, in Leon, in
                    Navarre, in Denmark, Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, the same story repeats itself,
                    with equal distinctness, if with less prominent results. Another outlet of the
                    zeal and ambition of Innocent was found in the fifth crusade, the leading events
                    of which, including the pact with Venice and the fall of Constantinople, have
                    been elsewhere related (vol. vi. p. 628-9). In the west also, a new crusade
                    against heretics<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n93/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0093-0084"/> was set on foot with relentless energy, which has
                    been described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Albigenses.</hi> The
                    principles upon which such enterprises ought to be conducted were formulated
                    under the presidency of Innocent at the fourth Lateran council (1215). It was
                    there decreed that all rulers should promise to tolerate no heretics within
                    their dominions, and that any prince who should refuse to comply with an
                    injunction of the church to purge his dominions of heresy was to be punished
                    with excommunication, and in case of contumacy to be deposed,—if necessary, by
                    force of arms. To those who should take part in such application of armed force
                    when declared necessary, immunities similar to those enjoyed by the Eastern
                    crusaders were guaranteed. At the same time very stringent laws were made with
                    reference to the Jews. Their disability to hold any public appointment of trust
                    was declared, and they were prohibited from at any time wearing Christian
                    apparel, and also from appearing in public at all during Holy Week. This council
                    was held by Innocent in the full consciousness of his approaching dissolution,
                    which took place at Perugia on July 16, 1216. He was succeeded by Honorious III.
                    Apart from his other claims to fame as a sovereign and statesman of remarkable
                    breadth of view, unity of purpose, and boldness of action, Innocent deserves
                    notice as a canonist and as a preacher. His decisions in canon law are
                    characterized by a learning and an acuteness which have made him an important
                    authority. The decretals of the first three years of his pontificate were
                    collected by Rainer of Pomposi, and afterwards Bernardus Compostellanus
                    undertook the editing of those of the first nine years, which appeared in a
                    collection known as the <hi rend="italic">Compilatio Romana.</hi> This, however,
                    contained some spurious documents, which were eliminated from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Compilatio tertia,</hi> brought down by Petrus Callivacinus to the
                    twelfth year, and sent to the university of Bologna. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Compilatio quarta,</hi> published shortly after his death, contains the bulls
                    and briefs of the closing six years. Some indication of Innocent’s power as a
                    preacher, which is known to have been great, can still be found in his extant
                    sermons; while fully partaking of the curious artificiality and mannerism of the
                    period, they abound in passages of fervid eloquence, and are everywhere
                    characterized by deep religious and moral feeling.</p>
