                    the softening or annealing only of the tool.</p>
                <p>In the act of hardening, steel becomes specifically lighter to an extent varying
                    with the temperature attained before cooling, the composition of the steel, and
                    its form and dimensions, and according as it has been rolled or otherwise worked
                    before treatment; thus Elsner found a specimen of cast steel had the specific
                    gravity 7’9288 before hardening, and 7 ’ 6578 after (both at 11° C.), indicating
                    an expansion in volume of about 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 per cent.
                    Similarly Hinman found expansions of 2 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 to 3 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 per cent, for blister steel; and Hausmann found for

                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 and 0'8 per cent, respectively. The expansion,
                    however, is not uniform in all directions; thus Caron found that a hammered
                    steel bar 20 centimetres long and 1 centimetre square in section altered after
                    repeated hardenings to the following extent in percentages of the original

                <p>whilst with rolled steel there was an increase in length of 2’25 per cent, and no
                    change in the other dimensions.</p>
                <p>On thoroughly annealing hardened steel it recovers the original, dimensions
                    possessed before hardening; evidently therefore when a large steel tool is
                    hardened, since the inner portion cannot possibly become cooled at the same rate
                    as the outer film, a kind of strain must be developed amongst the particles;
                    for, whilst the rapid chilling of the outer portion causes that part to occupy a
                    larger volume than it otherwise would, this is not effected to so large a
                    relative extent with the inner portions. The opposite result is necessarily
                    produced during annealing. Accordingly, in the process of tempering steel goods,
                    cracking and splitting or “buckling” and otherwise getting out of shape are
                    inconvenient results that are apt to happen, especially when all parts of the
                    surface are not equally and simultaneously heated or chilled, a result difficult
                    to bring about with articles of certain shapes; the hardening process may in
                    such cases be more safely effected by heating the article up gradually in a
                    fluid bath such as melted lead (or in some cases oil) and then chilling in a
                    cool fluid bath, preferably of oil; whilst the annealing may be performed by
                    allowing the fluid in which the article is slowly heated up to cool down again
                    spontaneously when the requisite temperature is attained. For special articles,
                    c.y., saws, a particular manipulation is requisite to avoid buckling; in some
                    cases the annealing of a flat plate, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a circular
                    saw, is effected between two solid flat masses of iron, which keep the plates
                    from getting out of shape whilst cooling. In some instances when the point only
                    of an article is required to be tempered, <hi rend="italic">e. g.,</hi> certain
                    kinds of chisels, the whole mass is heated red hot and the point dipped into
                    water or oil to harden it; on taking out, the heat from the body of the hot
                    article is rapidly conducted to the point; as soon as its temperature is
                    sufficiently raised the body is somewhat cooled by a short immersion so as to
                    reduce the temperature of the whole approximately to uniformity, and then the
                    article is allowed to cool altogether slowly; so that the hardening and
                    annealing are effected by one heating only. For articles the temper of which
                    requires to be somewhat exactly determined, the temperature attained is judged
                    of by the tint of the iridescent film of oxide which forms on the surface
                    (previously brightened) during the heating; the higher the temperature the
                    thicker the film, the colours and temperatures being approximately as follows

                <p>For instance, if a saw is to be tempered at a full blue it is heated over a clear
                    fire or a mass of red hot iron or in a sand bath until the tint appears on the
                    brightened surface, when it is allowed to oool. In many cases the tempering of
                    tools is effected with sufficient accuracy without brightening them, by coating
                    them with tallow, oil, or some similar composition, and then heating over a lamp
                    or amass of hot metal until the tallow, &amp;c., begins to decompose; with
                    sufficient experience as to the size of the article, the mode of heating, and
                    the character of the decomposition set up, much the same results are arrived at
                    as when the colour is watched on the brightened surface. In some instances the
                    requisite temper is given by one operation only, the point of the article to be
                    hardened (a drill, say) being coated with tallow and heated in a flame until the
                    tallow decomposes rapidly, and then plunged into a mass of tallow to chill it;
                    the point is thus rendered harder than the body of the drill. By heating the
                    point of a small tool nearly white hot and plunging it into a stick of sealing
                    wax for a second, and then into another part of the wax, and so on till cold,
                    steel may be made so hard as to be readily capable of boring into similar steel
                    hardened in the ordinary way.</p>
                <p>Instead of determining the temperature of the object to be annealed by the tint
                    developed on it, various fusible alloys may be used, a series of such being
                    placed in the annealing bath, so that by observing which are fluid the
                    temperature is known approximately. Parkes gives the following compositions of

                    Independently of the additional strength communicated to iron by the presence of
                    small quantities of carbon, producing steels or so-called steels of various
                    kinds, a considerable increase in this property is brought about by the removal
                    of portions of cindery matter by fusion. Wrought iron that has simply been
                    welded, reheated, and rolled a given number of times is, <hi rend="italic"

                    complete union together. Thus the best qualities of weld iron, containing

                    higher in this respect, viz., from 30 to 40 tons per square inch; harder steels

                    inch section, has been drawn by Johnson and Nephew (Manchester), whilst wire of
                    tensile strength of 70 to 80 tons per square inch is readily procurable.
                    According to Collingwood, galvanizing increases the strength of freshly drawn
                    wire by about 15 per cent., whilst ungalvanized wire has been found to gain
                    nearly 5 per cent, by merely being allowed to remain at rest for a week or so;
                    the increase of strength in each case appears <pb break="no"

                    strains produced during drawing.</p>
                <p>It does not necessarily follow that the resistance to percussive force exhibited
                    by a given sample of metal will be in the ratio of its tensile strength. Thus
                    phosphorus when present together with only minute quantities of carbon (forming
                    the so-called “phosphoric steels ”) does not very materially decrease the
                    tensile strength, such steels containing 0 ’ 3 per cent, of phosphorus being
                    often but little inferior to soft non-phosphorized steels in this respect; but
                    when tested by a “falling weight” (a mass of known weight falling once or
                    oftener from a known height upon the centre of the bar or rail firmly gripped in
                    supports a known distance apart) the phosphorized metals generally show
                    themselves considerably inferior to the non-phosphorized ones. The same remark
                    applies to silicon. According to</p>

                    it less capable of resisting percussion are nearly in the proportions of 3, 2,
                    and 1 relatively to one another. The presence of manganese diminishes this
                    deleterious effect of non-metals; whilst, if more than minute quantities of
                    carbon be present, the tensile strength as well as the resistance to percussion
                    is greatly diminished by the additional presence of phosphorus or silicon in
                    proportions beyond certain small limiting amounts. Accordingly it is the usual
                    practice to test rails, bars, &amp;c., not only by the determination of the
                    breaking strain for tensile force (measured by pulling asunder, preferably by
                    hydraulic power, a bar turned to known definite dimensions, and made into the
                    shape of fig. 65), but also by a falling weight,—a “monkey” (somewhat like a
                    pile driver) being raised to a known height and let drop upon the rail.</p>
                <p>The particular tests applied in different instances vary much; for instance, some
                    little while ago the official falling weight test for Bessemer rails at Gratz
                    (Austrian South Railway Company’s Works) was to permit a weight of 1000 kilos
                    (about a ton) to fall from a height of 15 feet upon the centre of the rail
                    supported by two rests 3 feet apart, any amount of bending being allowed, but
                    not fracture, whilst a test for elasticity or resistance to permanent deflexion
                    was applied by placing a weight of 17,500 kilos on the middle of the rail
                    similarly supported. The North-Eastern Railway (England) similarly at one time
                    tested rails by allowing a weight of 1800 lb to fall from 4 feet height, the
                    number of blows requisite to produce rupture and the permanent bending produced
                    by each being noted. In other instances the test applied has been a ton weight
                    falling a greater height, such as 20 feet or even 30 feet, the rail being
                    required to stand one such blow only, or a succession, the particular details of
                    the test to be applied being usually specified in each particular case; thus the
                    Midland Railway Company has tested steel rails by allowing a weight of 1 ton to
                    fall three times from a height of 12 feet, the supports being 4 feet
                    asunder.</p>
                <p>In just the same way as regards the determination of tensile strength, the
                    dimensions of the piece to be tested (6 inches, 8 inches, 10 inches long,
                    &amp;c.) are usually specified, and the strain which the metal will just stand
                    without becoming permanently elongated <hi rend="italic">{limit of
                    elasticity)</hi> determined, as well as the total strain requisite to produce
                    rupture, together with the “ductility” or amount of permanent extension of the
                    test piece and the diminution in section of the bar at the point of rupture.
                    Thus for instance the following numerical data were obtained by Kirkaldy with a
                    particular specimen of West Cumberland Bessemer steel plate, three pieces being
                    tested, each 10 inches long, and respectively ∣, ⅜, and ∣ inch in thickness.</p>

                <p>These numbers illustrate, amongst other things, the effect upon the final values
                    produced by variations in the diameter of the test pieces; the shorter and
                    thicker the piece the greater in amount is the permanent extension. In
                    calculating the rupturing strain per square inch, the dimensions of the metal as
                    originally employed <hi rend="italic">before</hi> permanent alteration was
                    brought about are employed; by taking the diminished area at the point of
                    fracture as the section, a much higher value is obtained as the tensile strength
                    per unit area of the extended metal. Tempering steel greatly increases its
                    breaking strain and limit of elasticity, but decreases the permanent extension;
                    thus the following values represent certain results obtained with Creuzot steels

                <p>In making a contract for the supply of steel of a particular quality, the details
                    of the tests of strength to be applied should consequently be duly set forth;
                    for instance, a short time ago the French Government required certain steel navy
                    tubes, of which the limit of elasticity and breaking strain tested in a
                    particular way were respectively to be 21 and 38 tons per square inch. Similarly
                    in the construction of the Mississippi great bridge the cast steels used were
                    contracted to be of the following qualities :—“To be of crucible cast steel; the
                    staves of the tubes to stand a compressive strain of 60,000 and a tensile strain
                    of 40,000 lb per square inch section without permanent set, and to stand a
                    tensile strain of 100,000 lb per square inch without fracture. Modulus of
                    elasticity to be between 26 and 30 million lb, preferably nearer the lower
                    limit, and as constant as possible; bars of the same modulus to be selected for
                    the tubes, so that each side shall have same power of resistance; each bar to be
                    tested and modulus stamped on it. Steel pins, rods, bolts, eyewashers, rivets,
                    &amp;c., and the ⅛ inch steel plates for enveloping the staves to stand a
                    tensile strain of 40,000 fb per square inch without permanent set, and an
                    ultimate tensile strain of 100,000 lb without fracture.”</p>
                <p>Practical tests of the capability of metal to stand bending double or through
                    some given angle, or twisting round and round in the cold without fracture are
                    often applied, as are also tests of the capability of being bent hot, forged,
                    welded, &amp;c. A test as to the power of resisting repeated bending strains
                    backward and forward through a given angle is sometimes applied; a particular
                    mechanical arrangement for effecting this has been described by Olrick.</p>
                <p>James Price has constructed a machine for testing rails as to durability under
                    rolling wear and tear, consisting of a pair of metal rollers 5 feet in diameter
                    and 16 inches wide, weighing 45 cwts. each, supporting a frame weighing 6⅜ tons,
                    connected with a centre boss and vertical axle, so that the rollers are driven
                    round in a circle, one bearing with 5 the other with 6 tons pressure; the rails
                    to be tested are bent into a circle or preferably a polygon, to equalize the
                    wear of the rollers, which are driven over them at a speed of 13 or 14 miles per
                    hour until the rails are broken or wear out.</p>
                <p>It by no means follows that the rail which possesses the greatest tensile
                    strength will resist wear and tear and rolling friction best, although this
                    might be anticipated if, other things being equal, increased tensile strength
                    corresponds to greater hardness; on the other hand, experience does not always
                    indicate that the most carbonized rails last the longest, although the
                    superiority of ingot metal (Bessemer steel, &amp;c.) over weld iron (not fused)
                    rails is well demonstrated; it is probable that the interposed film of cinder
                    between the metallic fibres in the latter case greatly facilitates the
                    destruction and wearing away of the upper surface, just as the accumulation of
                    dust and sand on the rail between the passage <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n370/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0370-0355"/> of consecutive trains, especially conjoined with
                    moisture, conduces to mechanical abrasion. Price Williams has calculated from
                    the results of various British lines that the average tonnage lives of wrought
                    iron and Bessemer rails (i.e., the traffic in tons requisite to wear away f inch
                    of the head of the rail) are respectively close to 17⅜and 161 million tons, the
                    latter being thus more than nine times as lasting as the former.</p>
                <p>Numerous observations have been made on the effect on the strength of iron and
                    steel of punching and dialling holes, of notching and otherwise removing part of
                    the surface, and of shearing, with the general result of indicating that the
                    disturbance produced in the relative positions of the constituent particles by
                    forcibly punching and shearing in the cold materially decreases the strength of
                    a bar or plate (apart from the actual removal of substance); but that drilling
                    does not effect the strength in the same way (see various papers in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal I. and S. Inst., Iron,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Engineering</hi> during the last few years). Annealing restores the strength to
                    a considerable extent; if the plates be punched whilst red hot the annealing
                    takes place spontaneously.</p>
                <p>The strengthening effect upon soft steels and ingot irons of hardening by heating
                    and plunging into oil is often very marked, the tendency to crystallinity
                    observable in large masses of cast metal being thus largely removed. A valuable

                    —Many observations on this point have been made by different experimenters, with
                    the general result of indicating that at 0° C. and below the tensile strain and
                    resistance to percussion of iron and steel bars, rods, &amp;c., are
                    substantially the same as at the average ordinary temperatures of 15° to 20°,
                    but that what difference there is is usually in the direction of diminution in
                    strength; the numerical values obtainable are considerably variable with the
                    composition of the metal, Ac.; thus Webster finds that a severe cold of - 15° C.
                    does not affect the tensile strain of wrought iron and steel, although it
                    slightly increases the ductility by about 1 per cent, with iron and 3 per cent,
                    with steel; the power of resisting transverse strain is, however, some 3 per
                    cent, lower, whilst the flexibility and the resistance to rupture by impact are
                    reduced by the following amounts :—</p>

                <p>A committee of engineers appointed by the Russian Government for the purpose of
                    examining carefully into this question has recently found that, when the amount
                    of phosphorus, silicon, and carbon in Bessemer and Siemens-Martin steel rails
                    exceeds jointly about 0 ’ 54 (varying from 0 ’ 44 to 0 ’ 67) per cent., the
                    rails are decidedly more brittle at temperatures near to - 20° C. than at the
                    ordinary temperature ( 4- 10° to 20°); whilst the effect of low temperature in
                    producing brittleness is not marked when the phosphorus, silicon, and carbon
                    jointly amount to only about 0 ’ 41 (0 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 37 to 0 ’
                    55) per cent. Expressing the amounts of non-metals on the scale proposed by
                    Dudley (3 parts of carbon, 2 of silicon, and 1 of phosphorus being considered as
                    equivalent to one another, so that a rail containing carbon = 0'30, silicon — 0
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 20, phosphorus = 005, would be equivalent to one
                    containing phosphorus = 0 ’ 25), these results may be expressed as follows: when
                    the percentages of carbon, silicon, and phosphorus are jointly equivalent to an
                    average of 0 ’ 19 per cent, of phosphorus, the effect of low temperatures is not
                    marked; but when they are equivalent to an average of 0’31 per cent, of
                    phosphorus, the rails are more brittle at temperatures near - 20° than at
                    ordinary average temperatures near to + 15°.</p>
                <p>Breakages of axles, crankshafts, pumprods, &amp;c., exposed to strains and
                    vibration appear to be more common in frosty weather than at other seasons of
                    the year; it is considered by many that exposure to vibration, &amp;c., and low
                    temperature simultaneously tend to diminish tenacity and set up a brittle
                    structure in a way not observed when only one of the two causes alone acts;
                    direct evidence on this point is, however, wanting. It is noticeable that large
                    masses of cast metal (cast iron, true steel, or ingot metal) if cooled too
                    quickly are apt to have the internal portions in a high state of tension or
                    strain; for the outer portion, when solidified, prevents the contraction taking
                    place that would otherwise ensue during the solidification and cooling of the
                    inner portion; hence the amount of extra strain requisite to produce rupture is
                    much diminished, so that the want of elasticity of bearings, foundations,
                    &amp;c., connected with the almost rigid ground during hard frosts in certain
                    cases causes the strain applied during use to exceed the reduced amount which
                    the metal can then bear without fracture. Chilled castings, case hardened iron,
                    and tempered steel, moreover, are affected by low temperatures in another way;
                    the outer harder portions do not expand at exactly the same rate as the inner
                    softer parts; and consequently alteration of temperature produces such
                    variations in the internal strain as in some cases to lead to fracture either
                    spontaneously or by the superaddition of the strain due to ordinary use. On the
                    whole it appears that no clear evidence is as yet extant proving that vibration
                    either alone or concurrently with low temperature does actually cause a brittle
                    crystalline structure to be developed; whilst on the other hand thousands of
                    examples are extant of axles, engine beams, connecting rods, tires, girders,
                    &amp;c., continually subjected to vibration, percussive action, and varying
                    strains of all kinds for years, in which no such development of brittleness has
                    taken place; in those cases in which fracture has been thus brought about, the
                    probability is that defective workmanship and the development of internal strain
                    are the true causes of the rupture, and not a gradual alteration in texture.</p>
                <p>At 300 <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> to 350° soft irons and steels become much
                    deteriorated in power to resist percussive action and bending strains, whilst at
                    lower temperatures and at a red heat this peculiar comparative rottenness is not
                    marked. Phosphorized iron appears to be affected to a greater extent than purer
                    varieties, but mild Bessemer and Siemens-Martin steels are by no means exempt
                    from the deteriorating influence. A railway wheel that has become heated through
                    the grease-box taking fire by friction rapidly fired guns, and tools that become
                    much heated in use, &amp;c., may readily attain to a temperature sufficiently
                    high to be much less capable of resisting strain than when cool. A large number
                    of experiments on this and allied points are described by Adamson, <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal I. and S. Inst.,</hi> 1878, 383, and 1879, 30.</p>
                <p>Closely akin to the comparative brittleness developed in iron and steel on the
                    one hand by interspersed films of cinder, and by the presence of phosphorus,
                    &amp;c., and on the other by temperature, is the phenomenon which gives rise to
                    the production by over-heating of what is termed “burnt iron”; according to some
                    the want of strength of burnt iron and steel is due to the formation of oxide
                    disseminated through the mass as cinder is through weld iron, this oxide coating
                    the constituent particles and preventing their adhesion to one another; others,
                    however, wholly dissent from this view. Caron <hi rend="italic">(Comptes
                    Rendus,</hi> March 4, 1872) has shown that by simply strongly igniting good
                    qualities of malleable iron either in a smith’s forge, or in porcelain tubes in
                    an atmosphere of hydrogen or of nitrogen, the “burnt” crystalline structure can
                    <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> be developed under circumstances where no oxidation
                    can occur. Akermann also has been led to the same conclusion, defining “burnt”
                    iron as “iron which, through too long continued or strong heating, has had the
                    opportunity of assuming a crystalline texture, with the brittleness which
                    accompanies it on account of the diminished cohesion of the crystals.”</p>
                <p>44. <hi rend="italic">Foundry Operations.—</hi> Occasionally for rough castings,
                    such as tuyere nozzles, &lt;kc., the pig iron is used as it comes from the blast
                    furnace, a small side channel leading off a portion of the molten pig flowing to
                    the sand bed containing the pig moulds (§ 16) to some other convenient part of
                    the bed in which the moulds have been prepared; but much more frequently the
                    iron employed for castings is remelted by the founder in a cupola furnace,
                    various kinds of pig being intermixed together according to circumstances. A
                    reverberatory furnace is preferable to a cupola, the metal being less altered by
                    oxidation; but a much greater consumption of fuel is thus occasioned. A very
                    coarse grained iron, No. 1, will, on remelting and running into small moulds,
                    give a much finer grain than the original pig; whilst, on the other hand, a
                    large massive casting which takes a long time to solidify would, if of the same
                    metal, develop a large grain like that of the original pig.</p>

                <p>To obtain just the right grain under any given circumstances requires an amount
                    of special knowledge and experience of a peculiar kind only to be gained in the
                    foundry itself, the mixture of brands that answer well for a certain kind of
                    casting not being necessarily at all suitable for one of different size;
                    different mixtures, moreover, are apt to differ more or less in the amount of
                    contraction taking place in solidifying and cooling, so that a somewhat
                    different allowance for shrinkage must be made in different cases; as a rule the
                    moulds are made about 1 per cent, larger in each direction than the casting is
                    intended to measure (one-eighth inch to the foot).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wrightson has recently made some interesting
                    observations on the variation in the volume occupied by a given mass of molten
                    cast iron during solidification and subsequent cooling; see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal I. and S. Inst.,</hi> 1879, 418, and 1880.</p></note></p>
                <p>For complex forms, a number of different pieces are required to make up the whole
                    mould, each piece being a metal box or “flask” containing sand mixed with
                    charcoal powder, loam, or similar materials somewhat varying in their nature
                    according to the character of the casting, moistened so as just to cohere
                    together and enable the outline of the casting to be defined by the surface of
                    the mixture. The “pattern” or model being placed in a suitable position, the
                    flasks are separately moulded to the variously shaped parts, and then set up
                    (being bolted or otherwise fixed together) so as to enclose a space shaped
                    precisely to the pattern; the molten metal being then allowed to run into this
                    space, by tapping the cupola and letting the fluid iron pass along a runner or
                    gutter on the sand bed floor of the casting house, gradually fills it up, the
                    seoriae floating on the top; the air which previously filled the mould passes
                    away through orifices left for the purpose, along with steam and gases formed by
                    the action of the hot metal on the materials of the mould. To ensure the casting
                    being free from seoriae, and to give sufficient hydrostatic pressure to enable
                    the impression to be sharp, the liquid metal is allowed to rise to some little
                    height above the top of the casting by making the highest part of the cavity of
                    the mould to be some inches or more below the surface of the floor, so that the
                    metal fills up the tubular hollow above the mould thus formed, making
                    aprojection (“gate” or “git”) above the top of the casting; this is ultimately
                    detached by a hammer or chisel, as are also the ridges formed where the
                    different flasks meet, and any similar protuberances at places where a little of
                    the sand has fallen away from the surface of the mould, thus increasing the
                    dimensions of the cavity at such places.</p>
                <p>More simple forms are cast in moulds prepared with a smaller number of flasks,
                    two often sufficing, or for some purposes one only; machinery is employed for
                    moulding such objects as gas pipes, railway chairs, &amp;c., required in large
                    quantities. For certain purposes metal moulds are used, or combinations of metal
                    and sand moulds; owing to the greater conducting power, the iron in contact with
                    the metallic parts of the mould is rapidly solidified; a peculiar hardness is
                    thus communicated to the casting, which is then termed a “chilled” casting. For
                    the best qualities of chills certain particular classes of pig are requisite;
                    thus for the cast iron car wheels used largely in America the brands of pig
                    preferred are certain kinds of cold blast charcoal brown haematite or specular
                    iron; iron smelted from the pure magnetites of Lake Champlain does not chill in
                    the required way so as to produce an outer film of white iron constituting the
                    “tread” of the wheel, passing into a mottled iron with a soft grey inner centre,
                    thus combining the maximum of strength with a hard wearing face. The peculiarity
                    of some of the American cast iron in this respect enables machinery of certain
                    kinds to be constructed in part of that kind of metal with a strength difficult
                    if not impracticable to obtain with the same weight of metal from most British
                    brands. In order to produce the chilling effect a cast iron ring is imbedded in
                    the sand mould so as to embrace the circumference of the wheel to be cast; the
                    metal is consequently rapidly solidified in contact with the iron ring, the
                    “chill,” or poι ’ tion solidified as white iron, penetrating inwards some 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 75 inch. It is found that confining the chill to the
                    middle portion of the outer circumference only, and not communicating it to the
                    entire flange and the opposite outer portion of the external surface, gives
                    greater strength without diminishing the resistance to wear; this is effected by
                    narrowing the cast iron chilling ring.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Casting under Pressure.—</hi> During the solidification of
                    iron, and especially of steel, after running into moulds, bubbles of gas are
                    often extruded, causing the substances to become vesicular and honeycombed,
                    especially at the upper portion; the gas thus evolved from Bessemer metal was
                    found by Bessemer and Henry to be almost entirely carbon oxide;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Müller has recently found
                    hydrogen to be the chief constituent of the gases contained in the bubbles found
                    in ordinary solid cast steels, along with nitrogen, and much smaller quantities
                    of carbon oxide than those found by Henry.</p></note> on casting in a mould from
                    which the air was rapidly pumped out, ebullition was set up, owing tu the rapid
                    evolution of gas, just as ordinary spring water apparently boils under the
                    exhausted receiver of an air pump. Three methods of overcoming this practical
                    difficulty of vesicular structure being set up have been used. The first, or
                    “dead melting,” applied to cast crucible steel, is simply to allow the crucibles
                    to stand for some time in the furnace with the molten metal in them before
                    casting; in this way the iron oxide disseminated through the mass is acted upon
                    by the carbon, and this source of gases eliminated; according to Bessemer,
                    silicon is also introduced (by the action of the metal on the pot-material), the
                    presence of which retards or stops altogether the gas evolution (see § 33). The
                    second method is the application of this principle in a more direct way by
                    adding silicious pig, preferably as silicious spiegeleisen (silico-manganeisen),
                    to the fused metal; this process has been long used on the Continent in one form
                    or another by steel-makers who have attained a high reputation for their cast

                    mechanical means, the fluid metal being subjected to powerful compression during
                    its solidification. In 1856 a patent for this was taken out by Bessemer, the
                    mould being closed by a strong cover and hydraulic power employed to force
                    inwards a stout wrought iron plunger; Whitworth’s system of casting “compressed
                    steel” is a more perfect development of this notion.</p>
                <p>Other methods of arriving at the same end have been also suggested, the pressure
                    being derived either from the admission of high pressure steam on the top of the
                    ingot mould, or by the generation of gases by the heat of the metal introduced
                    on some chemical composition in the upper part of the closed mould; thus by
                    employing a mixture of nitre and coal dust, the mould being closed by a screw
                    plug and strongly bound round to strengthen it, a high pressure can be exerted,
                    regulated by varying the amount of mixture used in the first instance. A
                    description of the steam process as employed at the Edgar Thomson Works,
                    Pittsburg, is given by H. R. Jones in the <hi rend="italic">Journal I. and S.
                    Inst.,</hi> 1879, 477; it appears to be simple and inexpensive as compared with
                    the Whitworth hydraulic arrangements, but generates far less pressure,<note

                    England with Bessemer ingots have indicated that no appreciable diminution in

                    per square inch.</p></note> Whitworth steel being compressed by forces up to 6
                    to 9 tons per square inch; increasing the pressure up to 20 tons produces little

                    practically valuable results were obtained at Terre Noire nor at St Étienne by
                    the application of intense pressure to the open-hearth steéls there
                    made,—indicating probably that the removal of gas bubbles effected by
                    Whitworth’s operation in crucible steel is accomplished chemically in soft
                    so-called steels of low carbonization made with silico-manganeisen.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">operandi</hi> of pressure in
                    consolidating steel during casting appears from Bessemer’s observations as to
                    the more copious evolution of gas on diminishing pressure to be simply the
                    application of the well-known law of increased solubility of gas in any given
                    medium with increased pressure; under high pressure the fluid metal retains the
                    gas dissolved just as soda water does the carbon dioxide whilst it remains in
                    bottle; but, justas effervescence is produced in this latter case as soon as the
                    pressure is relieved, so in the case of steel would gas bubbles appear under the
                    ordinary pressure which would not have been developed under high pressure. It
                    is, however, somewhat difficult to understand why steel should retain hydrogen
                    and carbon oxide dissolved when at a high temperature and perfectly fluid, and
                    should extrude it on cooling somewhat and when just on the point of solidifying;
                    but the phenomenon is not an isolated one, fused silver behaving in precisely
                    the same way towards oxygen, and thus giving rise to the well-known “spitting”
                    of silver during solidification. The function of silicon in preventing the
                    extrusion of gas may be ascribed either to its communicating the physical
                    peculiarity to the steel of dissolving as much <pb break="no"

                    higher temperature, ami consequently of preventing the separation of gas during
                    solidification; or else to its chemical reaction upon the dissolved carbon oxide
                    forming particles of silica disseminated through the mass and setting free
                    carbon, so that the metal containing less dissolved carbon oxide can thus retain
                    more hydrogen; experimental evidence is wanting finally to decide the question,
                    but the latter view seems to be highly probable.</p>

                    Appliances.—</hi> One of the greatest inconveniences in connexion with the use
                    of iron and steel for constructive and general purposes is the tendency of the
                    metal to oxidize and rust in the air under ordinary atmospheric conditions, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in presence of free oxygen together with moisture and
                    small quantities of carbon dioxide (and in the case of the air of seaside places
                    of saline spray, and in that of coal-consuming districts of sulphur acids,
                    &amp;c.). Highly polished iron can be kept in perfectly dry air without rusting
                    at all; and in contact with a solution of an alkali, such as caustic soda or
                    ordinary carbonate of soda, the tendency to oxidize is far less than in simple
                    spring water, sea-water, or moist air; in certain cases this property may be
                    utilized for the preservation of bright steel objects kept in stock, a coating
                    of ordinary whitewash (chalk and water, or preferably lime and water) being
                    brushed over them and allowed to dry on; a similar coating of lime or whiting
                    and oil is even more efficacious, especially if the oil be a non-drying one,
                    z.e., one that does not spontaneously take up oxygen and become more or less
                    acidified. Protective coatings of paints of various kinds—tar, melted pitch,
                    Ac.—are generally applied to the exterior of large iron constructions, such as
                    bridges, pillars, girders, rainwater spouts and conduits, railings, and the
                    like; the function of these is more mechanical than chemical, the coating simply
                    preventing the metal from coming in contact with the oxidizing medium; but in
                    some of the paints used the basic character of certain of the materials probably
                    also diminishes the tendency to oxidation. In certain cases the corrosion of
                    iron can be diminished by placing a more active metal in contact with it <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.y.,</hi> zinc), so that by a galvanic action the oxidation is
                    largely limited to the zinc; by causing the surface of the iron to be closely
                    adherent to the protecting zinc coating (by dipping the brightened metal in
                    fused zinc), a sort of permanent metallic paint coating is obtained, which acts
                    as a preservative in the threefold manner of mechanically preventing contact
                    with air, of galvanically confining the oxidation to the zinc, and of chemically
                    causing the iron to be coated with a basic film of zinc oxide (when the zinc has
                    become slightly oxidized).</p>
                <p>Many other metallic protective coatings can be similarly applied. Of these the
                    most frequently employed is tin, forming ordinary “tinplate,” the manufacture of
                    which dates back a considerable length of ’time. Other coatings can also be
                    applied by means of electricity, at least to small articles; electro-coppered
                    iron goods and nickelized steel articles thus prepared are now frequently
                    manufactured.</p>
                <p>It has long been noticed that iron bars, plates, &amp;c., from the forge or
                    rolling mill are coated externally with a film of magnetic oxide formed by the
                    action of the air on the heated metal; during rolling this film becomes somewhat
                    thick and peels off, forming “mill-scale”; when the film is but thin and is
                    closely adherent, it has long been known that the metal does not rast so readily
                    at the parts thus covered up with a protective coating as at points where this
                    coating is removed. Similarly it has been long known that certain natural forms
                    of magnetic oxide of iron, and in particular the “iron sands” of New Zealand,
                    Canada, and elsewhere possess the power of resisting the rusting action of
                    sea-water and atmospheric air conjoined. The idea oι purposely coating iron
                    articles with a film of magnetic oxide prepared in such a way as to resist to
                    the greatest possible extent natural peroxidation, and so closely adherent to
                    the underlying metal as not to be readily detached by ordinary usage, has
                    accordingly been successfully carried out in practice by’ more than one person.
                    <hi rend="italic">Bαrff's process</hi> for producing such a coating is based on
                    the reaction occurring between iron and steam at moderately elevated
                    temperatures, viz.,</p>
                <p>31 e 4* 41Γ .,O = 1 e∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> O^ + 4 H <hi rend="subscript"
                    > t</hi>,, hydrogen and magnetic oxide being produced; the articles to be
                    protected, having first been worked into shape, are placed inside a large muffle
                    or chamber of brick heated to a suitable temperature (400° to 600° C.), and
                    subjected to the action of superheated steam for a period of from five to ten
                    hours according to the thickness of the coating required. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bower's process</hi> consists in the exposure of the iron articles to be
                    protected to the action of air and carbon dioxide in a chamber or retort heated
                    externally and capable of being closed air-tight; when hot, air is blown in from
                    time to time so as to produce a thin coating of oxide on the surface. A
                    modification of the process consists in alternately oxidizing and reducing the
                    surface, the fuel being burnt inside the chamber; heated air, in excess of that
                    requisite for the combustion, is introduced, and the surface oxidized, so that
                    the outer film is peroxide, magnetic oxide underlying; by shutting off the air
                    supply for a short time the peroxide is reduced and a uniform film of adherent
                    magnetic oxide produced. Both processes can be so worked as to give a highly
                    protective coating to the iron, so that the articles treated will resist
                    ordinary atmospheric influences for long periods of time. The chief weak point
                    in each case (excluding the question of cost) is that it is impossible to apply
                    any amount of force to the treated articles without cracking or stripping off
                    chips of the coating, so that protected iron articles cannot be hammered,
                    rivetted together, bent, brotherwise subjected to mechanical strains, but must
                    be worked to the dimensions and shape (however large) that are ultimately
                    required before treatment; hence the processes become too costly for large
                    girders, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tin and Terne Plates.—</hi> In order to protect thin iron
                    plates from oxidation and to enable them to be readily soldered together so as
                    to manufacture the numerous articles in ordinary use made by the “whitesmith” or
                    “tin-man,” they are coated over with a closely adherent layer of metallic tin,
                    forming <hi rend="italic">tinplate</hi>; when instead of pure tin an alloy of
                    tin and lead is used as a protective coating, the product is known as <hi
                    rend="italic">terneplate.</hi> The charcoal plates (§ 23) prepared from a good
                    quality of iron used for the tinning process and properly annealed are
                    thoroughly scoured with sand and water and “pickled” in dilute sulphuric acid
                    alternately until perfectly clean and bright; they are then washed and immersed
                    in a pan full of melted grease until all adherent water has boiled away, and
                    dipped into a bath of melted tin (covered with grease to prevent oxidation)
                    which adheres to the surface more or less completely; the first bath is of less
                    pure tin than that contained in a second into which the plate is further dipped
                    so as to complete the coating; the plate is then taken out, and wiped with a
                    hempen rubber to remove superfluous tin and make sure that the surface is
                    completely covered, and dipped for a third time into another bath, after which
                    it is placed in a grease bath of tallow and palm oil at a moderately high
                    temperature, so that the surplus tin may run off, and then into a cooler grease
                    bath to avoid too sudden chilling, which would impair the face of the coating,
                    and finally taken out and cooled in the air. As the tin in the third bath
                    becomes alloyed with iron from the operation, it is removed into the second,
                    fresh pure tin being used instead; similarly the metal from No. 2 bath is by and
                    by removed to supply the first one, so that the plate is covered with less and
                    less ferruginous tin successively as it passes through the three baths. For
                    terne plates the process is much the same, only an alloy of about half tin and
                    half lead is used instead of pure tin; in consequence, the surface produced is
                    not so brilliant.</p>
                <p>When tin plates are partially etched by dilute aqua fortis mixed with common salt
                    or sal ammoniac, they acquire a peculiar spangled appearance, owing to the
                    dissolving away of adherent tin, leaving behind a less readily attacked
                    crystalline tin-iron alloy; the “moirée metallique” thus prepared, after
                    varnishing to prevent oxidation, is frequently used for ornamental purposes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Galvanized Iron.—</hi> When perfectly cleansed iron is immersed
                    in melted zinc instead of tin, the zinc adheres to the surface just as tin does
                    in the tinplate manufacture, forming “galvanized iron,” the name being derived
                    from the circumstance that the coating is analogous to that producible by
                    electrical means. Norwood and Bogers apply a thin coating of metallic tin to the
                    iron before dipping it in the zinc bath, by putting in a wooden tank alternately
                    granulated zinc and the cleaned iron plates, the tank containing a dilute
                    solution of chloride of tin, so that the tin is deposited by a kind of galvanic
                    action.</p>
                <p>By the ordinary processes of electroplating manufactured iron and steel goods can
                    be covered over with protective coatings of other metals, notably copper and
                    nickel. Similarly by various processes silver and gold coatings can be laid on,
                    especially by means of the application of mercurial solutions of the precious
                    metals (water gilding), the mercury <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> being
                    volatilized by <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> heat and the residual gold or
                    silver made more adherent by burnishing, the process being repeated several
                    times if necessary. “Pyrosilver” goods are prepared by heating the silvered
                    steel whereby the silver sinks, as it were, into the metal; successive coatings
                    are then applied and “burnt in,” until the sinkage ceases; in this way a coating
                    is obtained not readily detachable by wear and tear. Protective coatings of
                    various forms of enamel are often employed for various classes of iron goods,
                    more especially advertisement boards, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> sheets of

                    introduced by Dodé, metallic platinum being mixed with the enamelling
                    composition so as to “platinize” the metal and thus add to the durability;
                    according to the inventor, the comparatively high price of platinum does not
                    interfere with the applicability of the process, one platinizing application
                    costing no more than three coats of good paint, and only about a tenth of the
                    expense of nickelizing.</p>

                <p>The present position of the iron and steel trade generally as compared with that
                    at a period of some quarter of a century ago, may be put in a few sentences
                    thus. An enormous increase in the production of iron and steel from natural
                    sources has occurred; not only have the older iron producing countries, as a
                    rule, shared largely in this increase, but further, in many countries and
                    districts where the amount of iron production was formerly little more than a
                    nominal amount or even absolutely nil, the manufacture has now attained to
                    notable dimensions, whilst there is every prospect of this increase in
                    production continuing, notwithstanding the great fluctuations in trade
                    experienced from time to time in particular districts. This is mainly due to the
                    vastly increased use of iron and steel (or so-called steel = fused iron of a low
                    degree of carbonization) for constructive and other general purposes, and
                    especially to the introduction of the peculiar melted products obtained from pig
                    iron by means of Bessemer’s blowing process conjoined with Mushet’s
                    spiegeleisen-addition improvement; by Siemens’s open-hearth “steel” making
                    process involving the use of gaseous fuel and the regenerative principle; or by
                    various modifications of these methods, such as the Snelus-Thomas-Gilchrist
                    process, by means of which phosphorus is removed to a large extent from the pig
                    iron whilst undergoing decarbonization. By this and various other allied
                    devices, the production of useful kinds of so called “steels” from impure ores,
                    which till recently could only be utilized for inferior cast and wrought iron
                    production, has become possible. On the other hand the increasing use of fused
                    “steels,” prepared by various of these methods for many purposes for which
                    wrought iron was exclusively used some quarter of a century ago, has stimulated
                    the wrought iron department, and has in consequence caused the inven tion of
                    numerous machines for diminishing the cost and increasing the output of puddled
                    iron, and for effecting a greater degree of purification than hand puddling
                    ordinarily produces. Notwithstanding these advances, however, it is evident that
                    the weld iron industry is by no means increasing in magnitude as rapidly as the
                    ingot metal manufacture. So evident is the disparity that it is believed by many
                    competent judges that puddled metal will in a longer or shorter time become
                    practically a thing of the past, and that ingot metal will almost wholly take
                    its place,—especially when the advantages of the latter as regards physical
                    qualities and cheapness of production have become more extensively appreciated.
