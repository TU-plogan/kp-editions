                <p><label type="entry">INSTINCT</label> is a term which does not admit of rigid
                    definition, because, as ordinarily used, the meaning of the term is not rigidly
                    fixed. But for the purposes of scientific exposition from a biological point of
                    view the nearest approach we can make to such a definition is perhaps the
                    following: —Instinct is a generic term comprising all those faculties of mind
                    which lead to the conscious performance of actions that are adaptive in
                    character, but pursued without necessary knowledge of the relation between the
                    means employed and the ends attained. We must, however, remember that
                    instinctive actions are very commonly tempered with what Pierre Huber calls “a
                    little dose of judgment or reason.” But although reason may thus in varying
                    degrees be blended with instinct, the distinction between the two is
                    sufficiently precise; for reason, in whatever degree present, only acts upon a
                    definite and often laboriously acquired knowledge of the relation between means
                    and ends. Moreover, adjustive actions due to instinct are similarly performed by
                    all individuals of a species under the stimulus supplied by the same appropriate
                    circumstances, whereas adjustive actions due to reason are variously performed
                    by different individuals. Lastly, instinctive actions are only performed under
                    particular circumstances which have been frequently experienced during the life
                    history of the species, whereas rational actions are performed under varied
                    circumstances, and serve to meet novel exigencies which may never before have
                    occurred even in the life history of the individual.</p>
                <p>All instincts probably arose in one or other of two ways. (1) By the effects of
                    habit in successive generations, mental activities which were originally
                    intelligent become, as it were, stereotyped into permanent instincts. Just as in
                    the life-time of the individual adaptive actions which were originally
                    intelligent may by frequent repetition become automatic, so in the life-time of
                    the species actions originally intelligent may, by frequent repetition and
                    heredity, so write their effects on the nervous system that the latter is
                    prepared, even before individual experience, to perform adaptive actions
                    mechanically which in previous generations were performed intelligently. This
                    mode of origin of instincts has been appropriately called the “lapsing of
                    intelligence.” (2) The other mode of origin consists in natural selection, or
                    survival of the fittest, continuously preserving actions which, although never
                    intelligent, yet happen to have been of benefit to the animals which first
                    chanced to perform them. Thus, for instance, take the instinct of incubation. It
                    is quite impossible that any animal can ever have kept its eggs warm with the
                    intelligent purpose of hatching out their contents, so we can only suppose that
                    the incubating instinct began by warm-blooded, animals showing that kind of
                    attention to their eggs which we find to be frequently shown by coldblooded
                    animals. Thus crabs and spiders carry about their eggs for the purpose of
                    protecting them; and if, as animals gradually became warm-blooded, some species
                    for this or for any other purpose adopted a similar habit, the imparting of heat
                    would have become incidental to the carrying about of the eggs. Consequently, as
                    the imparting of heat promoted the process of hatching, those individuals which
                    most constantly cuddled or brooded over their eggs would, other things equal,
                    have been most successful in rearing progeny; and so the incubating instinct
                    would be developed without there having been any intelligence in the matter.</p>
                <p>That many instincts must have been developed in this way is rendered evident by
                    the following considerations. (1) Many instinctive actions are performed by
                    animals too low in the scale to admit of our supposing that the adjustments
                    which are now instinctive can ever have been intelligent. (2) Among the higher
                    animals instinctive actions are performed at an age before intelligence, or
                    power of learning by individual experience, has begun to assert itself. (3)
                    Considering the great importance of instincts to species, we are prepared to
                    expect that they must be in large part subject to the influence of natural
                    selection. As Mr Darwin observes, “it will be universally admitted that
                    instincts are as important as corporeal structures for the welfare of each
                    species under its present <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n169/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0169-0158"/> conditions of life. Under changed conditions of
                    life it is at least possible that slight modifications of instinct might be
                    profitable to a species; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so
                    little, then I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and
                    continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that was
                    profitable. It is thus, I believe, that all the most complex and wonderful
                    instincts have originated.”</p>
                <p>But here it is of importance to note that there is no reason why instincts should
                    be restricted to one or other of these two modes of origin. On the contrary,
                    there seems to be every reason to suppose that many instincts may have had, as
                    it were, a double root—intelligent adjustment and natural selection blending
                    their influences to a joint production. For example, the grouse of North America
                    display the curious instinct of burrowing a tunnel just below the surface of the
                    snow. In the end of this tunnel they sleep securely; for, when any four-footed
                    enemy approaches the mouth of the tunnel, the bird, in order to escape, has only
                    to fly up through the thin covering of snow. Now in this case the grouse
                    probably began to burrow for the sake of protection, or concealment, or both,
                    and if so, thus far the burrowing was probably an act of intelligence. But the
                    longer the tunnel the better would it have served the purposes of escape, and
                    therefore natural selection would almost certainly have tended to preserve the
                    birds which made the longest tunnels, until the utmost benefit that length of
                    tunnel could give had been attained. And similarly the origin of many other
                    instincts may be satisfactorily explained by thus supposing the combined
                    operation of two causes—intelligent adjustment and natural selection—where there
                    is a difficulty in explaining their origin as due to either cause alone. And if
                    even in fully formed instincts we often find “a little dose of judgment or
                    reason,” we can have no cause to doubt that in the formation of instincts by
                    natural selection such small admixtures of judgment or reason may often greatly
                    assist the process, while, conversely, it is even more evident that an instinct
                    which is developing from the habitual performance of an intelligent action might
                    be greatly assisted by natural selection favouring the individuals which most
                    frequently or most promptly performed that action.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to the above interpretation of the origin of instincts that the
                    latter should not be immutably fixed. A few words may therefore be added to show
                    that the view commonly entertained as to the unalterable character of instincts
                    is erroneous. As a matter of fact, instincts are eminently variable, and
                    therefore admit of being modified as modifying circumstances may require; their
                    variability gives them plasticity whereby they may be moulded always to fit an
                    environment, however continuously the latter may be subject to gradual
                    change.</p>
                <p>For the sake of brevity we may confine our attention to a single instinct, and
                    for the sake of procuring a good test we may again take as our example the
                    instinct of incubation. This affords a good test because it must be regarded,
                    not merely as one of the most important, but also as one of the σldest of
                    instincts, and therefore one which for both these reasons we should deem least
                    likely to exhibit variability. Yet we∙ find it to exhibit variability in every
                    imaginable direction. Thus the complicated effects of domestication and
                    artificial selection on some of our breeds of poultry appear to have almost
                    completely destroyed this instinct, while in other breeds it remains intact, if
                    indeed it has not even been intensified. Among the latter breeds experiment
                    shows that the natural period of incubation may be indefinitely prolonged by
                    substituting “dummies” <hi rend="italic">for eggs,</hi> while the following
                    experiment, which we owe to Mr Spalding, shows “how far the time of sitting may
                    be interfered with in the opposite direction. Two hens,” he says, “became broody
                    on the same day, and I set them on dummies. On the third day, I put two chicks a
                    day old to one of these two hens; she pecked at them once or twice, seemed
                    rather fidgety, then took to them, called them to her, and entered on all the
                    cares of a mother. The other hen was similarly tried, but with a very different
                    result; she pecked at the chickens viciously, and both that day and the next
                    stubbornly refused to have anything to do with them.” Similarly the period of
                    maternal supervision after the chickens have been hatched admits of being
                    greatly modified, as is proved by some experiments made and published several
                    years ago by the present writer. In one of these experiments there was given to
                    a Brahma hen a pea-fowl’s egg to hatch; the hen was an old one, and had
                    previously reared several broods of ordinary chickens. A pea-chicken requires a
                    much longer period of maternal care than does an ordinary chicken, and for the
                    wonderfully long period of eighteen months the old Brahma hen continued to pay
                    unremitting attention to her supposed offspring. Through all this time she never
                    laid any eggs, and eventually the separation seemed to take place from the side
                    of the peacock. In other cases, however, where the conditions of the experiment
                    were exactly parallel, the pea-chickens were abandoned by their Brahma mothers
                    at the time when the latter ordinarily abandon their chickens. But not only will
                    a hen thus take to a brood of birds so unlike her natural chickens as are
                    pea-fowl, and adapt her instincts to their peculiar needs; she may even take to
                    young animals belonging to a different class, and adapt her instincts to their
                    still more peculiar needs. Thus the writer gave to a hen, which for several
                    weeks had been sitting on dummies, three newly-born ferrets; she took to them
                    almost immediately, and remained with them for more than a fortnight, when they
                    were taken away from her. During the whole of this time she had to sit upon the
                    nest, for of course the young ferrets were not able to follow her about as young
                    chickens would have done. Two or three times a day she would fly off her nest,
                    calling upon her brood to follow; but, on hearing their cries of distress from
                    cold, she always returned immediately, and sat with patience for six or seven
                    hours more. She only took one day to learn the meaning of these cries, and after
                    that she would always run in an agitated manner to any place where the crying
                    ferrets were concealed. Yet it would not be possible to conceive a greater
                    contrast than that between the shrill piping note of a young chicken and the
                    hoarse growling noise of a young ferret. It is of importance to add that the hen
                    very soon learnt to accommodate herself to the entirely novel mode of feeding
                    that her young ones required; for, although at first she showed much uneasiness
                    when the ferrets were taken from her to be fed, before long she used to cluck
                    when she saw the milk brought, and surveyed the feeding with satisfaction. But
                    she never became accustomed to the attempt of the ferrets at sucking, and to the
                    last used now and then to fly off the nest with a cackle when nipped by the
                    young mammals in their search for the teats.</p>
                <p>Enough then has been said on the variability of instinct to show that there is
                    supplied to natural selection abundant opportunity for the development of new
                    and more highly wrought instincts from previously formed and less elaborated
                    instincts. But in order to show that this opportunity has been utilized it is
                    not enough to show that hereditary instinct may be modified by individual
                    experience; it must also be shown that such a modification when successively
                    repeated through a number of generations itself becomes inherited. Now, although
                    the evidence on this point is necessarily scanty, it is sufficient for the
                    purpose here required. The evidence is scanty because there are only a very few
                    cases in which human observation has, as it were, the opportunity of watching
                    the continuance of effects of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n170/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0170-0159"/> recently acquired or altered experiences over a
                    number of generations; but in the few cases in which we have this opportunity we
                    find good evidence that new or changed experience, when continued over a number
                    of generations, is bequeathed to future generations as a legacy of intuitive
                    knowledge, and that any newly acquired adjustive actions may in time be
                    similarly transmitted as instinctive actions which no longer require to be
                    separately learnt by each individual. Perhaps the best instance that can be
                    quoted is that of the many species of birds, and some mammals, which when first
                    found by man on oceanic islands were perfectly tame, but whose descendants now
                    show a dread of man which is, in the most rigorous sense of the word,
                    instinctive.</p>
                <p>The only other instances in which we have an opportunity of actually observing
                    the transmission of newly acquired mental habits are those in which such habits
                    have been artificially taught to domesticated animals. It so happens that these
                    instances are very few in number, but it is not too much to say that, in all the
                    cases where such habits have been taught for a long series of generations, some
                    tokens of their hereditary transmission may now be observed. Thus, to quote Mr
                    Darwin, whose accuracy on such a subject is not likely to be disputed by any
                    one, “it cannot be doubted that young pointers—I have myself seen a striking
                    instance—will sometimes point and even back other dogs the very first time they
                    are taken out; retrieving is certainly in some degree inherited by retrievers;
                    and a tendency to run round instead of at a flock of sheep by shepherd dogs. If
                    we were to behold one kind of wolf when young and without any training, as soon
                    as it scented its prey, stand motionless like a statue, and then slowly crawl
                    forward with a peculiar gait, and another kind of wolf rushing round instead of
                    at a herd of deer, and driving them to a distant point, we should assuredly call
                    these actions instinctive. Domestic instincts, as they may be called, are
                    certainly much less fixed than natural instincts, but they have been acted on by
                    far less rigorous selection, and have been transmitted for an incomparably
                    shorter period, under less fixed conditions.”</p>
                <p>Now these three habits, or mental attainments, are the only ones that have been
                    systematically taught to any animals for a number of generations, and the fact
                    that they all show a marked tendency to become intuitive may be taken as lending
                    a greater amount of confirmation to the present theory of the origin of
                    instincts than we might on <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> grounds be led to
                    expect. The only other facts· bearing upon this point are those which are thus
                    tersely rendered by Mr Darwin. “How strongly these domestic instincts, habits,
                    and dispositions are inherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well
                    shown when different breeds of dogs are crossed. Thus it is well known that a
                    cross with a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and
                    obstinacy of greyhounds, and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole
                    family of shepherd dogs a tendency to hunt hares. These domestic instincts
                    resemble natural instincts, which in like manner become curiously blended
                    together, and for a long time exhibit traces of the instincts of either
                    parent.”</p>
                <p>The above doctrine as to the nature, origin, and development of instincts serves
                    very satisfactorily to explain nearly all the enormous number of instincts with
                    which we are acquainted. There are, however, several special cases where there
                    is still some difficulty in applying the above doctrine as a full and
                    satisfactory explanation of the observed facts. This article may therefore fitly
                    conclude with a brief enumeration of these cases.</p>
                <p>1. The so-called “migratory instinct” is one that is still shrouded in much
                    obscurity. The main difficulty with regard to it is to account for the “sense of
                    direction,” whereby the animals are guided to their destinations. Thus, for
                    instance, many migratory birds fly at night, when it would seem impossible that
                    they can be guided on their way by the sight and memory of landmarks. Moreover,
                    it is asserted on good authority that among some species it is the habit for the
                    young brood to fly separately by themselves, or apart from the older birds, and
                    therefore to travel over enormous tracts of land and sea without either guidance
                    or previous experience of the way; such is unquestionably the case with the
                    young of the cuckow. Lastly, it is certain that several species fly across
                    immense tracts of ocean, where it is impossible that they can be guided on their
                    way by landmarks. Several theories have been propounded to account for these
                    facts; but, as none of them are satisfactory, we need not here occupy space with
                    their enumeration.</p>
                <p>2. Closely allied to, if not identical with, this so-called ‘ ‘ sense of
                    direction” as manifested in migration, is the faculty whereby various species of
                    animals which may not be migratory in their habits are enabled to find their way
                    over greater or less distances. This has been called the “homing” faculty, and
                    is chiefly manifested by various species of domesticated mammals. It is very
                    generally believed that it is also manifested by carrier-pigeons; as a matter of
                    fact, however, there is no trustworthy instance on record of one of these birds
                    having found its way back over a tract of country with which it was previously
                    unacquainted. In order that a carrier-pigeon should find its way home, it is
                    necessary first to teach the animal, by flying it at a series of points along
                    the route, the landmarks of the country which it is afterwards to traverse. But,
                    although the “sense of direction” may be a figment as regards the
                    carrier-pigeon, there can be no doubt that it is a fact as regards many species
                    of our domesticated mammals. Thus the evidence is unequivocal with regard at
                    least to dogs, cats, horses, sheep, pigs, and cattle. Judging from hitherto
                    unpublished correspondence received from Australia and South America, there
                    seems to be practically no limit to the distance over which these animals may be
                    able to return; and, what is of more importance, there can be no doubt that
                    these animals, when finding their way home, do not require to traverse the exact
                    routes by ιvhich they came; on the contrary, they generally seem to select the
                    shortest or the straightest course, however circuitous the way may have been by
                    which they were taken; or, if their outward journey is over two sides of a
                    triangle, their homeward journey will probably be taken over the third side. The
                    sense by which they are guided therefore cannot be, as has been suggested by
                    more than one eminent naturalist, the sense of smell; and for the same reasons
                    it cannot be either the sense of sight or that of hearing. More plausible is the
                    hypothesis that the faculty consists in an automatic process of “brain
                    registration,” every change of direction in the outgoing journey leaving behind
                    it a record in the cerebral nervous system, and therefore in the mind of the
                    animal, so that as a total result the general direction of the starting place is
                    retained in the memory,—just as we are ourselves able in a smaller degree to
                    preserve our general sense of direction when winding through the streets of a
                    town. One great difficulty attaching to this view appears to be that the animals
                    in question are able to find their way home over land even when they have made
                    their outward journey by sea, for it is evident that the difficulties of ‘ ‘
                    brain registration” must in such cases be indefinitely increased, not only by
                    the many meaningless movements of a vessel at sea, but still more by the fact
                    that the changes of direction made by the vessel, being made in long and easy
                    curves, and without muscular effort on the part of the animals, are movements
                    which we can scarcely suppose to be appreciated by the cerebral organization of
                    the animals. On the whole, therefore, with regard to the faculty of “homing,” as
                    with regard to the analogous if not identical faculty exhibited in migration, it
                    can only be said that further investigation is required in order to explain that
                    which, in the present state of our knowledge, must properly be regarded as
                    inexplicable.</p>
                <p>3. Mr Darwin has pointed out a serious difficulty lying against his theory of the
                    origin of instincts by natural selection, and one which, as he justly remarks,
                    it is surprising that no one should have hitherto advanced against the
                    well-known doctrine of inherited habit, as taught by Lamarck. The difficulty is
                    that among various species of social insects, such as bees and ants, there occur
                    “neuter” or asexual individuals, which manifest entirely different instincts
                    from the other or sexual individuals, and as the neuters cannot breed it is
                    difficult to understand how their peculiar and distinctive instincts can be
                    formed by natural selection, which, as we have seen, requires for its operation
                    the transmission of mental faculties by heredity. The only possible way in which
                    this difficulty can be met is the way in which it has been met by Mr Darwin,
                    viz., by supposing “that selection may be applied to the family as to the
                    individual.” “Such faith may be placed in the power of selection that a breed of
                    cattle always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns could, it is
                    probable, be formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and cows, when
                    matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and yet no one ox would ever have
                    propagated its kind”; and similarly, of course, with regard to the instincts of
                    neuters. As Mr Darwin has argued out this difficulty at length, it seems
                    unnecessary to say more with regard to it than that he has shown it to be not so
                    formidable as to exclude his doctrine as fully explanatory of such cases, when
                    we have already accepted his doctrine as explanatory of other cases.</p>
                <p>4. There are two or three other special instincts of minor importance<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n171/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0171-0160"/> the explanation of which is not as yet completely
                    clear. Thus it is not yet ascertained what hereditary influence it is that leads
                    the Norwegian lemming periodically to migrate westwards, with the result that
                    enormous numbers of the species are destroyed by drowning. But there can be
                    little doubt that this influence, whatever it was, was originally of benefit to
                    the species, for it would be a case standing out of all analogy if this instinct
                    should from its first origin have been, as it now appears to be, detrimental.
                    The only other instance that could be pointed to as wearing any such appearance
                    is that which has been alleged, but on very doubtful evidence, with regard to
                    the scorpion committing suicide by stinging itself to death when surrounded by a
                    ring of fire. It may be here incidentally observed that the fact of all the
                    innumerable multitude of animal instincts, with the exception of the two dubious
                    cases just mentioned, being of obvious use to the species which manifest them,
                    may properly be taken as the strongest possible evidence of the theory that
                    ascribes all instincts to the operation of natural selection.</p>
                <p>5. Lastly, we have an instinct which is pointed to by Mr Mivart as one that
                    cannot be explained by the influence of natural selection, or, as he would
                    appear to suggest, by the operation of any other natural cause. This instinct is
                    manifested by a certain wasp-like animal, and consists in this animal stinging
                    spiders in the particular part of the cephalo-thorax which contains the
                    principal nervous centre. The effect of stinging this nervous centre is that of
                    paralysing the spider without killing it, and the spider in this maimed
                    condition is then stored up with the larvae. of the fly, to serve as their food
                    when they quit the egg. It will be observed that there is here no question as to
                    the utility of the instinct to the species which manifests it, and the
                    difficulty to which Mr Mivart points consists merely in understanding how the
                    insect was in the first instance led to sting the spiders in precisely the right
                    spot to produce the particular results required. The answer to this single
                    remaining difficulty is that as yet the case has not been sufficiently observed
                    with a view to a possible solution of the difficulty. 1 seems, for instance, not
                    at all improbable that the striking of the spider’s ganglion by the sting of the
                    wasp is, as it were, wholly accidental, being determined only by the
                    circumstance that both the ganglion and the sting are organs which occur in the
                    median line of their respective possessors. Whether or not this is the
                    explanation of the supposed difficulty, it at least seems clear that the latter
                    is not one of any considerable magnitude. (G. J. B. )</p>
