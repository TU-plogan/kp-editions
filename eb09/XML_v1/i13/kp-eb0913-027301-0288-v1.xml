                <p><label type="entry">IRENAeUS</label>, bishop of Lyons in the end of the 2d
                    century, was one of the most distinguished of the theologians of the ante-Nicene
                    church. Very little is known of his early history, and the accounts given in
                    various biographies are for the most part conjectural He himself has informed us
                    that in his youth he was acquainted with Polycarp, the disciple of John
                    (Eusebius, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccl.,</hi> v. 20), and from this fact,
                    together with his Greek name, his early and thorough Christian training, and his
                    great acquaintance with Greek literature, it has been conjectured that he
                    belonged to the neighbourhood of Smyrna in Asia Minor, and that he was the child
                    of Christian parents. It is most probable that he died in the year 202, but the
                    date of his birth is quite uncertain; the best authorities place it between 120
                    and 140. How he, born and educated in Asia Minor, came to spend his life in Gaul
                    is also unknown. Eusebius tells us that he was a presbyter of Pothinus, bishop
                    of Lyons, and it has been inferred from that passage that he was ordained by
                    that bishop. In 177 the persecution under Marcus Aurelius reached Gaul, and the
                    members of the churches of Lyons and Vienne suffered severely (see the letter of
                    these churches to the brethren in Asia Minor and Phrygia, quoted by Eusebius,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccl.,</hi> v. 1). Pothinus the bishop was one of the
                    first martyrs. Irenaeus was called to succeed him and to fill the honourable but
                    dangerous post in the following year (178). Gregory of Tours has recorded his
                    wonderful success in the city of Lyons, which in a short time became almost
                    wholly Christian <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Eccl. Franc.,</hi> i. 27), and
                    tradition tells us of many scholars of Irenaeus who were notable missionaries
                    among the Pagan Gauls. Irenaeus, however, was best known by his endeavours to
                    counteract the teachings of the Gnostics, and his attempts to mediate between
                    the bishops of Rome and the churches of Asia Minor in their disputes about the
                    proper time at which to keep Easter. The Gnostic teacher whose views spread to
                    Gaul was Valentinus. He had come to Rome some time about the middle of the 2d
                    century, and disciples had tried to propagate his opinions among the Christians
                    in Gaul. It is said that the efforts of Irenaeus resulted in a council held at
                    Lyons, where the opinions of these Gnostics were condemned; but, as the evidence
                    for this statement is not probably older than the 9th century, it may be
                    considered doubtful. The Easter controversy, which lasted on to the council of
                    Nicaea in 325, and assumed various forms, had a very simple origin,—the question
                    whether, in reckoning the days on which our Lord died and rose again, Christians
                    should keep by thé day of the month simply, or so arrange it that the day to be
                    observed in commemoration of our Lord’s resurrection should always be a Sunday.
                    The sacrament of the Lord’s Supper was instituted on the 14th day of the J e
                    wish month Nisan, and it was the opinion of the churches of Asia Minor that that
                    day should always be observed; on the other hand, our Lord was crucified on a
                    Friday and rose again on a Sunday, and the churches of Alexandria and Rome held
                    that the two events should always be commemorated on a Friday and a Sunday
                    respectively. In the time of Irenaeus, Victor, bishop of Rome, made strenuous
                    endeavours to bring about uniformity of celebration; and, when he failed to
                    convince the churches of Asia Minor that the Western usage was right, he
                    proposed to declare these churches heterodox, and to cut them off from
                    ecclesiastical fellowship. The interference of Irenaeus was intended to dissuade
                    the pope from this hasty action, and his letter is interesting, not merely for
                    its peace-loving sentiments, but because of the valuable information it gives
                    upon the usages of the churches of the East and of the West <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi> Eusebius, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccl.,</hi> v. 24). Gregory of
                    Tours is our authority for saying that Irenaeus died a martyr in the persecution
                    under Severus; but, as this fact is not mentioned by Tertullian, Augustine,
                    Eusebius, Theodoret, and other early writers, it is considered doubtful by most
                    modern scholars. His death, whether crowned with the honour of martyrdom or not,
                    must have taken place near the beginning of the 3d century. Gregory tells us
                    that the bones of Irenaeus were buried under the altar of the church at Lyons.
                    The story that they were dug up and thrown into the street by the Calvinists in
                    1562 has been abundantly refuted.</p>
                <p>Irenaeus holds the same relation to the theology of the Greek fathers that
                    Tertullian does to the doctrinal system of the Church of the West. In tracing
                    back the history of a doctrine, it is common to find it first taking shape in
                    the writings of one or both of these early theologians. Hence the great value of
                    his writings. It is from Irenaeus also that we get the earliest form of the
                    creed which afterwards, through the labour of councils and theologians, became
                    what we now know as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan creed (Lumby’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Creeds,</hi> p. 14, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi>
                    Schaff, <hi rend="italic">The Creeds of the Latin and Greek Churches,</hi> p.
                    40). The only writing of Irenaeus which has come down to us, with the exception
                    of fragments, is his work <hi rend="italic">Against Heresies,</hi> and for this
                    reason his opinions are all expressed by way of controversy. The treatise is
                    divided into five books: of these the first two contain a minute description and
                    criticism of the tenets of various heretical sects, both Gnostic and Ebionite;
                    the other three set forth the true doctrines of Christianity, and it is from
                    them that we find out the theological opinions of the author. Irenaeus as a
                    Christian theologian lays great stress on the existence of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n289/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0289-0274"/> the Christian church, and on the necessity of
                    life within the church. Christianity does not consist merely in the possession
                    of knowledge, but in partaking in a life which is to be lived in the world and
                    beyond it. Believers have a common religious experience, and this rests both
                    upon facts outside · them and upon their association together within the church,
                    while it implies a community of knowledge. The church rests upon the common
                    facts contained, in the gospel history; her historical succession of pastors
                    places her in direct and outward relation to Christ, to whom her pastors ought
                    to be inwardly related also by spiritual consanguinity. Her common knowledge—the
                    true Gnosis, and not the false of the Gnostic—comes from the Holy Scriptures,
                    which in Old Testament and New are inspired by the Holy Spirit and contain the
                    truth of God. The church has also got, coming to her from apostolic times, and
                    giving authoritatively the interpretation of the Scripture, certain forms of
                    sound words or rules of faith which keep her from heresy. In speaking of God
                    Irenaeus is careful to insist that the God of the Christian church is the maker
                    of heaven and earth, and the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for it was a
                    Gnostic inference from the supposed sinfulness of matter that the good God could
                    not defile Himself with matter in a work of creation, and some carried their
                    antipathy to the Old Testament so far as to make the Hebrew Jehovah a malignant
                    deity whom Christ had come to destroy. Irenaeus is at pains to explain that
                    Christ, the Logos of God, the Saviour, is true man and true God, in opposition
                    to the Gnostic Docetae who taught that our Lord’s body was only an assumed
                    phantasm, and in contradiction to the Ebionites, who acknowledged Christ to be
                    the last of the prophets, and looked upon Christianity as Judaism with a new
                    prophet, but refused to confess him true God of true God. Irenaeus also lays
                    great stress upon the doctrine of the Trinity. His exposition is by no means
                    either so full or so precise as that of theologians who write after the council
                    of Nicaea, but he insists on the equality in divinity of the three persons,
                    Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The plan or method of salvation is commonly
                    represented under the idea of a covenant, which word is used more in the sense
                    of promise than of bargain. Sometimes the covenant is represented as
                    twofold,—that given to the favoured nation and symbolized in the Mosaic economy,
                    and that given to those who are not the descendants of Abraham and promised in
                    the gospel; sometimes it is fourfold, and Irenaeus speaks of a covenant given to
                    Noah, and renewed through Abraham and Moses, and lastly in the gospel of our
                    Lord. It is difficult to state with any precision what Irenaeus holds about the
                    nature of the effect of Christ’s work of reconciliation upon man. He makes great
                    use of metaphor, and evidently had not learnt to express himself otherwise. The
                    doctrine was still in its pictorial state in his mind. Still, traces appear of
                    that tendency afterwards common in the Greek Church to make the incarnation
                    rather than the crucifixion and ascension of our Lord the most important part of
                    his work, and to look upon the effect of that work as a transfusion of the
                    incarnation through redeemed humanity. The doctrine of the sacraments is also
                    too metaphorically expressed to admit of precise statement; but Irenaeus seems
                    to believe that in the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper it is the heavenly body of
                    Christ which is actually partaken of in the elements, and that such
                    participation gives immortality.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of the writings of Irenaeus comes principally from Eusebius. That
                    church historian tells us that Irenaeus wrote a <hi rend="italic">Letter to
                    Florinus,</hi> and a tract <hi rend="italic">On the Valentinian Octave</hi> (of
                    Aeons), both against Gnostic theories; a <hi rend="italic">Letter to Pope
                    Victor,</hi> and another <hi rend="italic">to</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Blastus,</hi> also at Rome, both on the Easter controversy; a work, probably on
                    apologetic, called ∏pδs "Eλληvαs λJγos . . . <hi rend="italic">ιreρl eπι- 7τημηs
                    iπιγeypaμμevos ',</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Picture of .Apostolic
                    Preaching·,</hi> and a book of aphorisms. According to Photius, Irenaeus wrote
                    also on the <hi rend="italic">Substance of the World.</hi> Fragments from these
                    lost works and perhaps from others have been recovered from Eusebius, from
                    Maximus of Turin, from Leontius of Byzantium, from John of Damascus, and from
                    several collections of fragments, some of which were discovered in European
                    libraries, and others came to the British Museum among Syriac MSS. from the
                    Nitrian convents. The only work of Irenaeus which has come to us entire is the
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">Against Heresies.</hi> The original Greek text,
                    except the greater part of the first book, which has been preserved in
                    quotations in Hippolytus and Epiphanius, has been lost, and the treatise has
                    been preserved in a somewhat barbarous Latin version. The first edition was
                    published by Erasmus in 1526. He used three MSS. which have since been lost. In
                    1570 Gallasius, a Calvinist professor in Geneva, published a new edition. He had
                    before him the Greek text as far as given in the quotations in Epiphanius. The
                    next important edition was that of Feuardent in 1596, and frequently reprinted.
                    Feuardent used a Vatican MS. In 1702 Grabe published at Oxford a new edition,
                    greatly better than preceding ones. He used the Aπιndel codex. In 1710 the
                    Benedictine Massuet published at Paris another edition, in which three new MSS.
                    were used. It long continued the standard, and forms the 5th volume of the Abbé
                    Migne’s <hi rend="italic">Pairologia</hi><hi rend="italic">Graeca,</hi> Paris,
                    1857. A valuable edition was published in 1849-53 by Adolph Stieren, which
                    really superseded the others. The fragments discovered among the Syriac MSS.,
                    however, are only to be found in the Cambridge edition of 1857, edited by the
                    Rev. Wigan Harvey. The extant writings of Irenaeus, including the fragments,
                    have been translatedand published in Clark’s <hi rend="italic">Ante-Nicene
                    Library.</hi> The facts of Irenaeus’s life and his dogmatic teaching and
                    ecclesiastical position may be learnt from the prefaces of Feuardent, Massuet,
                    and Stieren, as well as from such church historians as Tillemont, Schrock,
                    Neander, and Fr. Chr. Baur. There is a very valuable monograph upon Irenaeus in
                    Erseh and Gruber’s <hi rend="italic">Encyclopädie,</hi> II. section, vol.
                    xxiii., written by Stieren, the editor of the German edition. This was written,
                    however, before the Syriac versions were discovered. (T. Μ. L.)</p>
