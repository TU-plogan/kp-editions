                <p><label type="entry">LATIN LANGUAGE</label></p>
                <p>THE Latin language first appears in history as the language spoken in the plain
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Latium</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.vf</hi> In the 3d
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> at which date it first becomes known to
                    us from extant inscriptions and contemporary history, its range as a vernacular
                    was still limited to this district, although the arms of Rome had carried some
                    knowledge of it to the utmost boundaries of the peninsula of Italy. Of the
                    dialects commonly spoken outside the limits of Latium, two appear to have been
                    entirely distinct in character from the rest. In the extreme south-east,
                    inscriptions have been found in considerable numbers, written in a language
                    known as Iapygian or Messapian; but no progress has as yet been made in their
                    interpretation, and it is quite impossible to determine with certainty even to
                    what stock the language may have belonged. There are indications which seem to
                    point in the direction of some kinship with the Albanian, but these are far too
                    slight and untrustworthy to be accepted with any confidence. In Etruria, and at
                    one time in Campania and in the plain of the Po, a language was spoken the
                    affinities of which have not yet been determined satisfactorily (c∕. vol. viii.
                    pp. 638-39).</p>
                <p>The other dialects of the Italian peninsula may be divided into two main groups,
                    the Umbro-Sabellian and the Latin. The former is the more extensive in range in
                    the earlier historic times, and includes Umbrian and Oscau or Samnite, still
                    known to us by inscriptions, and (according to tradition) the language of the
                    Sabines, the Marsians, and the Volscians, of which but scanty traces remain. The
                    latter probably had in prehistoric times a much wider range than that to which
                    we find it afterwards confined. There are no facts to contradict the hypothesis,
                    to which a consideration of the geographical relations of the several tribes
                    seems to point, that at one time, not only Latium, but also Campania, Lucania,
                    Italia proper, and the eastern half of Sicily, were inhabited by tribes
                    belonging to the Latin race. But these regions were early subjected to
                    Hellenizing influences, or conquered by Sabellian invaders, and the only dialect
                    closely akin to the Latin of which any specimens are preserved in inscriptions
                    is that of Falerii in southern Etruria.</p>
                <p>The Umbro-Sabellian and the Latin share many characteristics which enable us to
                    unite them as members of a common Italian group; but what is the exact position
                    to be assigned to this group in the Indo-European stock is a question which
                    cannot be regarded as finally determined. Some scholars of eminence, as
                    Schleicher, maintain that its closest affinities are with the Celtic group,
                    mainly on the strength of the agreement of both in the loss of aspirates and
                    retention of spirants, in the form adopted for the expression of the middle or
                    reflexive voice in verbs, and in the dative plural, and on other less
                    significant points. But the more common opinion is that its connexion is closest
                    with the Hellenic group, and that we may safely assume the existence of a common
                    Italo·Hellenic nationality. Hence in vol. xi. pp. 130-131 an attempt was made to
                    reconstruct the main outlines of the language spoken by the ancestors of both
                    Greeks and Romans, and to point out what phonetic-changes and what developments
                    of inflexion must have already taken place. Starting from the basis there laid
                    down, we may now proceed to notice the following leading features, as marking
                    the course of the Italian group of languages after their separation from the
                    Hellenic group. Even for scholars who do not accept this genealogical
                    classification of languages such a survey will not be without its value as a
                    statement of the facts which every theory has to take into account.</p>
                <p>1. The vowels remained on the whole unaltered in Latin up to the time of the
                    earliest inscriptions. After that date there was a rapid development of a
                    tendency, of which traces are to be found even earlier, of the degradation of
                    the diphthongs to simple vowels. But in the earlier records we find, e.g., still
                    praidad = praeda (C. I. R., 63), utei = uti (ib., 196), virtutei = virtute (ib.,
                    34), ploirume =plurimi (ib., 32), Leucesius=Lucetius (Carm. Saliar. ), abdoucit=
                    abducit (C. I R., 30). Of these diphthongs ai is found almost exclusively in the
                    inscriptions older than the 7th century of Rome, in words afterwards spelt with
                    ae; ci is found representing an ë or an i as late as the time of Augustus; oi
                    occurs regularly for oe or ΰ up to the time of the Gracchi, and occasionally
                    later; eu is apparently found in the place of a later u only in the one form
                    quoted, although it is probable that in many cases ou represents a still earlier
                    eu, as is shown by Marti Loucekio (O'. I. Rhen., 929) by the side of Marti
                    Leucetio (ib. 930), and by the transliteration of Lucius by Λ∈υκιos; ou is found
                    regularly for u, with rare exceptions, up to the time of the Social War.</p>
                <p>Umbrian in this respect shows evidence of a much more rapid decay of the
                    vowel-system, and had reached, at the time at which we learn to know it, a stage
                    of monotony to which Latin only attained several centuries later: e.g., vinu=0.
                    Lat. veinδd, kvestur=O. Lat. quaistor, etu=O. Lat. eito, Aesë=Lat. ärae, tδru≈
                    Lat. tauros.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Oscan was much more faithful than the contemporary classical
                    Latin to the complex diphthong-system, coming in this respect very near to
                    archaic Latin: e.g., Fluus-aι∙ ≈ Florae, deicum (infinitive, answering to
                    dicere), tozdicom=tuticum (i.e., publicum).</p>
                <p>The change of o to u, u to i, and e to i takes place later. Within the history of
                    the Latin language the u retains its full sound, not weakened like the Greek υ
                    to ii.</p>
                <p>2. In respect of the consonants the principal change is in the aspirates. While a
                    comparison of Greek shows that they must have retained their character as sonant
                    aspirates up to the time of the separation, none of the Italian languages have
                    preserved them in this form. In Latin the guttural aspirate becomes g in the
                    middle of a word (comp. &amp;γχω and ango, λeiχω and lingo) and before r (comp.
                    grä-tu-s and χdριs, grando and χάλαγα); with a parasitic v frequently appended
                    (angui-s and iχι∙s), which sometimes leads to the loss of the g (brevi-s and
                    βραχύ-s). At the beginning it becomes h (hiemps and χιών, holus and χKo-h)
                    or/(/eland χόλ-os, for-mus and θeρ-μi-s), the two representative letters
                    sometimes alternating dialectically (haedus and faedτιs, our goat; fostis and
                    hostis, our guest). The dental aspirate became medially d (medius and μiσσos for
                    μeθ-yos), or sometimes b (τιber and obθap, ruber and i-pυθ-p6-s; comp, also
                    verbum and word, barba and beard), initially only f (fores and θύρα, ferus and
                    θήρ). The labial aspirate passes medially into b (ambo and &amp;μφω; comp,
                    navibus and vavφιv, containing the same element bhi, although the terminations
                    are not identical), initially into ∕ (fa-ri and Φnμi, fero and φeρω), and rarely
                    into h (perhaps dialectically in horda by the side of forda, and by
                    dissimilation in mi-hi for mi∙bi). Hence it appears that in Latin any one of the
                    three original aspirates may be represented by/; we may compare our laugh (Germ,
                    lachen), dιcαr∕(Germ. zwerg), Middle Eng. dwerth, the Russian Feodor for
                    Theodore, and the change in Greek from p-h (pronounced separately) to ph =f.</p>
                <p>The spirants (y, w, s), the loss of which is so marked a feature in the Greek
                    consonant-system, are retained with but few important exceptions. The most
                    important of these is the rhotacism whereby <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n345/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0345-0328"/> an s between two vowels passes regularly
                    (probably through the intermediate stage of a sibilant pronounced like z) into r
                    between two vowels, as in uro for an earlier usa. The loss of a y (z) between
                    vowels is not uncommon, e.g., sêdo for sedaio through sedao; it is less frequent
                    after consonants, as in obex for ob-iec-s; undeι ’ similar circumstances w (u)
                    disappears, as in amasti for amavisti, canis for cuanis.</p>
                <p>With regard to inflexion, the following may be noted as the chief developments
                    subsequent to the stage described in vol. xi. p. 131 :—</p>
                <p>1. In substantives there was a considerable extension of the class of z-stems,
                    due partly to new creations, partly to the transformation of stems belonging to
                    other classes. Thus a primitive gamι-s, Gr. βαρΰ-s, in Latin is grau-i-s, a
                    primitive kvan-s becomes cani-s. Very few of the Latin z-stems have
                    corresponding z’-stems in Sanskrit or Greek. In some cases the i appears to have
                    been originally an a; comp, imbri-and oμβpo-.</p>
                <p>2. The final -d of the ablative was retained, and (in Latin at any rate) the -bus
                    of the dative plural; on the other hand, the instrumental in -bhi (Gr. φι) does
                    not appear at all on Italian soil.</p>
                <p>3. The dual number was lost both in nouns and in verbs, as in the later
                    Greek.</p>
                <p>4. An entirely new system of inflexion for the reflexive tenses (the middle, or,
                    as it subsequently became, the passive voice) was created by the use of the
                    reflexive pronoun se as a suffix. (Whether this system is common to the Italian
                    and the Celtic languages, or •whether the apparently similar formations in the
                    latter are of different origin, is a question not yet definitely settled. )</p>
                <p>5. In many verbs the compound aorist with an s element was made by the action of
                    analogy into a perfect in si.</p>
                <p>6. Numerous verbs adopted for their perfect tenses a suffix in -vi or -ztz'. This
                    has been commonly supposed to represent a new process of combination with the
                    root bhu instead of es; but weighty objections have recently been brought
                    against this explanation, and it can no longer be propounded with
                    confidence.</p>
                <p>7. The root bhu was employed to form a past imperfect in -bam, and a future in
                    -bo; but in the case of consonant verbs and t-verbs the latter formation was
                    usually replaced by an optative form used as a future. ·</p>
                <p>8. Imperfect and pluperfect tenses of the subjunctive were formed apparently by
                    compounding the present and perfect stems with the optative of the root es, “to
                    be.”</p>
                <p>9. The infinitive and participle system received a considerable expansion,
                    especially by the formation of gerundives and supines, which, however, were
                    differentiated in, usage in the various Italian dialects (see below).</p>
                <p>10. The pronominal elements, though for the most part the same as in Greek, were
                    commonly used in composition one with another, and thus acquired a different
                    form. ’</p>
                <p>11. The «-class also was extended by the more common use of the suffix -tu for
                    verbal nouns.</p>
                <p>With regard to the vocabulary, very extensive additions were made, probably in
                    many instances from Celtic sources. Many of the most common Latin words are
                    entirely without demonstrable cognates in the other Indo-European languages;
                    and, even when the common root may be suggested with considerable plausibility,
                    the particular Latin word has evidently behind it a long and independent
                    history, during which its meaning and usage have been greatly modified. Hence
                    all attempts to deal with the etymology of the Latin stock of words are
                    confronted with a residuum which the materials at our command do not allow us to
                    deal with satisfactorily.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The Celtic element in Latin has been discussed by Professor Newman in his
                    Regal Rome, and more satisfactorily by Mr Wordsworth in an appendix to his
                    Lectures on Early Roman Literature; but the question still requires further
                    examination (comp, also Cuno’s Geschichte Italiens).</p></note></p>
                <p>The principal distinctions between the Latin branch of the Italian group and the
                    Umbro-Sabellian are the following:—</p>
                <p>1. Neither Umbrian nor Oscan had any character for o; for this the former
                    language used v=zz, c.g., puplum&lt;=populum; the latter û (perhaps
                    approximating to o), c.g., pud≈quod, or sometimes u, as in
                    aragetüd=argentδd.</p>
                <p>2. The Old Umbrian did not distinguish between surds and sonants in the case of
                    gutturals and dentals, having no g or &lt;Z; but both these letters were used in
                    Oscan.</p>
                <p>3. Oscan distinguished between i and i*, the latter a sound probably intermediate
                    between i and e.</p>
                <p>4. In Umbrian d, when occurring between vowels, or at the end of a word after a
                    vowel, was replaced by r, in later Umbrian by rs, e.g., asam ap=aram ad, i.e.,
                    ad aram, dupursus=bipedibus. K before e and z acquired a palatal sound, not
                    existing in Latin until long afterwards, which was denoted by <hi
                    rend="subscript"> f</hi> j, i.e., ç; e.g., ςcsna=cena,</p>
                <p>5. The Umbro-Sabellian dialects agreed in retaining the earlier genitive in s
                    (becoming afterwards in Umbrian r), e.g., Uιta-s, “of a city,” molta-s = multae,
                    while the Latin has in the case of a-, c-, and o-stems substituted for this a
                    form in z', probably a locative.</p>
                <p>6. They retain also the future compounded with cs, e.g., Umb.</p>
                <p>heriest, Osc. herest=volet, replaced in Latin either by the optative or by a new
                    form in -bo.</p>
                <p>7. Both Oscan and Umbrian allowed the velar guttural (q) to pass into p, as in
                    the Gallo-British branch of Celtic and in Greek, while this is never the case in
                    Latin; comp, qui-s and^zs, Quintius with its Samnite equivalent Pontius ≈
                    Pompeius.</p>
                <p>Three clearly marked stages present themselves in the history of the Latin
                    language (1) the archaic stage, previous to the development of literature; (2)
                    the stage of literary culture, during which the popular spoken language runs, as
                    it were, underground, giving but few traces of its existence; (3) the stage at
                    which the popular language reappears as colouring literature, and finally
                    recasting it in its own mould.</p>
                <p>The archaic stage is known to us almost wholly from inscriptions, and from
                    isolated forms and words quoted by the grammarians; although a careful study of
                    the phenomena of the diction and especially the metre of the early Roman
                    dramatists reveals to us many of its characteristic tendencies. It may be said
                    to have lasted until the time of Ennius (d. 169 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi>
                    whose growing influence is intimated in the epitaph composed for himself by
                    Naevius (d. 204 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.) :—</hi></p>
                <p>“itaque postquam est Orci traditus thesauro obliti sunt Romai loquier Latina
                    lingua.”</p>
                <p>Perhaps the oldest specimen of the Latin language preserved to us is to be found
                    in two fragments of the Carmina Saliaria preserved by Varro <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De ling. Lat.,</hi> vii. 26, 27), and one in Terentianus Scaurus, but
                    unfortunately they are so corrupt as to be quite unintelligible without the help
                    of very extensive conjectural changes in the reading <hi rend="italic"

                    one of the numerous tablets recording the transactions of the college of the

                    city of Rome; but this also supplies many points for discussion, and even its
                    general meaning is by no means clear <hi rend="italic">(ib.,</hi> pp. 203-11;

                <p>The text of the Twelve Tables (451-450 B.C.), if preserved in its integrity,
                    would have been invaluable as a record of antique Latin; but it is known to us
                    only in quotations, and it is doubtful whether any accurate reproduction of the
                    laws in their primitive form was accessible to our authorities. Hence the
                    language has been much modernized, and any archaic forms which have been
                    preserved are due rather to the citations of the grammarians than to continuous
                    quotations.</p>
                <p>Schoell, whose edition and commentary (Leipsic, 1866) is the most complete, notes
                    the following traces, among others, of an archaic syntax:—(1) both the subject
                    and the object of the verb are often left to be understood from the context,
                    c.g., ηi it αntestαmino, igitur em capito; (2) the imperative is used even for
                    permissions, si volet, plus dato, if he choose, he may give him more; (3) the
                    subjunctive is apparently never used in conditional, only in final sentences,
                    but the future perfect is common; (4) the connexion between sentences is of the
                    simplest kind, and conjunctions are rare; ast ( = sz)and igitur ( = tum demum)
                    have a different force from that found in later Latin. There are of course
                    numerous isolated archaisms of form and meaning, such as calvitur, pacunt, endo,
                    escit; but on the whole the diction cannot have been accurately preserved.</p>
                <p>In the case of inscriptions there is rarely any question of their faithful
                    reproduction of the language at the time at which they were made; but there may
                    be a difficulty about determining their date. Perhaps the oldest fragment of
                    Latin preserved in this way is furnished by a vessel dug up in the valley
                    between the Quirinâl and the Viminal early in 1880. The vessel is of a dark
                    brown clay, and consists of three small round pots, the sides of which are
                    connected together by short broad pipes, so that there is easy communication
                    from one to the other. All round this vessel runs an inscription, in three
                    clauses, two nearly continuous, the third written below; the writing is from
                    right to left, and is still clearly legible; the characters include some signs
                    not belonging to the Latin alphabet proper, but to the other Italian alphabet,
                    e.g., 4 for R, and I for Z, while the M has five strokes and the Q has the form
                    of a Koppa.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0346-0329"/>
                <p>The inscription is as follows :—</p>
                <p>Jovei Sat deivos qoi med mitat, nei ted endo cosmis virco sied, asted noisi Ope

                <p>The general style of the writing and the phonetic peculiarities make it pretty
                    certain that this work must have been produced not later than 300 B.C.; the
                    characters employed prove that the writer was familiar with one of the dialects
                    spoken in the hilly country to the east of Rome; but on the whole the language
                    may be taken as Latin. Some points in its interpretation are still open to
                    doubt;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comp. Jordan in
                    Hermes, xvi. 225-60; Bucheler in Rhein. Mus., xxxvi. 235 sg.</p></note> but the
                    probable interpretation is—</p>
                <p>Jovi Saturno divis qui ( = si quis) me mittet, ne te endo ( = in te) comis virgo
                    sit, ast nisi Opi Tutesiae pacari vis.</p>
                <p>Duenus me fecit in manum: enim die noni me mano stato.</p>
                <p>“If any one brings me to the gods Jupiter and Saturn, let not any maiden be
                    kindly to thee, except unless thou wilt offer a sacrifice to Ops Tutesia.</p>
                <p>“Duenus made me for the offering to the dead; therefore on the ninth day place me
                    for the offering for the dead.”</p>
                <p>The noteworthy phenomena here are the retention not only of ci but of the much
                    more archaic oi, apparently taking the place of the former by a dialectic
                    variation; ei in einom for a short c <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>, e for i in
                    feced, g before o, and dz apparently to represent the sound of dy (=H</p>
                <p>A bronze tablet recently discovered near the Fucine Lake, and some works of art
                    found at Palestrina, belong to the same period. They are undoubtedly Latin, but
                    the Latin has been mixed with other elements so that it would have been quite
                    unintelligible to a native of Rome.</p>
                <p>Of the earlier long inscriptions the most important would be the Columna
                    Rostrata, or column of Duilius, erected to commemorate his victory over the
                    Carthaginians in 260 B.C., but for the uncertainty as to the extent to which it
                    has suffered from the hands of restorers. The shape of the letters plainly shows
                    that the inscription, as we have it, was cut in the time of the empire. Hence
                    Ritschl and Mommsen suppose that the language was modified at the same time, and
                    that, although many archaisms have been retained, some were falsely introduced,
                    and others replaced by more modern forms. The most noteworthy features in it
                    are—C always for G (CESET=gess⅛), D retained in the ablative (e.g., in altod
                    marid), o for τι in inflexions (primos, exfodont = exfugiunt), single for double
                    consonants (closes=classes), c for i (navebos=navibus, exemet =∙ exemit) ∙, of
                    these the first is probably an affected archaism, G having been introduced some
                    time before the assumed date of the inscription. On the other hand, we have
                    praeda where we should have expected praida; no final consonants are dropped;
                    and the forms -es, -cis, and -is for the accusative plural are interchanged
                    capriciously. The doubts hence arising preclude the possibility of using it with
                    confidence as contemporary evidence for the state of the language.</p>
                <p>Of unquestionable genuineness and the greatest value are the Scipionum Elogia,
                    inscribed on stone coffins, found in the monument of the Scipios outside the
                    Capene gate. The earliest of the family whose epitaph has been preserved is L.
                    Cornelius Scipio Barbatus (consul 298 B.C.), the latest C. Cornelius Scipio
                    Hispanus (praetor in 139 B.C.); but there are good reasons for believing with
                    Ritschl that the epitaph of the first was not contemporary, but was somewhat
                    later than that of his son (consul 259 B.c.). The last may therefore be taken as
                    the earliest specimen of any length of Latin as it was written at Rome; it nnιs
                    as follows :—</p>
                <p>honcoino . ploirume . cosentiont. τ[omai] duonoro . optumo . fuise . uiro
                    [virorιrm] luciom . scipione . filios . barbati co]nsol . censor . aidilis . hic
                    . fuet a [pud ws] Λe]c . cepit. Corsica . aleriaque . urbe[m pugnandod] de]det .
                    tempestatebus . aide . mereto[d νoturn],</p>
                <p>The archaisms in this inscription are—(1) the retention of o for u in the
                    inflexion of both nouns and verbs; (2) the diphthongs oi ( = u) and ai (∙=ae)∙,
                    (3) -et for -it, hec for hie, and -ebus for -ibus∙, (4) the absence of doubled
                    consonants; and (5) duon-for bon-. On the other hand, the dropping of a final m
                    in every case except in Luciom is a sign of the tendency to lighten final
                    syllables, which is a marked characteristic of the language of this period.</p>
                <p>In the epitaph on Scipio Barbatus, o nowhere appears where the later language has
                    u, except in the doubtful case of Samnio (?—Samnium). The diphthongs oi and ai,
                    as well as ci, are found in the latest of all the Scipio inscriptions (aid. cur.
                    = aedilis curulis), as well as in the Epistola Consulum ad Teuranos (187 B.c.),
                    and in the almost exactly contemporary decree of L. Aemilius (Hermes, iii. 243
                    sg.); but in a somewhat earlier epitaph to a Scipio (L. Cornelius Cn. f. Cn. n.
                    Scipio) we have aetate. Of -et for -it and the like there is another example in
                    dedet (G. I. R., 63), comp, dede in C. I. R., 62; navebous (-bus) of the Duilian
                    column.</p>
                <p>Doubled consonants first appear in the decree of Aemilius, though not regularly
                    (comp, posedisent by essent and possidere)·, in the Epist. ad Teur. they are
                    still not used. Buonus is not found elsewhere, except in the Carmen Saliare, but
                    Buelonai for Bellonae appears in the Epist. ad Teur.; and duellum for bellum
                    occurs in Ennius and Plautus, as a legal archaism in Cicero, and as a poetic
                    variation in Horace, Ovid, and Juvenal.</p>
                <p>A number of precious indications of archaisms on the one hand and mutilated forms
                    on the other are supplied by dedicatory tablets of about the same age found in
                    Picenum and Latium. As specimens of the former we may select Muurte = Marti,
                    praidad= praeda, Junone=Junoni; of the ∖s∖texfledrot or dedro or dedcri =
                    dederunt, dede=dcdit, cupa=cubat; the omission of a final m is also common.</p>
                <p>It was a turning point in the history of the Latin language when Roman literature
                    took its rise under the influence of the Greek culture. It is a reasonable
                    conjecture that the much greater corruption of the Umbrian dialect as compared
                    with the Latin, and of the Latin as compared with the Oscan, in regard to the
                    precise representation of sound, was due mainly to the varying degrees of
                    contact with Greek civilization. The inscriptions dating from the 5th century of
                    the city show the greatest arbitrariness in such points as the insertion or
                    omission of final <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and rn, and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> before s, and in the distinction of e and <hi rend="italic">u,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> The language of Plautus shows
                    us the struggle of the two tendencies in the plainest manner. On the one hand we
                    have numerous archaisms not only in form but in quantity. Of the old long vowels
                    in final syllables we have the following still retained, not indeed always, but
                    when it is convenient for the verse :—</p>
                <p>-â in the nom. and voc. of the first declension:</p>
                <p>ne epistula quidem ulla sit in aédibus (Asin., 762).</p>
                <p>-bus in dat. and abl. plur. [usually when a pause in the sense affords some
                    justification]:</p>
                <p>ùt ego illic oculis exuram lâmpadibüs ardéntibus (Men., 842).</p>
                <p>ör in nom. of substantives, and comparatives, and also in verbs: modo, quom dicta
                    in me ingerebas, 6dium non uxor eram</p>
                <p>(Asin., 927).</p>
                <p>tanto mi aegritùdo auctiιo est in ânimo (bacchiac) (Caph, 782).</p>
                <p>pδl id quidem experior ita ut praedicas, Palacstιio (Mil., 633).</p>
                <p>-er in nom. :—</p>
                <p>méus fuit pat⅛r Antimachus, ego voeôr Lyconides (Aid., 772).</p>
                <p>-ït, not only in the subj. (where it is a contraction for -iêt) and in the perf.
                    ind., but even in the present:</p>
                <p>potionis aliquid, prius quam percipit insania (Men., 921).</p>
                <p>et:</p>
                <p>quod quisque in animo habet aut habitunist, sciunt (Trim, 206).</p>
                <p>[Ritschl, “in animod habet ’’].</p>
                <p>ät:</p>
                <p>fùndum alienum arδt, incultum familiarem deserit (Asin., 874).</p>
                <p>On the other hand we have much more commonly traces of the destructive influence
                    which was beginning to affect so powerfully the form of Latin words, especially
                    in their final syllables. From causes which it is now impossible to discover,
                    the freer accentuation of earlier times, the existence of which was proved
                    incidentally by Verner in his famous paper on some exceptions to the law of
                    “Lautverschiebung” (Kuhn’s <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift,</hi> xxiii. 97-138),
                    had been given up in favour of a more rigid system, which never allowed the
                    accent to fall on the final syllable. Hence there was a constant struggle
                    between the desire to preserve the older quantity of the final vowel and the
                    tendency to shorten an unaccented syllable. This difficulty of preserving the
                    quantity of the final vowel is naturally greatest when the accented syllable is
                    short; hence we are led to the formula that for Plautus, and therefore for the
                    spoken language of his time“^ .</p>
                <p>This holds good for all vowels, whether in nouns or in verbs, c.g.: a: satis si
                    futurumst; rogä me viginti minas (Pseud., 114).</p>
                <p>e: cave praéterbitas ιillas aedis quin roges (Epid., 433).</p>
                <p>i: meri bellatores gignuntur, quas hic praegnantis fecit(JΛ7., 1077).</p>
                <p>o: ηόνδ liberto opus est quod pappet, dabitur, praebebo cibum (Epid., 727).</p>
                <p>u: quod manù nequeunt tangere, tantum fas habent, quo manus apstineant (Trim,
                    288).</p>
                <p>The last case is a rare one; the others are very common.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n347/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0347-0330"/>
                <p>But further, forms like those quoted above from the inscriptions, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., dedro, oino,</hi><hi rend="italic">cuba,</hi> &lt;tc., led
                    Ritschl and his followers to the recognition of the fact that even at this early
                    time there was a strong tendency to drop the final consonant in Latin; and this
                    at once furnished a clue to the proper interpretation of many metrical phenomena
                    in Plautus, which had previously been explained on wholly incorrect
                    assumptions.</p>
                <p>In the case of a line like Trim, 306, né tibi aegritùdinem pater parerem, parsi
                    sédulo, it was assumed that pater was pronounced like p'ere, in order to avoid
                    the apparent neglect of the law of position, which would, according to the
                    practice of the classical poets, have lengthened the syllable -ter. Two
                    considerations suffice to dispose of this hypothesis :—first, there is no
                    evidence whatever that a mute between two vowels was ever dropped in early
                    Latin; secondly, if pater become by “compression” père, it would be natural to
                    find mater becoming mère; but in no case does a form with the first syllable
                    long and the second lengthened by position take the place of one long syllable.
                    On the other hand, there is positive evidence of a varied and unquestionable
                    character to show that a final consonant was frequently dropped in
                    pronunciation, especially in an iambic word. Hence it is clear that pater was
                    pronounced pâté, notiere. This shows too that it was not the case, as has been
                    asserted, that a final r was dropped only when it took the place of an earlier
                    s, although this is doubtless the most common instance of its omission. The
                    consonants most commonly dropped are the following :—</p>
                <p>s: e.g., nimi(s) lépide fecit verba ad parsimoniam (Aid., 493).</p>
                <p>This licence is retained by Ennius (e.g., Ann., 601, turn laterali(s) dolor,
                    certissumu(s) nuntiu(s) mortis), and is common even in Lucretius. Cicero (Orat.,
                    48, 161) speaks as if it had been the usual pronunciation in his own earlier
                    days, and he admits it seven or eight times in his version of Aratus, e.g.,
                    magnu(s) Leo, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>m: e.g., dιim quide(m) ne quid perconteris quod mi haud lubeat prôloqui.</p>
                <p>The practice of eliding a syllable ending in m before a tollowing vowel shows how
                    lightly this consonant was pronounced even by the classical poets. It is very
                    frequently omitted in inscriptions of every period (comp. Corssen, i. 267-74).
                    As Quintilian (ix. 4, 40) says, ‘ ‘ m parum exprimitur . . . neque enim
                    eximitur, sed obscuratur.” In this respect Umbrian quite agreed with popular
                    Latin, but Oscan and Volscian carefully preserved the m (Corssen, i. 276).</p>
                <p>t: e.g., set ârraboni dédi(t) quadraginta minas (Most., 648).</p>
                <p>So in inscriptions dede (C. I. L., i. 621&amp;).</p>
                <p>d: e.g., hie apu(d) nos magna tfirba ac magna fâmiliast (Aul., 340).</p>
                <p>r: as above; or, e.g., pater vénit. sed quid pertimui autem, bélua (Ter., Phοrm.,
                    601).</p>
                <p>l: e.g., et simu(l) conficiam facilius ego quôd volo (Ter., Heaut., 803).</p>
                <p>n: e.g., aùt quid istuc est quôd vos agitis? non licet, tame(n) sùs-picor (Ter.,
                    Ilee., 874).</p>
                <p>It'is doubtful whether the last two licences occur in Plautus.</p>
                <p>Occasionally we find these two tendencies concurring, and producing a short final
                    syllable by the loss of a final consonant and the shortening of a vowel
                    naturally long under the influence of the accent; so that we have forms like
                    οves, bονes, vides, rogas, manus, scanned as two short syllables, not only (a)
                    before vowels, but (b) even before consonants, e.g. :—</p>
                <p>(a) âsini mordicùs me scindunt, b&lt;5ves incursent côniibus (Aul., 232).</p>
                <p>(b) foräs foras lumbrice qui sub terra erepsisti modo (Aul., 620). viros nostros
                    quibus tii nos voluisti ésse matres familias (Stich.,</p>
                <p>98).</p>
                <p>âd papillas manus ferat, labra à labris nusquam aùferat (Bacch., 480).</p>
                <p>The tendency to drop the final consonant of an iambic word is further extended to
                    groups of words of the same scansion, especially when the second is a
                    preposition, as in quis ad fores est? &amp;c. (Amphitr., 1014).</p>
                <p>opta id, quod iit contingat tibi vis (Asin., 713).</p>
                <p>Accent had also an important effect in inducing the voice to hurry over
                    unaccented syllables, even though long by position, in order to lay full stress
                    upon an accented syllable. But this naturally took place only when the syllable
                    thus shortened was itself preceded by a short syllable so that the formula for
                    this process is <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi>-- = <hi rend="superscript">
                    v</hi> "" . Under this head we may bring a large number of instances of apparent
                    neglect of quantity. Many of these are cases where the usual spelling is with a
                    double consonant. Some have argued that as doubled consonants were not used in
                    writing before the time of Ennius <hi rend="italic">(Fest., s. v.</hi>
                    “Solitaurilia,” p. 293, confirmed from inscriptions by Ritschl, <hi
                    rend="italic">P, L. Μ. E.,</hi> p. 123), this is an indication that the
                    pronunciation fluctuated; but it is doubtful whether this was ever the case
                    except under the influence of the accent; and this influence was quite as
                    powerful over syllables followed by two different consonants as by a doubled
                    consonant.</p>
                <p>Thus, per annonam caram dixit me natιim pater (Stich., 179) does not differ in
                    principle from quia omnis bonas bonâsque adcurare addecet (Trim, 78); and the
                    unusual quantity of the last two words in nos potius onerémus nosmet vieïssatim
                    voliiptatibus (Stich., 532) is to be explained in precisely the same way, except
                    that in the latter the voice is hurrying on to dwell upon a long accented
                    syllable, in the former the accent has already fallen on a short accented
                    syllable, a fact which naturally tends to shorten the following unaccented one.
                    Compare for this configo sagittis fures thensaurârios (Aul., 395) where Goetz
                    after Fleckeisen reads “sagitis.”</p>
                <p>The combinations before which position is most commonly neglected are the
                    following :—</p>
                <p>nt: si id mea voluntate factumst (Trim, 1166).</p>
                <p>pt: voluptatem inesse tântam (Rud., 459).</p>
                <p>st: magistratus, si quis me hanc habere viderit (Rud., 477).</p>
                <p>rn: cassidem in capfit,dormiboplacided in tabernaculo (Trim,726).</p>
                <p>ps: scio apsûrde dictum hoc dérisores dicere (Capt., 69).</p>
                <p>rg: séd sine argento fnistra es . . . (Pseud., 378).</p>
                <p>It is needless to dwell further upon the details of Plautine scansion. The
                    foregoing instances will have made it clear that, while there are some archaisms
                    still retained, on the whole the language was beginning to suffer from that
                    process of disintegration, which has left such marked traces upon almost every
                    modern language.</p>
                <p>The introduction of Greek metres for the drama doubtless did much to check this
                    process, and it is probable that, even in the earliest Roman comedies, licences
                    of pronunciation are much less common than they were in the popular language of
                    the time. But the iambic and trochaic measures, especially as employed by the
                    Roman poets, admitted of a free treatment, which left room for much laxity. It
                    was not until the hexameter came to be used for poetry that the laws of prosody
                    were definitely fixed. The rigid canons of dactylic verse required that the
                    pronunciation should be strictly determined; and hence Ennius, although he does
                    not appear to have introduced any marked changes in generally recognized rules
                    of quantity, was compelled to settle positively much which had previously been
                    fluctuating, and so to lay down the lines to which subsequent poetical works had
                    to conform. From this time forward the literary language of Rome parted company
                    from the popular dialect. It has been said with truth that even to the classical
                    writers Latin was in a certain sense a dead language. Its vocabulary was not
                    identical with that of ordinary life. Literary works, whether in prose or in
                    verge, had to conform to a fixed standard. Now and again a writer of fresh
                    originality would lend new vigour to his style by phrases and constructions
                    drawn from homely speech. But on the whole, and in ever increasing measure, the
                    language of literature was the language of the schools, adapted to foreign
                    models. The genuine current of Italian speech is lost to view with Plautus and
                    Terence, and reappears only in the semi-barbarous products of the early Romance
                    literature.</p>
                <p>This appears the proper place for a rapid survey of the pronunciation of the
                    Latin language, as spoken in its best days.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Consonants.</hi> —1. Guttural, (a) Sonant G, pronounced
                    as in English, but never softened before about the 6th century after Christ. (b)
                    Surd C, pronounced always as <hi rend="italic">k</hi><note anchored="true"

                    i. xlvii.-liv. It may be summed up as follows:—(1) In some words the letter
                    following <hi rend="italic">c</hi> varies in a <pb n="331"/> manner which makes
                    it impossible to believe that the pronunciation of the <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    depended upon this, e.g., decurnus and decimus, capis and recipis; (2) if <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> was pronounced before e and i otherwise than before a, o,
                    and u, it is hard to see why k should not have been retained for the latter use;
                    (3) no ancient writer gives any hint of a varying pronunciation of <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi>; (4) a Greek κ is always transliterated by <hi

                    containing <hi rend="italic">c</hi> borrowed by Gothic and early High German are
                    always spelt with k. To these arguments it may be added that the varying
                    pronunciations of <hi rend="italic">ce</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ci</hi> in the
                    Romance languages are inexplicable except as derived independently from an

                    about the 7th century after Christ. K went out of use at an early period, except
                    in a few old abbreviations for words in which it had stood before a, e.g., kal.
                    for kalendae. Q always followed by the consonantal u, except in a few old
                    inscriptions, in which it is followed by the vowel u, e.g., pequnia. X, an
                    abbreviation for cs; xs is, however, sometimes found. (c) Aspirate H, the rough
                    breathing as in English.</p>
                <p>2. Palatal. The spirant J, like the English y; it is only in late inscriptions
                    that we find, in spellings like Zamιari, Giove, any indication of a
                    pronunciation like the English.</p>
                <p>3. Lingual, (a) R as in English, but probably produced more with the point of the
                    tongue, (δ) L as in English, (c) S, always surd when initial, but at one time
                    sonant between vowels, and possibly when final, (d) Z only found in the
                    transcription of Greek words in and after the time of Cicero.</p>
                <p>4. Dental, (a) Sonant, D as in English; but by the end of the 4th century di
                    before a vowel was pronounced like our j (comp. diurnal and journal). (δ) Surd,
                    T as in English, (c) Nasal, N as in English; but also (like the English n) a
                    guttural nasal (ng) before a guttural. Apparently it was very lightly
                    pronounced, and easily fell away before s.</p>
                <p>5. Labials, (a) Sonant, B as in English; but occasionally in inscriptions of the
                    later empire υ is written for b, showing that in some cases b had already
                    acquired the soft sound of the contemporary β. B before a sharp s was pronounced
                    p, e.g., in urbs. (b) Surd, P as in English, (c) Nasal, M as in English, but
                    very slightly pronounced at the end of a word, (d) Spirant, V like the oit in
                    Fr. oui, but probably often approximating to the South German w, i.e., a labial,
                    not (like the English ν) a labio-dental v.</p>
                <p>6. Labio-dental. Spirant, F as in English.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Vowels.—</hi> &lt;i, ü, î, as the English ah, oo, ee∙,
                    δ, a sound coming nearer to aw than the English ö; ê, an open Italian e, nearly
                    as the vowel of pet lengthened. The short sound of each vowel was probably
                    identical in quality with the long sound, differing only in quantity. Hence a
                    was pronounced as in the French chatte, U nearly as in pull, ï nearly as in pit,
                    o as in dot, é nearly as in p?t. The diphthongs were produced by pronouncing the
                    vowels of which they were composed very rapidly according to the above scheme.
                    This gives—au somewhat broader than ou in house; eu like ow in the Yankee
                    pronunciation of town·, ae like the vowel in hat lengthened, with perhaps
                    somewhat more approximation to the i in wine; oe, a sound intermediate between o
                    and e; ei, nearly as in feint, with the greater stress on the i; ui, as the
                    French oui.</p>
                <p>The changes which may be detected in the Latin language during the period of its
                    literary development may be arranged under the heads of (1) vocabulary, (2)
                    inflexion, (3) word formation, (4) syntax.</p>
                <p>These will be best regarded separately in connexion with the four principal
                    stages in the history of the language, which may be given, with their chief
                    writers, as follows :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Ante-Classical</hi> (240-80 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi>
                    —Naevius (1 269-204), Plautus (254-184), Ennius (239-169), Cato (234-149),
                    Terentius (1 195-159), Pacuvius (220-132), Accius (170-94), Lucilius (?
                    168-103).</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Classical—Golden Age</hi> (80 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.-14
                    a,d.).</hi> —Varro (116-28), Cicero (106-44), Lucretius (99-55), Caesar
                    (100-44), Catullus (87-? 47), Sallust (86-34), Virgil (70—19), Horace (65-8),

                    a.d.).</hi></p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Classical—Silver Age</hi> (14-180 A.D.).—Velleius (? 19
                    B.c.-? 31 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> M. Seneca (died <hi rend="italic"

                    (42—118), Plinius minor (61-1113), Tacitus (?60—? 118), Juvenal (? 47-? 138),
                    Suetonius (75-160), Fronto (c. 90-170).</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Post-Classical.</hi></p>
                <p>The additions made to the vocabulary of the Latin language from the Greek belong
                    to four different stages (Corssen, ii. 814). The first corresponds to the period
                    of the early intercourse of Rome with the Greek states, especially with the
                    colonies in the south of Italy and Sicily. To this stage belong many names of
                    nations, countries, and towns, as <hi rend="italic">Siculi,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tarentum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Graeci, Achivi,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Karthago,</hi><hi rend="italic">Poenus;</hi> and also names of
                    weights and measures, articles of industry, and terms connected with navigation,
                    as <hi rend="italic">drachuma, mina, talentum,</hi><hi rend="italic">purpura,
                    machina, patina,</hi><hi rend="italic">ancora, aplustre, nausea.</hi> To these
                    may be added names of gods or heroes, like <hi rend="italic">Apollo,
                    Pollux,</hi> and perhaps <hi rend="italic">Hercules.</hi> These were all freely
                    adapted to the phonetic laws of the Latin language.</p>
                <p>A second stage is marked by the closer intercourse resulting from the conquest of
                    southern Italy, and the wars in Sicily, and by the contemporary introduction of
                    imitations of Greek literature into Rome, with its numerous references to Greek
                    life and culture. In this stage, also, Greek words were freely adapted to the
                    forms familiar to Roman ears: we find words like <hi rend="italic"
                    >pessulus,</hi><hi rend="italic">scutula, amurca,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fungus,</hi><hi rend="italic">balineum, bucina, techina, comissari,
                    canistrum,</hi><hi rend="italic">career,</hi><hi rend="italic">sona</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(ζώνη),</hi><hi rend="italic">tarpessita,</hi> &amp;c. In many
                    cases hybrid forms are freely employed, whether by the addition of Latin
                    suffixes to Greek stems as <hi rend="italic">ballistarius, hepatarius,
                    subbasilicanus,</hi><hi rend="italic">sycophantiosus,</hi> or of Greek suffixes
                    to Latin stems as <hi rend="italic">plagipatidas,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pernonides</hi>; or by derivation, as <hi rend="italic">thermopo-lare,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">supparasitari</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or by composition as
                    <hi rend="italic">ineuscheme,</hi><hi rend="italic">thyrsigerae,
                    flagritribae,</hi><hi rend="italic">scrophipasci.</hi> The character of many of
                    these words shows that the comic poets who indulged in them must have been able
                    to calculate upon a fair knowledge of colloquial Greek on the part of a
                    considerable portion of their audience. The most remarkable instance of this is
                    supplied by the burlesque lines in Plautus <hi rend="italic">(Pers.,</hi> 702
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> where Sagaristio describes himself as</p>
                <p>Vaniloquidorus, Virginisvendonides, Nugi·palamloquides, Argentumexterebronides,
                    Tedigniloquides, Nummosexpalponides, Quodsemelarripides,
                    Nunquampostreddonides.</p>
                <p>During this period Greek words are generally inflected according to the Latin
                    usage.</p>
                <p>But with Accius begins a third stage, in which the Greek inflexion is frequently
                    preserved, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Hectora,</hi><hi rend="italic">Oresten,
                    Cithaeron</hi>; and from this time forward the practice wavers. Cicero generally
                    prefers the Latin case-endings, defending, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Piraeeum</hi> as against <hi rend="italic">Piraeea (Ad Att.,</hi>
                    vii. 3, 7), but not without some fluctuation, while Varro takes the opposite
                    side, and prefers <hi rend="italic">poemasin</hi> to the Ciceronian <hi
                    rend="italic">poematis.</hi> By this time also <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> were introduced, and words newly borrowed from the Greek
                    were faithfully reproduced.</p>
                <p>A fourth stage is marked by the practice of the Augustan poets, who, especially
                    when writing in imitation of Greek originals, freely use the Greek inflexions,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Arcades, Tethy,</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegida,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Echus,</hi> &amp;c. Horace probably always used the Greek form in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Odes,</hi> the Latin in his <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Epistles.</hi> Later prose writers for the most part
                    followed the example thus set.</p>
                <p>In Plautus we have the best example of the vigorous native Italian idiom,
                    enriched, but in no way fettered by imitation of the Greek. His constructions
                    are sometimes free, and do not square with the canons of later grammarians; but
                    there is much life and freshness, and it is very rarely that the right phrase is
                    lacking to set forth his meaning with telling vigour.</p>
                <p>The chief peculiarities of his grammar are :—</p>
                <p>1. The use of some substantives with a gender different from that afterwards
                    usual, c.g., dorsus, collus, nasum.</p>
                <p>2. The retention of inflexions afterwards obsolete or retained only in archaic
                    phrases: -iin the subj. pres., duint, creduis, posivi, die septimi. With regard
                    to some of these archaic inflexions it is still a question how far they may be
                    safely restored to the text of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n349/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0349-0332"/> Plautus; e.g., homoncm, cubi, tunde, &amp;c., the
                    ablative d, nom. plur. in -is, as fundis.</p>
                <p>3. The use of words excluded from the language of classical literature, but
                    reappearing in the popular dialect: e.g., suppetias iri, bakuere, clepere,
                    bellus, exinterare, cxanclare, nautea, saυium, &amp;c. Under this head we may
                    place the very frequent employment of diminutives, e.g., papillarum horridularum
                    oppressiunculae, especially as terms of endearment, “maim corculum, melculum,
                    verculum, <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> passerculum, haedillum, vitellum,
                    aneticulam, monerulam, catellum, putellum, &amp;c., the use of con, ad, and de
                    as strengthening particles, and of abstract words, especially in the plural,—all
                    marks of the plebeius sermo.</p>
                <p>4. Syntactical constructions afterwards unusual: e.g., the accusative after verbs
                    like fungor and utor; the accusative of the object after the gerundive
                    (agitandumst vigilias'); the indicative in indirect questions and with cum
                    signifying “since” or “although”; present infinitive instead of future after
                    verbs of promising; quia after verbs of feeling, instead of quod, quoniam
                    “since,” “after”; infinitive with purpose of motion; consulo and condono with
                    double accusative; decorus, aequus, and expers with ablative; vereor with
                    genitive; similis with genitive; quid hoc est hominis; facere tueri, compendi;
                    faxo with a future logically dependent; the frequent use of figura etymologica,
                    satin ut, praequam, praeiit. There is a free use of verbals in -tio: quid tibi
                    hanc curatio est rem aut muttitio. By a laxity common in popular language verbs
                    of seeing, knowing, asking, &amp;c., are followed by a direct, not an indirect,
                    question: scire volo, quoi reddidistii Asyndeton is very frequently employed to
                    give life and rapidity to the style: e.g. (Pseud., 168), lepido victu, vino,
                    unguentis, inter pocula pulpamentis.</p>
                <p>In Naevius we find archaisms proportionally much more numerous than in Plautus,
                    especially in the retention of the original length of vowels, and early forms of
                    inflexion, such as the genitive in <hi rend="italic">-as,</hi> and the ablative
                    in <hi rend="italic">-d</hi>; shortenings do not seem so numerous. The number of
                    archaic words preserved is perhaps due to the fact that εo large a proportion of
                    his fragments have been preserved only by the grammarians, who cited them for
                    the express purpose of explaining these. The language of Ennius deserves
                    especial study because of the immense influence which he exerted in fixing the
                    literary style. He first established the rule that in hexameter verse all vowels
                    followed by two consonants (except in the case of a mute and .a liquid) or a
                    double consonant, must be treated as lengthened by position. The number of
                    varying quantities is also much diminished, and the elision of final <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> becomes the rule, though not without exceptions. On the
                    other hand he very commonly retains the original length of verbal terminations
                    <hi rend="italic">{ponνt,</hi><hi rend="italic">esset, faciet)</hi> and of
                    nominatives in <hi rend="italic">or</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and
                    elides final s before an initial consonant. In declension he never uses <hi
                    rend="italic">-ae</hi> as the genitive, but <hi rend="italic">-ai</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">-as</hi>; he has an inflexion <hi rend="italic">Mettoeo
                    Fufetioeo,</hi> probably intended for a dative; the shorter form of the gen.
                    plur. is <hi rend="italic">-um</hi> in common; obsolete forms of pronouns are
                    used, as <hi rend="italic">mis, olli, sum</hi> ( = eum), <hi rend="italic">sas,
                    sos, sapsa</hi>; and in verbal inflexion there are irregularities like <hi
                    rend="italic">morimur, fuimus,</hi><hi rend="italic">ρotestur,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">contudit,</hi> &amp;c. Some experiments in the way of tmesis (saxo
                    <hi rend="italic">cere</hi> comminuit <hi rend="italic">-brum)</hi> and apocope
                    (divum domus altisonum <hi rend="italic">cael,</hi> replet te laetificum <hi
                    rend="italic">gau)</hi> were happily regarded as failures, and never took root
                    in the language. His syntax is simple and straightforward, with the occasional
                    pleonasms of a rude style, and conjunctions are comparatively rare. Pacuvius is
                    noteworthy especially for his attempt to introduce a free use of compounds after
                    the fashion of the Greek, which were felt in the classical times to be unsuited
                    to the genius of the Latin language. Quintilian censures severely his line—</p>
                <p>Nerei repandirostrum incurvicervicum pecus.</p>
                <p>Accius, though probably the greatest of the Roman tragedians, is only preserved
                    in comparatively unimportant fragments. We know that he paid much attention to
                    grammar and orthography; and his language is much more finished than that of
                    Ennius. It shows no marked archaisms of form, unless the infinitive in <hi
                    rend="italic">-ier</hi> is to be accounted as such.</p>
                <p>Lucilius furnishes a specimen of the language of the period, free from the
                    restraints of tragic diction and the imitation of Greek originals. Unfortunately
                    the greater part of his fragments are preserved only by a grammarian whose text
                    is exceptionally corrupt; but they leave no doubt as to the justice of the
                    criticism passed by Horace on his careless and “muddy” diction. The <hi
                    rend="italic">urbanitas</hi> which is with one accord conceded to him by ancient
                    critics seems to indicate that his style was regarded as free from the taint of
                    provincial Latinity, and it may be regarded as reproducing the language of the
                    educated circles in ordinary life; even the numerous Graecisms and Greek
                    quotations with which it abounds show the familiarity of his readers with the
                    Greek language and literature. Varro ascribes to him the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gracile genus</hi><hi rend="italic">dicendi,</hi> the distinguishing features
                    of which were <hi rend="italic">venustas</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >subtilitas.</hi> Hence it appears that his numerous archaisms were regarded as
                    in no way inconsistent with grace and precision of diction. But it may be
                    remembered that Varro was himself something of an archaizer, and also that the
                    grammarians’ quotations may bring this aspect of his language too much into
                    prominence. It is to be feared that the disgusting coarseness of many of his
                    lines did not lose them favour with the circle for whom he wrote. He shares with
                    the comic poets the use of many plebeian expressions, the love for diminutives,
                    abstract terms, and words of abuse; but occasionally he borrows from the more
                    elevated style of Ennius forms like <hi rend="italic">simitu</hi> ( = simul),
                    <hi rend="italic">ηoenu ( = non),</hi><hi rend="italic">facul</hi> ( = facile),
                    and the genitive in <hi rend="italic">-ai,</hi> and he ridicules the
                    contemporary tragedians for their <hi rend="italic">zetematia,</hi> their
                    high-flown diction and <hi rend="italic">sesquipedalia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >verba,</hi> which make the characters talk “not like men but like portents,
                    flying winged snakes.” In his ninth book he discusses questions of grammar, and
                    gives some interesting facts as to the tendencies of the language. For instance,
                    when he ridicules a <hi rend="italic">praetor τιrbanus</hi> for calling himself
                    <hi rend="italic">pretor,</hi> we see already the beginning of the confusion of
                    <hi rend="italic">ae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which afterwards became
                    universal. He shows a great command of technical language, and (partly owing to
                    the nature of the fragments) <hi rend="italic">a∙πaζ λeγogeνα</hi> are very
                    numerous.</p>
                <p>The treatise of Cato <hi rend="italic">De Re</hi><hi rend="italic">Rustica</hi>
                    would have afforded invaluable material, but it has unfortunately come down to
                    us in a text greatly modernized. As it is, it is of interest from the point of
                    view of literature rather than of language. We find in it instances of the
                    accusative with <hi rend="italic">υti,</hi> of the old imperative <hi
                    rend="italic">praefarnino,</hi> and of the fut. subj. <hi rend="italic"
                    >servassis, pτohibessis</hi>; but there is nothing which can be added to what we
                    learn from Plautus.</p>
                <p>It is unfortunately impossible to trace the growth of Latin prose diction through
                    its several stages with the same clearness as in the case of poetry. The
                    fragments of the earlier Latin prose writers are too scanty for us to be able to
                    say with certainty when and how a formed prose style was created. But the
                    impulse to it was undoubtedly given in the habitual practice of oratory. The
                    earliest orators, like Cato, were distinguished for strong common sense, biting
                    wit, and vigorous language, rather than for any graces of style; and probably
                    personal <hi rend="italic">auctoritas</hi> was of far more account than rhetoric
                    both in the law courts and in the assemblies of the people. The first public
                    speaker, according to Cicero, who aimed at a polished style, and elaborate
                    periods, was M. Aemilius Lepidus Porcina, in the middle of the 2d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Cicero also refers to certain scripiα dulcissima of the son of Scipio
                    Africanus Major, which must have possessed some merits of style.</p></note> On
                    his model the Gracchi and Carbo fashioned themselves, and, if we may judge from
                    the fragments of the orations of C. Gracchus which are preserved, there were few
                    traces of archaism remaining. A more perfect example of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >urbanitas</hi> at which good speakers aimed was supplied by a famous <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n350/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0350-0333"/> speech of C. Fannius against C. Gracchus, which
                    Cicero considered the best of all orations of the time. No small part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">urbanitas</hi> consisted in a pronunciation equally removed from
                    boorish roughness and from foreign affectations; and the standard of this was
                    found in the language of the women of the upper classes, such as Laelia and
                    Cornelia.</p>
                <p>In the earliest continuous prose work which remains to us, the four books <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Rhetorica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Herennium,</hi> we find the language already almost
                    indistinguishable from that of Cicero. There lias been much discussion as to the
                    authorship of this work, now commonly, without very convincing reasons, ascribed
                    to Q. Cornificius; but, among the numerous arguments which prove that it cannot
                    have been the work of Cicero, none has been adduced of any importance drawn from
                    the character of the language. It is worth while noticing that not only is the
                    style in itself perfectly finished, but the treatment of the subject of style,
                    <hi rend="italic">elocutio</hi> (iv. 12, 17), shows the pains which had already
                    been given to the question. The writer lays down three chief requisites—(1) <hi
                    rend="italic">elegantia,</hi> (2) <hi rend="italic">compositio,</hi> and (3) <hi
                    rend="italic">dignitas.</hi> Under the first come <hi rend="italic"
                    >Latinitas,</hi> a due avoidance of solecisms and barbarisms, and <hi
                    rend="italic">explanatio,</hi> clearness, the employment of familiar and
                    appropriate expressions. The second demands a proper arrangement, free from
                    hiatus, alliteration, rhyme, the repetition or displacement of words, and too
                    long sentences. Dignity depends upon the selection of language and of
                    sentiments.</p>
                <p>Hence we see that by the time of Cicero Latin prose was fully developed. We may,
                    therefore, pause here to notice the characteristic qualities of the language at
                    its most perfect stage. The Latin critics were themselves fully conscious of the
                    broad distinction in character between their own language and the Greek. Seneca
                    dwells upon the stately and dignified movement of the Latin period, and uses for
                    Cicero the happy epithet of <hi rend="italic">gradarius.</hi> He allows to the
                    Greeks <hi rend="italic">gratia,</hi> but claims <hi rend="italic">potentia</hi>
                    for his own countrymen. Quintilian (xii. 10, 27 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi>
                    concedes to Greek more euphony and variety both of vocalization and of accent;
                    he admits that Latin words are harsher in sound, and often less happily adapted
                    to the expression of varying shades of meaning. But he too claims “power” as the
                    distinguishing mark of his own language. Feeble thought may be carried off by
                    the exquisite harmony and subtleness of Greek diction; his countrymen must aim
                    at fulness and weight of ideas if they are not to be beaten off the field. The
                    Greek authors are like lightly moving skiffs; the Romans spread wider sails and
                    are wafted by stronger breezes; hence the deeper waters suit them. It is not
                    that the Latin language fails to respond to the calls that are made upon it.
                    Lucretius and Cicero concur, it is true, in complaints of the poverty of their
                    native language; but this was only because they had had no predecessors in the
                    task of adapting it to philosophic utterance; and the long life of Latin
                    technical terms like <hi rend="italic">qualitas,</hi><hi rend="italic">species,
                    genus, ratio,</hi> shows how well the need was met when it arose. Mr Munro has
                    said admirably of this very period —</p>
                <p>“The living Latin for all the higher forms of composition, both prose and verse,
                    was a far nobler language than the living Greek. During the long period of
                    Grecian pre-eminence and literary glory, from Homer to Demosthenes, all the
                    manifold forms of poetry and prose which were invented one after the other were
                    brought to such exquisite perfection that their beauty of form and grace of
                    language were never afterwards rivalled by Latin or any other people. But hardly
                    had Demosthenes and Aristotle ceased to live when that Attic which had been
                    gradually formed into such a noble instrument of thought in the hands of
                    Aristophanes, Euripides, Plato, and the orators, and had superseded for general
                    use all the other dialects, became at the same time the language of the
                    civilized world and was stricken with a mortal decay. . . . Epicurus, who was
                    born in the same year as Menander, writes a harsh jargon that does not deserve
                    to be called a style; and others of whose writings anything is left entire or in
                    fragments, historians and philosophers alike, Polybius, Chrysippus, Philodemus,
                    are little if any better. When Cicero deigns to translate any of their
                    sentences, see what grace and life he instils into their clumsily expressed
                    thoughts, how satisfying to the ear and taste are the periods of Livy when he is
                    putting into Latin the heavy and uncouth clauses of Polybius! This may explain
                    what Cicero means when at one time he gives to Greek the preference over Latin,
                    at another to Latin over Greek; in reading Sophocles or Plato he could
                    acknowledge their unrivalled excellence; in translating Panaetius or Philodemus
                    he would feel his own immeasurable superiority.”</p>
                <p>The greater number of long syllables, combined with the paucity of diphthongs and
                    the consequent monotony of vocalization, and the uniformity of the accent, lent
                    a weight and dignity of movement to the language which well suited the national
                    <hi rend="italic">gravitas.</hi> The precision of grammatical rules and the
                    entire absence of dialectic forms from the written literature contributed to
                    maintain the character of unity which marked the Roman republic as compared with
                    the multiplicity of Greek states. It was remarked by Bacon that artistic and
                    imaginative nations indulge freely in verbal compounds, practical nations in
                    simple concrete terms. In this respect, too, Latin contrasts with Greek. The
                    attempts made by some of the earlier poets to indulge in novel compounds was
                    felt to be out of harmony with the genius of the language. Composition, though
                    necessarily employed, was kept within narrow limits, and the words thus produced
                    have a sharply defined meaning, wholly unlike the poetical vagueness of some of
                    the Greek compounds. The vocabulary of the language, though receiving accessions
                    from time to time in accordance with practical needs, was rarely enriched by the
                    products of a spontaneous creativeness. In literature the taste of the educated
                    town circles gave the law; and these, trained in the study of the Greek masters
                    of style, required something which should reproduce for them the harmony of the
                    Greek period. Happily the orators who gave form to the Latin prose were able to
                    meet the demand without departing from the spirit of their own language, and the
                    periods of Cicero and Livy, though very different in structure from those of
                    Plato and Demosthenes, are not less satisfying to the ear, or less adequate to
                    the full expression of thought. To Cicero especially the Romans owed the
                    realization of what was possible to their language in the way of artistic finish
                    of style. He represents a protest at one and the same time against the inroads
                    of the <hi rend="italic">plebeius</hi><hi rend="italic">sermo,</hi> vulgarized
                    by the constant influx of non-Italian provincials into Rome, and the “jargon of
                    spurious and partial culture” in vogue among the Roman pupils of the Asiatic
                    rhetoricians. His essential service was to have caught the tone and style of the
                    true Roman <hi rend="italic">urbanitas,</hi> and to have fixed it in extensive
                    and widely read speeches and treatises as the final model of classical prose.
                    The influence of Caesar was wholly in the same direction. His cardinal principle
                    was that every newfangled and affected expression, from whatever quarter it
                    might come, should be avoided by the writer, as rocks by the mariner. His own
                    style for straightforward simplicity and purity has never been surpassed; and it
                    is not without full reason that Cicero and Caesar are regarded as the models of
                    classical prose. But, while they fixed the type of the best Latin, they did not
                    and could not alter its essential character. In subtlety, in suggestiveness, in
                    many-sided grace and versatility, it remained far inferior to the Greek. But for
                    dignity and force, for cadence and rhythm, for clearness and precision, the best
                    Latin prose remains unrivalled. These qualities make it pre-eminently the
                    language of legislation and of commerce. There is no haziness about a Latin
                    sentence; directness, concreteness, and lucidity stamp it as the utterance of
                    men who knew precisely what they wished to say, and said it with all the force
                    at their command.</p>

                <p>It is needless to dwell upon the grammar or vocabulary of Cicero. His language is
                    universally taken as the normal type of Latin; and, as hitherto the history of
                    the language has been traced by marking differences from his usage, so the same
                    method may be followed for what remains.</p>
                <p>Μ. Terentius Varro, “the most learned of the ancients,” a friend and contemporary
                    of Cicero, seems to have rejected the periodic rhythmical style of Cicero, and
                    to have fallen back upon a more archaic structure. Mommsen says of one passage
                    “the clauses of the sentence are arranged on the thread of the relative like
                    thrushes on a string.” But, in spite (some would say, because) of his
                    old-fashioned tendencies, his language shows great vigour and spirit. In his
                    Menippean satires he intentionally made free use of plebeian expressions, while
                    rising at times to a real grace and showing often fresh humour. His treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De Re Rustica,</hi> in the form of a dialogue, is the most
                    agreeable of his works, and where the nature of his subject allows it there is
                    much vivacity and dramatic picturesqueness, although the precepts are
                    necessarily given in a terse and abrupt form. His sentences are as a rule
                    co-ordinated, with but few connecting links; his diction contains many
                    antiquated or unique words.</p>
                <p>In Sallust, a younger contemporary of Cicero, we have the earliest complete
                    specimen of historical narrative. It is probably due to his subject-matter, at
                    least in part, that his style is marked by frequent archaisms; but something
                    must be ascribed to intentional imitation of the earlier chroniclers, which led
                    him to be called “priscorum Catonisque verborum ineruditissimus fur.” His
                    archaisms consist partly of words and phrases used in a ⅛ense for which we have
                    only early authorities, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,cum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >animo</hi><hi rend="italic">habere,</hi> &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">animos
                    tollere,</hi><hi rend="italic">bene factum,</hi><hi rend="italic">consultor,
                    prosapia,</hi><hi rend="italic">dolus,</hi><hi rend="italic">venenum, obsequela,
                    inquies, sallere, occipere, collibeo,</hi> and the like, where we may notice
                    especially the fondness for fréquentatives, which he shares with the early
                    comedy; partly in inflexions which were growing obsolete, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">semati,</hi><hi rend="italic">solui, comperior</hi> (dep.), <hi
                    rend="italic">neglegisset, vis</hi> (acc. pl.), <hi rend="italic">nequitur.</hi>
                    In syntax his constructions are for the most part those of the contemporary
                    writers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The character
                    of archaism has been denied to his style by Dean Merivale; and it is true that
                    in the matter of orthography the forms which Sallust adopts, as Corssen has
                    shown, were at least as common in his time as those which became afterwards the
                    rule; but, when we compare his diction with that of Cicero, there is quite
                    enough difference to justify the usual view; and the fact that some of his
                    expressions are found in later writers only goes to show that they imitated him
                    in this respect.</p></note></p>
                <p>In Lucretius and Catullus we have examples of the language of poetry of the same
                    period. The former is undoubtedly largely archaic in his style. We find <hi
                    rend="italic">im</hi> for eum, <hi rend="italic">endo</hi> for in, <hi
                    rend="italic">illae, ullae, unae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aliae</hi> as
                    genitives, <hi rend="italic">alid</hi> for aliud, <hi rend="italic">rabies</hi>
                    as a genitive by the side of genitives in <hi rend="italic">-ai,</hi> ablatives
                    in <hi rend="italic">-i</hi> like <hi rend="italic">colli, orbi, parti,</hi>
                    nominatives in s for <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> like <hi rend="italic">colos,
                    vapos, humos.</hi> In verbs there are <hi rend="italic">scatit, fulgit,
                    quaesit,</hi><hi rend="italic">confluxet</hi> = confluxisset, <hi rend="italic"
                    >recesse</hi> = recessisse, <hi rend="italic">induiacere</hi> for inicere;
                    simple forms like <hi rend="italic">fligere,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lacère,</hi><hi rend="italic">cedere, stinguere</hi> for the more usual
                    compounds, the infinitive passive in <hi rend="italic">-ier,</hi> and archaic
                    forms from <hi rend="italic">esse</hi> like <hi rend="italic">siet, escit,
                    fuat.</hi> Sometimes he indulges in tmesis which reminds us of Ennius: <hi
                    rend="italic">inque pediri,</hi><hi rend="italic">disque</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >supata,</hi><hi rend="italic">ordia</hi><hi rend="italic">prima.</hi> But this
                    archaic tinge is adopted only for poetical purposes, and as a practical proof of
                    his devotion to the earlier masters of his art; it does not affect the general
                    substance of his style, which is of the freshest and most vigorous stamp. But
                    the purity of his idiom is not gained by any slavish adherence to a recognized
                    vocabulary: he coins words freely; Mr Munro has noted more than a hundred <hi
                    rend="italic">aτrαξ</hi> λeγo∕x∈vα, or words which he alone among good writers
                    uses. Many of these are formed on familiar models, such as compounds and
                    fréquentatives; others are directly borrowed from the Greek apparently with a
                    view to sweetness of rhythm (ii. 412; v. 334, 505); others again (forty or more
                    in number) are compounds of a kind which the classical language refused to
                    adopt, such as <hi rend="italic">silvifragus, terriloquus, perterricrepus.</hi>
                    He represents not so much a stage in the history of the language as a protest
                    against the tendencies fashionable in his own time. But his influence was deep
                    upon Virgil, and through him upon all subsequent Latin literature. In Catullus
                    we have the type of the language of the cultivated circles, lifted into poetry
                    by the simple directness with which it is used to express emotion. In his heroic
                    and elegiac poems he did not escape the influence of the Alexandrian school, and
                    his genius is ill suited for long-continued flights; but in his lyrical poems
                    his language is altogether perfect. As Macaulay says, “No Latin writer is so
                    Greek. The simplicity, the pathos, the perfect grace, which I find in the great
                    Athenian models are all in Catullus, and in him alone of the Romans.” The
                    language of these poems comes nearest perhaps to that of Cicero’s more intimate
                    letters. It is full of colloquial idioms and familiar language, of the
                    diminutives of affection or of playfulness. Greek words are rare, especially in
                    the lyrics, and those which are employed are only such as had come to be current
                    coin. Archaisms are but sparingly introduced; but for metrical reasons he has
                    four instances of the inf. pass, in <hi rend="italic">-ier,</hi> and several
                    contracted forms; we find also <hi rend="italic">alls</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >alid, uni</hi> (gen.), and the antiquated <hi rend="italic">tetuli</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">recepso.</hi> There are traces of the popular language in the
                    shortened imperatives <hi rend="italic">cave</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mane,</hi> in the analytic perfect <hi rend="italic">paratam habes,</hi> and
                    perhaps in the use of <hi rend="italic">unus</hi> approaching that of the
                    indefinite article.</p>
                <p>The poets of the Augustan age mark the opening of a new chapter in the history of
                    the Latin language. The influence of Horace was comparatively slight; he worked
                    in a field of his own, and, although Statius imitated his lyrics, and Persius
                    and Juvenal, especially the former, his satires, on the whole there are few
                    traces of any deep marks left by him on the language of later writers. In his
                    <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> the diction
                    is that of the contemporary <hi rend="italic">urbanitas,</hi> differing hardly
                    at all from that of Cicero in his epistles and dialogues. The occasional
                    archaisms, such as the syncope in <hi rend="italic">erepsemus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">evasse, surrexe,</hi> the infinitives in <hi rend="italic"
                    >-ier,</hi> and the genitives <hi rend="italic">deum, divum,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">nummum</hi> may be explained as still conversationally allowable,
                    though ceasing to be current in literature; and a similar explanation may
                    account for plebeian terms, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >balatro, blatero, garrio,</hi><hi rend="italic">mutto,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vappa, caldus, soldus, surpite,</hi> for the numerous diminutives, and for such
                    pronouns, adverbs, conjunctions, and turns of expression as were common in
                    prose, but not found, or found but rarely, in elevated poetry. Greek words are
                    used sparingly, not with the licence which he censures in Lucilius, and in his
                    hexameters are inflected according to Latin rules. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odes,</hi> on the other hand, the language is much more precisely limited.
                    There are practically no archaisms <hi rend="italic">(spargier</hi> in Carm. iv.
                    11, 8 is a doubtful exception), or plebeian expressions; Greek inflexions are
                    employed, but not with the licence of Catullus; there are no datives in <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sin</hi> like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tethyi</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Dryasin</hi>; Greek constructions are fairly
                    numerous, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the genitive with verbs like <hi
                    rend="italic">regnare, abstinere, desinere,</hi> and with adjectives, as <hi
                    rend="italic">integer vitae,</hi> the so-called Greek accusative, the dative
                    with verbs of contest, like <hi rend="italic">luctari, decertare,</hi> the
                    transitive use of many intransitive verbs in the past participle, as <hi
                    rend="italic">regnatus, triumphatus</hi>; and finally there is a “prolative” use
                    of the infinitive after verbs and adjectives, where prose would have employed
                    other constructions, which, though not limited to Horace, is more common with
                    him than with other poets. Compounds are very sparingly employed, and apparently
                    only when sanctioned by authority<pb break="no"

                    numerous. About eighty <hi rend="italic">aπaξ</hi> λ∈γop,evαhave been noted; but
                    for the most part there is nothing very distinctive about their character, and
                    perhaps we should find them almost entirely disappearing if the remains of
                    contemporary literature were more extensive. Like Virgil, he shows his exquisite
                    skill in the use of language rather in the selection from already existing
                    stores, than in the creation of new resources: <hi rend="italic">tantum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">series iuncturaque</hi><hi rend="italic">pollet.</hi> But both his
                    diction and his syntax left much less marked traces upon succeeding writers than
                    did those of either Virgil or Ovid.</p>
                <p>In Virgil the development of the Latin language reached its full maturity. What
                    Cicero was to the period, Virgil was to the hexameter; indeed the changes that
                    he wrought were still more marked, inasmuch as the language of verse admits of
                    greater subtlety and finish than even the most artistic prose. For the
                    straightforward idiomatic simplicity of Lucretius and Catullus he substituted a
                    most exact and felicitous choice of diction, rich with the suggestion of the
                    most varied sources of inspiration. Sometimes it is a phrase of Homer’s
                    “conveyed” literally with happy boldness, sometimes it is a line of Ennius, or
                    again some artistic Sophoclean combination. Virgil was equally familiar with the
                    great Greek models of style and with the earlier Latin poets. This learning,
                    guided by an unerring sense of fitness and harmony, enabled him to give to his
                    diction a music which recalls at once the fullest tones of the Greek lyre and
                    the lofty strains of the most genuinely national song. His love of
                    antiquarianism in language has often been noticed, but it never passes into
                    pedantry. His vocabulary and constructions are often such as would have conveyed
                    to his contemporaries a grateful flavour of the past, but they would never have
                    been unintelligible. Forms like <hi rend="italic">iusso, olle,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">admittier</hi> can have delayed no one.</p>
                <p>In the details of syntax it is difficult to notice any peculiarly Virgilian
                    points, for the reason that his language, like that of Cicero, became the canon,
                    departures from which were accounted irregularities. But we may notice as
                    favourite constructions a free use of oblique cases in the place of the more
                    definite construction with prepositions usual in prose, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    it clamor</hi><hi rend="italic">caelo, flet noctem, rivis currentia vina,
                    bacchatam iugis Naxon,</hi> and many similar phrases; the employment of some
                    substantives as adjectives, like <hi rend="italic">venator canis,</hi> and vice
                    versa, as <hi rend="italic">plurimus volitans</hi>; a proleptic use of
                    adjectives, as <hi rend="italic">tristia</hi><hi rend="italic">torquebit·,</hi>
                    idioms involving <hi rend="italic">ille, atque, deinde, haud,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quin,</hi><hi rend="italic">vix,</hi> and the frequent occurrence
                    of passive verbs in their earlier reflexive sense, as <hi rend="italic">induor,
                    velor, pascor</hi> (comp. Dr Kennedy’s Appendix on “Virgilian Syntax ”).</p>
                <p>In Livy’s singularly varied and beautiful style we have Latin prose in that rich
                    maturity which seems to portend and almost to necessitate an early decline. To a
                    training in the rhetorical schools, and perhaps professional experience as a
                    teacher of rhetoric, he added a thorough familiarity with contemporary poetry
                    and with the Greek language; and these attainments have all deeply coloured his
                    language. It is probable that the variety of style naturally suggested by the
                    wide range of his subject matter was increased by a half-unconscious adoption of
                    the phrases and constructions of the different authorities whom he followed in
                    different parts of his work; and the industry of German critics has gone far to
                    demonstrate a conclusion likely enough in itself. Hence perhaps comes the fairly
                    long list of archaisms, especially in formulae, which scholars have collected
                    (c∕. Kühnast, <hi rend="italic">Liv.</hi><hi rend="italic">Syηt.,</hi> pp.
                    14-18). These are, however, purely isolated phenomena, which do not affect the
                    general tone. It is different with the poetical constructions and Graecisms,
                    which appear on every page. Of the latter we find numerous instances in the use
                    of the cases, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in genitives like <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad Spei</hi> (sc. <hi rend="italic">templum),</hi><hi rend="italic">pars
                    altera</hi><hi rend="italic">regiae</hi><hi rend="italic">adulationis erat,
                    oratores pacis petendae, ira praedae omissae, oppidum Antiochiae, aequum campi,
                    qui captivorum,</hi> in datives like <hi rend="italic">aeneum pectori tegumen,
                    comitia collegae creando, quibusdam volentibus erat, promptus veniae
                    dandae</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Kühnast (p.
                    140) holds that of more than three hundred and twenty datives in book xxiii.
                    about thirty show the influence of Greek constructions.</p></note><hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> in accusatives like <hi rend="italic">iurare calumniam,
                    certare multam, distendere hostem</hi>; an especially frequent use of transitive
                    verbs absolutely; and the constant omission of the reflexive pronoun as the
                    subject of an infinitive in reported speech. To the same source must be assigned
                    a very frequent pregnant construction with prepositions, an attraction of
                    relatives, and a great extension of the employment of relative adverbs of place
                    instead of relative pronouns, <hi rend="italic">e.g., quo = in quern.</hi> Among
                    his poetical characteristics we may place the extensive list of words which are
                    found for the first time in his works and in those of Virgil or Ovid, and
                    perhaps his common use of concrete words for collective, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">eques</hi> for <hi rend="italic">equitatus,</hi> of
                    abstract terms such as <hi rend="italic">remigium, servitia, robora,</hi> and of
                    frequentative verbs, to say nothing of poetical phrases like “haec ubi dicta
                    dedit,” “adversum montium,” &amp;c. Indications of the extended use of the
                    subjunctive, which he shares with contemporary writers, especially poets, are
                    found in the construction of <hi rend="italic">ante quam, post quam</hi> with
                    this mood, even when there is no underlying notion of purpose, of <hi
                    rend="italic">donec,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">cum</hi> meaning “whenever.”
                    On the other hand <hi rend="italic">forsitan</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >quamvis,</hi> as in the poets, are used with the indicative in forgetfulness of
                    their original force. Among his individual peculiarities may be noticed the
                    large number of verbal nouns in <hi rend="italic">-tus</hi> (for which Cicero
                    prefers forms in <hi rend="italic">-tio)</hi> and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >-tor,</hi> and the extensive use of the past passive participle to replace an
                    abstract substantive, <hi rend="italic">e.g., ex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dictatorio imperio concusso.</hi> In the arrangement of words Livy is much more
                    free than any previous prose writer, aiming, like the poets, at the most
                    effective order rather than at that which is logically suggested. His periods
                    are constructed with less regularity than those of Cicero, and gain at least as
                    much in variety and energy as they lose in uniformity of rhythm and artistic
                    finish. His style cannot be more fitly described than in the language of
                    Quintilian, who speaks of his <hi rend="italic">mira</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >iuσunditas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lactea ubertas.</hi></p>
                <p>The language of Propertius is too distinctly his own to call for detailed
                    examination here. It cannot be taken as a specimen of the great current of the
                    Latin language; it is rather a tributary springing from a source apart, tinging
                    to some slight extent the stream into which it pours itself, but soon ceasing to
                    affect it in any perceptible fashion. “His obscurity, his indirectness, and his
                    incoherence” (to adopt the words of Professor Postgate) were too much out of
                    harmony with the Latin taste for him to be regarded as in any sense
                    representative; sometimes he seems to be hardly writing Latin at all. Partly
                    from his own strikingly independent genius, partly from his profound and not
                    always judicious study of the Alexandrian writers, his poems abound in phrases
                    and constructions which are without a parallel in Latin poetry. His archaisms
                    and Graecisms, both in diction and in syntax, are very numerous; but frequently
                    there is a freedom in the use of cases and prepositions which can only be due to
                    bold and independent innovations. His style well deserves a careful study for
                    its own sake (c∕. Postgate’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction,</hi> pp.
                    lvii.-cxxv.); but it is of comparatively little significance in the history of
                    the language.</p>
                <p>The brief and few poems of Tibullus supply only what is given much more fully in
                    the works of Ovid. In these we have the language recognized as that best fitted
                    for <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n353/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0353-0336"/> poetry by the fashionable circles in the later
                    years of Augustus. The style of Ovid bears many traces of the imitation of
                    Virgil, but it is not less deeply affected by the rhetoric of the schools. His
                    never-failing fertility cf fancy and command of diction often lead him into a
                    diffuseness which mars the effect of his best works; according to Quintilian it
                    was only in his (lost) tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Medea</hi> that he showed
                    what real excellence he might have reached if he had chosen to control his
                    natural powers rather than to give them full rein. His influence on later poets
                    was largely for evil: if he taught them smoothness of versification and polish
                    of language, he also co-operated powerfully with the practice of recitation to
                    lead them to aim at rhetorical point and striking turns of expression, instead
                    of a firm grasp of a subjectas a whole, and due subordination of the several
                    parts to the general impression. Ovid’s own influence on language was not great:
                    he took the diction of poetry as he found it, formed by the labours of his
                    predecessors; the conflict between the archaistic and the Graecizing schools was
                    already settled in favour of the latter; and all that he did was to accept the
                    generally accepted models as supplying the material in moulding which his
                    luxuriant fancy could have free play. He is the pattern of the poet of society,
                    never rising above that which was readily intelligible to the circle in which he
                    moved, but achieving what all were attempting with consummate ease and grace. He
                    has no deviations from classical syntax but those which were coming into fashion
                    in his time <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">forsitan</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">quamvis</hi> with the indie., the dative of the agent with passive
                    verbs, the ablative for the accusative of time, the infinitive after adjectives
                    like <hi rend="italic">certus, aptus,</hi> &amp;c.), and but few peculiarities
                    in his vocabulary. It is only in the letters from the Pontus that laxities of
                    construction are detected, which show that the purity of his Latin was impaired
                    by his residence away from Rome, and perhaps by increasing carelessness of
                    composition.</p>
                <p>While the leading writers of the Ciceronian and Augustan eras enable us to trace
                    the gradual development of the Latin language to its utmost finish as an
                    instrument of literary expression, there are some less important authors who
                    supply valuable evidence of the character of the <hi rend="italic">sermo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plebeius.</hi> Among them may be placed the authors of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bellum Africanum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Bellum
                    Hispaniense</hi> appended to Caesar’s commentaries. These are not only far
                    inferior to the exquisite <hi rend="italic">urbanitas</hi> of Caesar’s own
                    writings; they are much rougher in style even than the less polished <hi
                    rend="italic">Bellum Alexandrinum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De Bello</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gallico</hi><hi rend="italic">Liber VIII.,</hi> which are now with
                    justice ascribed to Hirtius. There is sufficient difference between the two to
                    justify us in assuming two different authors; but both freely employ words and
                    constructions which are at once antiquated and vulgar. The writer of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bellum Alexandrinum</hi> uses a larger number of diminutives
                    within his short treatise than Caesar in nearly ten times the space: <hi
                    rend="italic">postquam</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ubi</hi> are used with the
                    pluperfect subjunctive; there are numerous forms unknown to the best Latin, like
                    <hi rend="italic">tristimonia,exporrigere, cruciabiliter,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">convulnero</hi><hi rend="italic">; potior</hi> is followed by the
                    accusative, a simple relative by the subjunctive. There is also a very common
                    use of the pluperfect for the imperfect, which seems a mark of this <hi
                    rend="italic">ρlebeius</hi><hi rend="italic">sermo</hi> (Nipperdey, <hi
                    rend="italic">Quaest. Caes.,</hi> pp. 13-30).</p>
                <p>Another example of what we may call the Latin of business life is supplied by
                    Vitruvius. Besides the obscurity of many of his technical expressions, there is
                    a roughness and looseness in his language, far removed from a literary style; he
                    shares the incorrect use of the pluperfect, and uses plebeian forms like <hi
                    rend="italic">calefaciuntur,</hi><hi rend="italic">faciliter, expertiones,</hi>
                    and such careless phrases as “rogavit Archimedem uti in se sumeret sibi de eo
                    cogitationem.” At a somewhat later stage we have, not merely plebeian, but also
                    provincial Latin represented in the <hi rend="italic">Satyricon</hi> of
                    Petronius. The narrative and the poems which are introduced into it are written
                    in a style distinguished only by the ordinary peculiarities of silver Latinity;
                    but in the numerous conversations the distinctions of language appropriate to
                    the various speakers are accurately preserved; and we have in the talk of the
                    slaves and provincials a perfect storehouse of words and constructions of the
                    greatest linguistic value. Among the unclassical forms and constructions may be
                    noticed masculines like <hi rend="italic">fatus, vinus, balneus, fericulus,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">lactem</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">lac), striga</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">strix, gaudimonium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tristimonium,
                    sanguen, manducare, nutricare, molestare, nesapius (sapius — Vr. sage),
                    rostrum</hi> ( = os), <hi rend="italic">ipsimus</hi> ( = master), <hi
                    rend="italic">scordalias, baro,</hi> and numerous diminutives like <hi
                    rend="italic">camella, audaculus, potiuncula, savunculum, ofia, peduclus,
                    corcillum,</hi> with constructions such as <hi rend="italic">maledicere</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">persuadere</hi> with the accusative, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >adiutare</hi> with the dative, and the deponent forms <hi rend="italic"
                    >pudeatur</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ridetur.</hi> Of especial interest for the
                    Romance languages are <hi rend="italic">astrum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(désastre),</hi><hi rend="italic">berbex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(brebis),</hi><hi rend="italic">botellus</hi><hi rend="italic">(boyau),</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">improperare,</hi><hi rend="italic">muttus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >naufragare.</hi></p>
                <p>Suetonius <hi rend="italic">(Aug.,</hi> c. 87) gives an interesting selection of
                    plebeian words employed in conversation by Augustus, who for the rest was
                    something of a purist in his written utterances: “ponit assidue et pro stulto
                    baceolum, et pro pullo pulleiaceum, et pro cerrito vacerrosum, et vapide se
                    habere pro male, et betizare pro languere, quod vulgo lachanizare dicitur.”</p>
                <p>The inscriptions, especially those of Pompeii, supply abundant evidence of the
                    corruptions both of forms and of pronunciation common among the vulgar. It is
                    not easy always to determine whether a mutilated form is evidence of a letter
                    omitted in pronunciation, or only in writing; but it is clear that there must

                    inflexions. There are already signs of the confusion of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>To return to the language of literature. In the dark days of Tiberius and the two
                    succeeding emperors a paralysis seemed to have come upon prose and poetry alike.
                    With the one exception of oratory, literature had long been the utterance of a
                    narrow circle, not the expression of the energies of national life; and now,
                    while all free speech in the popular assemblies was silenced, the nobles were
                    living under a suspicious despotism, which, whatever the advantage which it
                    brought to the poorer classes and to the provincials, was to them a reign of
                    terror. It is no wonder that the fifty years after the accession of Tiberius are
                    a blank as regards all higher literature. Velleius Paterculus, Valerius Maximus,
                    Celsus, and Phaedrus give specimens of the Latin of the time, but the style of
                    no one of these, classical for the most part in vocabulary, but occasionally
                    approaching the later usages in syntax, calls for special analysis. The elder
                    Seneca, in his collection of <hi rend="italic">suasoriae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">controversiae</hi> supplies examples of the barren quibblings by
                    which the young Romans were trained in the rhetorical schools. A course of
                    instruction, which may have been of service when its end was efficiency in
                    active public life, though even then not without its serious drawbacks, as is
                    shown by Cicero in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Oratore,</hi> became seriously injurious when its object was merely idle
                    display. Prose came to be overloaded with ornament, and borrowed too often the
                    language, though not the genius, of poetry; while poetry in its turn, partly
                    owing to the fashion of recitation, became a string of rhetorical points.</p>

                    schools upon language as well as literature. The leading man of letters was
                    undoubtedly Seneca the younger, “the Ovid of prose”; and his style set the model
                    which it became the fashion to imitate. But striking and popular as it was it
                    could not commend itself to the judgment of sound critics like Quintilian, who
                    held firmly to the great masters of an earlier time. He admits its brilliance,
                    and the fertility of its pointed reflexions, but charges the author justly with
                    want of selfrestraint, jerkiness, frequent repetitions, and tawdry tricks of
                    rhetoric. He was the worst of models, and pleased by his very faults. In his
                    tragedies the rhetorical elaboration of the style only serves to bring into
                    prominence the frigidity and frequent bad taste of the matter. But his diction
                    is on the whole fairly classical; he is, in the words of Muretus, “vetusti
                    sermonis diligentior quam quidam inepte fastidiosi suspicantur.” In Persius
                    there is a constant straining after rhetorical effect, which fills his verses
                    with harsh and obscure expressions. The careful choice of diction by which his
                    master Horace makes every word tell is exaggerated into an endeavour to gain
                    force and freshness by the most contorted phrases. The sin of allusiveness, that
                    besets so many young writers, is fostered by the fashion of the day for epigram,
                    till his lines are barely intelligible after repeated reading. Conington happily
                    suggested that this style was assumed only for satiric purposes, and pointed out
                    that when not writing satire Persius is as simple and unaffected as Horace
                    himself. This view, while it relieves Persius of much of the censure which has
                    been directed against his want of judgment, makes him all the more typical a
                    representative of this stage of silver Latiuity. In his contemporary Lucan we
                    have another example of the faults of a style especially attractive to the
                    young, handled by a youth of brilliant but ill-disciplined powers. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> abounds in spirited rhetoric, in striking epigram,
                    in high sounding declamation; but there are no flights of sustained imagination,
                    no ripe wisdom, no self-control in avoiding the exaggerated or the repulsive, no
                    mature philosophy of life or human destiny. Of all the Latin poets he is the
                    least Virgilian, so that Merivale remarks “he had never studied, one is almost
                    tempted to believe that he had never read, Virgil.” It has been said of him that
                    he corrupted the style of poetry, not less than Seneca that of prose. It may be
                    doubted whether his influence was ever great enough to produce such an effect;
                    it is safer to say that he is the earliest poet in whom the characteristics of
                    the silver Latinity are clearly marked.</p>
                <p>In the elder Pliny the same tendencies are seen occasionally breaking out in the
                    midst of the prosaic and inartistic form in which he gives out the stores of his
                    cumbrous erudition. Wherever he attempts a loftier tone than that of the mere
                    compiler, he falls into the tricks of Seneca. The nature of his encyclopaedic
                    subject matter naturally makes his vocabulary very extensive; but in syntax and
                    general tone of language he does not differ materially from contemporary
                    writers. Quintilian is of interest especially for the sound judgment which led
                    him to a true appreciation of the writers of Rome’s golden age. He set himself
                    strenuously to resist the tawdry rhetoric fashionable in his own time, and to
                    hold up before his pupils purer and loftier models. His own criticisms are
                    marked by excellent taste <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> and often by great
                    happiness of expression, which is pointed without being unduly epigrammatic. But
                    his own style did not escape, as indeed it hardly could, the influences of his
                    time; and in many small points his language falls short of classical purity.
                    There is more approach to the simplicity of the best models in Frontinus, who
                    furnishes a striking proof that it was rather the corruption of literary taste
                    than any serious change in the language of ordinary cultivated men to which the
                    prevalent style was due. Writing on practical matters—the art of war, and the
                    water-supply of Rome—he goes straight to the point without rhetorical
                    flourishes; and the ornaments of style which he occasionally introduces serve to
                    embellish but not to distort his thought.</p>
                <p>The epic poets of the Flavian age present a striking contrast to the writers of
                    the Claudian period. As a strained originality was the cardinal fault of the one
                    school, so a tame and slavish following of authority is the mark of the other.
                    The general <hi rend="italic">correctness</hi> of this period may perhaps be
                    ascribed (with Merivale) partly to the political conditions, partly to the
                    establishment of professional schools. Teacher’s like Quintilian must have done
                    much to repress extravagance of thought and language; but they could not kindle
                    the spark of genius. Valerius Flaccus, Silius Italicus, and Papinius Statius are
                    all correct in diction and in rhythm, and abound in learning: but their
                    inspiration is drawn from books and not from nature or the heart; details are
                    elaborated to the injury of the impression of the whole; every line is laboured,
                    and overcharged with epigrammatic rhetoric. Statius shows by far the greatest
                    natural ability and freshness; but he attempts to fill a broad canvas with
                    drawing and colouring suited only to a miniature. Juvenal exemplifies the
                    tendencies of the language of his time, as moulded by a singularly powerful
                    mind. A careful study of the earlier poets, especially Virgil and Lucan, has
                    kept his language up to a high standard of purity. His style is eminently
                    rhetorical; but it is rhetoric of real power. The concise brevity by which it is
                    marked seems to have been the result of a deliberate attempt to mould his
                    natural diffuseness into the form recognized as most appropriate for satire. In
                    his verses we notice a few metrical licences common to his age, especially the
                    shortening of the final -o in verbs, but as a rule they are as correct as they
                    are sonorous. In Martial the tendency of this period to witty epigram finds its
                    most perfect embodiment, combined with finished versification. The typical
                    prose-writers of this time are Pliny the younger and Tacitus. A study of their
                    diction and syntax will best disclose the characteristics of the silver
                    Latinity. Some of the features of the style of Tacitus are peculiar to himself;
                    but on the whole the following statement represents the tendencies shared in
                    greater or less degree by all the writers of this period. The gains lie mainly
                    in the direction of a more varied and occasionally more effective syntax; its
                    most striking defect is a lack of harmony in the periods, of arrangement in
                    words, of variety in particles arising from the loose connexion of sentences.
                    The vocabulary is extended, but there are losses as well as gains. Quintilian’s
                    remarks are fully borne out by the evidence of extant authorities: on the one
                    hand, “quid quod nihil iam proprium placet, dum parum creditur disertum, quod et
                    alius dixisset” (viii., prooem., 24); “a corruptissimo quoque poetarum figuras
                    seu translationes mutuamur; tum demum ingeniosi scilicet, si ad intelligendos
                    nos opus sit ingenio” <hi rend="italic">(il&gt;.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> f</hi> 25); “sordet omne quod natura dictavit” (ιδ., 26); on the
                    other hand, “nunc utique, cum haec exercitatio procul a veritate seiuncta
                    laboret incredibili verborum fastidio, ac sibi magnam partem sermonis
                    absciderit” (viii. 3, 23), “multa cotidie ab antiquis ficta moriuntur” (⅛, 6,
                    32). A writer like Suetonius therefore did good service in introducing into his
                    writings terms and phrases borrowed, not from the rhetoricians, but from the
                    usage of daily life.</p>
                <p>In the vocabulary of Tacitus there are to be noted :—</p>
                <p>1. Words borrowed (consciously or unconsciously) from the classical poets,
                    especially Virgil, occurring for the most part also in contemporary prose. Of
                    these Dräger gives a list of ninety-five (Syntax und Stil des Tacitus, p.
                    96).</p>
                <p>2. Words occurring only, or for the first time, in Tacitus. These according to
                    the same authority number eighty-eight, for the most <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0355-0338"/> part new formations or compounds from stems
                    already in use, especially verbal substantives in -tor and -sor, -lus and -sus,
                    -tura and -mentum, with new fréquentatives..</p>
                <p>3. Words used with a meaning (a) not found in earlier prose, but sometimes (in
                    more than eighty instances) borrowed from the poets, e.g., componere, “to bury”;
                    scriptura, “a writing”; ferratus, “armed with a sword”; (δ) peculiar to later
                    writers, e.g., numerosus, “numerous”; famosus, “famous”; decollare, “tobehead”;
                    imputare, “to take credit for,” &amp;c.; (c) restricted to Tacitus himself,
                    e.g., dispergere ≈ divolgare; of these Boetticher quotes one hundred and
                    twenty-two.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, Tacitus likes to use a simple verb instead of a compound one,
                    after the fashion of the poets, employs a pluperfect for a perfect, and (like
                    Livy and sometimes Caesar) aims at vividness and variety by employing the
                    present and perfect conjunctive in indirect speech even after historical tenses.
                    Collective words are followed by a plural far more commonly than in Cicero. The
                    ellipse of a verb is more frequent. The use of the cases approximates to that of
                    the poets, and is even more free. The accusative of limitation is common in
                    Tacitus, though never found in Quintilian. Compound verbs are frequently
                    followed by the accusative where the dative might have been expected; and the
                    Virgilian construction of an accusative with middle and passive verbs is not
                    unusual. The dative “absolute” is shared by Tacitus with Livy; the dative of
                    purpose and the dative with a substantive in place of a genitive are more common
                    with him than with any writer. The ablative of separation is used without a
                    preposition, even with names of countries and with common nouns; the ablative of
                    place is employed similarly without a preposition; the ablative of time has
                    sometimes the force of duration; the instrumental ablative is employed even of
                    persons. A large extension is given to the use of the quantitative genitive
                    after neuter adjectives and pronouns, and even adverbs, and to the genitive with
                    active participles; and the genitive of relation after adjectives is (probably
                    by a Graecism) very freely employed. In regard to prepositions, there are
                    special uses of citra, erga, iuxta, and tenus to be noted, and a frequent
                    tendency to interchange the use of a preposition with that of a simple case in
                    corresponding clauses. In subordinate sentences quod is used for “the fact
                    that,” and sometimes approaches the later use of “that”; the infinitive follows
                    many verbs and adjectives that do not admit of this construction in classical
                    prose; the accusative and infinitive are used after negative expressions of
                    •doubt, and even in modal and hypothetical clauses.</p>
                <p>Like Livy, the writers of this time freely employ the conjunctive of repeated
                    action with a relative, and extend its use to relative conjunctions, which he
                    does not. In clauses of comparison and proportion there is frequently an ellipse
                    of a verb (with nihil aliud quam, ut, tanquamf, tanquam, quasi, and vel·ut are
                    used to imply not comparison but alleged reason; quin and quominus are
                    interchanged at pleasure. Quamquam and quamvis are commonly followed by the
                    subjunctive, even when denoting facts. The free use of the genitive and dative
                    of the gerundive participle to denote purpose is common in Tacitus, the former
                    being almost limited to him. Livy’s practice in the use of participles is
                    extended even beyond the limits to which he restricts it. It has been calculated
                    that where Caesar uses five participial clauses, Livy has sixteen, Tacitus
                    twenty-four.</p>
                <p>In his compressed brevity Tacitus may be said to be individual; but in the
                    poetical colouring of his diction, in the rhetorical cast of his sentences, and
                    in his love for picturesqueness and variety he is a true representative of his
                    time.</p>
                <p>The language of Suetonius is of interest as giving a specimen of silver Latinity
                    almost entirely free from personal idiosyncrasies; his expressions are regular
                    and straightforward, clear and business-like; and, while in grammar he does not
                    attain to classical purity, he is comparatively free from rhetorical
                    affectations.</p>
                <p>A new era commences with the accession of Hadrian (117 A.D.). As the preceding
                    half century had been marked by the influence of Spanish Latinity (the Senecas,
                    Lucan, Martial, Quintilian), so in this the African style was paramount. This is
                    the period of affected archaisms and pedantic learning, combined at times with a
                    reckless love of innovation and experiment, resulting in the creation of a large
                    number of new formations and in the adoption of much of the plebeian dialect.
                    Fronto and Appuleius mark a strong reaction against the culture of the preceding
                    century, and for evil far more than for good the chain of literary tradition was
                    broken. The language which had been unduly refined and elaborated now relapsed
                    into a tasteless and confused patch-work, without either harmony or brilliance
                    of colouring. In the case of the former the subject matter is no set-off against
                    the inferiority of the style. His latest editor is quite pathetic in lamenting
                    the worthlessness of his author, and says that it would have conduced to his
                    reputation if his works had never been unearthed. He deliberately attempts to go
                    back to the obsolete diction of writers like Cato and Ennius. We find compounds
                    like <hi rend="italic">altipendulus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nudiustertianus,</hi><hi rend="italic">tolutilo-quentia,</hi> diminutives such
                    as <hi rend="italic">matercella,</hi><hi rend="italic">anulla,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ρassercula, studiolum,</hi> forms like <hi rend="italic"
                    >congarrire,</hi><hi rend="italic">disconciηηus, pedetemptius,
                    desiderantissimus</hi> (passive), <hi rend="italic">conticinium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">gaudeo, oboedio,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">perfungor</hi> are used with an accusative, <hi rend="italic"
                    >modestus</hi> with a genitive; and, if our MS. is to be trusted, the
                    interchange of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> has already
                    begun. On the other hand he actually attempts to revive the form <hi
                    rend="italic">asa</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ara.</hi> In Appuleius the archaic
                    element is only one element in the queer mixture which constitutes his style,
                    and it probably was not intended to give the tone to the whole. Poetical and
                    prosaic phrases, Graecisms, solecisms, jingling assonances, quotations, and
                    coinages apparently on the spur of the moment, all appear in this wonderful
                    medley. There are found such extraordinary genitives as <hi rend="italic">sitire
                    beati-</hi><hi rend="italic">tudinis,</hi><hi rend="italic">cenae
                    pignerarer,</hi><hi rend="italic">iηcoram omnium,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >foras</hi><hi rend="italic">corporis,</hi> sometimes heaped one upon another,
                    as <hi rend="italic">fluxos vestium Arsacidas et frugum pauperes Ityraeos et
                    odorum divites Arabas.</hi> Diminutives are coined with reckless freedom, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">diutule, longule, mundule amicta et
                    altiuscule sub ipsas papillas succinctula.</hi> He confesses himself that he is
                    writing in a language not familiar to him:—“Inurbe Latia advena studiorum
                    Quiritium indigenam sermonem aerumnabili labore, nullo magistro praeeunte,
                    aggressus excolui”; and the general impression of his style fully bears out his
                    confession. Melanchthon is hardly too severe when he says that Appuleius brays
                    like his own ass. The language of Aulus Gellius is much superior in purity; but
                    still it abounds in rare and archaic words, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">edulcare, recentari, aeruscator,</hi> and in meaningless
                    frequentatives like <hi rend="italic">solitavisse.</hi> He has some admirable
                    remarks on the pedantry of those who delighted in obsolete expressions (xi. 7)
                    such as <hi rend="italic">apluda,</hi><hi rend="italic">flocus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">bovinator</hi>; but his practice falls far short of his
                    theory.</p>
                <p>The style of the eminent lawyers of this period, foremost among whom is Gaius,
                    deserves especial notice as showing well one of the characteristic excellences
                    of the Latin language. It is for the most part dry and unadorned, and in syntax
                    departs occasionally from classical usages, but it is clear, terse, and exact.
                    Technical terms may cause difficulty to the ordinary reader, but their meaning
                    is always precisely defined; new compounds are employed whenever the subject
                    requires them, but the capacities of the language rise to the demands made upon
                    it; and the conceptions of jurisprudence have never been more adequately
                    expressed than by the great Roman jurists.</p>
                <p>It is needless to trace in detail the gradual impoverishment and disorganization
                    of literary Latin. After the time of Gellius, there is no writer who deserves in
                    any sense to be called classical. The true literary tradition was lost; and even
                    the poets who aimed at imitating the best models, by far the best of whom was
                    Claudian, were led into many faults by the defective taste of their time. The
                    sense of quantity was lost, and the practice of regarding accent as the ruling
                    principle in metre, which had doubtless never been extinct in popular
                    songs,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Munro

                    which has left plain traces in a poem quoted by Gellius (xix. 11), became

                    poems of Ausonius (flor. 350 A.τ&gt;. ), and are plain in those of Sedulius in

                    Apollinaris displays, with a profusion of erudition, an entire absence of
                    correctness. Latin was to him no living language; his natural medium of
                    expression was the <hi rend="italic">sermo rusticus,</hi> and this has left its
                    mark on every page.</p>
                <p>The influence of the Christian church in the development of the Latin language
                    was mainly in two directions. In the first place the new conceptions introduced
                    brought about a large extension of the vocabulary. As the most important of the
                    early Latin fathers belonged to Africa (Tertullian, Cyprian, Arnobius,
                    Augustine), this extension was made under the influence of the African Latinity;
                    the newly-coined terms took an awkward and almost barbarous form; and the
                    tendency of the time to abstract expressions and clumsy compounds was heightened
                    by the needs of the writers. Secondly, the Christian teachers, as several of
                    them expressly say, thought little of the grammatical exactness of their
                    language, provided they could make themselves readily intelligible to the common
                    people; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Augustine confesses “Melius est
                    reprehendant vos grammatici quam non intelligant populi,” and again, “Saepe enim
                    et verba non Latina dico, ut vos intelligatis.” Hence in the writings of the
                    early fathers we find a large element of plebeian Latinity introduced into the
                    clumsy and affected rhetoric and the bold linguistic experiments of the African
                    schools. Perhaps it is Tertullian who represents this stage of the language in
                    its most extravagant form. He has genitives like <hi rend="italic">imbrium
                    utilia,</hi> accusatives like <hi rend="italic">Campania</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >erepta Pompeios,</hi> adverbs used for adjectives, metaphorical terms employed
                    in the boldest fashion <hi rend="italic">(e.g., adulter,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aestum,</hi><hi rend="italic">census,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >contentiosus</hi><hi rend="italic">funis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >communicare,</hi> &amp;c.), numerous abstract words, often in the plural, like
                    <hi rend="italic">corpulentiae, discentiae,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >inexperientiae,</hi> and finally the most extraordinary compounds, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">interibilis, elementicius, concupiscentivum, ethnicalis,
                    extractorius, famulatorius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The language of the <hi rend="italic">Vetus Itala</hi> (a version of the Bible,
                    made in Africa) an&lt;l of the Vulgate has been made the subject of an admirable
                    study by Hermann Ronsch <hi rend="italic">(Itala</hi><hi rend="italic">und
                    Vulgata,</hi> 2d. ed., Marburg, 1875), from whom the following sketch of its
                    leading characteristics has been mainly derived (comp, also Bernhardy, <hi
                    rend="italic">Röm.</hi><hi rend="italic">Lit.,</hi> pp. 334, 335). Many of the
                    phenomena are common to the plebeian language generally, and have been already
                    noticed as appearing occasionally in ea⅛er writings.</p>
                <p>1. In the formation of substantives there appears a preference for full-sounding
                    forms, constructed by a free use of the suffixes <hi rend="italic">•mentum,
                    -minium, -arium, -orium,</hi><hi rend="italic">-culum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-bulum, -aneum, -inium, -ura,</hi><hi rend="italic">-udo,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∙ntia, -itas∙. e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">nugamentum</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">nugae, sessimonium, sessibulum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sessorium for sedes, calcanium</hi> for <hi rend="italic">calx, poenitudo</hi>
                    for <hi rend="italic">poena, dolositas</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >dolus.</hi></p>
                <p>2. Plebeian terms take the place of their classical equivalents: <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">caballus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(≈cheυal),</hi><hi rend="italic">mansio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(=*maison),</hi><hi rend="italic">bucca</hi><hi rend="italic">( =</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bouche), testa (</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tête), in</hi><hi rend="italic">gyrum</hi><hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">environ).</hi></p>
                <p>3. Substantives in <hi rend="italic">-tor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-io</hi>
                    receive large additions (Ronsch gives more than one hundred and eighty of the
                    first kind, and more than two hundred and seventy of the second kind, found
                    either now for the first time, or previously only in writers like Plautus and
                    Petronius).</p>
                <p>4. Adjectives are turned into substantives. From this class are formed many
                    Romance words: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">montana</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(≈</hi><hi rend="italic">montagne),</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hibernum</hi><hi rend="italic">(≈</hi><hi rend="italic">hiver),</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">diurnum</hi><hi rend="italic">( =</hi><hi rend="italic">giorno),
                    volatile</hi><hi rend="italic">(=</hi><hi rend="italic">volatili,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">volaille),</hi><hi rend="italic">matutinum</hi><hi rend="italic">(
                    =</hi><hi rend="italic">'mat</hi><hi rend="italic">tino,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >matin), murale (</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >muraille).</hi></p>
                <p>5. Adjectives in <hi rend="italic">-alis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >-bilis,</hi><hi rend="italic">-umus, -lnmdus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-lentus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-osus</hi> are largely introduced, often
                    replacing simpler forms: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >placibilis</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">placens,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aeternalis =</hi><hi rend="italic">aeternus, longiturnus,
                    amarulentus, meticulosus, dignitosus</hi>; and verbals in <hi rend="italic"
                    >-or</hi> give rise to participial forms like <hi rend="italic"
                    >expudoratus,</hi><hi rend="italic">intimoratus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >caloratus.</hi></p>
                <p>6. The terminations <hi rend="italic">-im</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-iter</hi>
                    largely replace <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in adverbs: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    inordinatim, pressim,</hi><hi rend="italic">avariter, improbiter.</hi></p>
                <p>7. Verbs of secondary derivation take the place of simple verbs, thus meeting the
                    love for fuller forms, as <hi rend="italic">mensurare, amaricare, taediare,
                    potionare, deteriorare</hi>; an intensive force is given by composition with <hi
                    rend="italic">ad, de, cum, ex, in,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ob</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">; e.g., adminari,</hi><hi rend="italic">coinquinare, confortare,
                    deplanare, elonginquare, incrassare, obdulcare;</hi> and sometimes, in imitation
                    of the Greek, there is a double prefix, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >adincrescere,</hi><hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >conterrere,</hi><hi rend="italic">obrelinquere,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >discooperire</hi><hi rend="italic">( =</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >découvrir).</hi></p>
                <p>8. Intensive and frequentative verbs are especially common, and have given rise
                    to many Romance words; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >compressare,</hi><hi rend="italic">proiectare, recollectare.</hi></p>
                <p>9. In composition there is great freedom, and the use of the negative <hi
                    rend="italic">in-</hi> is very common, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">imbonitas, disconvenientia, indicto-audientia,
                    quaterducatus</hi><hi rend="italic">( = tetrarch),</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >admanumdeductor.</hi> Hybrid forms are common, like <hi rend="italic"
                    >thelodives,</hi><hi rend="italic">accidia</hi> (for ακηδία), <hi rend="italic"
                    >cataplectatio (κaτaτληyμ0s),</hi><hi rend="italic">aporiari</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(iπopeiσθai).</hi> Especially noteworthy is the use of two
                    prepositions or an adverb with a preposition, as <hi rend="italic">de mane (
                    =</hi><hi rend="italic">demain),</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >foris</hi><hi rend="italic">( = dehors), de</hi><hi rend="italic">intus,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">ab intus</hi><hi rend="italic">(dans =de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ab intus),</hi><hi rend="italic">de retro (≈</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >derrière),</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">sursum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">( =</hi><hi rend="italic">dessus),</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi><hi rend="italic">ante ( =</hi><hi rend="italic">avant).</hi></p>
                <p>10. In inflexion there are many irregularities, largely due to the reappearance
                    of forms which had long been obsolete in the literary language, but partly
                    produced by the love of fuller forms, often resulting in heteroclite words. To
                    the first class belong ιt-stems inflected according to the second declension,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,fmcti,</hi><hi rend="italic">victi, strepiti,</hi>
                    &amp;c.; masculine for neuters, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,fanus, foenus,
                    lignus,</hi> &amp;c., and, on the other hand, <hi rend="italic">nasum,
                    populum,</hi> &amp;c.; numerous pronominal forms, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >.alis, ipsud,</hi><hi rend="italic">alio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">illo</hi>
                    (dat. ), &amp;c. To the second class belong <hi rend="italic">ossum for os</hi>
                    (comp. August., <hi rend="italic">L&gt;oct. Christ.,</hi> iii. 3: <hi
                    rend="italic">mallem quippe</hi><hi rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >barbarismo dici</hi><hi rend="italic">“non</hi><hi rend="italic">est

                    ideo esset minus apertum, quia magis Latinum est), princi-pens for princeps,

                    rend="italic">lampas, retia</hi> for <hi rend="italic">rete,</hi> &amp;c.
                    Comparatives and superlatives are largely invented, often with the aid of <hi
                    rend="italic">magis</hi> and7√us, sometimes used pleonastically’ as <hi
                    rend="italic">plus</hi><hi rend="italic">lucidiores.</hi> In verbs analogy has
                    often replaced the classical forms by others which seemed more regular: <hi
                    rend="italic">odio</hi> is inflected throughout like <hi rend="italic"
                    >audio</hi>; verbs are transferred from one conjugation to another, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">floriet,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fugiit,</hi><hi rend="italic">linies, extergunt</hi>; compare perfects like <hi
                    rend="italic">contcrui, porregi, collexi, prandiderunt,</hi> futures like <hi
                    rend="italic">augeam, persuadeam,</hi><hi rend="italic">metuebitis, peries,
                    scibo, sepelibo.</hi> Many deponents appear with active forms, as so commonly in
                    archaic Latin, and less frequently <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>11. In the meaning of words there are many changes, especially in the way of
                    giving a concrete force to abstract and figurative forms. Some of these preserve
                    their acquired force in the Romance languages: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cortina</hi> (curtain), <hi rend="italic">focus (fuoco,
                    feu),</hi><hi rend="italic">exhibitio</hi> ( = maintenance), <hi rend="italic"
                    >papilio</hi><hi rend="italic">(pavillon),</hi><hi rend="italic">sella</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(selle),</hi><hi rend="italic">spatula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(épaule),</hi><hi rend="italic">substantia</hi> ( = property), <hi
                    rend="italic">venatio</hi><hi rend="italic">(venaison),</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gentes</hi><hi rend="italic">(gens),</hi><hi rend="italic">exterminare</hi>
                    (exterminate), <hi rend="italic">instaurare</hi> (store), <hi rend="italic"
                    >involare (embler), rememorari</hi> (remember), <hi rend="italic"
                    >renuntiare</hi> (renounce), <hi rend="italic">traducere</hi> (traduce), <hi
                    rend="italic">recuperari</hi> (recover), <hi rend="italic">stare</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(être).</hi><hi rend="italic">Ad</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >apud</hi> are treated as equivalent; <hi rend="italic">de</hi> is constantly
                    used with an instrumental force, and as equal to <hi rend="italic">ex:</hi> it
                    replaces the partitive genitive <hi rend="italic">(de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >colentibus multitudo magna</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">tantum
                    de chartis),</hi> and sometimes forms with its case a substantive used as a
                    nominative <hi rend="italic">(ampulla in qua de oleo [de l'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">huile]</hi><hi rend="italic">continebatur).</hi></p>
                <p>12. In syntax there is everywhere visible a negligent simplicity of structure,
                    careless of grammatical rule, but aiming at directness and ready
                    intelligibility. Hence the tendency to analytic rather than synthetic
                    construction, observable in earlier stages, is extended. Prepositions are
                    constantly used instead of the simple cases, often with entire neglect of their
                    classical construction: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">cum, de, ex, in,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sub</hi>
                    (of rest), <hi rend="italic">prae, pro, sine,</hi> with acc.; <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sub</hi> (of motion), <hi rend="italic">intra,
                    post,</hi> &amp;c., with abl.). Verbs are construed <hi rend="italic"
                    >κατά</hi><hi rend="italic">συveσιv,</hi> instead of according to classical
                    usage: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">egere</hi> c. acc., <hi
                    rend="italic">misereri</hi> and <hi rend="italic">impedire</hi> c. dat. <hi
                    rend="italic">llle, hie,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">is</hi> are used for the
                    definite article, <hi rend="italic">unus</hi> for the indefinite. <hi
                    rend="italic">Quod, quia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quoniam</hi> are constantly
                    used for the accusative with the infinitive; the indicative follows <hi
                    rend="italic">ut</hi> and indirect interrogatives. Sometimes (as at times in
                    modern German) the subjunctive is used in expressing astonishment. The
                    infinitive follows a preposition, as <hi rend="italic">quomodo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">potest hie nobis dare</hi><hi rend="italic">carnem cui
                    manducare</hi><hi rend="italic">(à manger)·, non</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >habuit</hi><hi rend="italic">linde</hi><hi rend="italic">reddere</hi> (comp,
                    <hi rend="italic">de quoi vivre).</hi> The pluperfect conj ιιnctive frequently
                    replaces the imperfect (comp, <hi rend="italic">que je punisse),</hi> and the
                    perfect infinitive the imperfect, especially with∕&gt;&lt;wιwn and <hi
                    rend="italic">debeo.</hi> The ablative gerund often takes the place of a
                    participle, and the gerundive of a future infinitive.</p>
                <p>Of Graecisms, which are very numerous in the literal versions of the Bible, the
                    only one requiring notice here is the frequent use of <hi rend="italic"
                    >habco</hi> with the infinitive (not unknown even to Cicero), which has given
                    rise to the Romance future.</p>
                <p>The changes of pronunciation which had been effected by this time consisted
                    partly in the λvider extension given to tendencies previously existing in the
                    popular speech, partly in that gradual disintegration and weakening of sounds
                    always observable in the history of a language. Our knowledge of them has to be
                    derived almost wholly from inscriptions; for, although the conclusions derived
                    from these may sometimes be usefully supplemented by the evidence of
                    manuscripts, there is usually a doubt possible in the latter case whether the
                    forms occurring bear witness to the pronunciation of the author or to that of
                    the copyist in a later age. Interesting evidence is sometimes furnished by the
                    rhymes found in the poets who discarded the classical forms of verse for rhyming
                    metres. For instance, the tendency to drop a final consonant, shown in
                    inscriptions of every period, comes out plainly in the verses of Sedulius, who
                    has the following rhymes: <hi rend="italic">pectoris—dei,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >impie</hi><hi rend="italic">—times,</hi><hi rend="italic">viderant</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">praeviam, personat</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">pignora, millia— victimam, fundere—originem,
                    torridi—obstruit.</hi> The following table (mainly from Schuchardt, <hi
                    rend="italic">Vokalismus</hi><hi rend="italic">des Vulgärlatein,</hi> i. 104-5)
                    gives the principal facts of the popular pronunciation, with an indication of
                    the periods at which the change can be proved to have taken place. It will be
                    understood that it is always possible that the more correct pronunciation may
                    have been retained side by side with the corruption long after the latter makes
                    its first appearance.</p>

                <p>The assibilation of <hi rend="italic">cl</hi> commenced in Africa, not before the
                    time of Alexander Severas (222-235 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and was late
                    in extending to Italy; in Gaul it was common in the 7th century; that of <hi
                    rend="italic">ti</hi> was generally adopted even by the educated in the 5th
                    century. In the 6th and 7th century <hi rend="italic">g</hi> was dropped after
                    vowels before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> or <hi rend="italic">i (vinti =
                    viginti)</hi> in Africa. This phenomenon had been common in Umbrian and
                    Oscam</p>
                <p>The exact date of some of these changes is open to question; but it Would be
                    impossible to attempt to determine it without a fuller discussion of the
                    evidence than is here possible. Ou the whole, it may be asserted with confidence
                    that all these changes had been fully established before the end of the 6th
                    century after Christ. The question of the relation of the Latin language to the
                    various Romance tongues which have been derived from it is one which can be
                    discussed in detail only under the head of· the several languages. The general
                    character of the relation is all that can be touched upon here. But it is of
                    importance to notice that the metaphor which is embodied in the phrase “mother
                    and daughter languages” holds good only for literature. From this point of view
                    Μ. Littré writes with justice: “Latin alters without doubt towards the end of
                    the empire and after the arrival of the barbarians, and the style of Gregory of
                    Tours is very far removed from the puritv of Livy; but after all it is Latin,
                    and not one of the Neo-Latin languages. Then all at once it disappears, and we
                    see arising, as if from under the ground, the various idioms to which it has
                    given birth. It dies suddenly and without transformation, so that these
                    secondary languages cannot be considered as the metamorphosis or expansion of
                    it. We have no right to say that Latin is continued in the new languages; it
                    died without developing itself, but it died leaving children and heirs.” Such a
                    breach of continuity is wholly inconceivable as an historical procedure. From
                    the popular Latin various dialects were gradually fonned, assuming forms
                    differing with the various influences which were brought to bear upon them. 11
                    is true that there is much in the derived languages which cannot be shown to
                    have existed in the popular Latin; but if we set aside what is evidently due to
                    the action of foreign, especially Teutonic idioms—and this is to be found far
                    more in the vocabulary than in the syntax—there is nothing which may not fairly
                    be ascribed to the operation of tendencies already existing in the plebeian
                    speech. By degrees the custom grew up of confining the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Latina</hi> to the literary language, while the popular speech was known as <hi
                    rend="italic">lingua</hi><hi rend="italic">Romana.</hi> As early as 660 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> St Mummolinus was elected bishop of Noy on, “quia
                    praevalebat, non tantum in Teutonica, sed etiam in Romana lingua.” In the middle
                    of the next century the <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum,</hi> speaking of St
                    Adalhard, abbot of Corbey, brings out the distinction still more clearly: “qui
                    si vulgari, id est, Romana lingua loqueretur, omnium aliarum putaretur inscius;
                    si vero Teutonica, enitebat perfectius, si Latina, in nulla omnino absolutius.”
                    The famous “glosses of Reichenau” of the same date explain some words of the
                    Latin vulgate in the popular language: <hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">caementarii</hi><hi rend="italic">=∙macioni</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(maçons).</hi> In the beginning of the 9th century the church ordered the
                    priest to preach, not in literary Latin, but in the popular tongue. The oath of
                    Strasburg (842 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> happily preserved in a
                    contemporary record, gives us what may be called with equal justice the latest
                    specimen of the Latin or the earliest example of the French language.</p>

                <p>The details of the changes which the popular Latin experienced in passing into
                    the Romance languages cannot be given in this connexion; but a few of the
                    leading features may be not improperly noticed. It is to be remarked at the
                    outset, however, that these concern only those portions of the vocabulary which
                    have come by direct descent from the Latin; in all the Romance languages there
                    is a large element which is due to borrowing at a later stage by the learned;
                    for this portion the tendencies to be mentioned do not come into play. The
                    Italian <hi rend="italic">cagione,</hi> Spanish <hi rend="italic">velar,</hi>
                    French <hi rend="italic">fréle,</hi> are examples of the first class; I tai. <hi
                    rend="italic">occasione,</hi> Span, <hi rend="italic">vigilar,</hi> French <hi
                    rend="italic">fragile,</hi> are instances of the second. We notice then that (1)
                    the accented vowel, “the soul of the word,” as it is called by Diez, is always
                    retained, subject to phonetic changes: comp. <hi rend="italic"
                    >rdbiem≈rage,</hi><hi rend="italic">crétam=craie.</hi> (2) An unaccented vowel
                    in the immediate neighbourhood of an accented one is usually lost: comp, <hi
                    rend="italic">au,rtcula≈ oreille = orccchio,</hi> or changed for another,
                    especially«, almost arbitrarily, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >silvaticus</hi><hi rend="italic">=&gt;salvaggio =</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sauvage.</hi> (3) Diphthongs are rarely retained; the tendency noticed already
                    in Latin to change them into simple vowels continued to operate; and the
                    numerous diphthongs in the Romance languages are usually of later origin,
                    arising either from contraction, or from the modification of simple vowels. (4)
                    A mute between two vowels is commonly lost: comp, <hi rend="italic"
                    >frigidus</hi><hi rend="italic">=froid≈freddo; laudarc =</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >louer.</hi> Hiatus thus caused is usually removed by contraction. (5) When two
                    mutes are brought into contact, by the loss of the intermediate vowel, the
                    former is generally sacrificed: <hi rend="italic">manducare</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">=mangiare, manger; berbicarius=∙</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >berger.</hi> (6) C before <hi rend="italic">a, o,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >u,</hi> before a consonant, or at the end of a word, commonly remains, but
                    occasionally is softened; it is only in French that as a rule <hi rend="italic"
                    >ca</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">cha</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ehe,</hi> as in
                    <hi rend="italic">caballus</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cheval,</hi><hi rend="italic">cambiare</hi><hi rend="italic">= changer,</hi>
                    while <hi rend="italic">co, cu</hi> are retained, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >collum</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">cou,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cuneus == coin.</hi> When medial, it is softened usually in Spanish, and
                    frequently in Italian; in French it passes into <hi rend="italic">y</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">i,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">doyen= decanus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">braie</hi><hi rend="italic">= braca,</hi> or is lost, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">mie—mica, prior ≈</hi><hi rend="italic">precari.</hi> C before <hi
                    rend="italic">e, i, ae, oe,</hi> is almost invariably assibilated, in accordance
                    with a linguistic law, examples of which might be adduced from the most diverse
                    quarters. G has passed through precisely analogous changes. (7) The liquids <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> freely interchange; and, while
                    in Latin itself <hi rend="italic">l</hi> rarely if ever becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> except under the influence of dissimilation, in the
                    Romance languages this change is apparently quite as common as the reverse: <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">lusciniola</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >=</hi><hi rend="italic">rosig-</hi><hi rend="italic">nuolo≈</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rossignol.</hi> L regularly becomes <hi rend="italic">i</hi> after
                    <hi rend="italic">c (ch) f</hi> in Italian, and <hi rend="italic">al</hi> before
                    a mute becomes <hi rend="italic">au</hi> in French. Both <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> are especially liable to metathesis, as
                    also in Latin and English: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Span, <hi rend="italic"
                    >blago</hi> from <hi rend="italic">baculus,</hi> Ital. <hi rend="italic"
                    >frugare</hi> from <hi rend="italic">furca.</hi> N frequently becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">pampre</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >pampinus·,</hi> but the reverse rarely happens. (8) Before <hi rend="italic"
                    >sp, st, sc,</hi> Spanish always, French and Provençal usually, but Italian
                    never prefixes <hi rend="italic">e∙.</hi> comp, <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiritus·,</hi> Span, <hi rend="italic">espiritu,</hi> French <hi rend="italic"
                    >esprit,</hi> Prov. <hi rend="italic">csperit,</hi> Ital. <hi rend="italic"
                    >spirito.</hi></p>
                <p>It is needless to add that assimilation, syncope, and the avoidance of a harsh
                    concurrence of consonants, either by the rejection of one or more of them, or by
                    the insertion of a vowel, have all played a great part in the consonantal system
                    of the Romance languages. A table of the chief changes of consonants in
                    combination will be found in Diez, <hi rend="italic">Grammaire des
                    Langues</hi><hi rend="italic">Romanes,</hi> vol. i. p. 282.</p>
                <p>In nouns the inflexions denoting cases were generally lost and their functions
                    supplied in the genitive, dative, and ablative by the use of prepositions, and
                    this in two ways. On the one hand French and Provençal, following a tendency
                    common in popular Latin, took the accusative as the typical oblique case, and
                    used forms thence derived for the objective case, while forms derived from the
                    nominative constituted the subjective case: <hi rend="italic">eg.,</hi> sing,
                    subj. <hi rend="italic">murs</hi><hi rend="italic">(=rnurus),</hi> obj. <hi
                    rend="italic">mur ( = murum),</hi> plur. subj. <hi rend="italic">mur ( =
                    muri),</hi> obj.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n358/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0358-0341"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic">murs</hi><hi rend="italic">[=</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >muros).</hi> But by the 14th century this distinction, no longer corresponding
                    to any facts in the pronunciation of the French language, fell into disuse, and
                    the objective form alone was used, the last trace of inflexion thus
                    disappearing. On the other hand, Italian and Spanish seem never to have passed
                    through the former stage, but to have adopted from the first the accusative form
                    as the basis of their own subjective as well as objective case, although in the
                    plural <hi rend="italic">[cor one, anni)</hi> a desire to avoid confusion has
                    led the Italian to adopt forms pointing rather to the nominative. Again, the
                    neuter gender is lost entirely in the Romance languages; neuter words have
                    become masculine as a rule, not, however, without many exceptions, due in some
                    cases to false analogy, in others to the corruptions of the popular Latin. We
                    may notice also the development of the article out of the popular use of <hi
                    rend="italic">ille</hi> and <hi rend="italic">unus</hi> found in all the Romance
                    languages.</p>
                <p>The comparison of adjectives shows the steady growth of the preference for
                    analytic over <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> synthetic forms, which is a
                    characteristic of Romance grammar generally. The use of <hi rend="italic"
                    >magis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">plus,</hi> comparatively rare, especially the
                    latter, in Latin, has become quite normal, the former in Spanish, Portuguese,
                    and Roumanian, the latter in the other language, while the suffixed forms <hi
                    rend="italic">-ior</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-issimus</hi> have left but few
                    traces, and the definite article has been generally employed to form the
                    superlative on quite a new principle.</p>
                <p>In the case of pronouns some of the most common (e.y., <hi rend="italic">hie, is,
                    uter)</hi> are lost altogether, and many new ones are created by
                    composition.</p>
                <p>In the conjugation of verbs, the principal changes are due to the disintegration
                    of the old forms, leading to their replacement by compound forms. In popular
                    Latin there was already a strong tendency to analytic forms, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">habeo compertum, habeo dicere,</hi> which supplied the model for
                    numerous similar expressions. Thus the passive inflexions have been entirely
                    replaced by the use of auxiliary verbs; the perfect is formed with the aid of
                    <hi rend="italic">habere</hi> (for which Spanish and Portuguese often employ <hi
                    rend="italic">tenere [tener,</hi><hi rend="italic">ter]),</hi> the future is
                    compounded with <hi rend="italic">habeo</hi><hi rend="italic">(j’aimer-ai,</hi>
                    &amp;c.); a new mood, the conditional, is formed by a termination borrowed from
                    the past imperfect; and supines and gerunds are entirely lost. In regard to the
                    inflexion of particular verbs, it is of especial importance to notice the
                    distinction between strong and weak forms, the accent in the former falling on
                    the root <hi rend="italic">(créscere),</hi> and in the latter on the termination
                    <hi rend="italic">(amdre);</hi> comp, <hi rend="italic">tiens</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∙=ttneo,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">tenons=tenirnus.</hi></p>
                <p>In adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions, the chief point to notice is the
                    extent to which, as in pronouns, simple forms have been replaced by .compound
                    forms, either as a result of the indistinguishable shape assumed by the latter
                    in course of time, or with a view to a more complete expression of meaning. The
                    former cause has led, for example, to the loss of adverbs distinguished from
                    adjectives merely by a termination, worn away by the lapse of time; the latter
                    to compounds like <hi rend="italic">désormais</hi><hi rend="italic">[-=de
                    ex</hi><hi rend="italic">hora magis),</hi><hi rend="italic">beaucoup</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">( =</hi><hi rend="italic">bellum colaphum,</hi> “a fine stroke
                    ”).</p>
                <p>In derivation the Romance languages are especially rich, the loss of numerous
                    simple Latin words, which either were too short to bear the abbreviating effects
                    of time, or would have assumed an inconvenient form under the influence of the
                    necessary phonetic changes, being compensated by new creations. Thus in the
                    place of <hi rend="italic">res, vis, ius,</hi><hi rend="italic">os, rus,
                    sus,</hi><hi rend="italic">crus, rnus,</hi> we find derivatives from <hi
                    rend="italic">causa,</hi><hi rend="italic">fortia,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >directum,</hi><hi rend="italic">bucca,</hi><hi rend="italic">campania,
                    troia,</hi><hi rend="italic">gamba, sorex</hi>; and diminutives very frequently
                    replace their primitives. We may notice finally how frequently it was necessary
                    to adopt new forms in order to avoid homonyms, thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >bellum</hi> was driven out by <hi rend="italic">bellus, aequus</hi> by <hi
                    rend="italic">cquus,</hi><hi rend="italic">puer</hi> by <hi rend="italic"

                    Frequently words of nonLatin origin were employed for this purpose.</p>
                <p>But the formation of the Romance languages, and their occasional employment in
                    popular songs and stories, at first hardly affected at all the use of Latin as
                    the language of literature. Its adoption as the means of utterance of the
                    Christian church lent to it, in the days of its most marked decay, a new though
                    a strangely transformed life. So appropriated, it became familiar to all who had
                    even the elements of education throughout western Europe; it was universally
                    retained in the services of the church, if not in the discourses with which
                    these services were sometimes, but by no means always, accompanied; all
                    philosophy and theology to which the new and unformed popular idioms could give
                    no expression was necessarily expressed in its terminology; and it remained, as
                    it is at the present day, the official language of the ecclesiastical
                    authorities. In France it is not until the 10th century that we find any
                    considerable remains of the vernacular in the form of charters and other
                    muniments, and literary prose does not begin until the 12th century, when French
                    versions of the chronicles, originally written in Latin, are fairly common. In
                    Italy, as was perhaps natural, the use of Latin for literature was retained
                    still more tenaciously, and the development of the national language in its new
                    form was extremely slow. It was not before the 13th century that there was any
                    serious attempt at writing in Italian; the earliest prose work, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gomposizione del Mundo,</hi> dating from the middle of that
                    century, quite in accordance with the spirit of Italian thought at the time, was
                    a scientific treatise. Numerous <hi rend="italic">novelle</hi> are preserved to
                    us from about the same period; but the use of Italian as an organ of literary
                    expression was still so little established that Dante found it natural to write,
                    not only his political treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Monarchia,</hi> but also his defence of the vulgar tongue <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Vulgari Eloquio,</hi> in Latin.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The history of waiter Spinelli is, however,
                    enough to show that Italian was already assuming precise and definite shape, to
                    say nothing of the Sicilian and early Florentine poets.</p></note> Even in the
                    sixteenth century sermons addressed to a mixed audience in Italy were frequently
                    delivered in Latin. The fact that so large a proportion of the chronicles of the
                    Middle Ages proceeded from the monasteries serves to explain the continued use
                    of a language familiar to the writers alike in their religious exercises and in
                    their theological studies; and in our own English chronicles we have perhaps a
                    unique instance of the history of a nation recorded for centuries in its own
                    vernacular. Further, as the clergy supplied the secretaries and often the
                    ministers of state in every court in western Europe, Latin continued to be the
                    language of diplomacy and public business; and, as all science and learning was
                    confined to them or to their pupils, works appealing to a learned audience were
                    of necessity clothed in the same garb. Of the vast mass of Latin poetry produced
                    in the cloisters of the Middle Ages, perhaps it is enough to say, with a scholar
                    whose studies made him exceptionally familiar with it, “It offers no one
                    exception to the eternal irrepealable law, that no great poet is inspired but in
                    his native language.” Even the Latin hymns, some of which have taken their place
                    among the perennial treasures of the church, owe their charm almost wholly to
                    the intensity of their religious emotions, and to the lofty or plaintive music
                    to which they were wedded, and not to any power in wielding the resources of the
                    language, or happy artistic skill. It is perhaps in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Imitatione</hi><hi rend="italic">Christi</hi> that
                    ecclesiastical Latin is seen in its most perfect form. The style is of course
                    wholly unlike that of the classical writers; but the Hebraic individualism,
                    which in the Latin fathers often seems to clash inhar-moniously with the general
                    tone of the diction, has here proved strong enough to absorb the whole into its
                    own key. Its terse and pregnant vigour, its direct simplicity, its profound
                    thought, and its intense passion of self-devotion give it a place in the history
                    of literature hardly inferior to that which it has always held among works of
                    religious edification. It was one of the happy effects of a universal
                    language.that such a book, embodying, as none other did, the whole spirit of
                    mediaeval Christianity, should at once be accessible to the whole of
                    Christendom.</p>
                <p>During the long period for which Latin continued to be the language of learning
                    and science, we find the writers who used it dividing themselves broadly into
                    two great classes, according as they were accustomed to employ the current
                    language of the cloister and the court, or aimed at a reproduction of the rhythm
                    and diction of classical times. Of course the line cannot be drawn sharply, and
                    all degrees of purity in idiom and syntax are represented, from the barbarous
                    expressions which teem in many of the chroniclers to the purism of the
                    Ciceronians. But it is not hard, as a rule, to determine in the case of any
                    particular writer whether his style is merely derived from the traditional
                    teachings of the schools, or drawn from a fresh study of the great models; and,
                    while it is impossible to trace in detail the fluctuations in the greater or
                    less badness of the former group, it may not be improper to sketch in outline
                    the origin, the development, and it is to be feared that we must add the
                    decline, of the art of using the Latin language with purity and grace. The
                    attempt to return to something like the classical standard may perhaps have
                    originated in the schools of Charles the Great, but it was least unsuccessful
                    where, as in England, Latin was never a living language, and all knowledge of it
                    had to be obtained from regular grammatical instruction. In the 9th and 10th
                    centuries reference is very rarely made to the classical writers; it was only in
                    the 11th century, under the influence of the schools of Lanfranc and Anselm,
                    that a purer taste and a wider knowledge begin to show themselves. If the
                    impulse came from Italy, the scholars of England and France soon surpassed their
                    masters, and there is probably no Italian scholar who can be placed by the side
                    of John of Salisbury, or (in the next century) of Abelard and Bernaιd of
                    Clairvaux. But the influence of the mendicant friars, and the corruption of the
                    monastic houses, led to a decline at least as marked as the revival; and the
                    Latin of the 13th century was not less barbarous, as a rule, than that of the
                    10th. A far more enduring movement for reform is connected with the name of
                    Petrarch (1304-1374). According to his own account the sweetness and
                    sonorousness of the periods of Cicero charmed his ears, when a boy, and made all
                    other Latin seem to him harsh and discordant. Of course he was unable to escape
                    altogether the influences of his time, and the more accurate scholars of a later
                    age, aided by the vast improvement in the <hi rend="italic">subsidia</hi> of
                    learning, such as dictionaries and grammars, find much to censure in his
                    diction. But at least he set the example of that enthusiastic study of the great
                    ancient models which is the only possible road to a finished and harmonious
                    Latin style; and the lesson that he taught was not destined to be forgotten,
                    until it had borne its due fruits. His favourite pupil, John of Ravenna, was
                    himself the teacher of the best scholars of the next generation; and to <pb

                    has commonly been assigned the distinction of being the father oi the pure and
                    elegant Latinity of the Renaissance. His devotion to the study of Cicero is
                    shown by the plan which he formed to fill up, by conjectural links, the numerous
                    deficiencies in the MSS. of the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Oratore</hi> then known to scholars, a design happily superseded by the
                    discovery of the famous <hi rend="italic">Codex Laudianus.</hi> Additional
                    material was furnished by the recovery of not a few authors or portions of
                    authors of the best period by the unwearied diligence of Poggio Bracciolini; and
                    from henceforward the study of the Latin classics was pursued with the happiest
                    results. Throughout the 15th century no literary acquirement was more valued
                    than a good Latin style; the patronage extended to scholarship by the learned
                    Pope Nicholas V. and the grammatical teaching of scholars like Laurentius Valla
                    combined to encourage its pursuit with energy and success. Towards the latter
                    part of the century Politian at Florence, and Hermolaus Barbaras at Venice,
                    showed a mastery over the Latin language which won for them the enthusiastic
                    admiration of their contemporaries; and, though the learning of these eminent
                    scholars proved not unfrequently injurious to their style by inducing an
                    affectation of obsolete or unfamiliar words, there is no reason to deny that on
                    the whole this admiration was well deserved. In Germany they had a worthy rival,
                    by some even ranked before them, in Agricola; in France and England there was as
                    yet no one who, in the judgment afterwards expressed by Erasmus, could be said
                    to write Latin at all. As far as purity of style went, the highest pitch of
                    excellence was doubtless reached by the Italians towards the beginning of the
                    16th century. Sadolet, Bembo, Paulus Manutius, and, we must in justice add,
                    Longolius in France, wrote Latin with a grace and finish which place their works
                    in respect of style almost on a level with those of their great model Cicero.
                    But it cannot be denied that their fastidiousness of language often led them to
                    sacrifice the fruits to the flowers of learning, and justly drew down upon them
                    the witty and biting censures of Erasmus in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ciceronianus.</hi> In the controversy between the men of learning and the men
                    of taste, the best tendencies of the age were decidedly on the side of the
                    former; and the Italian scholars whose object, as Hallam well expresses it, was
                    “to write pure Latin, to glean little morsels of Roman literature, to talk a
                    heathenish philosophy in private, and to leave the world to its own abuses,” had
                    little influence on the next generation in comparison with the wider culture and
                    loftier aims of scholars like Erasmus and Melanchthon. The rapid extension of a
                    knowledge of Greek literature, especially in England, France, and Germany, had
                    its effects in the same direction. Men threw themselves into the new world of
                    thought thus revealed with an eager avidity which left little leisure for that
                    elaborate polishing of periods which had been the delight of the Ciceronianists.
                    The 16th century saw enormous advances in the knowledge of antiquity; but the
                    most learned scholars were by no means always equally famous for their skill in
                    the use of the Latin language. Even in Italy itself the most eminent writers on
                    classical subjects approach rather to the German than to the Ciceronian type,
                    and are more distinguished for the width of their erudition and the abundance of
                    their quotations than for elegance or purity of style. On this side of the Alps
                    the prevalence of the same type was, as might have been expected, all but
                    universal. Muretus alone perhaps maintained in this generation the best
                    traditions of style, and was pronounced, even by the judgment of the censorious
                    Scaliger, to have written better Latiu than any one since Cicero; in Italy,
                    however, he had a formidable rival in the last of the Ciceronians, Paulus
                    Manutius. It shows how little Latin was now a living language that the latter,
                    like all his school, refused to speak in Latin, for fear that the necessities of
                    daily conversation should make him familiar with barbarous phrases, which would
                    hardly fail to taint his written style. Others for a similar reason always
                    recited the breviary in Greek, just as in later days some have refused to read
                    the New Testament in the original language for fear of spoiling the purity of
                    their Attic prose. In Germany especially the influence of Lipsius founded a new
                    school of Latinists, based on the imitation of the silver Latinity of Tacitus
                    and Seneca, and conspicuous for some of the merits, and more than all the
                    faults, which have been noticed above as marking those authors. In Britain the
                    only scholar whose style merits especial notice is George Buchanan, whose prose
                    is hardly less admirable than his famous poetical version of the Psalms. On the
                    whole it must be said that, while the improvement in works of reference, and in
                    methods of education generally (especially through the activity of the Jesuits),
                    raises the average of correctness and purity, there is less grace and power than
                    may be found among the best of the writers of an earlier time. As yet the use of
                    Latin as a means of literary expression and of public business showed no signs
                    of decline, except perhaps in Germany, where the version of the Bible by Luther
                    and his popular works in the vernacular had given a model for literary German,
                    and in England, where some of the great works of controversial theology, notably
                    Hooker’s <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Polity,</hi> were already published in
                    English, doing thereby incalculable service to the dignity and the enrichment of
                    the native tongue. But during the 17th century, as a consequence of the steady
                    development of the various national literatures, Latin came to be more and more
                    merely the language of the learned. Some of the most eminent scholars belong to
                    this period; and among them Heinsius, Grotius, Salmasius, and his more
                    illustrious antagonist Milton are all famous for the elegance of their diction;
                    while Scioppius and V^ossius contributed largely to the scientific knowledge of
                    grammar. But towards the end of the century complaints as to the general decay
                    of learning frequently occur. In Germany it was almost extinct. In France the
                    Jesuit colleges maintained the traditions of a pure Latinity with some success,
                    and were noted for the polished though sometimes too rhetorical style in which
                    their exercises were conducted. In England the decay of Latin was never so
                    complete as that of Greek; and the great name of Bentley shines out conspicuous,
                    set off, it must be admitted, by the school-boy darkness of most of his rivals.
                    Even he did not escape the ferule of the schoolmaster, Richard Johnson of
                    Nottingham, who claims in his <hi rend="italic">Anti-Aristarchus</hi> to have
                    pointed out more than ninety errors in the great scholar’s Latinity. In the 18th
                    century we still find Latin used for works on science and philosophy, which
                    appealed to the learned in all countries; to say nothing of Newton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia</hi> (1689), Burnet’s <hi rend="italic">Theoria
                    Telluris</hi><hi rend="italic">Sacra</hi> (1694), and Ray’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Synopsis</hi><hi rend="italic">Methodica</hi> (1693), and subsequent botanical
                    works, we find even Linnaeus in 1760 issuing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae</hi> in Latin. But as an organ of general
                    literature it may be said to have expired in the course of the 17th century. The
                    last great philosopher who habitually employed Latin for his works was Leibnitz
                    (1646-1716); perhaps the last important work in English theology written in
                    Latin was Bull’s <hi rend="italic">Defensio Fidei</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nicenae</hi> (1685).</p>
                <p>The use of Latin in diplomacy died out towards the end of the 17th century. The
                    Spanish embassy sent to the court of James I. in 1605 used sometimes Latin and
                    sometimes French; the Latin state-papers written by Mil ton during the
                    Commonwealth are well known; and in the negotiations at Miinster (1644) even the
                    French representative, Μ. d’Avaux, prided himself on his skill in writing Latin.
                    But at Nymegen (1677) the Danish ambassador’s claim that the Latin language
                    should be used between the French representative and himself was rejected as an
                    impertinence; and he was obliged to agree that, while he might employ Latin
                    himself, the French should use their own language. At Ryswick, Temple opened the
                    proceedings in French; he was answered by the bishop of Gurk in Latin; but the
                    French envoys pleaded that they had forgotten their Latin, and the subsequent
                    proceedings were conducted in French (c∕. Bernard’s <hi rend="italic">Lectures
                    on Diplomacy,</hi> pp. 153-155). Long after this date the German empire insisted
                    that all negotiations with it should be conducted in Latin; and, although Joseph
                    II. attempted to make German the official language of Hungary in its place, he
                    was compelled to give way, and it was only in 1825 that Latin was for the first
                    time displaced by Magyar in the debates of the diet (c∕. vol. xii. p. 371). It
                    is now the universal practice that written communications from any European
                    power should be made in the language of that power, but oral intercourse is
                    carried on in French, with rare exceptions.</p>

                    storehouse of the inflexional forms. Dräger’s <hi rend="italic"

                    Hanover, 1877-78) is the most complete of recent grammars. In English the best
                    grammars are those of Madvig, Dr Kennedy, and Mr Roby. The first is excellent in
                    the syntax, and well represents the most complete knowledge of the Latin
                    language in its classical form to be gained without the aid of comparative
                    philology; the second in respect of etymology too frequently adopts not only the
                    facts but the less trustworthy theories of Corssen, while in syntax the full
                    collection of examples is sometimes encumbered by an awkward terminology; the
                    last is equally admirable for the clearness and fulness of its discussion of
                    phonetics, the careful historical treatment of inflexions, and the freshness and
                    precision of its syntax. For later Latin and its connexion with the Romance
