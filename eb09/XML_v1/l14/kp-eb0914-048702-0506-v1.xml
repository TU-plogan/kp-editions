                    according to the usual methods of Hebrew genealogical history as the descendants
                    of Levi, the third son of Jacob by Leah (Gen. xxix. 34).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Gen. xxix. 34 the name of Levi is
                    connected with ∏⅛. “attach oneself to.” The form, however, is that of a gentile
                    noun, and it is most probably a <hi rend="italic">nisbeh</hi> from Leah, as
                    suggested by Wellhausen. See also Stade in <hi rend="italic">Z. f.
                    ATliche</hi><hi rend="italic">Wissenschaft,</hi> i. 115.</p></note> But in
                    Hebrew genealogies we are not necessarily entitled to look upon the eponymus of
                    a tribe as more than an ideal personality, and, without entering into the large
                    question how far the patriarchal history may be held to furnish exceptions to
                    this rule, it may be observed that the only narrative in which, on a literal
                    interpretation, Levi appears as a person (Gen. xxxiv.) bears internal evidence
                    of the intention of the author to delineate under the form of personification
                    events in the history of the tribes of Levi and Simeon which must have taken
                    place after the sojourn of Israel in Egypt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Jacob in verse 30 is not a personal but a collective idea,
                    for he says, “I am a few men,” and the capture and total destruction of a
                    considerable city is in the nature of things the work of two tribes rather than
                    of two individuals.</p></note> The same events are alluded to in Gen. xlix. 5-7,
                    where Simeon and Levi are plainly spoken of as communities with a communal
                    assembly (<hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> p∏p). They were allied tribes or
                    brothers; their onslaught on the Shechemites was condemned by the rest of
                    Israel; it took place before the Hebrews had passed from pastoral to settled
                    life (ver. 5, “instruments of violence are their shepherds’ staves ”); and its
                    results were disastrous to the actors, when their cause was disavowed by their
                    brethren. The Bnê Hamor regained possession of Shechem, as we know from Judges
                    ix., and both the assailing tribes were scattered through Israel, and failed to
                    secure an independent territorial position. The details of this curious portion
                    of the earliest Hebrew history must remain obscure; the narrative in Gen. xxxiv.
                    does not really place them in so clear a light as the briefer reference in Gen.
                    xlix.; for the former chapter has been recast and largely added to by a late
                    writer, who looks upon the action of the brethren in the light of the priestly
                    legislation, and judges it much more favourably than is done in Gen. xlix. In
                    post-canonical Judaism the favourable view of the zeal of Levi and Simeon
                    becomes still more dominant (Judith ix. 2 <hi rend="italic">sq.; L. Jubil.,</hi>

                    represented as a crime, which imperilled the position of the Hebrews and was
                    fatal to the future of the tribes directly involved.</p>
                <p>But while the Levites were scattered throughout Israel their name does not
                    disappear from the roll of the tribes. In the Blessing of Moses (Deut, xxxiii.),
                    where Simeon is passed over, Levi still appears, not as a territorial tribe but
                    as the collective name for the priesthood. The priesthood meant is that of the
                    northern kingdom under the dynasty of Jehu, to which the chapter in question
                    belongs; and in fact we know that the priests of the important northern
                    sanctuary of Dan traced their origin to a Levite (Jud. xvii. 9), Jonathan the
                    son of Gershom, the son of Moses (Jud. xviii. 30).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is generally agreed that Moses (∏bθ) is
                    the true reading. The later Jews corrected the name to Manasseh by inserting the
                    letter J, but did not venture to do so except above the line (∏ti*⅛), so that
                    the reading of the archetype can still be restored.</p></note> That the Judaean
                    priesthood were also known as Levites in the later times of the kingdom appears
                    from the book of Deuteromony, especially from x. 8 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi>
                    xviii. 1 s∕.; and we learn from Ezek. xliv. 10 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> that
                    the Judaean Levites were not confined to the service of the temple, but included
                    the priests of the local high places abolished by Josiah. Alike in Judah and in
                    the north the priestly prerogative of Levi was traced back to the days of Moses
                    (Deut. x. 8, xxxiii. 8); but in later times at least the Judaean priesthood did
                    not acknowledge the Levitical status of their northern colleagues (1 Kings xii.
                    31). It must, however, be observed that the prophets Amos and Hosea never speak
                    of the northern priesthood as illegitimate, and Hosea iv. certainly implies the
                    opposite. Presumably it was only after the fall of Samaria, and the introduction
                    of large foreign elements into the population of the north, that the southern
                    priests began to disavow the ministers of the sanctuaries of Samaria, most of
                    whom can no longer have been representatives of the old priesthood as it existed
                    before the northern captivity (2 Kings xvii. 28, comp. Amos vii. 17, Jud. xviii.
                    30, 2 Kings xxiii. 20, in contrast with verses 8 <hi rend="italic">sqf.</hi></p>
                <p>In the most developed form of the hierarchical system the ministers of the
                    sanctuary are divided into two grades. All are regarded as Levites by descent,
                    but the mass of the Levites are mere subordinate ministers not entitled to
                    approach the altar or perform any strictly priestly function, and the true
                    priesthood is confined to the descendants of Aaron. In the documents which
                    reveal to us the actual state of the priesthood in the northern and southern
                    kingdoms before the exile, there is no trace of this distinction. Every Levite
                    is a priest, or at least is qualified to become such (Deut. x. 8. xviii. 7). The
                    subordinate and menial offices of the tabernacle are not assigned to members of
                    a holy guild; in Jerusalem at least they were mainly discharged by members of
                    the royal body-guard (the Carians and footmen, 2 Kings xi. 4, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hébf,</hi> or by bond slaves, the ancestors of the later Nethinim,—in either
                    case by men who might even be uncircumcised foreigners (Ezek. xliv. 7 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf.</hi> A Levitical priest was a legitimate priest; when the
                    author of 1 Kings xii. 31 wishes to represent Jeroboam’s priests as illegal he
                    contents himself with saying that they were not taken from the sons of Levi. The
                    first historical trace of a modification of this state of things is found in
                    connexion with the suppression of the local high places by Josiah, when their
                    priests were brought to Jerusalem and received their support from the temple
                    offerings, but were not permitted to minister at the altar (2 Kings xxiii. 9).
                    The priests of the temple, the sons of Zadok, were not prepared to concede to
                    their provincial brethren all the privileges which Deut, xviii. had proposed in
                    compensation for the loss of their local ministry. Ezekiel, after the fall of
                    the temple, in planning a scheme of ritual for the new temple, raises this
                    practical exclusion from the altar to the rank of a principle. In the new temple
                    the Levites who had ministered before the local altars shall be punished by
                    exclusion from proper priestly work, and shall fill the subordinate offices of
                    the sanctuary in place of the foreigners who had hitherto occupied them, but
                    shall not be permitted to pollute Jehovah’s house in future by their presence
                    (Ezek. xliv. 7 <hi rend="italic">sqf.</hi> After the exile this principle was
                    actually carried out: priests and Levites are distinguished in the list of the
                    Jews who returned under the decree of Cyrus (Ezra ii.; Neh. vii.); but the
                    former, that is, the descendants of the pre-exilic priests of the royal temple,
                    greatly outnumber the Levites or descendants of the priests of the high places.
                    At this time other classes of temple servants, the singers, the porters, the
                    Nethinim or slaves of the sanctuary, and the children of Solomon’s slaves, whose
                    hereditary service would, on Eastern principles, give them a pre-eminence over
                    other slaves of the sanctuary, are also still distinguished from the Levites;
                    but these distinctions lost their significance when the word Levite itself came
                    to mean a subordinate minister. In the time of Nehemiah, Levites and singers,
                    Levites and porters, are very much run into one (Neh. xi., xii., xiii.), and
                    ultimately the absorption of the other classes of subordinate ministers into the
                    hereditary guild of Levites is formally expressed in the shape of genealogies,
                    deriving the singers, and even families whose heathenish and foreign names show
                    them to have originally belonged to the Nethinim, from the ancient stock of
                    Levi.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the details,
                    and the proof that the later Levites included men whose actual ancestry belonged

                <p>The new hierarchical system found its legal basis in the Pentateuch, or rather in
                    the so-called priestly legislation, first publicly accepted as an integral part
                    of the Torah under Ezra and Nehemiah. Here the exclusion of the Levites from all
                    share in the proper priesthood of the sons of Aaron is precisely formulated
                    (Num. iii. <hi rend="italic">sqf;</hi> their service is regulated from the point
                    of view that they are essentially the servants and hereditary serfs of the
                    priests (iii. 9), while, on the other hand, they are recognized as possessing a
                    higher grade of holiness than the mass of the people, and are endowed with the
                    tithes, of which in turn they pay a tithe to the priests (Num. xviii. 21 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf.</hi> These regulations as to tithes were enforced by
                    Nehemiah; but the subordinate position of the Levites was hardly consistent with
                    their permanent enjoyment of revenues of such importance, and we learn from the
                    Talmud that they were finally transferred to the priests.<note anchored="true"

                    inalienable pasture ground (Num. xxxv.; Lev. xxv. 34), was apparently never put
                    in force after the exile.</p>

                    Chrom xv., xvi., xxiii.) or to Hezekiah (2 Chron. xxix.) and Josiah (2 Chrom
                    xxxv.). The chief point is the development of the musical service of the temple,
                    which has no place in the Pentateuch, but afterwards came to be of the first
                    importance, as we see from the Psalter, and attracted the special attention of
                    Greek observers (Theophrastus, <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Porph., <hi
                    rend="italic">De Abstin.,</hi> ii. 26).</p>
                <p>While it is not difficult to trace the history of the Levites from the time of
                    the Blessing of Moses and Deuteronomy downwards, the links connecting the
                    priestly tribe with the earlier fortunes of the tribe of Levi are hardly to be
                    determined with any certainty.</p>
                <p>According to the traditional view the scheme of the Levitical legislation, with
                    its double hierarchy of priests and Levites, is of Mosaic ordinance. But there
                    are many proofs that in the Pentateuch, as we possess it, divergent ordinances,
                    dating from very different ages, are all carried back by means of a legal
                    convention to the time of the wilderness journey. And, if the complete
                    hierarchical theory as it existed after the exile was really the work of Moses,
                    it is inexplicable that all trace of it was so completely lost in the time of
                    the monarchy, that Ezekiel speaks of the degradation of the non-Zadokite Levites
                    as a new thing and as a punishment for their share in the sin of the high
                    places, and that no clear evidence of the existence of a distinction between
                    priests and Levites has been found in any Hebrew writing demonstrably earlier
                    than the exile.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    recent defence of the traditional view by S. I. Curtiss <hi rend="italic">(The
                    Levitical Priests,</hi> 1877) still seeks such evidence in 1 Kings viii. 4. But
                    there are many evidences that the text of this part of Kings has undergone
                    considerable editing at a pretty late date. The LXX. translators did not read
                    the clause which speaks of “priests and Levites,” and the Chronicler read “the
                    Levite priests,”—the phrase characteristic of the Deuteronomic identification of
                    priestly and Levitical ministry.</p></note> It is indeed argued that the
                    narrative of the rebellion of Korah, and the list of Levitical cities in Josh.
                    xxi., imply that the precepts of the post-exile law were practically recognized
                    by Moses and Joshua; but it is certain that the distribution spoken of in Josh.
                    xxi. did not take place at the time of the conquest, because many of the cities
                    named were either not occupied by the Hebrews till long afterwards, or, if
                    conquered, were not held by Levites. The Levitical cities of Joshua are indeed
                    largely identical with ancient holy cities (Hebron, Shechem, Mahanaim, &amp;c.);
                    but in ancient Israel a holy city was one which possessed a noted sanctuary
                    (often of Canaanite origin), not one the inhabitants of which belonged to the
                    holy tribe. These sanctuaries had of course their local priesthoods, which in
                    the time of the monarchy were all called Levitical; and it is only in this
                    sense, not in that of the priestly legislation, that a town like Shechem can
                    ever have been Levitical. So again the narrative of Korah proves on critical
                    examination to be of composite origin; the parts of it which represent Korah as
                    a common Levite in rebellion against the priesthood of Aaron belong to a late
                    date, and the original form of the history knows nothing of the later
                    hierarchical system.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    the latest researches of Kuenen, <hi rend="italic">Theol. Tijdsch.,</hi> xii.

                    examined.</p></note></p>
                <p>We are thus compelled to give up the idea of carrying back the distinction of
                    Levites and Aaronites in the later sense to the time of Moses, and are excluded
                    from using the priestly parts of the Pentateuch and Joshua as a source for the
                    earliest history of the tribe. It still, however, remains certain that under the
                    monarchy the priestly consecration of Levi was referred to the time of Moses,
                    who was himself a member of the tribe, and in Dent. x. 8 the functions of Levi
                    are specially connected with the Mosaic sanctuary of the ark. Now we know from 1
                    Sam. ii. 27 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> that the priests of the ark in the period
                    of the Judges claimed descent from the family of Moses; and the case Of Micah’s
                    Levite shows that a descendant of Moses was regarded as a peculiarly fit priest.
                    The whole evidence conspires to show that from the time of Moses downward his
                    kin had a certain hereditary prerogative in connexion with the worship of
                    Jehovah. In the earliest times the ritual of Jehovah’s sanctuary had not
                    attained such a development as to occupy a whole tribe; but if, as appears
                    probable, the mass of the tribe of Levi was almost annihilated in the first age
                    after Moses, the name of Levite might very well continue to be known only in
                    connexion with those of the tribe who traced kin with Moses or remained by the
                    sanctuary. The multiplication of Hebrew holy places was effected partly by
                    syncretism with the Canaanites, partly in other ways that had nothing to do with
                    the Mosaic sanctuary, and so a variety of priestly guilds arose which certainly
                    cannot have been all of Levitical descent. But, as the nation was consolidated
                    and a uniform system of sacred law, referred to Moses as its originator, came to
                    be administered all over the land, in the hands of the ministers of the greater
                    sanctuaries, the various guilds must have been drawn together and have aimed at
                    forming such a united body as we find described in Dent, xxxiii.; and this unity
                    would find a natural expression in the extension of the name of Levites to all
                    priesthoods recognized by the state. If this was the course oi things we can
                    hardly suppose that the term came into large use til] the Israelites were
                    consolidated under the monarchy, and in fact the integrity of the text in 1 Sam.
                    vi. 15, 2 Sam. xv. 24, as well as 1 Kings viii. 4, is open to question. Up to
                    the time of David and Jeroboam, as appeal's from the cases of Samuel, Zadok,
                    Eleazaz (1 Sam. vii. 1), and the sons of David (2 Sam. viii. 18), as well as
                    from 1 Kings xii. 31, the priesthood was not essentially hereditary; but, like
                    all occupations that required traditional know· ledge, it must have tended to
                    become more and more so, so that all priests would appear as Levites by adoption
                    if not by descent. Wellhausen <hi rend="italic">(Gesch.,</hi> i. 139) has argued
                    from Deut, xxxiii. 9 that the northern priesthood was notan hereditary guild,
                    but involved the surrender of all family connexion; the words, however, are more
                    naturally understood as praise of the judicial impartiality which refused to be
                    influenced by family ties. Our data are too scanty to clear up the details of
                    this interesting piece of history; but it can hardly be doubted that the
                    development of a consolidated and hereditary priestly corporation in all the
                    sanctuaries was closely bound up with the unification of the state and the
                    absorption of tribal organization in the monarchy. The reaction of tribal
                    feeling against the central government, of which there are many traces in the
                    history of Ephraim, has perhaps its counterpart in the opposition to the unified
                    priesthood which is alluded to in Deut, xxxiii. 11.</p>
                <p>There have been many attempts on the part of recent writers from the time of
                    Vatke downwards to deny that Levi was one of the original tribes of Israel, but
                    they' all break down before the testimony of Gen. xlix. See especially Kuenen’s
