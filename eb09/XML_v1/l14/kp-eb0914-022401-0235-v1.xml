                    26* 51' to 27° 54' N. lat., and from 93° 49' to 96° 4' E. long. It lies along
                    both banks of the Brahmaputra, which belongs to the district for about 400 miles
                    of its course; and it is bounded N. by the Daphla, Miri, Abar, and Mishmi hills,
                    E. by the Mishmi and Singpho hills, S. by the watershed of the Patkai range and
                    the Lohit branch of the Brahmaputra, and W. by the districts of Darrang and
                    Sibsagar. To the north and north east the frontier is undefined. The Brahmaputra

                    Sadiya; its navigable tributaries within the district are the Subansiri, Dibru,
                    and Buri Dihing. The greater part of the area (11,500 square miles) is sparsely
                    occupied by independent hill tribes, and only 3200 square miles are directly
                    under British administration. The elephant, rhinoceros, bear, buffalo, wild
                    cattle, and deer are abundant; the capturing of elephants is a Government
                    monopoly worth from £3000 to £4500 annually. Coal and petroleum (both worked for
                    a short time about 1866), building stone, limestone, and ironclay exist in the
                    district; and gold has been washed in the hill streams from time immemorial.
                    Rice was grown on 39,460 acres in 1871. Tea is grown with European capital and
                    under European supervision, and has in recent years made great progress, the
                    plantations in 1874 covering 89,370 acres. Silk cloth is made from the cocoons
                    of the <hi rend="italic">mug a</hi> worm <hi rend="italic">(Saturnia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">assamuηgis'),</hi> which feeds on the <hi rend="italic">sum</hi>
                    tree; but the manufacture has greatly fallen off. A thousand cocoons yield 6 or
                    8 oz. of thread, worth 10s. to Ils. per pound. The exports of Lakhimpur are tea,
                    rnugâ silk, india-rubber, beeswax, ivory, and mustard seed; the imports rice,
                    opium, tobacco, salt, oil, and cotton cloth. The annual fair established by the
                    Government at Sadiya is less of commercial than of political importance.</p>
                <p>The population of the settled district in 1871-72 was 121,267, residing in 125
                    villages, and including 28,388 aborigines, 68,388 semi-Hinduized aborigines,
                    19,748 caste Hindus, 3826 Mohammedans. The most numerous Hindu caste λvas the
                    Kolitâ (3406), the former priests of the aboriginal kings of Assam; they have
                    now taken to agriculture, and rank as pure Sùdras. Of the semi-Hinduized
                    aborigines the most numerous tribe is the Aham, the former rulers of the country
                    (43,942). The hill tribes of the unsettled district are broadly distinguished
                    into a Shan group (Khamtis and Singphos) and an Indo-Chinese group (Mishmis,
                    Abars, Miris, Daphlas, &amp;c.). Most, if not all of them, have sent out little
                    colonies who settle on the borders of the plains. There are no towns in the
                    Lakhimpur district. Dibrugarh, on the Dibru, a few miles above its junction with
                    the Brahmaputra, is the chief civil station, with a population of 3870 in 1872.
                    Lakhimpur figures largely in the annals of Assam as the region where successive
                    invaders from the east first reached the Brahmaputra. The Bara Bhuiyas,
                    originally from the western provinces of India, were driven out by the Chutias
                    (a Shan race), and these in their turn gave place to their more powerful
                    brethren, the Ahams, in the 13th century. The Burmese, who had ruined the native
                    kingdoms, were expelled by the British in 1825; but it was not till 1839 that
                    the country was taken under direct British management.</p>
