                <p><label type="entry">LABRADOR</label>, in the widest acceptation of the word, is
                    the peninsular portion of North America bounded on three sides by the Gulf of St
                    Lawrence, the North Atlantic, Hudson’s Straits, and Hudson’s Bay, and vaguely
                    defined towards the south-west by Rupert’s river, the Mistassini river, and the
                    Bersiamits river. It extends from about 49° to 63° N. lat., and from the 55th to
                    the 79th meridian. Its greatest length from the Straits of Belle Isle, which
                    separate it from Newfoundland, to Cape Wolstenholme, its most northern
                    extremity, is 1100 miles; its greatest breadth is about 700 miles. The area is
                    approximately 420,000 square miles, equal to the united areas of the British
                    Isles, France, and Prussia. As a permanent abode of civilized man, Labrador is
                    on the whole one of the most uninviting regions on the face of the earth. The
                    Atlantic coast is the edge of a vast solitude of rocky hills, split and blasted
                    by frosts and beaten by the waves. A vast tableland, in one region 2240 feet
                    above the sea-level, occupies much of the interior. This plateau, says Professor
                    Hind, “is pre-eminently sterile, and, where the country is not burned, caribou
                    moss covers the rocks, with stunted spruce, birch, and aspen in the hollows and
                    deep ravines. The whole of the table-land is strewed with an infinite number of
                    boulders, sometimes three and four deep; these singular erratics are perched on
                    the summit of every mountain and hill, often on the edges of cliffs, and they
                    vary in size from 1 foot to 20 feet in diameter. Language fails to paint the
                    awful desolation of the table-land of the Labrador peninsula.”</p>
                <p>The interior of Labrador has been but very partially explored, and even the
                    course of the main rivers is largely matter of conjecture. The largest is
                    probably the Ashwanipi or Hamilton river, which rises in the rear of the Seven
                    Islands, drains a portion of the vast table-land, and falls into Hamilton Inlet,
                    on the Atlantic coast. At its mouth it is nearly a mile and a half in width. One
                    hundred miles from its mouth are the great falls and rapids which extend over 20
                    miles, and involve fifteen portages. The valley of this river is well wooded,
                    some of the trees, which are chiefly spruce, white birch, and poplar, being of
                    considerable size, and tracts of loamy soil being found at intervals along its
                    banks. The Kenamou and the Nasquapee or North-West river also fall into Hamilton
                    Inlet. The Eagle river, the West and East rivers, all famous for salmon and
                    trout, discharge their waters into Sandwich Bay. Of the rivers falling into
                    Ungava Bay the largest is Koksoak or South river, which is 3 miles wide at its
                    mouth, and has its source in Lake Kaniapuscaw, 70 miles long and 20 broad, which
                    occupies the very centre of the peninsula, being equidistant from the St
                    Lawrence, Ungava, and Hamilton Inlet, and 350 miles from each. George’s river
                    and Whale river also fall into Ungava Bay. The aspect of the country drained by
                    these rivers is forbidding in the extreme, bleak and barren rocks, with a few
                    stunted trees at the mouths of the rivers or around the lakes, being the most
                    marked features. In a few sheltered spots, however, on the margins of the
                    rivers, timber of fair size is to be found. The rivers discharging into Hudson’s
                    Bay are Rupert’s river, East Main, and Great and Little Whale rivers. The Moisie
                    river, 250 miles in length, the Mingan, and the Ounaneme fall into the Gulf of
                    St Lawrence. The St Augustine falls into a fine bay of the same name, and has
                    its source in the lakes and marshes of the table-land. The country through which
                    these rivers flow is rugged and mountainous, swamps and innumerable lakes
                    occupying the lower grounds.</p>
                <p>By far the most important portion of Labrador is the Atlantic seaboard. The coast
                    itself is rugged, but is deeply indented with bays and inlets, and has many fine
                    harbours. The scenery is grand and impressive. Dark and yellow headlands
                    towering over the waters are ever in sight, some grim and naked, others clad in
                    the pale green of mosses and dwarf shrubbery. With miles on miles of rocky
                    precipices alternate lengthened sea slopes, tame and monotonous, or fantastic
                    and picturesque in form, with stony vales winding alway among the blue hills of
                    the interior. Battle Harbour at the northern extremity of the straits of Belle
                    Isle, is a busy fishing settlement with a narrow sheltered roadstead about half
                    a mile in length between Battle Islands and Great Caribou Island. The water is
                    of great depth in this neighbourhood, and is noted for its wonderful ground
                    swell, which at times rolls in without wind from the eastward into St Lewis
                    Sound, “bursting,” as Admiral Bayfield describes it, “with fury over islets 30
                    feet high, or sending sheets of foam and spray sparkling in the sunbeams 50 feet
                    up the sides of precipices.” By far the greatest of the numerous inlets which
                    indent the coast is Eskimo Bay or Ivuktoke or Hamilton Inlet, 250 miles north of
                    the straits of Belle Isle. This inlet is 30 miles wide at the entrance, but at
                    Port Rigolette,. 50 miles from the sea, it narrows to a mile. On both sides of
                    these narrows hills tower to the height of 1000 feet, wooded with spruce from
                    base to summit. At the termination of this gorge the inlet again expands and
                    forms Lake Melville, 30 miles in length and 20 in breadth. After narrowing again
                    it forms another lake (Goose Bay) 7 miles wide and 20 long, and at its extremity
                    the head of the great inlet is reached, 150 miles from the sea. The scenery
                    along the shores of Hamilton Inlet is wild and rugged, and above Rigolette <pb

                    Melville lake are the volcanic peaks of the Mealy Mountains, 1500 feet in
                    height. This range commences 100 miles to the south of Hamilton Inlet, running
                    nearly parallel to the coast; and after skirting Lake Melville it strikes
                    westerly and is lost in the hilly regions of the interior.</p>
                <p>Northern Labrador, from Cape Webeck to Cape Chudleigh, is the proper home of the
                    Eskimo of this region, who are now about 1400 in number.<note anchored="true"

                    labours of the Moravian Brethren, commenced in 1770, nearly the whole of them
                    have been brought under Christian training. The Brethren have four
                    stations—Hopedale, (55° 25' N. lat.), Nain (56° 25'), Okkak (57° 33'), and
                    Hebron, (58° 50'). Each station has a church, store, dwelling-house for the
                    missionaries, and workshops for the native tradesmen. The missionaries number
                    about twenty.</p>
                <p>The white inhabitants of the St Lawrence coast of Labrador are chiefly of Acadian
                    or Canadian origin, with a few settled fishermen from France. On the Atlantic
                    coast of Labrador many of the white inhabitants are British sailors and their
                    descendants. Salmon and cod fishing are their main occupations; and the products
                    of their industries are exchanged with traders on the spot for such commodities
                    as they require. The winter is passed in trapping furbearing animals. There are
                    nine places of worship—four of the Church of England, three of the Church of
                    Rome, and two Wesleyan. During the fishing season a steamer carrying mails and
                    passengers plies fortnightly on the coast, connecting with the Newfoundland
                    coastal steamer at Battle Harbour.</p>
                <p>The Indians inhabiting the interior of Labrador are now greatly reduced in
                    numbers. The returns of the Hudson’s Bay Company show that about four thousand
                    of these Indians frequent the company’s posts throughout the whole of Labrador;
                    and this account probably includes nearly their whole strength.
                    Nineteen-tweatieths of them are nominally Roman Catholics. The early Jesuit
                    missions in Canada extended to Labrador; and of late years Roman Catholic
                    missions have been resumed and are now systematically carried on. Game of all
                    kinds is every year becoming scarcer, and in many parts has almost disappeared.
                    Fires have destroyed the· forests, berry-bearing shrubs, mosses, and lichens,
                    and converted whole districts into hopeless deserts. The savage tribes wander
                    over a vast extent of country, and have established routes along certain rivers
                    and lakes, by which periodically they make their way to the seacoast, to
                    exchange the products of the chase for firearms, clothing, and other
                    necessaries.</p>
                <p>It is only in the interior valleys of the rivers, at some distance from the
                    coast, that any extent of forest appears; but there sufficient timber for fuel
                    and building purposes can almost always be found. The trees are chiefly larch,
                    birch, aspen, silver fir, black, white, and red spruce, willow, cherry, and
                    mountain ash. Among the wild animals may be enumerated reindeer, black and white
                    bears, wolves, foxes, martens, lynxes, otters, minks, beavers, muskrats, hares,
                    rabbits, moles. The birds are represented by the hawk, falcon, eagle, owl,
                    raven, ptarmigan, spnιce partridge, curlew, grey plover, sandpipers and other
                    waders, geese, ducks, gulls, divers, swallows, martins, snipe, pigeons.
                    Berry-bearing plants abound in many regions—whortleberries, raspberries,
                    cranberries, partridge berries, bake appleberries, wild currants, and wild
                    gooseberries. In summer, where there are sheltered spots, mosses of every hue,
                    wild flowers of the most delicate colours, ferns, and tall grasses diversify the
                    scene.</p>
                <p>Though Labrador is detached from Arctic lauds, and though much of it lies between
                    the same parallels of latitude as Great Britain, the climate is rigorous in the
                    extreme, owing mainly to the ice-laden Arctic current which washes its shores.
                    Snow lies from September or October till June. In winter the whole coast is
                    blockaded by ice-fields drifting from Baffin’s Bay and other outlets of the
                    Arctic Ocean; while in summer icebergs, stranded or floating, impart a stern
                    grandeur to the frowning shores. At Nain the mean annual temperature is 22 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 52° Fahr., at Okkak, 27 ’ 86°, and at Hopedale, 27 ’
                    82°. In summer the thermometer sometimes reaches 75°; spirits freeze in the
                    intense cold of winter, and 30° below zero is not uncommon; but, owing to the
                    dryness of the air and the absence of high winds, such a temperature is not felt
                    as uncomfortable. The winter is one continued stretch of cold dry frosty
                    weather, and is felt to be bracing by those accustomed to it. Travelling is
                    performed by sledges drawn by dogs, sometimes at the rate of 100 miles a day,
                    over the frozen snow.</p>
                <p>The total.perman ent population of Labrador is about 12,500, and is distributed

                <p>Tourists in search of the picturesque, invalids, sportsmen, and anglers are
                    finding their way, of late years, in increasing numbers to Labrador during its
                    brief but lovely summer; and in the fishing season from the end of June to the
                    first or second week of October the migratory population from Newfoundland, Nova
                    Scotia, Canada, and the United States numbers between 20,000 and 25,000.</p>
                <p>But little is known of the geology of Labrador. It has been ascertained, however,
                    that the Laurentian formation constitutes the great framework of the peninsula,
                    and that Lower Silurian beds, principally Potsdam, rest on the Laurentian at
                    various points along the coast. On the north side of the Straits of Belle Isle
                    there is a large development of Lower Silurian rocks, corresponding to those on
                    the Newfoundland side opposite. The Potsdam rocks here are grey and reddish
                    sandstones, 230 feet in thickness, overlaid by 140 feet of limestone, with some
                    shale. These limestones and sandstones extend about 80 miles along the coast,
                    and about 10 miles back from the shore. All over the country gneiss ranges of
                    mountains and hills and gneiss boulders in countless multitudes are everywhere
                    met with. “The rocks of this formation,” says Sir William Logan, “are the most
                    ancient known on the American continent, and correspond probably to the oldest
                    gneiss of Finland and Scandinavia, and to some similar rocks in the north of
                    Scotland.” The system is made up of crystallized rocks, and may be considered as
                    an alternation of crystalline schists, quartzites, limestones, and serpentines.
                    Copper ore has been discovered at various points along the coast; also silver,
                    lead, and mica, as well as gold.</p>
                <p>The southern portion of the Labrador coast, as far north as Sandwich Bay, has
                    been frequented as a fishing ground for more than a century. Since about 1850
                    large numbers of fishermen have extended their operations as far north as Cape
                    Harrison or Webeck. From about 1870 Newfoundland cod-fishers have ventured as
                    far north as Cape Mugford; and the probability is that they will soon be
                    attracted still farther, to Cape Chudleigh, at the entrance of Hudson’s Straits,
                    by the reports of the amazing quantity of fish. From Cape Harrison to Cape
                    Mugford the coast, like that of Norway, is deeply serrated by a succession of
                    narrow fiords stretching from 30 to 50 miles into the interior. As far as
                    Freestone Point, 120 miles north of Cape Harrison, the heads of many of these
                    fiords contain timber fit for the construction of fishing craft and all ordinary
                    building purposes. The climate and soil of these sheltered spots also permit the
                    cultivation of potatoes and garden vegetables. According to Professor Hind, “it
                    is fringed with a vast multitude of islands forming a continuous archipelago
                    from Cape Aillik to Cape Mugford, averaging 20 miles in depth seawards. Outside
                    these islands, and about 15 miles seawards from them, are numerous banks and
                    shoals which form the summer feeding ground of large cod, and a second range of
                    banks, outside the shoals, which are probably their winter feeding grounds.”
                    This island-studded area, exclusive of the banks and shoals, from Cape Harrison
                    to Cape Mugford, he estimates at 5200 square miles, furnishing a boat fishing
                    ground for cod (which as yet has hardly been touched) nearly as large as the
                    combined areas of the English and French boat fishing ground on the coasts of
                    Newfoundland. The Arctic current which washes the coast of Labrador exerts a
                    most important influence on the fish life of those regions, as well as on that
                    of the seas around Newfoundland, Canada, and the United States, forming, in many
                    places, “a living mass, a vast ocean of living slime;” and this slime
                    “accumulates on the banks of northern Labrador, and renders the existence
                    possible of all those forms of marine life which contribute to the support of
                    the great shoals of cod which also find their home there” (Hind). The same
                    current which brings the slime and multitudes of minute crustaceans also carries
                    on its bosom innumerable cod ova, and distributes them far and wide.</p>
                <p>The principal fisheries are those of cod, herrings, salmon, and seals. The
                    following table is compiled from the Newfoundland customs returns for the year
                    ending July 31, 1880 :—</p>

                <p>The estimated value of exports by traders being 19,950, this gives for the total
                    exports $1,342,035, or £279,590 sterling.</p>
                <p>To these direct exportations must be added the fish of various kinds taken at
                    Labrador and sent to Newfoundland for shipment, amounting to about a third of
                    the whole; also the quantities <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n188/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0188-0177"/> taken by American and Canadian fishermen of which
                    no returns can be obtained, but which are estimated to be about an eighth of the
                    quantities taken by Newfoundland fishermen. These last can work the fisheries
                    more successfully than those coming from a distance, and are gradually absorbing
                    the trade. The total catch by Newfoundlanders, Canadians, Americans, and Eskimo
                    on the Atlantic and St Lawrence coasts of Labrador may be valued at £1,000,000
                    sterling per annum, and is increasing steadily. The number of vessels employed
                    annually is estimated at from 1100 to 1200.</p>
                <p>Labrador as well as Newfoundland was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; the recent
                    discovery of a map made by or under the direction of Sebastian Cabot proves that
                    it must surrender the honour of being his “Prima tierra vista” to the present
                    island of Cape Breton. Cabot does not appear to have given any name to Labrador;
                    tradition has it that a Basque whaler, called “Labrador,” penetrated as far as
                    Labrador Bay (now Bradore Bay), and that, as this bay was in process of time
                    much frequented by Basque fishermen, the name was extended to the whole coast.
                    The Basques were the successors of the Norsemen. After them, about the year
                    1520, came the Bretons, who founded the town of Brest in Bradore Bay, about 3
                    miles from Blanc Sablon Harbour, which at one time contained upwards of one
                    thousand permanent residents. The ruins and terraces of this old town are still
                    visible. For a lengthened period extensive fisheries (to which they attached the
                    greatest importance) were carried on by the French on the Labrador coast, near
                    the Straits of Belle Isle. After the British conquest of Canada the whole
                    fisheries along the southern and cistern shores of Labrador were placed under
                    the government of Quebec, and they continued so till 1763, when the Atlantic
                    coast was annexed to the government of Newfoundland, the boundary between the
                    two jurisdictions being fixed at Blanc Sablon. In 1773, owing to difficulties
                    arising out of grants made to a few persons, under French rule, the eastern
                    coast was restored to the government of Quebec; but since 1809 it has been again
                    attached to Newfoundland. In 1824 the governor of Newfoundland was empowered to
                    institute a court of civil jurisdiction on the coast of Labrador. At present the
                    civil and criminal court of Labrador is presided over by one judge appointed by
                    the governor in council. All goods landed are subjected to the duties imposed on
                    like goods in any part of the island of Newfoundland. The extent of the
                    jurisdiction of the government of Newfoundland in Labrador is thus defined
                    (Letters-Patent, 28th March 1876); “all the coast of Labrador from the entrance
                    of Hudson’s Straits to a line to be drawn due north and south from Anse Sablon
                    on the said coast to the fifty-second degree of north latitude, and all the
                    islands adjacent to that part of the said coast of Labrador.” The northwestern
                    portion, or that which drains into Hudson’s Bay and Hudson’s Straits, now forms
                    the North-East Territory of the Dominion of Canada, and the southern portion,
                    draining into the Gulf of St Lawrence, is incorporated with the province of
                    Quebec. An undefined area of what is now the North-East Territory was formerly
                    known as East Main.</p>
