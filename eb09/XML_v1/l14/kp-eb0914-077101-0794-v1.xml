                    Scottish poet of some reputation, was born in 1748, and was son of George Logan,
                    a farmer at Soutra, in East Lothian. Being destined for the church, he was in
                    1762 sent to study at the university of Edinburgh. After finishing his course,
                    Logan was in 1768-69 tutor at Ulbster to the well-known Sir John Sinclair, and
                    in 1770 he edited some of the poems of his college friend <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Michael Bruce</hi><hi rend="italic">(jpvf.</hi> This publication was for the
                    benefit of Bruce’s parents, who were in humble circumstances. In order to make
                    up a volume he inserted some poems of his own, with some from other sources, and
                    in his preface he stated that these could be easily distinguished without any
                    names being attached. Of the seventeen pieces in the volume five were by Bruce,
                    two by Bruce and Logan, eight by Logan, one by Sir James Foulis, and of one the
                    authorship is unknown. One of the poems by Logan was “The Ode to the
                    Cuckoo.”</p>
                <p>In 1770 Logan was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery of Edinburgh, and in
                    1771 was presented to the βharge of South Leith, but was not inducted till 1773.
                    In 1779 he delivered a course of lectures on the philosophy of history in St
                    Mary’s Chapel, Edinburgh. An analysis of these lectures was published in 1781
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Elements of the Philosophy of History,</hi>
                    and was followed by one of the lectures <hi rend="italic">On the Manners and
                    Government of Asia,</hi> 1781.</p>
                <p>Logan was an active member of the committee of the General Assembly of the Church
                    of Scotland appointed in 1775 to revise the “Translations and Paraphrases”·
                    drawn up in 1745 for use in private families, and to adapt them for public
                    worship. The committee finished its; <pb break="no"

                    paraphrases is still in use. Eleven of them are the composition of Logan, and
                    others were revised or altered by him. In the same year he published his poems
                    in a volume which attracted so much attention that a second edition was issued
                    in 1782. It also included the “Ode to the Cuckoo,” with which Edmund Burke was
                    so pleased that when in Edinburgh he sought out Logan and complimented him as
                    the author of the finest ode in the English language.</p>
                <p>In 1783 he published a tragedy called <hi rend="italic">liunnamede,</hi> which
                    met with little success. In 1786 he resigned his charge at South Leith,
                    retaining part of his stipend. He then went to London, where he devoted himself
                    to literature. He was engaged on the management of the <hi rend="italic">English
                    Review,</hi> and in 1788 published a pamphlet on the charges against Warren
                    Hastings. He died in December 1788.</p>
                <p>A work on ancient history, published, that year under the name of Dr Rutherford,
                    rector of an academy at Uxbridge, is believed to have been the lectures written
                    by Logan. His sermons were published in 1790-91, in two volumes, and have been
                    several times reprinted. His poems were collected and published in 1812, with a
                    memoir understood to be by the Rev. R. Douglas of Galashiels.</p>
                <p>About forty years after Logan’s death what may be called the Bruce-Logan
                    controversy arose by the publication in 1836 of a life of Michael Bruce,
                    prefixed to an edition of his poems by the Rev. Dr MacKelvie. In this work there
                    is claimed for Bruce the authorship of sixteen of the pieces in the volume
                    issued by Logan in 1770. Logan was at the same time charged with having retained
                    some of Bruce’s MSS. entrusted to him, which he used in the revision of the
                    paraphrases. These statements have been reiterated with much abuse of Logan in a
                    memoir of Bruce prefixed to an edition of his works published in 1865, by the
                    Rev. Dr Grosart. In this edition the paraphrases written by Logan are inserted
                    as having been written by Bruce. The evidence, however, brought against Logan in
                    these biographies of Brace, being nearly altogether of a hearsay character, is
                    not of much value, and it may be urged that Logan was not blamed during his life
                    for any such literary delinquencies. If anything can be brought against him with
                    justice, it is his publishing as his own, with very few alterations, the second
                    Paraphrase, which is the composition of Dr Doddridge.</p>
                <p>Within the last few years the various pieces in the volume of Brace’s poems
                    issued by Logan in 1770 have been subjected to careful criticism, and the
                    statements made from personal knowledge by the Rev. Dr Robertson of Dalmeny, the
                    college friend of Bruce and Logan, who was often referred to on the subject,
                    must be held to be substantially correct. These will be found in a <hi
                    rend="italic">brochure</hi> by Dr David Laing, <hi rend="italic">Ode to the
                    Cuckoo</hi> (Edinburgh 1770), <hi rend="italic">with remarks on its authorship,
                    in a letter to J. C. Shairp,</hi> LL.D., 1873. See also a paper by J. Small in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Brit, and For. Evan. Rev.,</hi> 1877, and especially two
                    papers by the Rev. R. Small, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 1878.</p>
