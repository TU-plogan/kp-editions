                <p><label type="entry">LITHIUM</label>, one of the rarer metallic elements,
                    intermediate in its character between sodium and barium. It was discovered in
                    1817 by Arfvedson in the course of an analysis of petalite in Berzelius’s
                    laboratory. He recognized the presence in this mineral of a new kind of alkali,
                    which his master subsequently named “lithia,”to denote its mineral origin.
                    Lithia, though widely disseminated throughout the mineral world—traces of it
                    being found in almost all alkaliferous silicates, in the soils derived from
                    these, and in many mineral waters—nowhere occurs in any abundance, except in the
                    immense masses of lithia-mica (lepidolite) known to exist in Bohemia. Of other
                    lithia-minerals (all rare) we may name petalite and spodumene (both silicates of
                    alumina and alkalies) and triphylline, a mixed phosphate of ferrous, manganous,
                    and lithium oxides. Only lepidolite comes into consideration as a raw material
                    for the preparation of lithia and its salts. But the extraction from it of pure
                    lithia in any form is difficult. The first step is the disintegration of the
                    finely powdered mineral, which may be effected by means of vitriol and
                    hydrofluoric acid (or vitriol and fluorspar); the silicon goes off as gaseous
                    fluoride, the bases remain as sulphates. Or else we may mix the mineral
                    intimately with quicklime, and by very intense heating of the mixture produce a
                    more highly basic silicate, which is readily disintegrable by acids. In either
                    case it is easy to unite all the bases (A1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 3</hi>, CaO, MgO, Li <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, K <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O, Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O) into a solution of chlorides or
                    sulphates. From it we precipitate successively and remove by filtration (1) the
                    bases not alkalies or Li <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O by means of excess of
                    milk of lime, and (2) the lime introduced by operation (1) by means of carbonate
                    of ammonia. There results a mixed solution of potash, soda, lithia, and ammonia
                    salt, from which the last-named component is easily removed by evaporation to
                    dryness and ignition. For these very tedious operations Troost has substituted
                    an elegant process which, though admittedly imperfect in the analytic sense,
                    lends itself admirably to manufacturing purposes. He mixes ten parts of the
                    finely powdered mineral with ten parts of carbonate of baryta, five parts of
                    sulphate of baryta, and three parts of sulphate of potash, and melts down the
                    mixture in a powerful wind-furnace. There results a mass which separates
                    spontaneously into a lower layer forming a transparent glass, and an upper one
                    consisting of the sulphates of barium, potassium (sodium), and lithium, the
                    latter representing about three-fourths of the lithia contained in the mineral.
                    By treatment with water the sulphate of baryta is easily removed as an insoluble
                    residue; the mixed alkaline sulphates are converted into chlorides by
                    decomposition with chloride of barium, and from the dry mixed chlorides
                    approximately pure chloride of lithium is obtained by lixiviation with
                    ether-alcohol, which solvent dissolves only very small proportions of the other
                    chlorides. To purify the crude chloride it is dissolved in water and, by double
                    decomposition with carbonate of soda, converted into a precipitate of carbonate
                    of lithia, Li <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,
                    which must be washed with small instalments of water, as it is very appreciably
                    soluble in water. This carbonate of lithia is still contaminated with soda. To
                    purify it fully dissolve it in water with the help of carbonic acid, filter, and
                    evaporate slowly on a water-bath; the added carbonic acid goes off, and pure
                    carbonate of lithia separates out in crystalline crusts (Troost). One litre of
                    pure water dissolves 12 grammes; 1 litre of water kept saturated with carbonic
                    acid dissolves 52 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 grammes of the carbonate. The
                    dry salt fuses at a red heat, but before doing so loses part of its carbonic
                    acid, which, after cooling, it shows no tendency to take up again from the
                    atmosphere. Perfectly acid-free lithia, Li <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, can
                    be obtained by heating a mixture of the carbonate and pure charcoal in a
                    platinum crucible, or by heating the nitrate for a long time in a silver one. If
                    the preparation, ultimately, of the hydrate Li <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> OH
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = 2LiOH is contemplated, the latter operation may
                    be very materially shortened by addition of metallic copper, which reduces the
                    nitric acid. The anhydrous oxide, when treated with water, dissolves without
                    much evolution of heat as hydrate, LiOH, which, by evaporation (in silver) is
                    easily obtained in the solid form. It melts at a dull red heat, but at even
                    higher temperatures loses no water. It dissolves in water (far less abundantly
                    than soda), with formation of a strongly alkaline solution, which neutralizes
                    all acids, with formation of salts. Like baryta, it refuses to form acid
                    sulphates or carbonates (the bodies HLiSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> and HLiCO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> exist only in solution), and forms insoluble or
                    almost insoluble salts with carbonic and phosphoric acids (formulae Li <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> and Li <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> PO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>); and, last not least,
                    it is not reducible to metal by charcoal at any temperature. Add to this that
                    the highly deliquescent chloride LiCl, when dehydrated by heating, always loses
                    part of its chlorine as HC1, and we feel tempted to conclude that in the case of
                    lithium, as in that of barium or magnesium, two equivalents are united into one
                    atom ‰i = Li <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> =14. But the specific heat of the
                    metal demands the lesser number.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the first time in 1855, by Bunsen. He obtained it by fusing the pure chloride in
                    a porcelain crucible, and decomposing the fused salt by a battery of four or six
                    “Bunsens, using a rod of retort charcoal as a positive and a knitting wire as a
                    negative pole. The metal separates out in about pea-sized globules, which stick
                    to the wire, and, thanks to the protecting action of the fused chloride, can be
                    lifted out and collected without reoxidation, under rock-oil. Lithium is a
                    silver-white metal, of only '58 specific gravity (it floats on rock-oil),
                    somewhat softer than lead, and like it susceptible of being pressed into wire.
                    It tarnishes in air, though far less readily than sodium. When thrown upon water
                    it gradually dissolves as hydrate, with evolution of hydrogen, but without
                    fusing. The metal melts at 180° C., and at a somewhat higher temperature takes
                    fire and burns into oxide with a brilliant white flame. Hence the characteristic
                    intensely red colour which a colourless gas flame assumes when a lithium salt is
                    volatilized in it must be a property of something else than the metal itself;
                    perhaps it is the hydroxide LiOH that emits it. The red lithium flame forms a
                    spectrum consisting chiefly of one brilliant red and a somewhat faint orange
                    line.</p>
