                <p><label type="entry">LIBYA</label> was a geographical name by which the Greeks
                    usually designated Africa, with the exception of Egypt, although sometimes the
                    continent was thought to be divided between Libya and Ethiopia. Libya enters
                    into the sphere of ancient history only in so far as it came into contact with
                    the civilized races of antiquity, and the present article will touch this point
                    only; the natural features and the ethnology will be found under other headings
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Africa).</hi> The native tribes came several times
                    into collision with the kings of ancient Egypt. In the reign of Rameses the
                    Great and his successor they invaded the Delta, and various expeditions were
                    made by the Pharaohs into the outlying country, on the south particularly (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt).</hi> Herodotus mentions one important expedition
                    sent out by Pharaoh Necho (610-594 B.C.), which started from the Red Sea,
                    circumnavigated the continent, and reached the mouth of the Nile after three
                    years’ absence. The truth of the tale has often been doubted, but one
                    circumstance in which Herodotus himself expresses his disbelief, viz., that as
                    they sailed west they had the sun on their right hand, has in modern times been
                    generally accepted as proving that the voyage was actually made.</p>
                <p>The Phoenician colonies on the north coast, Utica, Carthage, &lt;fcc., beginning
                    between 1000 and 800 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> established a powerful and
                    civilized empire in a hitherto unknown part of Libya. Their trading expeditions
                    gave them a wide acquaintance with the geography of the country, even with the
                    Atlantic coast as far almost as the equator; but the contempt with which the
                    Roman conquerors treated the literature of the Carthaginians allowed much
                    valuable material to disappear. The historian Sallust, when praetor of Numidia,
                    was still able to use the Punic records which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n571/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0571-0552"/> he got interpreters to translate for him (Sall.,
                    <hi rend="italic">Jug.,</hi> 17); and fortunately one record of an exploring
                    voyage along the west coast, preserved in a temple in Carthage, was translated
                    by some Greek traveller and is still available (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hanno).</hi> For all that is known of the Carthaginian rule in Libya see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carthage.</hi></p>
                <p>Greek mariners must have visited Libya at a very early period, for the edible
                    lotus of the northern coast is mentioned in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey.</hi></p>
                <p>In the latter part of the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.o.</hi> the Greeks
                    began to colonize the north coast. Between the Carthaginian territory and the
                    borders of Egypt they planted a number of cities, and the Pentapolis of which
                    Cyrene was the chief was among the richest and most flourishing of all the Greek
                    states (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyrene).</hi> When the Persians invaded Egypt
                    they made some attempt to extend their empire over Libya; but the expedition of
                    Cambyses (about 525 <hi rend="smallcaps">rc.)</hi> was too unfortunate to
                    encourage them to further efforts. The camel was introduced into Egypt under the
                    Persian rule, and from this time it became easier to make long journeys over the
                    Libyan deserts. Herodotus shows much knowledge of the Sahara, and it is clear
                    that his account must be founded on the reports of traders and caravan guides
                    well acquainted with the desert route. Under the Macedonian kings knowledge of
                    Libya was much extended; they sent exploring expeditions for scientific purposes
                    into Abyssinia, while growing wealth and luxury caused a continually increasing
                    demand for the ivory, spices, and other produce of Libya. In the period 500-200
                    B.C. it seems certain that commerce was maintained with the countries beyond the
                    Sahara in at least two ways—by the Carthaginian ships trading along the Atlantic
                    coast, and by the overland route across the desert to the Nile. The Roman
                    conquest of Carthage closed the former route. Polybius indeed was commissioned
                    by Scipio to explore the country, and sailed a long way down the west coast; but
                    the Romans themselves had not the maritime enterprise required for such voyages.
                    The record which Polybius wrote for his friend Scipio is quoted by Pliny and
                    Stephanus. Sallust also collected information about the country, and under the
                    emperor Nero an exploring expedition was sent into Abyssinia. The Romans added
                    more to the knowledge of Libya in other ways,—by a better organization of the
                    province and increased facilities of travel and trade, by the frontier wars
                    against surrounding tribes, and finally by the expeditions sent directly into
                    the heart of the country to procure wild animals for the amphitheatre. The
                    passion of the Roman populace for seeing strange animals slaughtered in the
                    public games was gratified by the emperors and magistrates. Enormous numbers of
                    Libyan wild beasts were exhibited in the amphitheatre; even hippopotami and
                    alligators are mentioned. One Roman officer, Maternus, penetrated at least as
                    far as Lake Chad. The <hi rend="italic">Periplus</hi> of Arrian preserves a
                    record of the trade along the east coast of Libya in the 1st century. In these
                    ways a fairly accurate knowledge of northern Libya was obtained, and Ptolemy
                    could, in the 2d century, construct a good map of Africa as far south as 11° N.,
                    though his idea of the shape of the continent further to the south is less
                    accurate than that of Herodotus.</p>
