                <p><label type="entry">LEGERDEMAIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Prestidigitation</hi>, or
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Sleight of Hand</hi></label>, as it is variously called, is
                    the art of deceiving the eye of the spectator by adroit movements of the hand of
                    the operator so as apparently to cause an object either to be changed, produced,
                    or made to disappear. The term “legerdemain” is extended in meaning to include
                    all sorts of “conjuring” by means of mechanical and other contrivances, although
                    it properly applies to tricks performed with the hand alone. Even in ancient
                    times two distinct branches of magic existed—the impostures of divination and
                    necromancy, and the amusing exhibition of jugglery and sleight of hand. Judging
                    from the accounts which history has handed down to us, the marvels performed by
                    the thaumaturgists of antiquity were very skilfully produced, and must have
                    required a considerable practical knowledge of the art. The Romans were in the
                    habit of giving conjuring exhibitions, the most favourite feat being that of the
                    “cups and balls,” the performers of which were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >acetabularii,</hi> and the cups themselves <hi rend="italic">acetabula.</hi>
                    The balls used, however, instead of being the convenient light cork ones
                    employed by modern conjurors, were simply round white pebbles which must have
                    added greatly to the difficulty of performing the trick. The art survived the
                    barbarism and ignorance of the Middle Ages; and the earliest professors of the
                    modern school were Italians such as Jonas, Androletti, and Antonio Carlotti. In

                    patrons; Chaucer, in describing a motley assemblage, says :—</p>
                <p>“There I saw playenge jongeleurs,</p>
                <p>Magiciens, tregeteours, Phetonysses, cTιarmeresses, Old witches, sorceresses
                    ;”</p>
                <p>and in another place <hi rend="italic">(House of Fame,</hi> bk. iii.) he records
                    a startling feat of prestidigitation:—</p>
                <p>“There I saw Coll Tregetour U pon a table of sycamour Play an uncouthe thyιιge to
                    tell; I saw him cary a wyndemell Under a walnot shale.”</p>
                <p>But there is no reason for supposing that the ancient magicians were more
                    proficient in the art than their modern successors; and, as Robert-Houdin, the
                    greatest of modern conjurors, has pithily observed, <hi rend="superscript">
                    α</hi> if antiquity was the cradle of magic, it is because the art was yet in
                    its infancy.” Towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth the profession had
                    fallen very low in England, and the performers were classed with “ruffians,
                    blasphemers, thieves, vagabonds, Jews, Turks, heretics, pagans, and sorcerers.”
                    In 1840 a German physicist named Döbler devised an entertainment which gave an
                    entirely new development to the science, and was in effect the same as the
                    conjuring entertainments which have since become so popular and familiar. The
                    most eminent conjurors of the modern school have been Robert-Houdin, Wiljalba
                    Frikell, Hermann, and Buatier de Kolta.</p>
                <p>The secrets of legerdemain were for a long time jealously guarded by its
                    professors, but in 1793 a work appeared in Paris entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Testament de Jerome Sharpe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Professeur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Physique Amusante,</hi> which gives a
                    very fair account of the methods then in vogue. Its author was M. Decremps. In
                    1858 a still more important and accurate book was published— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sorcellerie ancienne et moderne expliquée,</hi> by J. N. Ponsin; and ten years
                    later J. E. Robert-Houdin issued his <hi rend="italic">Secrets de la
                    Prestidigitation</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">de la</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Magie,</hi> which is a masterly exposition of the entire art and
                    mystery of conjuring. The last-mentioned book has been translated into English
                    by “Professor Hoffman,” the author of <hi rend="italic">Modern Magic,</hi> the
                    best English treatise on the subject. Modern magic calls to its aid all the
                    appliances of modern science, —electricity, magnetism, optics, and mechanics;
                    but the most successful adepts in the art look down upon all such succedaneous
                    aids and rely upon address and sleight of hand alone. Confederacy is never
                    resorted to except by the merest tyros. The prestidigitator’s motto is “The
                    quickness of the hand deceives the eye ;” but this very phrase, which is always
                    in a performer’s mouth, is in itself one of the innocent frauds which the
                    conjuror employs as part and parcel of his exhibition. The truth is that it is
                    not so much upon the quickness with which a feat is performed as upon the
                    adroitness with which the time and means of performing it are concealed that its
                    success depends. “A prestidigitator,” says Robert-Houdin, “is not a juggler; he
                    is an actor playing the part of a magician, an artist whose fingers should be
                    more clever than nimble. I would even add that, in the practice of legerdemain,
                    the calmer the movements are the more easy is it to produce an illusion on the
                    spectators.” Professor Hoffman corroborates this statement, and says, “The
                    effects of magic are produced by successive adroit substitutions, and the whole
                    magic of the trick consists in the concealment of the particular moment at which
                    each substitution is effected.” The right opportunity for executing the required
                    movement is technically called a <hi rend="italic">temps.</hi> This is defined
                    to be any act or movement which distracts the attention of the audience while
                    something is being “vanished” or “produced.” Experiment will readily convince
                    any one that it is absolutely impossible to move the hand so quickly as to
                    abstract or replace any object without being perceived, so long as the eyes of
                    the audience are upon the performer. But it is very easy to do so unnoticed,
                    provided the audience are looking another way at the time; and the faculty of
                    thus diverting their attention is at once the most difficult and the most
                    necessary accomplishment for a conjuror to acquire. It does not suffice to
                    point, or ask them to look in another direction, because they will obviously
                    suspect the truth and look with all the more persistence. The great requisite is
                    to “have a good eye ”—in French conjuring parlance <hi rend="italic">avoir de
                    l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">οeil</hi>; an earnest, convinced look of the
                    performer in a particular direction will carry every one’s glances with it,
                    while a furtive glance at the hand which is performing some function that should
                    be kept secret will ruin all.</p>
                <p>Robert-Houdin may be considered the actual founder of the modern school of
                    legerdemain. This celebrated conjuror, who was originally a watchmaker and
                    mechanician, possessed a remarkably inventive genius, and, having early turned
                    his attention to legerdemain, he concentrated all his efforts upon the
                    development and improvement of that art. Discarding the clumsy tricks of what he
                    calls the “false-bottomed school,” as well as the gaudy paraphernalia with which
                    his predecessors used to encumber their stage, he produced in 1845, at a little
                    theatre in the Palais Royal, a number of entirely new illusions, in which all
                    the resources of mechanical and electrical science were combined with manual
                    dexterity and personal address. His entertainments, which he called <hi
                    rend="italic">Soirees</hi><hi rend="italic">Fantastiques,</hi> made a great
                    sensation in Paris, and placed him at once at the head of his profession. His
                    skill and success were so great that the French Government sent him on a sort of
                    roving commission to Algeria, in order that he might, by his exhibitions of
                    natural magic, destroy the prestige of the <hi rend="italic">marabouts—</hi>
                    wonder-workers who had obtained a great and dangerous influence over the Arabs
                    by their pretended miracles. The motto prefixed by Robert-Houdin to his chapter
                    on the “Art of Conjuring” is—“to succeed as a conjuror, three things are
                    essential: first, dexterity; second, dexterity; and third, dexterity”; and this
                    is not a mere trick of language, for triple dexterity is required, not only to
                    train the hand to the needful adroitness, but to acquire the requisite command
                    of eye and tongue.</p>
                <p>. Besides the legitimate application of legerdemain to the purpose of amusement,
                    it serves another and less innocent purpose, being employed by card sharpers in
                    their nefarious profession. The successful card sharper must have qualities
                    which, if applied in a legitimate direction, would ensure distinction in almost
                    any profession. He must be observant, dexterous, cool; but above all he must
                    have impudence. If it requires a considerable share of this quality to perform
                    an ordinary feat of legerdemain with all the advantages of scenic effects and
                    stage arrangements, how much more must it need to effect a trick under the very
                    eyes of a vigilant adversary, and when the consequences of failure are so
                    extremely unpleasant? As in legitimate conjuring, too, it is not so much that
                    actual dexterity or the quickness of the hand deceives the eye as that the
                    attention is diverted by some ingenious but unperceived device at the moment
                    when the operation is performed.</p>
                <p>Legerdemain as applied to cheating at cards may be divided into the following
                    branches :—(1) marking the cards; (2) abstracting certain cards during the game
                    for clandestine use; (3) previously concealing cards about the person; (4)
                    packing the cards; (5) substituting marked or prepared packs; (6) confederacy;
                    (7) false shuffles. All these methods are thoroughly exposed in Robert-Houdin’s
                    work <hi rend="italic">Les tricheries des Grecs.</hi></p>
