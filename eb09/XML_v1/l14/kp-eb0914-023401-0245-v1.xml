                <p><label type="entry">LAMB, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi></label> (1775-1834),
                    an original and delightful English essayist and critic, was born in Crown Office
                    Row, Inner Temple, London, February 10, 1775. His father, John Lamb, a
                    Lincolnshire man, who filled the situation of clerk and servant companion to Mr
                    Salt, one of the benchers of the Inner Temple, was successful in obtaining for
                    Charles, the youngest of three children, a presentation to Christ’s Hospital,
                    where the boy remained from his eighth to his fifteenth year (1782-1789). Here
                    he was fortunate enough to have for a schoolfellow the afterwards famous Samuel
                    Taylor Coleridge, his senior by rather more than two years, and a close and
                    tender life-long friendship began which had a singularly great influence on the
                    whole of his after career. When the time came for leaving school, where he had
                    learned some Greek and acquired considerable facility in Latin composition,
                    Lamb, after a brief stay at home (spent, as his school holidays had often been,
                    over old English authors in the library of Mr Salt), was condemned to the
                    labours of the desk,—an “unconquerable impediment” in his speech disqualifying
                    him for a school exhibition, and thus depriving him of the only means by which
                    he could have obtained a university education. For a short time he held a
                    clerkship in the South Sea House under his elder brother John, and in 1792 he
                    entered the accountant’s office in the East India House, where during the next
                    three and thirty years the hundred folios of what he used to call his true
                    “works” were produced. A dreadful calamity soon came upon him, which seemed to
                    blight all his prospects in the very morning of life. There was insanity in the
                    family, which in his twenty-first year had led to his own confinement for some
                    weeks in a lunatic asylum; and, a few months afterwards, on the 22d of September
                    1796, his sister Mary, “worn down to a state of extreme nervous misery by
                    attention to needlework by day and to her mother by night,” was suddenly seized
                    with acute mania, in which she stabbed her mother to the heart. The calm
                    self-mastery and loving self-renunciation which Charles Lamb, by constitution
                    excitable, nervous, and timid, displayed at this crisis in his own history and
                    in that of those nearest him, will ever give him an imperishable claim to the
                    reverence and affection of all who are capable of appreciating the heroisms of
                    common life. His sister was of course immediately placed in confinement, and
                    with the speedy return of comparative health came the knowledge of her fatal
                    deed; himself calm and collected, he knew how to speak the words of soothing and
                    comfort. With the help of friends he succeeded in obtaining her release from the
                    life-long restraint to which she would otherwise have been doomed, on the
                    express condition that he himself should undertake the responsibility for her
                    safe keeping. It proved no light charge; for, though no one was capable of
                    affording a more intelligent or affectionate companionship than Mary Lamb during
                    her long periods of health, there was ever present the apprehension of the
                    recurrence of her malady; and, when from time to time the premonitory symptoms
                    had become unmistakable, there was no alternative but her removal, which took
                    place in quietness and tears. How deeply the whole course of Lamb’s domestic
                    life must have been affected by his singular loyalty as a brother need not be
                    pointed out; for one thing, it rendered impossible his union with Alice
                    Winterton, whom he appears to have truly loved, and to whom such touching
                    reference was made long afterwards in <hi rend="italic">Dream Children, a
                    Reverie.</hi></p>
                <p>Lamb’s first appearance as an author was made in the year of the great tragedy of
                    his life (1796), when there were published in the volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poems on Various Subjects</hi> by Coleridge four sonnets by “Mr Charles Lamb of
                    the India House.” In the following year he also contributed along with Charles
                    Lloyd some pieces in blank verse to Coleridge’s new volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poems.</hi> In 1798 he published a short and pathetic prose tale entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Rosamund Cray,</hi> and in 1799 he was associated with Coleridge
                    and Southey in the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Annual Anthology,</hi>
                    to which he had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n246/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0246-0235"/> contributed a short religious poem in blank verse
                    entitled “Living without God in the World”; the company in which he was thus
                    found brought upon him the irrelevant and pointless ridicule of Canning and
                    Gillray. His next public appearance was not more fortunate. His <hi
                    rend="italic">John JVoodvil</hi> (1801), a slight dramatic piece written in the
                    style of the earlier Elizabethan period, and containing some genuine poetry and
                    happy delineation of the gentler emotions, but as a whole deficient in plot,
                    vigour, and character, was held up to ridicule by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review</hi> as a specimen of the rudest condition of the drama, a
                    work by “a man of the age of Thespis.” The dramatic spirit, however, was not
                    thus easily quenched in Lamb. His next effort (1806) was a farce, named <hi
                    rend="italic">Mr H.,</hi> the point of which lay in the hero’s anxiety to
                    conceal his name, “Hogsflesh”; it has recently been put upon the boards with
                    success in America, but in London it did not survive the first night of its
                    appearance. Its author bore the failure with rare equanimity and good humour,
                    and soon struck into new and more successful fields of literary exertion. In
                    1807 appeared <hi rend="italic">Tales founded on the Plays of Shakespeare,</hi>
                    written by Charles and Mary Lamb; and in 1808 <hi rend="italic">Specimens of
                    English Dramatic Poets who lived about the time of Shakespeare,</hi> with short
                    but felicitous critical notes. In the same year Mary Lamb, assisted by her
                    brother, also published <hi rend="italic">Poetry for Children</hi> and a
                    collection of short school-girl tales under the title <hi rend="italic">Mrs
                    Leicester's School</hi>; and to the same date belongs the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adventures of Ulysses,</hi> designed by Lamb as a companion to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Adventures of</hi><hi rend="italic">Telemachus.</hi> In 1810 began
                    to appear Leigh Hunt’s quarterly periodical, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Reflector,</hi> in which Lamb published much (including the essays on the
                    tragedies of Shakespeare and on Hogarth) that subsequently appeared in the first
                    collective edition of his TFbrZrs (2 vols. 12mo), which appeared in 1818. The
                    establishment of the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi> in 1820 stimulated
                    him to the production of a series of new essays which rose into instant
                    popularity, and may be said to form the chief corner-stone in the small but
                    classic temple of his fame. The first of these, as it fell out, was a
                    description of the old South Sea House, with which Lamb happened to have
                    associated the name of a “gay light-hearted foreigner” called Elia, who had
                    frequented it in the days of his service there. The pseudonym adopted on this
                    occasion was retained for the subsequent contributions which appeared
                    collectively in a post 8vo volume of <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> in 1823.
                    After a brief career of five years the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>
                    came to an end; and about the same period Lamb’s long connexion with the India
                    House terminated, a pension of about £450 having been assigned to him. The
                    increased leisure, however, for which he had long sighed, did not prove
                    favourable to literary production, which henceforth was limited to a few
                    trifling contributions to the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly</hi> and other
                    serials. The malady of his sister, which continued to increase with eveι∙
                    shortening intervals of relief, broke in painfully on his lettered ease and
                    comfort; and it is unfortunately impossible to ignore the deteriorating effects
                    of an over-free indulgence in the use of tobacco and alcohol on a temperament
                    such as his. His removal on account of his sister to the quiet of the country,
                    by tending to withdraw him from the stimulating society of the large circle of
                    literary friends who had helped to make his Wednesday evening “at homes” so
                    remarkable, doubtless also tended to intensify his listlessness and
                    helplessness. One of the brightest elements in the closing years of his life was
                    the friendship and companionship of Emma Isola, whom he and his sister had
                    adopted, and whose marriage in 1833 to Mr Moxon, though a source of unselfish
                    joy to Lamb, left him more than ever alone. While living at Edmonton, he was
                    overtaken by an attack of erysipelas brought on by an accidental fall as he was
                    walking on the London road; after a few days’ illness he painlessly passed away
                    on December 27, 1834. The sudden death of one so widely known, admired, and
                    beloved as Charles Lamb fell on the public, as well as on his own attached
                    circle, with all the poignancy of a personal calamity and a private grief. His
                    memory wanted no tribute that affection could bestow, and Wordsworth has
                    commemorated in simple and solemn verse the genius, virtues, and fraternal
                    devotion of his early friend.</p>
                <p>In depth of thought and splendour of genius Charles Lamb was surpassed by not a
                    few of his contemporaries, but as an essayist he is entitled to a place beside
                    Montaigne, Sir Thomas Browne, Steele, and Addison. He unites many of the
                    characteristics of each of these writers,—refined wit, exquisite humour, a
                    genuine and cordial vein of pleasantry, and heart-touching pathos. His fancy as
                    an essayist is distinguished by great delicacy and tenderness; and even his
                    conceits are imbued with human feeling and passion. He had an extreme and almost
                    exclusive partiality for our earlier prose writers, particularly for Fuller,
                    Browne, and Burton, as well as for the dramatists of Shakespeare’s time; and the
                    care with which he studied them is apparent in all he ever wrote. It shines out
                    conspicuously in his style, which has an antique air, and is redolent of the
                    peculiarities of the 17th century. Its quaintness has subjected the author to
                    the charge of affectation, but there is nothing really affected in his writings.
                    His style is not so much an imitation as a reflexion of the older writers; for
                    in spirit he made himself their contemporary. A confirmed habit of studying them
                    in preference to modern literature had made something of their style natural to
                    him; and long experience had rendered it not only easy and familiar but
                    habitual. It was not a masquerade dress he wore, but the costume which showed
                    the man to most advantage. With thought and meaning, often profound, though
                    clothed in simple language, every sentence of his essays is pregnant, and in
                    this respect he bears a strong resemblance to the writers already named. If he
                    had their manner, he possessed their spirit likewise. To some of his essays and
                    specimens we are considerably indebted for the revival of the dramatic writers
                    of the Shakespearian age; for he preceded Gifford and others in wiping the dust
                    of ages from the works of these authors. In his brief comments on each specimen
                    he displays exquisite powers of discrimination; his discernment of the true
                    meaning of his author is almost infallible. As a poet Lamb is not entitled to so
                    high a place as that which can be claimed for the essayist and critic. His
                    dependence on Elizabethan models is here also manifest, but in such a way as to
                    bring into all the greater prominence his native deficiency in “the
                    accomplishment of verse.” Yet it is impossible, once having read, ever to forget
                    the tenderness and grace of such verses as those to Hester Savory and on “The
                    Old Familiar Faces,” or the quaint humour of “A Farewell to Tobacco.” As a
                    letter writer also Lamb is entitled to rank very high.</p>
                <p>The Letters of Charles Lamb, with a sketch of his life by one of his executors,
                    Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd, appeared in 2 vols, in 1837, and Final Memorials of
                    Charles Lamb, by the same hand, were published in 1848. Supplementary to these
                    is the Memoir by another personal friend B. W. Procter (Barry Cornwall)
                    published in 1866. See also Fitzgerald’s Charles Lamb, his Friends, his Haunts,

                    and Charles Lamb: Poems, Letters, and Remains, 1874. There have been several
                    complete editions of the Works of Lamb; of these the fullest as well as most
                    recent is that of Fitzgerald (Life, Letters, and Writings of Charles Lamb, 6
