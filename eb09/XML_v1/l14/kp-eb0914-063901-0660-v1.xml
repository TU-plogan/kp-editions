                <p><label type="entry">LIGURIA</label>, in ancient geography, was the name given to
                    a portion of the north-west of Italy, including the districts, on both sides of
                    the Maritime Alps and the Apennines, which border on the Tyrrhenian Sea from the
                    frontiers of Gaul to those of Etruria. Along the sea-coast it extended from the
                    river Varus or Var, which separated it from Gaul, to the Macra (Magra), which
                    formedits limit on the side of Etruria, thus comprising the whole district
                    between the mountains and the sea, now known as the Riviera of Genoa. But
                    besides this it comprehended a broad tract to the north of the same range,
                    formed by the underfalls of the Apennines and the hilly tract adjoining them,
                    extending to the plains of the Padus or Po,—that river itself constituting its
                    northern limits under the Roman administration. But at an earlier period the
                    term had a much wider signification,—all the tribes on the south slopes of the
                    Alps, in the north-west of Italy, being apparently of Ligurian origin. This we
                    are expressly told by ancient authors in the case of the Taurini, who dwelt
                    around Turin, and of the Laevi and Libici, who extended from thence to the
                    Ticinus; and there can be little doubt that it was true also of the Salassi, who
                    occupied the modern Vai d’Aosta. But to the west of the Maritime Alps also the
                    Ligurians were undoubtedly widely spread in ancient times, and occupied a
                    considerable extent of what was afterwards included in GauL Thus the Salyes, who
                    held all the southern part of Provence from the Var to the Rhone, are distinctly
                    termed a Ligurian tribe, as well as the minor tribes of the Oxybii and Deciates,
                    near Frejιιs and Nice. All the early Greek writers speak of the important colony
                    of Massilia as founded in Liguria.</p>
                <p>Of the origin or affinities of the Ligurians (or Ligyans, as they are termed by
                    Greek writers) we know absolutely nothing. All ancient writers concur in
                    representing them as a distinct people from the Gauls on the one hand, and from
                    the Iberians on the other; and the attempts of some modern writers to assign
                    them to a Celtic stock rest upon no adequate foundation. In the absence of all
                    remains of their language, all such speculations must be matters of mere
                    conjecture. They appear in the historical period as a rough and hardy race of
                    mountaineers, cultivating a <pb break="no"

                    a stubborn resistance to the efforts of the Romans to reduce them to subjection.
                    They first came in contact with the Roman arms in 235 B.C., but it was not till
                    after the Second Punic War—in which the Ligurians had openly espoused the cause
                    of Hannibal—that a serious struggle began, which, commencing in 200 B.c., was
                    continued with little intermission for more than eighty years. While the Roman
                    generals in the East were overthrowing, with comparative ease, the powerful
                    monarchies of Macedonia and Syria, one of the consuls was generally engaged in
                    inglorious hostilities with the hardy mountaineers of the Ligurian Apennines.
                    Even.after these were reduced to subjection, the tribes which held the still
                    more rugged fastnesses of the Maritime Alps long maintained their independence,
                    and it was not till the reign of Augustus that they were finally subdued. The
                    construction by that monarch of a Roman highway along the coast, which followed
                    almost exactly the same line as the modern road of the Corniche, marked the
                    period of their complete subjection.</p>
                <p>The physical geography of Liguria has been already described in the article of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Italy.</hi> All the rivers which take their rise on the
                    northern slope of the mountains ultimately discharge their waters into the Po;
                    of these by much the most considerable is the Tanaro, which receives the
                    tributary streams of the Stura and the Bormida, while to the east of it flow the
                    Scrivia and the Trebia, celebrated by the victory of Hannibal over the Romans.
                    This last stream, according to the division of Augustus, formed the boundary
                    between Liguria and Gaul south of the· Po. The streams which flow from the
                    Apennines southward to the sea are for the most part inconsiderable, and mere
                    mountain torrents. But the Magra, which forms the limits of the province on the
                    east, is an important stream, and brings with it the waters of its tributary,
                    the Boactes or Vara. On the west also the Var is a river of considerable
                    magnitude, which forms a natural boundary on this side between Liguria and Gaul,
                    as it long constituted their political limit. The Rutuba or Roya, a little
                    farther east, is also a considerable river, descending through a deep mountain
                    valley from the Col di Tenda.</p>
                <p>The principal Ligurian tribes were (1) the Apuani, inhabiting the valley of the
                    Magra, including the district known in modern times as the Lunigiana; (2) the
                    Friniates, on the northern slope of the Apennines towards Modena; (3) the
                    Briniates, in the valley of the Vara; (4) the Genuates, around Genoa; (5) the
                    Veturii, immediately west of the preceding; (6) the Ingauni, whose capital was
                    Albium Ingaunum, still called Albenga; (7) the Intemelii, whose chief city still
                    retains the name of Vintimiglia; and (8) the Vediantii, extending thence to the
                    Var. North of the Apennines the most important tribes were the Vagienni, who
                    held the whole mountain tract from the Monte Viso and the sources of the Po to
                    the Tanaro; and the Statielli, east of them, whose chief town was Aquae
                    Statiellae or Acqui.</p>
                <p>The chief city on the Ligurian sea-coast was, in ancient as in modern times, that
                    of Genoa, which combined an excellent natural port with a central position, and
                    easy communications with the interior. West of it, along the coast, were Vada
                    Sabbata (Vado, near Savona), Albium Ingaunum (Albenga), Albium Intemelium
                    (Vintimiglia), the. Portus Herculis Monoeci (Monaco), and Nicaea (Nice), which
                    was founded by a colony from Massilia. In its immediate vicinity was the Roman
                    town of Cemenelium (Cimiez). On the northern slope of the Apennines were several
                    considerable towns, almost all of them of Roman origin. The chief of these were
                    Augusta Vagiennorum (Bene), Alba Pompeia, Asta, Aquae Statiellae, Dertona
                    (Tortona), and Iria (Voghera), but none of them attained to anything like the
                    same prosperity and importance as the great cities of Cisalpine Gaul. The towns
                    on the eastern Riviera, between Genoa and the Gulf of Spezia, were
                    inconsiderable places; and even on the shores of that gulf, forming the
                    magnificent port called the Portus Lunae, there was never any town of
                    importance, Luna itself being some distance inland, and within the confines of
                    Etruria. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. h. b.)</hi></p>
