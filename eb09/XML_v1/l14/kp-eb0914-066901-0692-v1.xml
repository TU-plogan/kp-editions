                    Lothian</hi></label>, a county of Scotland, stretching for 17 miles along the
                    south coast of the Firth of Forth, and bounded E. and S E. by Edinburghshire or
                    Midlothian, S.W. by Lanarkshire, and W. by Stirlingshire. It lies between 55°
                    49' and 56° 1' N. lat., and 3° 18' and 3° 51' W. long. According to the ordnance
                    survey the area is 127 square miles, or 81,114 acres, a considerable increase on
                    previous estimates. The longest straight line that can be drawn within the
                    county is one of about 22 miles from north-east to south-west, but the average
                    length does not exceed 16 miles, and the average breadth is about 7. To the east
                    and west the boundaries are in the main natural, following in the one case the
                    Almond and the Breich Water (except in the neighbourhood of Mid Calder, where
                    Edinburgh encroaches on Linlithgow), and in the other the Avon and Drumtassie
                    Burn. To the south they are more conventional, the line of the watershed between
                    the Clyde and the Forth being disregarded, and a good deal assigned to
                    Lanarkshire which physically belongs to the Lothians. The whole county lies in
                    the basin of the Forth, and there is a general slope upwards from the shore of
                    the firth to the hilly district in the south-west. The surface is diversified by
                    hill and dale, and, with the exception of the upland moors on the borders of
                    Lanarkshire, there is no extensive tract of level ground. A kind of irregular
                    valley stretches across the county from east to west, affording the most
                    convenient route for road, canal, and railway. Between this valley and the firth
                    runs a line of crags and hills often beginning to rise immediately behind the
                    shore; the more prominent are Dalmeny, Dundas, the Binns, and Glowerow’rem or
                    Bonny-tounhill, the last a rounded eminence 559 feet above the sea, crowned by a
                    conspicuous monument to General A. Hope, who fell in the Indian mutiny of 1858.
                    To the south of the valley the ground rises pretty rapidly towards the west,
                    more gradually towards the east. Between Bathgate and Linlithgow a general
                    height is obtained of from 600 to 700 feet,—the principal eminences being Knock
                    (1017 feet), Cairnpaple or Cairnnaple (upwards of 1000), the Torphichen Hills,
                    Bowden (749), and Cockleroy (942). Farther east come the Riccarton Hills; and
                    the range may be said to terminate with Binny Craig, a striking crag-and-tail
                    similar to those of Stirling and Edinburgh. To the south-east stands the
                    isolated Dechmont Law (686 feet).</p>
                <p>There is no stream of any considerable size belonging exclusively to the county.
                    The Almond rises in Lanarkshire, enters Linlithgowshire near Polkemmet, receives
                    the "White Burn and the Black Burn, and joining the Breich Water (also from
                    Lanarkshire) passes Livingston, Mid Calder (Midlothian), and Kirkliston, and
                    reaches the firth across the Drum Sands at Cramond. The Avon, which is already
                    nearly as large as it ever becomes when it reaches the borders of the county
                    below Muiravonside, passes Linlithgow bridge and Kinneil, and falls into the
                    firth Mme distance bel⅜w Inveravon. With the exception of Lochcot, the only lake
                    in the county is Linlithgow Loch, a sheet of water covering 102 acres to the
                    north of the town, well-known as a meeting place for curling and skating clubs.
                    The eastern end is not more than 10 feet deep, but in the western portion there
                    is one place about 50 feet deep. Eels are still caught in great numbers; and the
                    perch and the worthless roach, locally called the braise, are abundant. See <hi

                <p>“The eastern portion of the county,” says Mr H. M. Cadell, “consists of Lower
                    Carboniferous Sandstones, thin estuarine limestones, and shales. The
                    Carboniferous Limestone series, to which the strata in the western portion
                    belong, is separated from the underlying Calciferous Sandstone series by the
                    Carboniferous or Mountain Limestone, which dips westward and is well exposed
                    along the outcrop in the disused lime-quarries of Hillhouse, Sil vermi ne, and
                    Bathgate. The overlying rocks consist of sandstones, shales, and coal-seams,
                    which are worked at Bathgate and Bo’ness, above which come the three upper
                    marine bands named respectively the Index, the Calmy or Janet Peat, and the
                    Castlecary or Levenseat Limestone, the last of which is taken as the top of the
                    Carboniferous Limestone series and the base of the Millstone Grit. The strata
                    containing most of the workable coals at Bo’ness have a thickness of about 150
                    fathoms, measuring from the Index Limestone to the lowest seam. The extensive
                    sheets of contemporaneous volcanic rocks (basalts, dolerites, and tuffs) form a
                    remarkable feature in the geology of the county. The high ground between
                    Linlithgow and Bathgate is formed of an almost uninterrupted pile of these rocks
                    about 2000 feet in thickness. They thin out towards the north and south, and on
                    the shore of the firth they occur regularly interbedded with the seams of the
                    Bo’ness coal-field, which are usually in no degree injured by their presence.
                    The tuffs or ash beds are well seen at Preston Burn., Carriden House, and St
                    Magdalen’s near Linlithgow, while Binns Hill near Blackness is the remnant of an
                    old volcano of Lower Carboniferous age. Trap dykes rise through the strata and
                    run in an east and west direction, one of which can be traced for 4 miles
                    between Parkly Craigs and the Avon.” A few mineral springs, sulphurous and
                    chalybeate, are known to exist in the county, but none of them are now of
                    medical repute. In 1875 a salt spring was discovered in the volcanic rocks to
                    the west of the town of Linlithgow, boring having been prosecuted to the depth
                    of 451 feet in search of drinking water. (See <hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc.
                    Hdin.,</hi> 1875.) Coal-mining has been prosecuted in the county probably from
                    the time of the Romans; and the earliest document extant in regard to coalpits
                    in Scotland is a charter granted about the end of the 12th century to William
                    Oldbridge of Carriden. In 1871 it was estimated by the Government commissioners
                    that the Linlithgow coal-fields still contained 127,621,800 tons of coal
                    accessible at depths not exceeding 4000 feet. About 1440 miners were employed in
                    the twenty coal-mines in 1881, and the output for the year was 504,338 tons. At
                    the same date there were six iron-mines iu operation, with 926 miners and an
                    output of 180,194 tons. The Kinneil Company, which is the largest in this
                    department, employs about 700 persons. Fire-clay is worked in connexion with the
                    coal; at Kinneil 60,000 bricks can be turned out per week. Since their value was
                    made apparent by Mr Young about 1850, the shales have been the object of an
                    extensive industry at Broxburn, Uphall, Dalmeny, and Hopetoun. The six mines in
                    1881 employed 691 miners, and the output was 353,826 tons. Limestone, freestone,
                    and whinstone are all quarried within the county, and the Binny freestone has
                    been used for the Royal Institution, the National Gallery, and many of the
                    principal buildings of both Edinburgh and Glasgow. As a manufacturing district
                    Linlithgow does not stand high,—the chief estab- <pb break="no"

                    connexion with the town, being grist-mills, distilleries, chemical works, glass
                    works, spade and shovel works, and a pottery.</p>
                <p>The climate of the county hardly differs from that of the western portion of
                    Midlothian. The annual rainfall, however, is somewhat greater, and is a fifth
                    more than that of East Lothian: for the twenty-one years ending 1880 the mean at
                    Linlithgow was 31 ’ 76 inches, while at East Linton (east of Haddington) it was
                    26 ’ 52.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For earlier
                    notices of rainfall, &amp;c., see Trotter’s <hi rend="italic">Agriculture of
                    West Lothian.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Linlithgow is classed as a mixed agricultural and pastoral county; the
                    agricultural element, however, preponderates largely, though the area of
                    permanent pasture has been increasing. It is calculated that of the total area
                    of 81,114 acres about 20,000 acres consist of the best sorts of clay (carse,
                    &amp;c.), 22,700 of clay on a cold bottom, 9500 of loam, as much of light gravel
                    and sand, 14,000 of moorland and high rocky ground, and 1500 of peat. Only a
                    very small part of the arable land remains unreclaimed; the parish of
                    Livingston, which in the beginning of last century was nearly covered with heath
                    and juniper, is now all under rotation. Bathgate and Torphichen contain patches
                    of peat moss and swamp. In Carriden and Dalmeny, and generally along the coast,
                    the soil is light and early, though in some parts it varies so often that no
                    single term is applicable to any considerable area. According to the
                    agricultural returns for 1881, the corn crops occupied 17,347 acres, green crops
                    7264, clover and grass under rotation 12,980, permanent pasture (exclusive of
                    heath or mountain land) 21,289. Oats are the most important of the cereals,
                    10,348 acres; and barley comes next with 4874 acres, an increase on the 3787
                    acres of 1856. Wheat has been steadily losing ground; while 1856 showed 4643
                    acres, 1881 gives only 1450. Beans, which used to occupy about 1000 acres, are
                    now reduced to 655. An increasing area is devoted to clover and grasses for hay;
                    but on the other hand the turnip area has been considerably reduced—5142 acres
                    in 1856, 3861 in 1881. The extent of land under potatoes has slightly increased,
                    —3052 acres for 1881, 2355 being the average for 1866-75. Cattle breeding is not
                    much attended to, but a considerable number of animals are bought and fattened,
                    and dairy farming is largely prosecuted, the fresh butter and churn milk being
                    sent mainly to Edinburgh, but also to Newcastle, &amp;c. Very little cheese is
                    made. As a sheepfarming county Linlithgow stands very low—the returns giving
                    17,605 head in 1881, 23,070 in 1866. But few horses are bred, and the number of
                    those in the county has remained wonderfully steady for the last fifteen years.
                    Pigs have grown greatly feλver—3166 in 1866, and only 1442 in 1881.</p>
                <p>The average extent of the farms is 108 acres, rather less than in Midlothian; of
                    the total 542 more than 200 do not exceed 50 acres, and only 35 rise above 300.
                    Very little of the land is rented at more than £3 per acre; an average of £2 to
                    £2, 10s. for the best districts, of 30s. to 35s. for medium soils, and 15s. to
                    25s. for the worst land, will not be wide of thê mark. ‘ ‘ The leases of the
                    arable lands are almost invariably for nineteen years, and grass lands are
                    usually let annually by public auction, though in some instances they are taken
                    for a period of three or five years.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Though it is only in the neighbourhood of the principal mansions that large
                    stretches of wood exist, the county as a tree-growing district rises
                    considerably above the average for Scotland,—the woodland area being returned as
                    4899 acres in 1881, or one-sixteenth of the whole (Edinburgh shows
                    one-twentieth). The finest woods are those of Hopetoun (where the beech avenues
                    are especially noteworthy), Newliston, Kinneil, and Dalmeny. Much of the old
                    timber has been recently cut down, but replanting has been vigorously
                    prosecuted.</p>
                <p>The valued rent of the county in 1649 was £75,027 Scots, or about £6252 sterling.
                    In 1806 the real rent was £64,518 sterling, and in 1811, £88,745. Exclusive of
                    railways, the valuation was £189,198 in 1876-77, and £216,011 in 1881-82. In the
                    beginning of the century the county was practically in the hands of between
                    thirty and forty landowners (Trotter). According to the Government return for
                    1872-73, the total number of owners was 1535, of which 287 possessed upwards of
                    1 acre. The pro-Erietors holding estates above 2000 acres were as follows :—Earl
                    of [opetoun, 11,870 acres; Earl of Rosebery, 5680; Sir William Baillie of
                    Polkemmet, 4320; Duke of Hamilton’s Trustees, 3694; Lord Cardross, 2995; William
                    Cowan of Linburn, 2231; Robert H. J. Stewart of Champfleurie, 2036; Dundas’s
                    Trustee, 2082.</p>
                <p>Hopetoun House, the seat of the earl of Hopetoun, and the grandest mansion in the
                    county, occupies a fine position between Queensferry and Blackness. Begun about
                    1696 by Sir William Brace of Kinross, and completed long afterwards by Mr Adam,
                    it practically occupies the site of the old castle of Abercorn, which was taken
                    from the Douglas family by James II. in 1455. Dalmeny Park (earl of Rosebery)
                    lies about 1⅛ mile west of Cramond; the neighbouring ruins of Barnbougie Castle,
                    an ancient seat of the Mowbrays, have been incorporated with a modern building.
                    Almondell House (earl of Buchan) is situated on the Almond, not far from Mid
                    Calder. Kinneil, a now deserted residence of the dukes of Hamilton, associated
                    with memories of Colonel Lilburn and Dugald Stewart, is a short distance to the
                    south-west of Bo’ness. On a trap rock jutting out into the firth stands
                    Blackness Castle, now used as a powder magazine, but once one of the “keys of
                    the kingdom,” with a busy little port under its protection. Niddry Castle (often
                    called West or Seton Niddry), one of the resting places of Queen Mary, is now a
                    mere ruin. Newliston (now owned by T. A. Hog) was for many years the residence
                    of Lord Stair, who first introduced the field cultivation of cabbage, and is
                    said to have laid out the woods according to the plan of the battle of
                    Dettingen. Dundas Castle was the original seat of the Dundas family. Pardovan
                    recalls the memory of Walter Steuart, author of the <hi rend="italic"

                    Philipstoun that of John Dundas, another Scottish ecclesiastical lawyer.
                    Kincavel was the birthplace and family mansion of Patrick Hamilton.</p>
                <p>There are two royal burghs in the county—Linlithgow and Queensferry, and, besides
                    the towns Bathgate, Borrowstounness or Bo’ness, Armadale, a number of thriving
                    villages.</p>
                <p>The Union Canal connecting the Forth and Clyde Canal with Edinburgh passes along
                    the central valley, and crosses the Almond and Avon by bridges designed by
                    Thomas Telford. The North British Railway has two lines between Edinburgh and
                    Glasgow, which pass through the county <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Linlithgow and
                    Bathgate respectively. Queensferry and Bo’ness are both connected with the
                    system by branch-lines, and Bathgate is a junction of some importance.</p>
                <p>The population of West Lothian has increased from 17,844 in 1801 to 43,198
                    (22,436 males and 20,762 females) in 1881. The greatest increase (8601) took
                    place in the decennial period 1851-1861, the least (606) in 1811-21. The females
                    were in excess of the males in every census down to 1841; since then the
                    preponderance has been on the other side. The total population was 23,291 in
                    1831, 26,872 in 1841, 30,044 in 1851, 38,645 in 1861, and 40,965 in 1871.</p>
                <p>Traces of the prehistoric occupation of the county are fairly numerous. On Bowden
                    Hill is an earthwork connected by Mr Glennie and others with the Arthurian
                    contest. On Cairnpaple may be seen a circular building of unknown but early
                    origin, and at Kipps is a cromlech once surrounded by circles of stones. Stone
                    cists have been discovered at Carlowrie, Dalmeny, Newliston, &amp;c. Near
                    Inveravon is a vast accumulation of shells considered by several geologists to
                    be a natural bed, but claimed by antiquaries as an artificial mound, either a
                    kitchen midden or a heap for the manufacture of lime (see David Grieve, <hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Sc. Soc. of Ant.,</hi> 1870-71). The Wall of Antoninus lies
                    for a considerable distance within the county, and is believed to give origin to
                    the names Carriden and Walton (see an account of a detailed exploration of the
                    wall in <hi rend="italic">Builder,</hi> 1877, pp. 1023-25). A fine legionary

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Linlithgow,</hi> the county town of the above county, and a
                    royal and parliamentary burgh, situated in the central valley, 18 miles by rail
                    from Edinburgh, consists almost exclusively of a single street running east and
                    west along both sides of the highway; gardens behind the houses stretch down to
                    the lake or climb the lower slopes of the rising grounds, on which a
                    considerable number of suburban residences have been erected. In the early part
                    of the century the general aspect of the street was antique and picturesque, but
                    the greater proportion of the frontage has been rebuilt or modernized. Apart
                    from the palace and the contiguous church of St Michael, the only edifices of
                    any note are an ancient towerlike building near the railway station, which
                    tradition regards as a mansion of the Knights Templars, the town-house (1688),
                    and the county courts (1865). “Linlithgow for wells” is a proverbial expression;
                    and the cross well in the public <pb break="no"

                    piece of grotesque carved work in stone, originally erected, it is believed, in
                    the reign of James V., but rebuilt in 1807. The burgh school goes back to the
                    pre-Reformation times. Shoemaking and tanning are the leading industries; but a
                    large distillery and (in the neighbourhood) two paper mills, glue works, and a
                    soap factory add considerably to the business of the place. Linen bleaching is
                    altogether a thing of the past. A grain market is held every Friday. The riding
                    of the marches of the burgh is still performed annually by the magistrates and
                    trades. The population of the burgh was 2282 in 1792-93, 3843 in 1861, 3690 in
                    1871, and 3913 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Linlithgow Palace is by general consent the finest ruin of its kind in Scotland.
                    Heavy but effective, the sombre walls rise above the green knolls of the
                    promontory λvlιich divides the lake into two nearly equal portions. In plan it
                    is almost square (168 by 174 feet), enclosing a court (91 by 88 feet), in the
                    centre of which stands the ruined fountain used as a model for that erected in
                    front of Holyrood Palace. At each comer there is a tower with an internal spiral
                    staircase,—that of the north-west angle being crowned by a little octagonal
                    turret known as “Queen Margaret’s Bower,” from the tradition that it was there
                    that the consort of James IV. sat and watched for his return from Flodden. The
                    oldest portion of the building is probably the west side, whose massive masonry,
                    hardly broken by a single window, is supposed to date in part from the time of
                    James III.; but the larger part of the south and east sides belong to James V.,
                    about 1535; and the north side was rebuilt in 1619-20. Of James V.’s portion,
                    which is architecturally the richest, the main apartments are the Lyon chamber
                    or parliament hall, and the chapel royal. The grand entrance approached by a
                    drawbridge, was on the east side; above the gate way are still some weather-worn
                    remains of rich allegorical designs, once resplendent with colour. A few yards
                    to the south of the palace is the church of St Michael, a Gothic (Scottish
                    Decorated) building (180 feet long internally excluding the apse and the
                    steeple, by 62 in breadth excluding the transepts) probably founded in 1242, but
                    mainly built in ths 15th century. The central west front steeple was till 1821
                    topped by a crown like that of St Giles, Edinburgh.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Linlithgow (wrongly identified with a Roman Lindum) was a royal burgh with a
                    royal castle and an endowed church as far back as the reign of David I. Edward
                    I., who had encamped there the night before the battle of Falkirk (1298),
                    wintered at Linlithgow in 1301, and next year built <hi rend="italic">“a</hi>
                    pele (castle) mekill and strong,” which in 1313 was captured by the Scots
                    through the assistance of William Bunnock or Binning and his famous hay-cart.
                    Later in the century (1369) the customs of Linlithgow yielded more than those of
                    any other chief town except Edinburgh; and the burgh was taken along with Lanark
                    to supply the place of Berwick and Roxburgh in the court of the Four Burghs
                    (1368). Robert II. granted it a charter of immunities, the oldest still
                    preserved, in 1384. The palace becoming a favourite residence of the kings of
                    Scotland, and often forming part of the marriage settlement of their consorts
                    (Mary of Guelders, 1449; Margaret of Denmark, 1468; Margaret of England, 1503),
                    is frequently mentioned in Scotch history. James V. was born within its walls in
                    1512, and his daughter Mary, December 7, 1542. In 1570 the Regent Murray was
                    assassinated in the High Street by Hamilton of Bothwell· haugh. In 1600 the
                    title earl of Linlithgow was bestowed on Alexander, Lord Livingston, by James
                    VI., who after his accession to the English throne retained an affection for the
                    palace, and visited it again in 1617. The university of Edinburgh took refuge at
                    Linlithgow from the plague in 1645-46; and in the same year the national
                    parliament, which had often sat in the palace, was held there for the last time.
                    The public burning of the Covenant (1661), the passing of Prince Charles through
                    the town in 1745, and the burning of the palace by Hawley’s dragoons in 1746 are
                    the chief remaining facts in the local annals. Most of the privileges which
                    Linlithgow enjoyed have dropped away. The rise of Bo’ness gave the last blow to
                    the prosperity of its port at Blackness; its burgh lands Lave all been sold;
                    and, after gaining its case three times in the Court of Session, it was deprived
                    (1859) by the House of Lords of any claim to levy bridge toll and custom from
                    the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway.</p>
