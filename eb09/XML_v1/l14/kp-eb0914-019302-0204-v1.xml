                <p><label type="entry">LACONIA</label>, the Greek Λακωνική, is the name generally
                    applied in modern times to the country which occupied the south-eastern corner
                    of the Peloponnesus, often called Lacedaemon, Λακeδαi∕xωv, which is the only
                    name used in Homer. The history of the district has already been given (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Greece),</hi> and it only remains to give a slight sketch of
                    its physical features. These are very peculiar, and had great influence in
                    producing the marked and distinctive character of the section of the Dorian race
                    which occupied Laconia throughout the historical period. The country is a deep
                    valley almost completely surrounded by mountains, and it is the general opinion
                    that both names, Laconia and Lacedaemon,, refer to this hollow sunken character,
                    being connected with <hi rend="italic">lacus,</hi> λάκκος, Ac. The mountains of
                    Arcadia shut in this valley on the north, and from them two parallel chains of
                    mountains stretch due south bounding the valley on the east and on the west. The
                    eastern chain bore in ancient times the name Taygetus, the western, Parnon; both
                    ridges stretched far out into the sea, forming respectively the promontories of
                    Taenarus and Malea. Taygetus, now called Pentedaktylon, is a splendid unbroken
                    chain of lofty peaks, well deserving its Homeric epithet <hi rend="italic"
                    >πeρψ.τ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">κfτo'i;</hi> the highest
                    point is the ancient Taleton, now St Elias, 7900 feet high. Mount Parnon is not
                    such a fine ridge, but still forms a strong barrier along the sea-coast. Through
                    the whole length of the valley from north to south flows the river Eurotas,
                    which has only one tributary of any consequence, the Oenus. The soil was not
                    remarkably fertile, except in the low ground towards the sea; but the sides of
                    Taygetus were covered with dense forests which afforded excellent sport to the
                    inhabitants of the plain. The people were thus inured to the hardy life of
                    mountaineers; they were so securely defended by nature against invasion that the
                    victorious Epaminondas hesitated to attack the country; while with command of
                    the passes they could at any time invade the neighbouring countries. Over Mount
                    Taygetus there was hardly any pass practicable for an army; from Arcadia there
                    were only two entrances, both easily defended, one by the course of the Oenus,
                    the other by the Eurotas. Mount Parnon stretched along the east coast, which
                    offered no harbour, hardly even a landing place, for foreign ships. While adding
                    to the security of the country, the same causes isolated it greatly from
                    intercourse with other peoples, tended to keep the inhabitants backward and to
                    prevent education, and led to that jealous and exclusive character which
                    distinguished the Lacedaemonians.</p>
