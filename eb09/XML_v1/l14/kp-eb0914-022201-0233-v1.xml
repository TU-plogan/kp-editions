                <p><label type="entry">LAKE DWELLINGS</label>, as their name implies, are
                    habitations constructed, not on the dry land, but within the margins of lakes or
                    creeks at some distance from the shore. The villages of the Guajiros in the Gulf
                    of Maracaibo are described by Goering as composed of houses with low sloping
                    roofs perched on lofty piles and connected with each other by bridges of planks.
                    Each house consisted of two apartments; the floor was formed of split stems of
                    trees set close together and covered with mats; they were reached from the shore
                    by dug-out canoes poled over the shallow waters; a notched tree trunk served as
                    a ladder; and the piles were so firmly driven that no shakiness was perceptible
                    even when the houses were crowded with people. In such a climate the advantages
                    of dwelling in houses so situated are obvious. The custom is common both in the
                    Gulf of Maracaibo and in the estuaries of the Orinoco and Amazon; indeed the
                    name of the province of Venezuela was given to it from the prevalence of these
                    pile-dwellings along its shores. A similar system prevails in New Guinea.
                    D’Urville describes four such villages in the Bay of Dorei, containing from
                    eight to fifteen blocks or clusters of houses, each block separately built on
                    piles, and consisting of a row of distinct dwellings accommodating a number of
                    families. Cameron describes three villages thus built on piles in Lake Mohrya in
                    Central Africa, the motive here being to prevent surprise by bands of
                    slave-catchers. Similar constructions have been described by travellers, among
                    the Dyaks of Borneo, in Celebes, in the Caroline Islands, on the Gold Coast of
                    Africa, and in other places. Historians have referred to the former existence of
                    the custom in Europe and Asia. Hippocrates, writing in the 5th century B.c.,
                    says of the people of the Phasis that their country is hot and marshy and
                    subject to frequent inundations, and that they live in houses of timber and
                    reeds constructed in the midst of the waters, and use boats of a single tree
                    trunk. Herodotus, writing also in the 5th century B.C., describes the people of
                    Lake Prasias as living in houses constructed on platforms supported on piles in
                    the middle of the lake, which are approached from the land by a single narrow

                    13th century, notices the fact that part of the Apamaean Lake was then called
                    the Lake of the Christians, because it was inhabited by Christian fishermen who
                    lived on the lake in wooden huts built on piles. Fishermen’s huts roughly
                    constructed of branches of trees and supported on piles placed saltire-wise
                    existed in the shallows of the bays on the European side of the Bosphorus not
                    many years ago, and Sir John Lubbock mentions that the Roumelian fishermen on
                    Lake Prasias “still inhabit wooden cottages built over the water, as in the time
                    of Herodotus.” The records of the wars in Ireland in the 16th century show that
                    the petty chieftains of that time had their defensive strongholds constructed in
                    the “freshwater lochs” of the country, and there is record evidence of a similar
                    system in the western parts of Scotland. The archaeological researches of the
                    past few years have shown that such artificial constructions in lakes were used
                    as defensive dwellings by the Celtic people of post-Roman and mediaeval times
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Crannogs).</hi> Similar researches on the Continent
                    have also established the fact that in pre-historic times nearly all the shallow
                    lakes of Switzerland, and many in the adjoining countries—in Savoy and the north
                    of Italy, in Austria and Hungary, and in Mecklenburg and Pomerania—were peopled,
                    so to speak, by lake-dwelling communities, living in villages constructed on
                    platforms supported by piles, at varying distances from the shores. The
                    principal groups are those in the Lakes of Bourget, Geneva, Neuchâtel, Bienne,
                    Zurich, and Constance lying to the north of the Alps, and in the Lakes Maggiore,
                    Varese, Iseo, and Garda lying to the south of that mountain range. Many smaller
                    lakes, however, contain them, and they are also found in peat moors on the sites
                    of ancient lakes now drained or silted up. In some of the larger lakes the
                    number of settlements has been very great. Fifty are enumerated in the Lake of
                    Neuchâtel, thirty-two in the Lake of Constance, twenty-four in the Lake of
                    Geneva, and twenty in the Lake of Bienne. Some of these settlements have been of
                    considerable size. The site of the lake dwelling of Wangen, in the Untersee,
                    Lake of Constance, forms a parallelogram more than 700 paces in length by about
                    120 paces in breadth. The settlement at Morges, which is one of the largest in
                    the Lake of Geneva, is 1200 feet long by 150 feet in breadth. The settlement of
                    Sutz, one of the largest in the Lake of Bienne, extends over an area of 6
                    English acres, and was connected with the shore by a gangway nearly 100 yards
                    long and about 40 feet wide. The substructure .which supported the platforms on
                    which the dwellings were placed was most frequently of piles driven into the
                    bottom of the lake. Less frequently it consisted of a stack of brushwood or
                    fascines built up from the bottom and strengthened by stakes penetrating the
                    mass so as to keep it from spreading. When piles were used they were simply the
                    rough stems of trees of a length proportioned to the depth of the water,
                    sharpened sometimes by fire and at other times chopped to a point by hatchets.
                    On their level tops the beams supporting the platforms were laid and fastened by
                    wooden pins, or inserted in mortices cut in the heads of the piles. In some
                    cases the whole construction was further steadied and strengthened by cross
                    beams, notched into the piles below the supports of the platform. The platform
                    itself was usually composed of rough layers of unbarked stems, but occasionally
                    it was formed more regularly of boards split from larger stems. When the mud was
                    too soft to afford foothold for the piles they were mortised into a framework of
                    tree trunks placed horizontally on the bottom of the lake. On the other hand,
                    when the bottom was rocky so that the piles could not be driven, they were
                    steadied at their bases by being enveloped in a mound of loose stones, deposited
                    around and among them, exactly in the manner in which the foundations of piers
                    and breakwaters are now constructed. In cases where piles have not been used, as
                    at Niederwyl and Wauwyl, the substructure is a mass of fascines or faggots laid
                    parallel and crosswise upon one another with layers of brushwood or of clay and
                    gravel separating the beds of the wooden material, which is steadied and kept in
                    position by upright stakes not driven into the lake bottom,—a few piles here and
                    there being occasionally fixed throughout the mass to serve as guides or stays.
                    At Niederwyl the platform was formed of split boards, many of which were 2 feet
                    broad and 2 or 3 inches in thickness. On these substructures were placed the
                    groups of huts composing the settlement; for the peculiarity of these lake
                    dwellings is that they were pile villages, or clusters of huts occupying a
                    common platform. The huts themselves were quadrilateral in form. The size of
                    each separate dwelling is in some cases marked by boards resting edgeways on the
                    platform, like the skirting boards over the flooring of the rooms in a modern
                    house. The walls, which were supported by posts, or by piles of greater length,
                    were formed of wattle-work, coated with clay. The floors were of clay, and in
                    each floor there was a hearth constructed of flat slabs of stone. The roofs were
                    thatched with bark, straw, reeds, or rushes. As the superstructures are in all
                    cases gone, there is no evidence as to the position and form of the doorways, or
                    the size, number, and position of the windows, if there were any. In some cases
                    the remains of the gangways or bridges connecting the settlements with the shore
                    have been discovered, but in others the village appears to have been practically
                    insular and accessible only by canoes. Several of these single-tree canoes have
                    been found, one of which is 43 feet in length and 4 feet 4 inches in its
                    greatest width. It is impossible to estimate with any degree of certainty the
                    number of separate dwellings of which any of these villages may have consisted,
                    but at Niederwyl they stood almost contiguously on the platform, the space
                    between them not exceeding 3 feet in width. The size of the huts also varied
                    considerably. At Niederwyl they were 20 feet long and 12 feet wide, while at
                    Robenhausen they were about 27 feet long by about 22 feet wide. The character of
                    the relics associated with the sites of the various settlements discloses the
                    fact that in some cases they have been the dwellings of a people using no
                    materials but stone, bone, and wood for their implements, ornaments, and
                    weapons; in others, of a people using bronze as well as stone and bone; and in
                    others again iron and bronze were used. But, though the character of the
                    associated relics is thus changed, there is no corresponding change in the
                    construction and arrangements of the dwellings. The settlement in the Lake of
                    Moosseedorf, near Bern, affords the most perfect example of a lake dwelling of
                    the Stone age. It was a parallelogram 70 feet long by 50 feet wide, supported on
                    piles, and having a gangway built on faggots connecting it with the land. The
                    superstructure had been destroyed by fire. The implements found in the relic bed
                    under it were celts or axe-heads of stone, with their haftings of stag’s horn
                    and wood; a flint saw, set in a handle of fir wood and fastened with asphalt;
                    flint flakes and arrow-heads; harpoons of stag’s horn with barbs; awls, needles,
                    chisels, fish-hooks, and other implements of bone; a comb of yew wood 5 inches
                    long; and a skate made out of the leg bone of a horse. The pottery consisted
                    chiefly of roughly-made vessels, some of which were of large size, others had
                    holes under the rims for suspension, and many were covered with an encrustation
                    of soot, the result of their use as culinary vessels. Burnt wheat, barley, and
                    linseed, with many varieties of seeds and fruits, were plentifully mingled with
                    the bones of the stag, the ox, the swine, the sheep, and <pb break="no"

                    inhabitants, while remains of the beaver, the fox, the hare, the dog, the bear,
                    the horse, the elk, and the bison were also found. The settlement of
                    Robenhausen, in the moor which w as formerly the bed of the ancient Lake of
                    Pfäffikon, seems to have continued in occupation after the introduction of
                    bronze. The site covers an area of nearly 3 acres, and is estimated to have
                    contained 100,000 piles. In some parts three distinct successions of inhabited
                    platforms have been traced. The first had been destroyed by fire. It is
                    repre-ssnted at the bottom of the lake by a layer of charcoal mixed with
                    implements of stone and bone, and other relics highly carbonized. The second is
                    represented above the bottom by a series of piles with burnt heads, and in the
                    bottom by a layer of charcoal mixed with corn, apples, cloth, bones, pottery,
                    and implements of stone and bone, separated from the first layer of charcoal by
                    3 feet of peaty sediment intermixed with relics of the occupation of the
                    platform. The piles of the third settlement do not reach down to the shell marl,
                    but are fixed in the layers representing the first and .second settlements. They
                    are formed of split oak trunks, while those of the two first settlements are
                    round stems chiefly of soft wood. The huts of this last settlement appear to
                    have had cattle stalls placed between them, the droppings and litter forming
                    heaps at the lake bottom. The bones of the animals consumed as food at this
                    station were found in such numbers that 5 tons were collected in the
                    construction of a watercourse which crossed the site. Among the wooden objects
                    recovered from the relic beds were tubs, plates, ladles, and spoons, a flail for
                    threshing corn, a last for stretching shoes of hide, celt handles, clubs,
                    long-bows of yew, floats, and implements of fishing, and a dug-out canoe 12 feet
                    long. No spindle-whorls were found, but there were many varieties of cloth,
                    platted and woven, bundles of yarn, and balls of string. Among the tools of bone
                    and stag’s horn were awls, needles, harpoons, scraping tools, and haftings for
                    stone axe-heads. The implements of stone were chiefly axe-heads and arrow-heads.
                    Of clay and earthenware there were many varieties of domestic dishes, cups and
                    pipkins, and crucibles or melting pots made of clay and horse dung and still
                    retaining the drossy coating of the melted metal. No bronze objects have yet
                    been found at Robenhausen, although the presence of the crucibles attests the
                    fact of the use of that metal. The settlement of Auvernier in the Lake of
                    Neuchâtel is the richest and most considerable station of the Bronze age. It has
                    yielded four bronze swords, ten socketed spear-heads, forty celts or axe heads
                    and sickles, fifty knives, twenty socketed chisels, four hammers and an anvil,
                    sixty rings for the arms and legs, several highly ornate torques or twisted neck
                    rings, and upwards of two hundred hair pins of various sizes up to 16 inches in
                    length, some having spherical heads in which plates of gold were set. Moulds for
                    sickles, lance-heads, and bracelets were found cut in stone or made in baked
                    clay. From four to five hundred vessels of pottery finely made and elegantly
                    shaped are indicated by the fragments recovered from the relic bed at this
                    station. In the settlement at Marin in the Lake of Neuchâtel iron takes the
                    place of whatever in the older lake dwellings was made either of stone, bone, or
                    bronze. The swords are well forged, of a peculiarly fibrous iron, and furnished
                    with iron sheaths. The spear-heads are large, sometimes as much as 18£ inches in
                    length, with blades indented by segmental curves. Shield mountings, horse
                    trappings, and personal ornaments such as fibulae are here made of iron instead
                    of bronze, and Roman and Gallic coins found in the relic bed bring the
                    occupation of the settlement distinctly within the historic period. The
                    antiquity of the earlier settlements of the Stone and Bronze ages is not capable
                    of being deduced from existing evidence. “We may venture to place them,” says Dr
                    Keller, “in an age when iron and bronze had been long known, but had not come
                    into our districts in such plenty as to be used for the common purposes of
                    household life, at a time when amber had already taken its place as an ornament
                    and had become an object of traffic.” It is now established that the people who
                    erected the lake dwellings in Switzerland were also the people who were spread
                    over the mainland. The forms and the ornamentation of the implements and weapons
                    of stone and bronze which are found in the lake dwellings are the same as those
                    of the implements and weapons in these materials which are found in the soil of
                    the adjacent regions, and both groups of relics must therefore be ascribed to
                    the industry of one and the same people. Whether dwelling on the land or
                    dwelling in the lake, they have exhibited so many indications of capacity,
                    intelligence, industry, and social organization that they cannot be considered
                    as presenting, even in their Stone age, a low condition of culture or
                    civilization. Their axes were made of tough stones, sawn from the block by
                    flint, and ground to the fitting shape. They were fixed by the butt in a socket
                    of stag’s horn, mortised into a handle of wood. Their knives and saws of flint
                    were mounted in wooden handles and fixed with asphalt. They made and used an
                    endless variety of bone tools. Their pottery, though roughly finished, is well
                    made, the vessels often of large size and capable of standing the fire as
                    cooking utensils. For domestic dishes they also made wooden tubs, plates,
                    spoons, ladles, and the like. The industries of spinning and weaving were
                    largely practised. They made nets and fishing lines, and used canoes. They
                    practised agriculture, cultivating several varieties of wheat and barley,
                    besides millet and flax. They kept horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and swine.
                    Their clothing was partly of linen and partly of woollen fabrics and the skins
                    of their beasts. Their food was nutritious and varied, their dwellings neither
                    unhealthy nor incommodious. They lived in the security and comfort obtained by
                    social organization, and were apparently intelligent, industrious, and
                    prosperous communities.</p>
                <p>The materials for the investigation of this singular phase of prehistoric life
                    were first collected and systematized by the late Dr Ferdinand Keller, who died
                    at Ziirich, July 21, 1881, in the eighty-first year of his age. They were
                    submitted in a series of seven successive reports to the Society of Antiquaries
                    of Ziirich, of which he was president, and printed in the Society’s

                    i.-xix., 4to, 1855-76. The substance of these reports has also been issued as a
                    separate work in England, The Lake Dwellings of Switzerland and other parts of
