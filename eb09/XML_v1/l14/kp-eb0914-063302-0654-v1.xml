                    Rod</hi></label><hi rend="italic">{Paratonnerre,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Blitz-ableiter),</hi> is the name usually given to apparatus designed to
                    protect buildings or ships from the destruβtive effects of lightning. The title,
                    alike in English, French, and German, is misleading; for, when properly
                    constructed, lightning rods serve rather to prevent the occurrence than to ward
                    off the effects of a flash of lightning. Damping the enemy’s powder would be a
                    most efficient precaution against cannon-shot, but it would be very
                    inappropriately termed fortification. When a conductor charged with electricity
                    is brought near to another conductor connected with the earth, it induces on it
                    a charge of the opposite kind of electricity. The result is an attractive force
                    which tends to bring the conductors nearer to one another, and to augment the
                    electric density on their opposed surfaces. When the density is sufficiently
                    great, there is rupture of the dielectric (air) between the conductors, and the
                    disruptive discharge takes place as an electric spark. If one of the conductors
                    have projecting points or angles, the electric density is usually much greater
                    at such places than over the rest of the surface. But, though the density is
                    great at such places, the charge on them is usually small, and the discharge
                    takes place in an almost continuous manner by a brush or glow. When, for
                    instance, a large conductor, connected with an electric machine, is giving a
                    rapid succession of bright sparks to a ball connected with the ground, the
                    sparks cease as soon as a pointed wire, connected with the ground, is held in
                    the vicinity of the conductor. No discharge is heard, but in the dark a faint
                    glow is seen at the end of the wire, which continues as long as the machine is
                    turned. Remove the wire and the sparks instantly recommence. This glow is known
                    to sailors as St Elmo’s (San Telmo’s) fire, in old days Castor and Pollux
                    (Plin., <hi rend="italic">H. H.,</hi> ii. 37). Suppose now one of the conductors
                    to be a thundercloud, the other the surface of the earth, the discharge will
                    usually take place between the places of greatest surface density; and it will
                    in general be the more gradual as these are more pointed, and of less capacity.
                    Hence Franklin’s idea of furnishing buildings or other prominent objects with a
                    projecting metal spike well connected with the ground, for the purpose of
                    preventing a lightning discharge by substituting for it what is practically a
                    continuous electric current.</p>
                <p>To effect this object thoroughly, only three things are necessary:—(1) the points
                    should so project from the building or ship to be protected as to prevent any
                    great development of electric density elsewhere than on themselves; (2) they
                    should be effectually connected with the earth; (3) the connecting rod ought to
                    be so good a conductor as not to be injured even by a powerful electric
                    discharge.</p>
                <p>The first of these conditions is realized by making the rod branch out to all the
                    salient portions of the building or ship, and furnishing it with points
                    projecting beyond each of them. No general rule can be laid down as to the
                    extent of the region protected by a single point, though it may usually be
                    assumed with safety that the region extends throughout a vertical cone whose
                    vertex is at the point, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n655/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0655-0634"/> and whose semivertical angle is about 45°. This
                    is probably not true if the point be very high,—on the top of a tall chimney or
                    tower, for instance. Objects not far from the base of such a protected tower,
                    and within the cone just described, have occasionally been damaged by
                    lightning.</p>
                <p>The second condition is easily fulfilled in towns by connecting the lower end of
                    the rod with the iron gas and water-mains, which form an excellent “earth,” as
                    it is technically called. Water-pipes, being usually jointed with
                    metallic-lead-washers, are preferable to gas-pipes, which are usually put
                    together with white lead. This condition is also easy to secure in ships and in
                    lighthouses, where large metal plates (in the case of a ship, the copper
                    sheathing is precisely what is required) can easily be permanently immersed in
                    sea-water. In country houses it is usually more difficult to obtain a proper
                    earth. Plates and tubes of metal, of large surface, buried in ground which is
                    permanently damp, form usually the best arrangement. A well makes a good earth;
                    a carefully constructed water tank (of stone or cement) is not an earth at
                    all.</p>
                <p>The third condition, so far as experience can guide us, seems to be effectually
                    realized by making the conductor <hi rend="italic">throughout</hi> of iron rod
                    of an inch in diameter, or of copper rod not less in diameter than fths of an
                    inch. Such rods of equal length have nearly the same conducting power, and
                    therefore would have equal amounts of heat developed in them by a given
                    discharge. But if such a discharge took place, the copper would be heated much
                    more than the iron, in consequence of its smaller mass per -foot (the specific
                    heat being approximately the same in the two materials). Hence iron is, in this
                    respect, preferable to copper, if the conducting powers of the rods are equal.
                    Another advantage possessed by the iron rod is that it is much less likely to be
                    wilfully damaged or stolen. Against this may be set the objections that it is
                    easily injured by rust, and is not nearly so flexible as the equivalent copper
                    rod. Conductors are now usually made of wire-rope, so that the question of
                    flexibility is no longer of serious importance; but when iron is used it should
                    always be protected by zinc, 7.e., be what is absurdly called “galvanized.” Many
                    fantastic forms of lightning rods were devised in consequence of the old
                    erroneous notion that their efficiency depended on their surface and not on
                    their cross section. In reality all conductors of equal length, and of the same
                    material, are equally efficient if their cross sections be equal.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some curious modifications of
                    this statement are introduced when we deal with magnetizable metals, but they
                    are unimportant in practice.</p></note> Thus, instead of stating the diameter of
                    a rod, we may speak of its weight per foot, and say that a copper conductor
                    should weigh at least about half a pound, and an iron one at least two pounds
                    and a half per foot,—provided the materials be of good conducting quality.</p>
                <p>The points need not be very sharp, but they ought to be protected by a coating of
                    platinum or other non-oxidizable metal. And they should be in a group of two or
                    three at the end of each branch of the rod, lest one of them should be fused and
                    impaired in efficiency by an accumulation of electricity so rapid as to make the
                    silent continuous discharge impossible. Joints should be avoided as far as
                    possible; where they are unavoidable they should be made, not by screws or
                    brazing, but by means of a large mass of solder completely enveloping the ends
                    to be connected.</p>
                <p>Another point to be carefully attended to is that all large metallic bodies, such
                    as lead or zinc roofing, metal tanks, &amp;c., should be in good conducting
                    connexion with the rod, so as to prevent discharges of electricity inside the
                    ship or building. In many buildings we see the lightning rods attached by means
                    of glass or porcelain insulators, such as are employed for telegraph wires. This
                    is a perfectly needless, expensive, and possibly dangerous practice.</p>
                <p>The literature of this subject is very extensive, as may be seen from Ronalds’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Works on Electricity.</hi> The reader may also
                    consult Anderson on <hi rend="italic">Lightning Conductors</hi> (1880), and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Report of the Lightning-Rod Conference</hi> (1882). In the
                    latter work will be found abstracts of many valuable papers, especially the
                    reports on lightning-rods made to the French Academy by some of its most
                    distinguished members, including Coulomb, Laplace, Poisson, Gay Lussac, Fresnel,
                    Pouillet, Cagniard de la Tour, Régnault, &amp;c. There will also be found hints
                    about some of the most ludicrous devices employed by men ignorant of the laws of
                    electrical phenomena. One of the most singular of these was theso-called
                    “Repeller.” A lightning-rod, in all respects sufficient, was wont to be capped
                    by a piece of glass like a thick soda-water bottle, invented upon its point. The
                    effect of this could only have been to prevent the possibility of the silent
                    discharge, to produce which is the proper function of the rod, and to make
                    probable a lightning flash, just as if the rod had been· terminated by a ball
                    instead of a point. One of these dangerous monuments of ignorance was removed
                    from a British lighthouse within the last ten years. In an Irish lighthouse,
                    which was recently examined after suffering serious damage, it was found that
                    the lower end of the lightning-rod was jumped into the solid rock—a truly
                    original form of “earth”!</p>
                <p>In 1876 Clerk Maxwell suggested to the British Association the idea (based on
                    Faraday’s experiments) of protecting a building from the effects of lightning by
                    surrounding it with a sort of cage of rods or stout wire. Here au “earth” would
                    not be absolutely required. The present writer had some months previously
                    suggested the same idea in a Report to the Board of Northern Lights. It is
                    possible, though not certain, that this form of defence might be useful against
                    globe-lightning, which undoubtedly occurs, and against which ordinary
                    lightning-rods would probably be of little use.</p>
                <p>These brief remarks contain all that is yet known to be necessary to the complete
                    solution of an important practical problem about which many treatises have been
                    written. (P. G. T.)</p>
