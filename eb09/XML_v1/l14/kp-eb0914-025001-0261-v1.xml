                <p><label type="entry">LANARK</label>, an inland county of Scotland, lies between
                    55° 15' and 55° 57' N. lat., and between 3° 20' and 4° 23' W. long., and is
                    bounded N. by Dumbarton and Stirling, E. by Stirling, Linlithgow, Midlothian,
                    and Peebles, S. by Dumfries, and W. by Ayr, Renfrew, and Dumbarton. Its greatest
                    length north-west to south-east is over 50 miles, and its greatest breadth from
                    east to west over 30 miles. The total area comprises 568,868 acres, or 888
                    square miles. Though only the twelfth as regards extent, it stands far above all
                    the other Scottish counties in point of population, having 904,405 inhabitants
                    in 1881, or only 18,909 less than the aggregate of the three counties that rank
                    next to it.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the county to the east and south, included in what is known
                    as the upper ward, consists of high moorlands frequently rising into lofty
                    rounded hills, in many cases more .than 2000 feet above sea-level, the highest
                    summits being Coulter Fell (2456) and Tinto (2350) in Carmichael parish, and
                    Green Louther (2403), Five Cairn Louther (2377), Queensberry Hill (2285),
                    Sergeant Law (2257), and several others in Crawford parish, which consists
                    chiefly of a cluster of mountains. The highest inhabited land in Scotland is at
                    Leadhills, a village in the southern extremity of the county, which is about
                    1300 feet above sea-level. The remainder of the county to the north-west of
                    Tinto softens down to gentle undulations, never rising to an elevation of more
                    than 700 feet, and gradually opening out into the fertile vale of Clyde.</p>
                <p>The principal river is the Clyde, which is formed of several streams rising among
                    the mountains that separate Lanark from Peebles and Dumfries near to the sources
                    of the Tweed and Annan, the chief of these streams being the Crook Burn,
                    Powtrail Water, and Elvan Water. Running almost north, the river is joined by
                    the Glengonner Burn, the Duneaton Water, and other streams; after receiving the
                    Medwyn near Carstairs it flows south-west, and then, on being joined by the
                    Douglas Water, it turns abruptly to the north-west—its general direction for the
                    rest of its course. At Bonnington, the first of the famous falls of Clyde, the
                    banks slope gently downwards, and are adorned with lofty trees and leafy
                    shrubbery. The river widens as it reaches the fall, and its course remains
                    uninterrupted until it suddenly descends a precipice 27 feet in height in a
                    broad and unbroken stream. From this point it rolls turbulently along between
                    lofty and precipitous banks of sandstone rocks beautified with wood until it
                    reaches the magnificent fall of Corra, where it rushes over a precipice 85 feet
                    in height into the deep abyss of the linn. Through a deep ravine it reaches a
                    small fall called Dundaff Linn, and after passing a singular piece of rock
                    called “Wallace’s Chair,” skirts New Lanark and the county town of Lanark.
                    Shortly afterwards it receives the Mouse, which, dashing and foaming from the
                    split rocks of Cartland Crags, adds to the volume of the stream and contributes
                    at the precipice of Stonebyres to form the fourth fall of Clyde. Near the ruins
                    of Craignethan Castle it receives the Nethan, and a little further on the Avon,
                    and then sweeps through the richly wooded haughs of Hamilton past Bothwell to
                    Glasgow, where it becomes navigable. The lochs are few and small, the principal
                    being Bishop Loch between the parishes of Cadderand Old Monkland, Black Loch in
                    New Monkland, and Johnston Loch in Cadder. The Hillend reservoir for supplying
                    the Forth and Clyde and the Monkland Canals has an area of 307 acres. The Forth
                    and Clyde Canal traverses the north-west corner of the county; the Monkland
                    Canal connects Glasgow with the southern extremity of Old Monkland parish; and
                    the Ardrossan Canal passes by Govan to Renfrew and Ayr.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Minerals.—</hi> Lanarkshire is nearly wholly
                    occupied by the Carboniferous strata forming the coal-field of the Clyde basin.
                    This is almost entirely confined to the county, but portions of it extend into
                    Dumbartonshire, Renfrewshire, and Stirlingshire. The formation rests on traps
                    and ashes associated with the Lower Calciferous Sandstones, which towards the
                    east separate the coal-field from that of the Lothians, and in the west from
                    that of Ayr. The middle portion of the formation, which contains the best
                    coal-seams with blackband and other ironstones, is without limestone, and
                    apparently of freshwater origin, although a bed of marine fossils has been
                    detected in the series near Glasgow. Towards the border on all sides a lower
                    marine series with encrinal and coralline limestones crops out. It also contains
                    many valuable coal-seams and veins of ironstone, and, while affording a great
                    variety of marine fossils, possesses a few interpolated beds of estuarine or
                    freshwater origin. The line of junction between this lower series and the Old
                    Red Sandstone occurs in the vicinity of the Falls of Clyde, Lanark, and
                    Carstairs. Besides the older trap rocks, which bound the field to the east and
                    west, others, probably of the same age as the Upper Carboniferous series, rise
                    through and disturb the strata of the interior in many places; and numerous
                    basaltic dykes, which, however, are generally unconnected with faults in the
                    strata, extend through the area of the coal-field in an easterly direction.
                    These, like the other erupted masses, usually alter the strata with which they
                    come into contact, converting coal into coke and clay into jasper, and highly
                    indurating the shales and sandstones. The isolated coal-field of Lesmahagow,
                    about 7 miles square, is nearly surrounded by Old Red Sandstones, upon which
                    also the coal rests.</p>
                <p>The amount of coal available in the Lanark coal-field is estimated at
                    2,044,090,216 tons, slightly less than that in the Midlothian coalfield, and
                    less than a fourth of that available in Scotland. The mines lie scattered over a
                    considerable area, but the principal coalpits are in the districts between
                    Glasgow, Hamilton, and Airdrie. The coal-field is perhaps best developed in the
                    neighbourhood of Hamilton, the seam being rich and easily reached; and the
                    famous Wishaw “ell coal” is there found in its best state. There is a valuable
                    seam of gas coal at Lesmahagow; this is also frequently associated with
                    blackband ironstone. The number of shafts or pits from which minerals were
                    raised in 1880 was 452, and connected with these 25,882 persons were employed
                    underground and 5355 on the surface. The gross amount of minerals raised was
                    11,071,054 tons, nearly one-half of the whole amount raised in Scotland. The
                    total amount of coals raised was 10,026,999 tons, of ironstone 757,291, of
                    fireclay 195,419, of oil shale 28,830, of limestone 59,419, of lead ore 1801,
                    and of gannister 1295. The lead-mines are at Leadhills in the parish of
                    Crawford. From the ore silver to the extent of 6 to 12 oz. to the ton is
                    obtained. Copper-ore is found in the mines, and also antimony, but the quantity
                    does not repay the cost of mining. The gold-mines are said to have been
                    discovered in the reign of James IV., and it is stated that in 1542 as many as
                    300 persons were employed in connexion with the industry, and that upwards of
                    £100,000 sterling value was collected. The gold-field extends over an area of 25
                    miles by 12, but it is only in the neighbourhood of the lead-mines that gold is
                    found in considerable quantity. It does not, however, repay the labour of search
                    and washing. Freestone and sandstone are abundant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The upper ward of Lanarkshire consists
                    principally of moorland, even where the land is not too elevated to admit of
                    successful tillage. The climate of this district is variable, and the rainfall
                    considerable. Wheat is grown in the lower valleys, but the cereals best adapted
                    for those portions of the district where grain is cultivated are oats and
                    barley. In the higher grounds potatoes and Scotch kail are almost the only
                    vegetables grown. Some <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0264-0251"/> portions of this district, on the borders of the
                    Clyde, are however, very fruitful. The feeding of cattle and dairy and sheep
                    farming are largely followed. Generally twenty-five to thirty cows are kept, but
                    on some farms most attention is directed to the rearing of cattle or sheep.
                    Several large sheep farms are occasionally held by one tenant. In the middle
                    ward the land is generally strong clay, with the exception of the alluvial
                    deposits on the banks of the Clyde. A large portion of it is occupied by peat,
                    and the presence of coal-pits has in many instances deteriorated the soil. In
                    this district oats and barley are the principal crop. The banks of the Clyde
                    have been occupied with orchards since the days of the Venerable Bede. Apples,
                    pears, and plutos are largely grown, but of late years more attention has been
                    paid to gooseberries, currants, and strawberries. The district of the lower ward
                    is much exposed to westerly breezes, but though humid is warm, severe frosts
                    being seldom of long duration. It is very highly cultivated, its proximity to
                    Glasgow having greatly stimulated improvements.</p>

                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1881 the total area under crops was
                    247,777 acres, a percentage of 43'5, the percentage in 1870 being 41'8. The area

                    four-fifths of the area was under oats, which in 1881 occupied 44,982 acres,
                    while only 3790 were under wheat, 1408 beans, and 682 barley. Potatoes were

                <p>The total number of horses in 1881 was 7755, of which 5611 are stated to be used
                    solely for purposes of agriculture, and 2144 to be unbroken horses and mares
                    kept for breeding purposes. The celebrated Clydesdale draught horses are
                    supposed to have been bred from Flanders horses, imported in the 17th century by
                    one of the dukes of Hamilton. The number of cows in 1881 was 33,730, of other
                    cattle two years of age and above 10,989, and under two years of age 19,557. The

                    Glasgow is included within its limits, the increase of the population since the
                    beginning of the century has been very great. From 147,692 in 1801 it had
                    increased in 1831 to 316,819, in 1851 to 530,169, in 1871 to 765,339, and in
                    1881 to 904,405, of whom 449,192 were males and 455,213 females. The county
                    includes the greater part of the parliamentary burgh of Glasgow (population in
                    1881,487,948), and the parliamentary burghs of Airdrie (13,363), Hamilton
                    (13,997), Lanark (4908), and Rutherglen (11,265). Glasgow, Lanark, and
                    Rutherglen are also royal burghs, and in addition to Airdrie and Hamilton the
                    police burghs are Biggar (1556) in the upper ward; Wishaw (13,112) and
                    Motherwell (12,911) in the middle ward; and Govan (49,448), Hillhead (6683),
                    Maryhill (12,916), Partick (27,396), and Govanhill (9634) in the lower ward
                    immediately adjoining Glasgow. The other towns are Bailieston, Bellshill, part
                    of Busby, Calderbank, Cambuslang, Carluke, Coatbridge (population 18,425),
                    Holytown, Larkha∏, Lesmahagow, Newmains, Shettleston, Stonehouse, Strathaven,
                    and Whifflet. There are also over seventy villages, the majority numbering over
                    500 inhabitants, and very many over 1000.</p>
                <p>Administration.—The county comprises forty-nine parishes and two parts of
                    parishes. For purposes of county taxation it is divided into an upper, a middle,
                    and a lower ward, and the middle ward has also been lately divided into two
                    districts for police purposes. The coünty is represented in parliament by two
                    members, one for the northern division and one for the southern division.<note

                    The city of Glasgow returns three members, while Lanark, Hamilton, and Airdrie
                    are included in the Falkirk district of burghs, and Rutherglen in the Kilmarnock
                    district. A sheriff ordinary court is held at Glasgow, and sheriff courts are
                    held at Lanark, Airdrie, and Hamilton.</p>
                <p>History and Antiquities.—Lanarkshire at an early period was inhabited by a Celtic
                    tribe, the Damnii, whose territory was divided by the Roman wall of Antonine
                    between the Forth and Clyde, but none of whom were ever fully subdued by the
                    Romans. Traces of these early inhabitants are still to be seen in remains of
                    fortifications, mounds, and circles; and numerous stone axes, bronze celts,
                    hand-mills, and urns belonging to the same period have also been dug up. Two
                    Roman roads entered the county from Dumfriesshire, and after their junction near
                    Crawford proceeded by Biggar, Carstairs, and Carluke, being joined at several
                    points by others. Along the route of the roads there are many traces of camps
                    and fortifications, and coins and other relics are frequently found. After the
                    departure of the Romans, a district of country which included Lanarkshire was
                    united into the kingdom of Strathclyde, which in the 7th century was subdued by
                    the Saxons of Northumberland, large numbers, however, of the Celtic population
                    migrating to AVales. Formerly Lanarkshire included a portion of Renfrew, but
                    this was disjoined in the time of Robert III. Lanark at the same time was
                    divided into two wards, the over and the nether, with Lanark and Rutherglen as
                    the chief towns in each ward. The division into three wards—upper, middle, and
                    lower— took place in the last century. Among the more important events of later
                    history connected with the county are the battles of Drumclog in the parish of
                    Avondale, 1st June 1679, in which the Covenanters defeated Graham of
                    Claverhouse, and of Bothwell Bridge at Bothwell near Hamilton on the 22d June of
                    the same year, in which the Covenanters were defeated by the duke of Monmouth
                    with great slaughter. The principal buildings of interest besides those noticed
                    in the separate articles on particular towns, are the ruins of Blantyre Priory,
                    the remains of the ancient Douglas Castle, Craignethan Castle (the Tullietudlem
                    of Sir Walter Scott, where Mary Queen of Scots found refuge after her esoape
                    from Lochleven), and Bothwell Castle. See Irving’s History of the Upper Ward of
                    Lanarkshire, 3 vols., 1864.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lanark,</hi> a royal and parliamentary burgh, the chief town
                    of the above county, is situated on a slight eminence near the Clyde, 32 miles
                    south-west of Edinburgh, and 25 south-east of Glasgow. It consists principally
                    of one main street, which is spacious and well-paved. The industries are
                    hand-loom weaving and nail making. In the neighbourhood there are extensive
                    oil-works. The county buildings, in the Grecian style, were erected in 1836, and
                    the assembly-rooms, erected in 1827, occupy the site of an old Franciscan
                    monastery. The population of the town in 1871 was 5099, and in 1881 it was
                    4908.</p>
                <p>A parliament was held by Kenneth III. at Lanark in 978, and occasionally it was
                    the residence of the Scottish kings. Its charter is said to have been bestowed
                    by Alexander I. It was more than once the scene of the exploits of William
                    Wallace. New Lanark, a manufacturing village situated on the Clyde about a mile
                    distant, is famous from its connexion with the communistic projects of Robert
                    Owen.</p>
