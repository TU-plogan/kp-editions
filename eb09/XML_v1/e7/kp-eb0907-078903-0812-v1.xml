                <p><label type="entry">EIDER</label> (Icelandic, <hi rend="italic">Aeejur),</hi> a
                    large marine Duck, the <hi rend="italic">Somateria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mollissima</hi> of ornithologists, famous for its down, which, from its extreme
                    lightness and elasticity, is in great request for filling bed-coverlets. This
                    bird generally frequents low rocky islets near the coast, and in Iceland and
                    Norway has long been afforded every encouragement and protection, a fine being
                    inflicted for killing it during the breeding-season, or even for firing a gun
                    near its haunts, while artificial nesting-places are in many localities
                    contrived for its further accommodation. From the care thus taken of it in those
                    countries it has become exceedingly tame at its chief resorts, which are
                    strictly regarded as property, and the taking of eggs or down from them, except
                    by authorized persons, is severely punished by law. In appearance the Eider is
                    somewhat clumsy, though it flies fast and dives admirably. The female is of a
                    dark reddish-brown colour barred with brownish-black. The adult male in spring
                    is conspicuous by his pied plumage of sable beneath, and creamy-white above: a
                    patch of shining sea. green on his head is only seen on close inspection. This
                    plumage he is considered not to acquire until his third year, being when young
                    almost exactly like the female, and it is certain that the birds which have not
                    attained their full dress remain in flocks by themselves without going to the
                    breeding-stations. The nest is generally in some convenient corner among large
                    stones, hollowed in the soil, and furnished with a few bits of dry grass,
                    seaweed, or heather. By the time that the full number of eggs (which rarely if
                    ever exceeds five) is laid the down is added. Generally the eggs and down are
                    taken at intervals of a few days by the owners of the “Eider-fold,” and the
                    birds are thus kept depositing both during the whole season; but some experience
                    is needed to insure the greatest profit from each commodity. Every Duck is
                    ultimately allowed to hatch an egg or two to keep up the stock, and the down of
                    the last nest is gathered after the birds have left the spot. The story of the
                    Drake’s furnishing down, after the Duck’s supply is exhausted, is a fiction. He
                    never goes near the nest. The eggs have a strong flavour, but are much relished

                    the Eider breeds in suitable localities from Spitsbergen to the Farn Islands off
                    the coast of Northumberland—where it is known as St Cuthbert’s Duck. Its food
                    consists of marine animals (mollusks and crustaceans), and hence the young are
                    not easily reared in captivity. The Eider of the New World differs somewhat from
                    our own, and has been described as a distinct species (&lt;S'. <hi rend="italic"
                    >dresseri).</hi> Though much diminished in numbers by persecution, it is still
                    abundant on the coast of Newfoundland and thence northward. In Greenland also,
                    Eiders are very plentiful, and it is supposed that three-fourths of the supply
                    of down sent to Copenhagen comes from that country. The limits of the Eider’s
                    northern range are not known, but the late Arctic Expedition does not seem to
                    have met with it after leaving the Danish settlements, and its place is taken by
                    an allied species, the King-Duck (N. <hi rend="italic">spectabilis),</hi> a very
                    beautiful bird which sometimes appears on the British coast. The female greatly
                    resembles that of the Eider, but the male has a black chevron on his chin and a
                    bright orange prominence on his forehead, which last seems to have given the
                    species its English name. On the west coast of North America the Eider is
                    represented by a species (N. <hi rend="italic">v-nigrum)</hi> with a like
                    chevron, but otherwise resembling the Atlantic bird. In the same waters two
                    other fine species are also found (N. <hi rend="italic">fischem</hi> and N. <hi
                    rend="italic">stelleri),</hi> one of which (the latter) also inhabits the Arctic
                    coast of Russia and East Finmark aud has twice reached England. The Labrador
                    Duck (N. <hi rend="italic">labradoria),</hi> which is now believed tobe extinct
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 735), also belongs to this
                    group. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
