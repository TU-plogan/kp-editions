                <p><label type="entry">EFFIGIES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Monumental</hi></label>. —In
                    the course of the twelfth century the idea appears, for the first time, to have
                    been carried into effect that the figure of a deceased personage should be
                    represented by effigy upon his monumental memorial. These earliest attempts at
                    commemorative portraiture were executed in low relief upon coffin-lids of stone
                    or purbeck marble, some portions of the designs for the most part being executed
                    by means of incised lines, cut upon the raised figure. Gradually, with the
                    increased size and the greater architectural dignity of monumental structures,
                    effigies attained to a high rank as works of art, so that before the close of
                    the 13th century, very noble examples of figures of this order are found to have
                    been executed in full relief; and, about the same period, similar figures also
                    began to be engraved, either upon monumental slabs of stone or marble, or upon
                    plates of metal, which were affixed to the surfaces of slabs that were laid in
                    the pavements of churches. Engraven plates of this class, known as “Brasses,”
                    continued in favour until the era of the Reformation, and in our own times their
                    use has been revived. It seems probable that the introduction and the prevalence
                    of flat engraven memorials, in place of commemorative effigies in relief, were
                    due, in the first instance, to the inconvenience and obstruction resulting from
                    increasing numbers of raised stones on the pavement of churches; while the
                    comparatively small cost of engraven plates, their high artistic capabilities,
                    and their durability combined to secure for them the popularity they
                    unquestionably enjoyed. It will be kept in remembrance that, if considerably
                    less numerous than contemporary incised slabs and engraven brasses, effigies
                    sculptured in relief, and with some exceptions in full relief, continued for
                    centuries to constitute the most important features in more than a few mediaeval
                    monuments. In the 13th century, it must be added, their origin being apparently
                    derived from the endeavour to combine a monumental effigy with a monumental
                    cross upon the same sepulchral stone, parts only of the human figure sometimes
                    were represented, whether in sculpture or by incised lines, as the head or bust,
                    and occasionally also the feet; in some of the early examples of this curious
                    class the cross symbol is not introduced, and after a while half-length figures
                    became common.</p>
                <p>Except inveryrare instances,that most important element which may be
                    distinguished as genuine face-portraiture is not to be looked for, in even the
                    finest sculptured effigies, earlier than about the middle of the 15th century.
                    In works of the highest order of art, indeed, the memorials of personages of the
                    most exalted rank, from an early period in their existence effigies may be
                    considered occasionally to have been portraits properly so called; and yet even
                    in such works as these an approximately correct general resemblance but too
                    frequently appears to have been all that was contemplated or desired. At the
                    same time, from the first, in these monumental effigies we possess contemporary
                    examples of vestments, costume,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is well-known that the costume of effigies, almost as a
                    rule, represented what was actually worn by the remains of the person
                    commemorated, when prepared for interment and when lying in state; and, in like
                    manner, the aspect of the lifeless countenance, even if not designedly
                    reproduced by mediaeval “image” makers, may long have exercised a powerful
                    influence upon their ideas of consistent monumental υortraiture.</p></note>
                    armour, weapons, royal and knightly insignia, and other personal appointments
                    and accessories, in all of which accurate fidelity has been certainly observed
                    with scrupulous care and minute exactness. Thus, since the monumental effigies
                    of England are second to none in artistic merit, while they have been preserved
                    in far greater numbers, and generally in better condition than in other
                    countries, we may claim to possess in unbroken continuity an unrivalled series
                    of original personal representations of the successive generations of our
                    predecessors, very many of them being, in the most significant acceptation of
                    that term, veritable contemporaneous portraits.</p>
                <p>Till recently esteemed to be simply objects of antiquarian curiosity, and at no
                    distant period either altogether disregarded or too often subjected to injurious
                    indignity, the monumental effigies of England still await the formation of a
                    just estimate of their true character and their consequent worth in their
                    capacity as authorities for face-portraiture. In the original contract for the
                    construction of the monument at Warwick to Richard Beauchamp, the fifth earl,
                    who died in the year 1439, it is provided that an effigy of the deceased noble
                    should be executed in gilt bronze, with all possible care, by the most skilful
                    and experienced artists of the time; and the details of the armour and the
                    ornaments of the figure are specified with minute particularity and precision.
                    It is remarkable, however, that the effigy itself is described only in the
                    general and decidedly indefinite terms— “an image of a man armed.” There is no
                    provision that the effigy should even be “an image” of the earl; and much less
                    is there a single word said as to its being such a “counterfeit presentment” of
                    the features and person of the living man, as the contemporaries of Shakespeare
                    had learned to expect in what they would accept as true portraiture. The effigy,
                    almost as perfect as when it left the sculptor’s hands, still bears witness, as
                    well to the conscientious care with which the conditions of the contract were
                    fulfilled, as to the eminent ability of the artists employed. So complete is the
                    representation of the armour, that this effigy might be considered actually to
                    have been equipped in the earl ’ 3 own favourite suit of the finest Milan steel.
                    The cast of the figure also evidently was studied from what the earl had been
                    when in life, and the countenance is sufficiently marked and endowed with the
                    unmistakable attributes of personal character. Possibly such a resemblance may
                    have been the highest aim in the image-making of the period, somewhat before the
                    middle of the 15th century. Three-quarters of a century later, a decided step
                    further in advance towards the requirement of fidelity in true portraiture is
                    shewn to have been taken, when, in his will (1510 A.D.), Henry VII. spoke of the
                    effigies of himself and of his late queen, Elizabeth of York, to be executed for
                    their monument, as “an image of our figure and another of hers.” The existing
                    effigies in the Beauchamp chapel and in Henry VII.’s chapel, with the passages
                    just quoted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n716/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0716-0695"/> from the will of the Tudor king and from the
                    contract made by the executors of the Lancastrian earl, with remarkable
                    significance illustrate the gradual development of the idea of true personal
                    portraiture in monumental effigies, during the course of the 15th and at the
                    commencement of the 16th century in England. A glance upwards naturally first
                    rests on the royal effigies still preserved in this country, which commence in
                    Worcester Cathedral with King John. This earliest example of a series of
                    effigies of which the historical value has never yet been duly appreciated is
                    rude as a work of art, and yet there is on it the impress of such individuality
                    as demonstrates that the sculptor did bis best to represent the king. Singularly
                    fine as achievements of the art of the sculptor are the effigies of Henry III.,
                    Queen Alianore of Castile, and her ill-fated son Edward IL, the two former in
                    Westminster Abbey, the last in Gloucester Cathedral; and of their fidelity also
                    as portraits no doubt can be entertained. In like manner, the effigies of Edward
                    III. and his queen Philippa, and those of their grandson Richard II. and his
                    first consort, Aune of Bohemia (all at Westminster), and of their other
                    grandson, the Lancastrian Henry, whose greater might made his better right to
                    Richard’s throne, with his second consort, Joan of Navarre, at Canterbury— these
                    all speak for themselves that they are true portraits. Next follow the effigies
                    of Henry VII. and Elizabeth of York,—to be succeeded, and the royal series to be
                    completed, by the effigies of Queen Elizabeth and the hapless Mary Stuart, all
                    of them in Westminster Abbey. Very instructive would be a close comparison
                    between the two last-named works and the painted portraits of the rival queens,
                    especially in the case of Mary, whose pictures differ so remarkably from one
                    another.</p>
                <p>As the 15th century advanced, the rank of the personage represented and the
                    character of the art that distinguishes any effigy will go far to determine its
                    portrait qualities. Still later, when more exact face-portraiture had become a
                    recognized element, sculptors must be supposed to have aimed at the production
                    of such similitude as their art would enable them to give to their works; and
                    accordingly, when we compare effigies with painted portraits of the same
                    personages, we find that they corroborate one another. The prevalence of
                    portraiture in the effigies of the 1Gth and 17th centuries, when their art
                    generally underwent a palpable decline, by no means raises all works of this
                    class, or indeed the majority of them, to the dignity of true portraits; on the
                    contrary, in these effigies, as in those of earlier periods, it is the character
                    of the art in each particular example that will go far to determine its merit,
                    value, and authority as a portrait. In judging of these latter effigies,
                    however, they must be estimated by the standard of art of their own era; and, as
                    a general rule, the effigies that are the best as works of art in their own
                    class are the best also and the most faithful in their portraiture. The earlier
                    effigies, evidently produced in the great majority of instances without any
                    express aim at exact portraiture, as we now employ that expression, have
                    nevertheless strong claims upon our veneration. Often their sculpture is very
                    noble; and even when they are rudest as works of art, there rarely fails to be a
                    rough grandeur about them, as exhibited in the fine bold figure of Fair
                    Rosamond’s son, Earl William of the Long Sword, which reposes in such dignified
                    serenity in his own cathedral at Salisbury. These effigies may not bring us
                    closely face to face with the more remote generations of our ancestors, but they
                    do place before us true images of what the men and women of those generations
                    were.</p>
                <p>Observant students of monumental effigies assuredly will not fail to appreciate
                    the singular felicity with which the mediaeval sculptors adjusted their
                    compositions to the recumbent position in which their ’ '* images” necessarily
                    had to be placed. Equally worthy of regard is the manner in which not a few
                    monumental effigies, and particularly those of comparatively early date, are
                    found to have assumed an aspect neither living nor lifeless, and yet
                    impressively life-like. The sound judgment also, and the good taste of those
                    early sculptors, were signally exemplified in their excluding, almost without an
                    exception, the more extravagant fashions in the costume of their era from their
                    monumental sculpture, and introducing only the simpler but not less
                    characteristic styles of dress and appointments. In all representations of
                    monumental effigies, it must be kept in remembrance that they represent
                    recumbent figures, and that the accessories of the effigies themselves have been
                    adjusted to that position. With rare exceptions, when they appear resting on one
                    side, these effigies lie on their backs, and as a general rule (except in the
                    case of episcopal figures represented in the act of benediction, or of princes
                    and warriors who sometimes hold a sceptre or a sword) their hands are uplifted
                    aud conjoined as in supplication. The crossed-legged attitude of numerous armed
                    effigies of the era of mail-armour has been supposed to imply the personages so
                    represented to have been crusaders or Knights of the Temple; but in either case
                    the supposition is unfounded, and inconsistent with unquestionable facts. Much
                    beautiful feeling is conveyed by figures of ministering angels being introduced
                    as in the act of supporting and smoothing the pillows or cushions that are
                    placed, in very many instances to give support to the heads of the recumbent
                    effigies. The animals at the feet of these effigies, which frequently have an
                    heraldic significance, enabled the sculptors, with equal propriety and
                    effectiveness, to overcome one of the special difficulties inseparable from the
                    recumbent position. In conclusion, it remains only to remark upon the masterly
                    treatment of outline composition which so honourably distinguishes the earlier
                    examples of the engraven effigies in monumental brasses. (c. B.)</p>
