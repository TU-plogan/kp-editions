                    (1649-1707), one of the greatest copper-plate engravers, was born at Antwerp in
                    1649. The rudiments of the art, which he was to carry to a higher pitch of
                    excellence than it had previously reached, he acquired in his native town under
                    the engraver Cornelisz Galle. But he was not long in reaching the limits of his
                    master’s attainments; and then he went to Paris to improve himself under the
                    teaching of De Poilly. This master likewise had soon done all he could to help
                    him onwards, and Edelinck ultimately took the first rank among line engravers.
                    His excellence was generally acknowledged; and having become known to Louis XIV.
                    he was appointed, on the recommendation of Le Brun, teacher at the academy
                    established at the Gobelins for the training of workers in tapestry. He was also
                    entrusted with the execution of several important works. In 1677 he was admitted
                    member of the Paris Academy of Painting and Sculpture. The work of this great
                    engraver constitutes an epoch in the art. His prints number more than four
                    hundred, and it is asserted that amongst them there is no work of poor or
                    middling quality, although many of his subjects were poor and unworthy of the
                    high art which he lavished upon them. Edelinck stands above and apart from his
                    predecessors and contemporaries especially in this that he excelled, not in some
                    one respect, but in all respects,—that while one engraver attained excellence in
                    correct form, and another in rendering light and shade, and others in giving
                    colour to their prints and the texture of surfaces, he, as supreme master of the
                    burin, possessed and displayed all these separate qualities, and that in so
                    complete a harmony that the eye is not attracted by any one of them in
                    particular, but rests in the satisfying whole. Edelinck was the first to break
                    through the custom of making prints square, and to execute them in the lozenge
                    shape. Among his most famous works are a Holy Family, after Raphael; a Penitent
                    Magdalene, after Charles le Brun; Alexander at the Tent of Darius, after Le
                    Brun; a Combat of Four Knights, after Leonardo da Vinci; Christ surrounded with
                    Angels; St Louis praying; and St Charles Borromeo before a crucifix,— the last
                    three after Le Brun. Edelinck was especially good as an engraver of portraits,
                    and executed prints of many of the most eminent persons of his time. Among these
                    are those of Le Brun, Rigaud, Philippe de Champagne (which the engraver thought
                    his best), Santeuil, La Fontaine, Colbert, John Dryden, Descartes, &amp;c. He
                    died at Paris in 1707. His younger brother John, and his son Nicholas, were also
                    engravers, but did not attain to his excellence.</p>
