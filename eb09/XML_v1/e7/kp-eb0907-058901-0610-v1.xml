                    Eadmerus, and by mistake Edimerus and Edinerus), an English ecclesiastic and
                    historian of the Norman period, probably, as his name suggests, of English as
                    opposed to Norman parentage. At an early age he was sent to the Benedictine
                    monastery at Canterbury; and there he became acquainted with Anselm, at the time
                    of the latter’s first visit to England as abbot of Bee. The intimacy was renewed
                    when Anselm was raised to the episcopal see; and thenceforward Eadmer was not so
                    much the archbishop’s disciple and follower as his friend and director, and that
                    at last not only by Anselm’s private recognition, but by the formal appointment
                    of Pope Urban II. So complete, indeed, was the obedience shown by the great
                    scholastic philosopher and head of the English Church to his self-elected tutor,
                    that—according to William of Malmesbury, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gestis pontificum</hi><hi rend="italic">Aηglorum,</hi> lib. i.—he
                    is said to have waited for his express permission before he rose from his bed,
                    or even turned from one side to the other. After Anselm’s death Eadmer
                    accompanied Radulph, the new archbishop, to Rome in 1119; and on their return in
                    1120 he was nominated to the see of St Andrews in Scotland. Owing, however, to
                    the refusal of the Scotch to recognize the claims put forward by Eadmer and his
                    patron in support of the episcopal authority of the see of Canterbury, he was
                    never formally inducted into the office. He was at Canterbury in 1121, and he
                    spent the latter part of his life as prior of the monastery there. His death is
                    variously assigned to the year 1123 and 1137.</p>
                <p>Eadmer has left a large number of works, of which a list is given in Wharton’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Anglia Sacra,</hi> part ii. Most important are his <hi
                    rend="italic">Ηistoriοe</hi><hi rend="italic">Novorum,</hi> in six books
                    treating of his own times down to the death of Radulph in 1122, and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Vita Anselmi,</hi> which ranks as one of the chief authorities in
                    regard to the primate. The former was first published by Selden in 1623, the
                    latter at Antwerp in 1551; and both have since been several times reprinted. Of
                    less mark are his lives of Odo, Bregwin, and Dunstan, and of Oswald and Wilfrid
                    of York, and his treatises—formerly ascribed to Anselm— <hi rend="italic">De
                    quatuor</hi><hi rend="italic">virtutibus</hi><hi rend="italic">qnae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fuerunt</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >beata</hi><hi rend="italic">Maria rnrgine,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Similitudinibus S. Anselmi.</hi> Nearly all his works
                    are to be found in an early MS. in the library of Corpus Christi College,
                    Cambridge (C.C.C.C., No 371), and most of them have been reprinted as an
                    appendix to Anselm’s <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi> by Gerberon, fol. 1675, and by
                    the Benedictine monks of St Maure, fol. Paris, 1721. A number of his letters are
                    preserved in MSS. Cotton., Otho, A. xii.</p>
