                    (1703-1758), the most distinguished metaphysician and divine of America, was the
                    son of the Rev. Timothy Edwards, and of Esther, daughter of the Rev. Solomon
                    Stoddard, of Northampton, and was born at <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0710-0689"/> East Windsor, Connecticut, October 5, 1703. He
                    was the only son in a family of eleven children, of whom four were older than
                    himself. Even in his very early years the religious instruction communicated to
                    him by his parents seems to have engaged a large share of his interest, and to
                    have exercised a strong influence on his character. In a statement of his
                    religious views in youth, he says, “I had a variety of concerns and exercises
                    about my soul from my childhood,” and also, “from my childhood up my mind had
                    been full of objections against the doctrine of God’s sovereignty” In his eighth
                    or ninth year he experienced, he tells us, “two remarkable seasons of awakening
                    ;” but these objections against the doctrine of God’s sovereignty continued to
                    trouble him more or less until about his 17th year, “when,” he says, “I seemed
                    to be convinced and fully satisfied as to this sovereignty of God, and his
                    justice in thus eternally disposing of men, according to his sovereign pleasure,
                    but never could give an account how or by what means I was convinced, nor in the
                    least imagined at the time, nor a long time after, that there was any
                    extraordinary influence of God’s Spirit in it.” Until he entered college his
                    education was conducted by his father, with the occasional assistance of his
                    elder sisters. At the age of six he began the study of Latin, and in that
                    language, as well as in Greek and Hebrew, he attained to considerable
                    proficiency. In September 1716 he entered Yale College. He took his B. A. degree
                    in 1720, but with a view to preparation for the ministry he continued his
                    residence at college for two additional years. In 1718 he read Locke on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Human Understanding,</hi> and it was from its perusal that his
                    intense passion for abstract thought was first kindled. He declared that it had
                    afforded him “far higher pleasure than the most greedy miser finds when
                    gathering up handfuls of silver and gold from some newly discovered treasure.”
                    He received licence to preach in 1722, and in August of that year, on the
                    invitation of a number of ministers in New England, he went to preach to the
                    Presbyterians in New York, where he continued eight months. He was invited by
                    the congregation to continue with them permanently, but on account of doubts as
                    to his future usefulness in that particular sphere, he declined their
                    invitation, and returned to his father’s house at East Windsor. Here he
                    prosecuted his studies in theology and metaphysics till June 1724, when he was
                    appointed tutor in Yale College. About this time he completed the series of
                    seventy resolutions begun during his preparation for the ministry, and designed
                    to “regulate his own heart and life.” No. 11 of these may be mentioned as
                    specially characteristic:—“Resolved, when I think of any theorem in divinity to
                    be solved, immediately to do what I can towards solving it, if circumstances do
                    not hinder.” He resigned his tutorship in September 1726, on receiving an
                    invitation from Northampton to become colleague and successor to his
                    grandfather, the Rev. Samuel Stoddard, and in February 1727 he was ordained to
                    that office. In the following July he was married to Sarah, daughter of the Rev.
                    James Pierrepont, of New Haven. He continued at Northampton till June 22, 1750,
                    when, on account of a dispute that had arisen from an attempt on his part to
                    prohibit some of the younger members of his congregation from perusing certain
                    books, which in his opinion were obscene, he found himself compelled to resign
                    his charge. On learning of his resignation some of his friends in Scotland
                    advised him to settle in that country, and he was also invited to a church in
                    Virginia, but he accepted in preference to either invitation the proposals made
                    to him by the “Society in London for Propagating the Gospel in New England,”
                    that he should become missionary to the Housatonnuck Indians, who were settled
                    at Stockbridge, Berkshire Co., Massachusetts. The nature of his work now left
                    him in possession of considerable leisure, of which he made use to such
                    advantage that, within the six years of his residence at Stockbridge, he
                    completed four of his principal treatises, including that on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Freedom of the Will,</hi> which was published in 1754. On account
                    of the fame which this work acquired for him he was in 1757 called to succeed
                    President Burr of Princeton College, New Jersey. He was installed February 16,
                    1758, but was scarcely spared to enter upon the performance of his duties. On
                    account of the prevalence of small-pox in the neighbourhood, he submitted to
                    inoculation and the disease taking an unfavourable turn, he died on the 28th
                    March. Edwards says of himself that he possessed “a constitution in many
                    respects peculiarly unhappy, attended with flaccid solids, vapid, sizy, and
                    scarce fluids, and a low tide of spirits, often occasioning a kind of childish
                    weakness and contemptibleness of speech, presence, and demeanour.”
                    Notwithstanding this unhappy constitution, he was throughout life a laborious
                    student, often prosecuting, pen in hand, his arduous metaphysical researches for
                    thirteen hours daily. As an orator he sometimes held not only the feelings but
                    the intellects of his hearers completely under his sway. The extraordinary
                    influence which he thus exercised was not due to any personal advantages, for
                    even when his oratory was most effective the “contemptibleness of his speech and
                    demeanour” still remained, although it was no longer felt by his hearers, nor to
                    any special excellences of style, for though his language conveyed his meaning
                    without ambiguity, it did so not only without any of that peculiar felicity of
                    arrangement which is usually one of the chief elements of successful oratory,
                    but in a bald, even in a lumbering and awkward, manner. His eloquence was simply
                    intense moral earnestness, expressed in the form of what, in more senses than
                    one, might be called “merciless logic.”</p>
                <p>His writings present a very remarkable conjunction of apparently contradictory
                    qualities, a conjunction attributable partly to a peculiar combination of
                    natural mental characteristics, and partly to a habit of solitariness which
                    rendered him almost completely ignorant of the dominant tendencies of
                    contemporary thought, and placed him almost beyond the reach of any external
                    influences fitted to aid him in freeing himself from the shackles of past
                    systems. The outstanding features of his character were undoubtedly his sense of
                    reverence and his passion for ratiocination. In one respect these two opposite
                    characteristics combined to produce a harmonious result, namely, to impress him
                    with an almost overwhelming conviction of the claims of duty. His awe of the
                    Supreme Power was in one aspect of such a nature as to seem consistent only with
                    the grossest superstition, but from the very fact that it was the awe of an
                    intellect, within the sphere of logic, so keen and penetrating, it was
                    necessarily a moral awe, an awe which intensified that sense of duty whose
                    requirements his logical faculty revealed with a distinctness which admitted of
                    no fallacy or evasion. It was his overwhelming conviction of duty which gave to
                    his system, theological, moral, and metaphysical, what unity it possesses. That
                    unity is, however, nothing more than seeming; the positive and negative elements
                    are held apart in different spheres; if they were brought into contact the
                    necessary result would be an utterly destructive explosion. The basis of his
                    whole system is the “sovereignty of God ;” and of his conviction of God’s
                    “sovereignty” he tells us that of how or by what means he arrived at it he could
                    give no account. This mysterious and unaccountable conviction he, however,
                    endeavours to justify by a protracted logical process, without being at all
                    conscious of any incongruity between means and end. This unconsciousness is due
                    to the fact that the strength of his original conviction prevented him from
                    discerning the real difficulties he had to surmount. We have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n711/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0711-0690"/> thus presented to us the spectacle of a mystic
                    endeavouring to expound his belief by a mere process of reasoning, almost
                    mathematical in its cold and definite precision and in its rigour. It is quite
                    possible that his strong prepossessions would in any case have prevented him
                    from estimating at their proper importance the new problems that were beginning
                    to appear on the horizon of contemporary thought, but, so far from having given
                    these problems the attention necessary in order to understand them, he was
                    scarcely aware of their existence. The impulse he received from Locke’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on the Human</hi><hi rend="italic">Understanding</hi> did
                    not lead him to seek full acquaintance with the whole circle of the
                    philosophical speculation of his time,—partly no doubt because his circumstances
                    prevented him from doing so, but partly also because he had a strong bias
                    towards the pursuit of solitary trains of thought. In his essay on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Freedom of the Will</hi> he confesses having never read Hobbes;
                    and although he mentions in a letter having read one of Hume’s works, this would
                    appear to have been subsequent to the publication of the essay on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Freedom of the Will,</hi> and its perusal does not seem to have
                    impressed him with any idea of its author’s exceptional metaphysical ability,
                    for he merely says of it and of some other books, “I am glad of an opportunity
                    to read such corrupt books, especially when written by men of considerable
                    genius, that I may have an idea 'of the notions which prevail in our country.”
                    He was scarcely conscious of the presence of the new influence which was then
                    stirring the stagnant waters of speculation; but it certainly influenced him
                    unconsciously, and compelled him to check his vague unrest by more stedfastly
                    clinging to his old convictions. He succeeded in doing so, but not without the
                    exercise of constant watchfulness, for, apart from any immediate external
                    influence, his strong and eager logical faculty seems often as if bent on
                    carrying him beyond the bounds of traditional opinion, and requires frequently
                    to be pulled up with a certain measure of abruptness.</p>
                <p>The theological system of Edwards emphasized all the sterner features of
                    Calvinism and revealed them in strong relief. Calvinism in its original form was
                    founded on extreme statements regarding “God’s sovereignty” and “man’s depravity
                    by nature,” but the inferences implied in these statements are set forth by
                    Edwards in their terrible and repulsive aspects with a thoroughness and a
                    logical completeness not previously attempted. The argument he employs to
                    establish his propositions is unanswerable as against the Libertarians of his
                    time, for he shows conclusively that their plight is, if anything, rather worse
                    than his own·; but when he seeks to go beyond this very circumscribed sphere he
                    involves himself in a labyrinth of scholastic quibbling, where all that seems to
                    present itself is only a choice of two evils,—either to remain for ever utterly
                    bewildered by the contradictory paths which open up before him, or by selecting
                    one of them to wander irrevocably beyond the bounds of what he recognized as
                    orthodox. We have an example of this when he endeavours to prove that though men
                    are born utterly depraved, God is not the author of their depravity. His theory
                    is that Adam was originally possessed of two principles,—one which may be called
                    <hi rend="italic">natural,</hi> being the mere <hi rend="italic">principles of
                    human nature,</hi> or as it is called in Scripture the <hi rend="italic"
                    >flesh,</hi> and another called the <hi rend="italic">supernatural</hi>
                    principle, or as in Scripture the <hi rend="italic">divine nature.</hi> When
                    Adam ate of the tree of forbidden fruit the divine nature was withdrawn from
                    him, and thus his nature became corrupt without God infusing any evil thing into
                    it. “So,” says Edwards, “does the nature of his posterity; they come into the
                    world mere flesh, and entirely under the government of natural and inferior
                    principles.” Here it will be seen, not only that Edwards appears to very little
                    advantage as a reasoner, but that he is in imminent peril of overthrowing the
                    central position of his own system; for, first, if to represent sin as a merely
                    negative quality in any degree solves the difficulty of God being its author, it
                    does so at the expense of denying to it a real existence; and secondly, to
                    represent men as born into the world “mere flesh” entirely destroys the
                    distinction, so essential to Edwards’s system, between “moral and natural
                    inability.” He soon, however, escapes back to his old position although not by
                    the way he set out. “If any,” he says, “should object to this that, if the want
                    of original righteousness be thus according to an established course of <hi
                    rend="italic">nature,</hi> then why are not principles cf holiness, when
                    restored by divine <hi rend="italic">grace,</hi> also communicated to posterity,
                    I answer, the divine law and establishments of the Author of nature are
                    precisely settled by Him as He pleaseth, and limited by His wisdom. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi></p>
                <p>The moral theory of Edwards is but a corollary from his theological system.
                    Virtue he places in love or benevolence towards being in general, or more
                    accurately in a “<hi rend="italic">disposition</hi> to benevolence towards being
                    in general,” for he does not mean to affirm that “every virtuous act must have
                    universal existence for its direct and immediate object,” but merely that “no
                    affections towards particular persons or beings are of the nature of true
                    virtue, but such as arise from a generally benevolent temper.” He shows that
                    this love cannot be primarily a “love of complacence,” that is, a love having
                    any regard to excellence in the object, for that “would be going in a circle,
                    and the same as saying that virtue consists in love to virtue,” and that it
                    cannot consist in “gratitude, or one being benevolent to another for his
                    benevolence to him,” because “this implies the same inconsistence;” consequently
                    that “the first object of a virtuous benevolence is being simply considered,
                    and, if being simply considered, then being in general.” There is, however, “a
                    second object of a virtuous propensity of heart, namely, benevolent being, for
                    one that loves being in general will necessarily value good-will to being in
                    general.” True virtue must, therefore, chiefly consist in love to God, for “he
                    that has true virtue, consisting in benevolence to being in general, and in
                    benevolence to virtuous being, must necessarily have a supreme love to God both
                    of benevolence and complacence.” This theory he applies to support the
                    theological dogma that no one whose virtuous acts are not the result of real
                    conscious love to a personal God can possess any true righteousness, or be in
                    any other moral condition than that of utter depravity. As to the merits of the
                    theory in itself, these are not helped by the form in which it is stated. Being
                    in general, being without any qualities, is too abstract a thing to be the
                    primary cause of love. The feeling which Edwards refers to is not love, but awe
                    or reverence, and, moreover, necessarily a blind awe. Properly stated therefore,
                    true virtue, according to him, would consist in a blind awe of being in general,
                    and a love of complacency to those who possess a blind awe of being in
                    general—only this would be inconsistent with his definition of virtue as
                    existing in God. In reality, as he makes virtue merely the second object of
                    love, his theory becomes identical with that utilitarian theory with which the
                    names of Hume, Bentham, and Mill are chiefly associated; but it is
                    utilitarianism necessarily expressed in very awkward terms, because these are
                    hampered by its derivation from certain theological principles, and its
                    necessary connection with a theological belief. Unlike Hume and Mill, he deduces
                    his theory primarily from certain scholastic propositions regarding God’s
                    purpose in the creation of the world. He accepts the Scripture statement that
                    God makes himself his own chief end, and he endeavours by scholastic reasoning
                    to snow the “reasonableness” of his doing so. He is, however, unable to proceed
                    a step in his argument without committing himself to such pantheistic statements
                    as that “God’s existence, being infinite, must be equivalent to universal
                    existence,” and that “the eternal and infinite Being is in effect being in
                    general, and comprehends universal existence.” He is, therefore, obliged to
                    confess that “there is a degree of indistinctness and obscurity in the close
                    consideration of such subjects,” and to fall back “on revelation as the surest
                    guide in these matters ;” although ’affirming at the same time that, in his
                    endeavours “to discover what the voice of reason is so far as it can go,” he has
                    been successful in “obviating cavils insisted on by many.”</p>
                <p>The fame of Edwards is associated chiefly with his treatise on <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Freedom of the Human Will.</hi> The will is defined by him as that by which
                    the “mind chooses anything.” By “determing the will” he means “causing that the
                    act of the will or choice should be thus and not otherwise.” And, “with respect
                    to the inquiry, What determines the will ?” he answers, “It is that motive which
                    as it stands in the view of the mind is the strongest.” Liberty, according to
                    him, belongs not to the will itself, but to the person, and the liberty which
                    any one possesses is merely liberty to act as he wills. Any other kind of
                    liberty, he affirms, implies three suppositions:—(1) “A self-determining power
                    in the will,” (2) “Indifference,—that previous to the act of volition the mind
                    is in a state of equilibrium;” and(3) “Contingence,—thatevents are not
                    necessarily connected with their causes.” These suppositions, as involving in
                    different forms denials of the law of causality, are severally shown to be/
                    absurd. That Edwards demonstrates the position of his opponents to be utterly
                    untenable must without the least qualification be admitted; but he is
                    unconsciously equally successful in overthrowing his own theological position.
                    Accordingly Edwards’s theory of the will, like his ethical theory, is now held
                    only by those who, in regard to the supreme power, are agnostics. His theory
                    differs in no respect from that of Jolm Stuart Mill, except that his statement
                    of the law of causality is a little confused, and that he gives a different
                    account of the origin of our knowledge of causality. He so far anticipated Hume
                    as to recognize that by cause is often meant “any antecedent with which a
                    consequent event is so connected that it truly belongs to the reason why the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n712/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0712-0691"/> proposition which affirms that event is true,
                    whether it has and positive influence in producing it or not.” There is, of
                    course, some confusion here, as the word “reason” is, in the position in which
                    it stands, ambiguous, showing that Edwards never properly grasped the
                    distinction between causality and mere sequence; and further differing from Hume
                    in recognizing that there are causes which have a positive influence in
                    producing their effects, his statements are rendered additionally perplexing by
                    his unconsciously making use of either signification of the word cause,
                    according to the exigencies of his argument. Thus he makes our knowledge not
                    only of the law of positive causality but of mere sequence to depend not on
                    experience but on a primary intuition ‘ ‘ implanted by God in the minds of all
                    mankind,” which is virtually a contradiction in terms. There is also the further
                    difficulty as to how, consistently with his theory in regard to the will, he can
                    hold any other doctrine regarding causality than that it is that mere sequence
                    which experience enables us to believe in; for it seems impossible that we can
                    have a primary intuition of causality unless from the consciousness of our own
                    casual energy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">h</hi> That part of Edwards’s argument in which he most
                    decidedly fails is .his endeavour to reconcile his theory of the will with his
                    own views in regard to moral agency, and more particularly in regard to the
                    nature of reward and punishment. John Stuart Mill admits that, on his own
                    theory, the only ends that can justify punishment are the benefit of the
                    offender himself and the protection of others, and the only “feeling of
                    accountability” he contends for is that “caused by the experience of
                    punishment.” It has been disputed whether even the kind of punishment contended
                    for by Mill is on his theory justifiable, but he has endeavoured to obviate
                    objections to it by distinguishing between what he calls “modified fatalism” and
                    what lie calls the “true doctrine ot causation.” The distinction is similar to
                    that drawn by Edwards between “moral” and “natural” necessity. It may be
                    questioned whether Mill’s doctrine of causality leaves room for this
                    distinction, but undoubtedly. Edwards’s doctrine does not; for by tracing our
                    knowledge of causality not to experience but to a primitive intuition, he
                    becomes not merely a “determinist,” buta “necessitarian.” Whether the doctrine
                    of the will held by Edwards, Hume, and Mill be the correct one, or whether the
                    true solution of the problem or its tree statement is to be found in some form
                    of the transcendental philosophy which received its great impulse from Kant, it
                    is not our province to inquire; but there need be no hesitation in affirming
                    both that Edwards is successful in showing that the doctrine of the freedom of
                    the will must be stated in different terms and justified by different methods
                    than those employed up to his time, and that, on account of his attempting to
                    build on principles so widely removed from each other as to be utterly
                    irreconcilable, his own well-planned structure, notwithstanding extraordinary
                    applications of architectural skill, inevitably collapses.</p>
                <p>The collected works of Jonathan Edwards, including a large number of sermons,
                    were first published at worcester, Mass., 1809, in 8 vols. 8vo. Among van∩us
                    other editions afterwards published may be mentioned that by his relative sereno
                    E. Dwight, 1830, in 10 vols., containing a memoir by Dr Dwight. This edition,
                    with an introductory essay byΗenry Rogers, was published at London in 1840, in
                    two vols. Edwards’s principal treatises are :— <hi rend="italic">Religious
