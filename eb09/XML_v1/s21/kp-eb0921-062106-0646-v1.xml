                    (1260-1644) as Gan-se; and under the present dynasty as Se-gan. During the
                    Ts’in, Han, and T’ang dynasties it was the capital of the empire, and is at the
                    present time second only to Peking in size, population, and importance. The
                    city, which is a square, measuring 10 Chinese miles each way, is prettily
                    situated on ground rising from the river Wei, and includes within its limits the
                    two district cities of Ch’ang-gan and Hien-ning. Its walls are little inferior
                    in height and massiveness to those of Peking, while its gates are handsomer and
                    better defended than any of which the capital can boast. The population is said
                    to be 1,000,000, of whom 50,000 are Mohammedans. Situated in the basin of the
                    Wei river, along which runs the great road which connects northern China with
                    Central Asia, at a point where the valley opens out on the plains of China,
                    Se-gan Foo occupies a strategical position of great importance, and repeatedly
                    in the annals of the empire has history been made around and within its walls.
                    During the late Mohammedan rebellion it was besieged by the rebels for two years
                    (1868-70), but owing to the strength of the fortifications it defied the efforts
                    of its assailants. From its eastern side three great roads radiate, one reaching
                    to Shan-se, one to Ho-nan, and one to Hoo-pih; while from it runs in a
                    south-westerly direction the great highway into Sze-chuen. It is thus admirably
                    situated as a trade centre and serves as a depot for the silk from Che-keang and
                    Sze-chuen, the tea from Hoo-pih and Ho-nan, and the sugar from Sze-chuen
                    destined for the markets of Kansuh, Turkistan, Ili, and Russia. Marco Polo
                    speaking of Kenjanfu, as the city was then also called, says that it was a place
                    “of great trade and industry. They have great abundance of silk, from which they
                    weave cloths of silk, and gold of divers kinds, and they also manufacture all
                    sorts of equipments for an army. They have every necessary of man’s life very
                    cheap.” Many of the temples and public buildings are very fine, and not a few
                    historical monuments are found within and about the walls. Of these the most
                    notable is a Nestorian tablet,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The contents of this Nestorian inscription, which consists
                    of 1780 characters, may be described as follows. (1) An abstract of Christian
                    doctrine of a vague and figurative kind. (2) Au account of the arrival of the
                    missionary Olopun (probably a Chinese form of Rabban = Monk), from Tats’in in
                    the year 635, bringing sacred books and images; of the translation of the said
                    books; of the imperial approval of the doctrine and permission to teach it
                    publicly. Then follows a decree of the emperor (T’ait-sung, a very famous
                    prince), issued in 638, in favour of the new doctrine, and ordering a church to
                    be built in the square of justice and peace <hi rend="italic">(Ining fang)</hi>
                    in the capital. The emperor’s portrait was to be placed in this church. After
                    this comes a description of Tats’in, and then some account of the fortunes of
                    the church in China. Kaoutsung (650-683, the devout patron also of the Buddhist
                    traveller and doctor, Hwen Ts’ang), it is added, continued to favour the new
                    faith. In the end of the century Buddhism got the upper hand, but under
                    Yuen-tsung (713-755) the church recovered its prestige, and Kiho, a new
                    missionary, arrived. Under Tih-tsung (780-783) the monument was erected, and
                    this part of the inscription ends with a eulogy of I-sze, a statesman and
                    benefactor of the church. (3) Then follows a recapitulation of the above in
                    octosyllabic verse. The Chinese inscription, which concludes with the date of
                    erection, viz., 781, is followed by a series of short inscriptions in Syriac and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Estrangelo</hi> character, containing the date of the
                    erection, the name of the reigning Nestorian patriarch, Mar Hanan Ishua, that of
                    Adam, bishop and pope of China, and those of the clerical staff of the capital.
                    Then follow sixty-seven names of persons in Syriac characters, most of whom are
                    characterized as priests, and sixty-one names of persons in Chinese, all priests
                    but one.</p></note> which was accidentally discovered in 1625 in the Ch’ang-gan

                <p>The stone slab which bears the inscription is 7 ½ feet high by 3 wide, and at
                    present stands embedded in a brick wall, which forms part of a dilapidated

                    point of view, however, the Pei Lin or “forest of tablets” is a place of even
                    greater interest than the above-mentioned temple. For there are collected
                    tablets of the Han, T’ang, Sung, Yuen, and Ming dynasties, some of which bear
                    historical legends, notably a set of stone tablets having the thirteen classics
                    inscribed upon them, while others are symbolical or pictorial; among these last
                    is a full-sized likeness of Confucius. As might be expected on a site which has
                    played so prominent a part in Chinese history, antiquities are constantly being
                    discovered in the neighbourhood of the city, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> rich
                    stores of coins and bronzes, bearing dates ranging from 200 <hi rend="smallcaps"
