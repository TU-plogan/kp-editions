                    rend="italic">Marcanda,</hi> the capital of Sogdiana, then the residence of the
                    Sámánids, and subsequently the capital of Timur, is now chief town of the
                    Zerafshan district of the Russian dominions. It lies in a richly cultivated
                    region, 185 miles southwest of Tashkend, and 145 miles east of Bokhara, in 39°
                    39' N. lat. and 67° 17' E. long., 2150 feet above the sea, in the valley of the
                    Zerafshan, at the point where it issues from the extreme western spurs of the
                    Tian-Shan before entering the steppes of Bokhara. The Zerafshan now flows about
                    three or four miles to the north of the city, supplying its extensive gardens
                    with water.</p>
                <p>Marcanda, a great city, whose walls had a compass of</p>
                <p>90 stadia, was destroyed by Alexander the Great. It reappears as Samarkand at the
                    time of the conquests of the Arabs, when it was finally reduced by Kotaiba ibn
                    Moslim in 93 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (711—712 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.).</hi> Under the Sámánids it became a brilliant seat of Arabian
                    civilization. Its schools, its savants, were widely renowned; it was so populous
                    that, when besieged by Jenghiz Khan in 1219, it is reported to have been
                    defended by an army of 110,000 men. Destroyed and pillaged by the great
                    conqueror, its population was reduced to one-quarter of what it had been, but it
                    still reckoned 25,000 families within its walls. The great conqueror Timur made
                    it his residence, and the inhabitants rose to 150,000. The magnificent buildings
                    of the epoch of the successors of Timur, which still remain, testify to its
                    former wealth. But new invaders again reduced it to ruin, so that at the
                    beginning of last century it is reported to have been almost without
                    inhabitants. It fell under Chinese dominion, and subsequently under that of the
                    emir of Bokhara, suffering again and again from wars which were fought for it
                    and around it. But no follower of Islam enters it without feeling that he is on
                    holy ground, although the venerated mosques and beautiful colleges of Samarkand
                    are falling into ruins, its high influence as a seat of learning has vanished,
                    and its very soil is profaned by infidels. It was not without a struggle that
                    the Mohammedans permitted the Russians to take possession of their holy city;
                    and, while other cities of Central Asia submitted almost without striking a
                    blow, Samarkand revolted in 1868, the Russian garrison shut up in the citadel
                    being rescued only by the timely arrival of a corps despatched from
                    Tashkend.</p>
                <p>The present city, which is but a wreck of its former self, is quadrangular in
                    shape and is enclosed by a low wall 9 miles long. The citadel rises in the west,
                    and to the westward of this again the Russians have laid out their new town,
                    with broad streets and boulevards radiating from the citadel, while a pretty
                    public garden, carefully irrigated, occupies the centre.</p>
                <p>The central part of Samarkand is the Righistan—a square limited by the three <hi
                    rend="italic">madrasahs</hi> (colleges) of Ulug-beg, Shir-dar, and Tilla-kari;
                    in its architectural symmetry and beauty this is rivalled only by some of the
                    squares of Italian cities. Though differing in detail, the great lines of the
                    three colleges are the same. An immense doorway decorates the front of each of
                    these large quadrilateral buildings. A high and deep-pointed porch, whose summit
                    almost reaches the top of the lofty façade, is flanked on each side by a broad
                    quadrilateral pillar of the same height, subdivided into three sections, each of
                    which has its own style of decoration. Two fine columns, profusely decorated, in
                    turn flank these broad pillars, On each side of the high doorway are two lower
                    archways connecting it with two elegant towers, narrowing towards their tops and
                    slightly inclined. The whole of the façade and also the interior courts are
                    profusely decorated with enamelled bricks, whose colours —blue, green, pink, or
                    golden, but chiefly turquoise-blue—are wrought into the most fascinating
                    designs, in striking harmony with the whole and with each part of the building.
                    In the recess of the deep doorway is the wide door, with proportions of
                    remarkable elegance, and above it are the broad decorations filling up the upper
                    part of the arch. Over the interior are bulbed or melon-like domes, perhaps too
                    heavy for the façade. The cool and shady<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n266/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0266-0247"/> courts are surrounded by three stories of small
                    rooms, each having only one opening—the door. The majestic buildings are now
                    merely the dwellings of mollahs, who live on the revenues of the Wakf lands at
                    Katty-kurgan.</p>
                <p>The college of Shir-dar (built in 1601) takes its name from the two lions, or
                    rather tigers, figured on the top of its doorway, which is richly decorated with
                    green, blue, red, and white enamelled bricks. It is the most spacious of the
                    three, and 128 mollahs inhabit its 64 apartments. The Tilla-kari (“dressed in
                    gold”), built in 1618, has 56 rooms. But the most renowned of the three
                    madrasahs is that of Ulug-beg, built in 1420 or 1434, by Timur, the grandson of
                    the great conqueror. It is smaller than the others, but it was to its school of
                    mathematics and astronomy that Samarkand owed its wide renown in the 15th
                    century.</p>
                <p>A winding street running north-east from the Righistan leads to a much larger
                    square having the college of Bibi-khanym on the west, the graves of Timur’s
                    wives on the south, and a clean bazaar on the east. The college was erected in
                    1888 by a Chinese wife of Timur, and is said to have once sheltered as many as a
                    thousand students. It covers a large area, and has three mosques connected by a
                    quadrangular building containing the students’ rooms. The archway and towers of
                    its façade are considered by Vambéry as a model for such buildings, and its
                    decorations resist the destructive influences alike of time and of man. One of
                    its mosques still raises its high bulbed dome above the outer walls, which are
                    falling into ruins, and now give accommodation to the carts and the bazaar of
                    traders in cotton. The lofty ruins of the grave of Timur’s wives are really
                    grand.</p>
                <p>To the north, outside the walls of Samarkand, but close at hand, is the Hazreti
                    Shah-Zindeh—the summer-palace of Timur; and near this is the grave of
                    Sliah-Zindeh, or, more precisely, Ḳotliam ibn al-'Abbás ibn 'Abd al-Moṭṭalib, a
                    famous companion of the Prophet. This was already a famous shrine in the 14th
                    century (Ibn Batuta, iii. 52); it is believed that the saint still lives in the
                    mosque, and will one day rise for the defence of his religion. The Hazreti
                    Shah-Zindeh covers a wide area on a terrace reached by forty marble steps. A
                    series of galleries and rooms lead to the hall containing the relics of the
                    saint. The decoration of the interior halls is marvellous.</p>
                <p>Another street running south-west from the Righistan leads to the Gur-Emir—the
                    grave of Timur. This consists of a chapel crowned with an elegant dome, enclosed
                    by a wall and fronted by an archway. Time and earthquakes have greatly injured
                    this fine building; one of the minarets is already in ruins. The interior
                    consists of two apartments paved with white marble, the walls being covered with
                    elegant turquoise arabesques and inscriptions in gold. The chief room is of
                    great beauty, and its decorations, of a bolder style than the others, are in
                    strict harmony with the impression it is designed to produce. A large pyramidal
                    piece of jade broken into two covers the grave of Timur, which has by its side
                    that of his teacher, Mir Seid Berke, and those of several members of his family,
                    all enclosed by a marble railing. A dark and narrow flight of steps leads down
                    to the crypt, also ornamented with arabesques, where the graves are placed in
                    the same order as in the upper hall.</p>
                <p>The citadel is situated on the west of the city, upon a hill whose steep slopes
                    render it one of the strongest in Central Asia. Its walls, 3000 yards in circuit
                    and about 10 feet high, enclose a space of about 4 square miles. It contained
                    the palace of the emir of Bokhara,—a vulgar modern building now transformed into
                    a hospital,—and the audience hall of Timur,—a long narrow court, surrounded by a
                    colonnade, and containing the <hi rend="italic">Keuk-tash,</hi> a grey stone 10
                    feet long, 4 feet broad, and 4½ feet high, reported to have been brought from
                    Brussa. On it Timur used to take his seat, surrounded by his numerous vassals;
                    from it more recently the emirs of Bokhara also were wont to dispense their
                    terrible justice.</p>
                <p>Ruins of former buildings—heaps of plain and enamelled bricks, among which
                    Graeco-Bactrian coins have been found—cover a wide area all around the present
                    city, and especially on the west and north. The name of Aphrosiab is usually
                    given to these ruins, which extend for nearly three miles to the westward of the
                    present Russian town; this suburb of Samarkand was enclosed by a wall, the ruins
                    of which can be traced for seven or eight miles. Five miles to the south-west of
                    Samarkand is the college Khodja Akrar; its flower ornamentation in enamelled
                    brick is one of the most beautiful of Samarkand. Rye is now grown in its courts,
                    and its artistic ornamentation is going to ruin. To the north-north-east are the
                    Tchupan-ata Hills, the chief of which has on its summit the grave of Daniar
                    Polvan. On the right bank of the Zerafshan stands the village of Dehbid, peopled
                    by descendants of Mahkdum Aazam (died in 1542), who possess a beautiful <hi
                    rend="italic">khanka</hi> (monastery), with pretty avenues of trees planted by
                    Nezr Divabeghi in 1632. As for the famous Baghitchi-naran (the garden of plane
                    trees), only the ruins of its palace now mark its former position; the trees
                    have disappeared. Of the Graeco-Armenian library said to have been brought to
                    Samarkand by Timur no traces have been discovered, and Vambéry regards the whole
                    legend as a fable invented by Armenians. Every trace of the renowned high school
                    Kalinder-kliany has also disappeared.</p>
                <p>The present Moslem city is an intricate labyrinth of narrow winding streets,
                    having on both sides clay walls concealing dirty court-yards and miserable
                    houses. The population was estimated at 36,000 in 1879; it consists of Tajiks
                    (Iranians) and Sarts or Uzbegs. The Europeans numbered 5380. Some 300 Jews
                    occupy a separate quarter, remarkable for its filth. Numbers of Arabs, Persians,
                    Afghans, Hindus, Kiptchaks, and Tsigans (Gipsies) may be met with in the
                    streets. The chief occupation of the inhabitants is gardening; the gardens
                    beyond the walls are extensive and very well kept. There is also a certain
                    amount of manufacturing industry; the workshops, which are small, are thus
                    enumerated by</p>
                <p>M. Kostenko :—for metallic wares, 12; for tallow and soap, 34; tanneries, 30;
                    potteries, 37; for various tissues, 246. Those for dyeing and the manufacture of
                    harness, boots, and silver and gold wares are also numerous. The best harness,
                    ornamented with turquoises, and the finer products of the goldsmith’s art, are
                    imported from Bokhara or Afghanistan. The products of local potteries are very
                    fine.</p>
                <p>The bazaars of Samarkand, the chief of which is in the centre of the town, close
                    by the Righistan, are more animated and kept with much greater cleanliness than
                    those of Tashkend or Namangan. The trade carried on by local or Bokhara
                    merchants is very brisk, the chief items being cotton, silk, wheat and rice,
                    horses, asses, fruits, and cutlery. Wheat, rice, and silk are exported chiefly
                    to Bokhara; cotton to Russia, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Tashkend. Silk-wares
                    and excellent fruits are imported from Shahri-Syabs, and rock-salt from Hissar.
