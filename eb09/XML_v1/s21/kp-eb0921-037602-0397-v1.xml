                    >Scarlatina</hi> are names applied indifferently to an acute infectious disease,
                    characterized by high fever, accompanied with sore throat and a diffuse red rash
                    upon the skin. This fever appears to have been first accurately described by
                    Sydenham in 1676, before which period it had evidently been confounded with
                    smallpox and measles.</p>
                <p>In connexion with the causation of this disease, the following points have been
                    ascertained. (1) It is a highly contagious malady, the infective material being
                    one of the most subtle, diffuse, and lasting known in fevers. It would seem that
                    the disease is communicable from an early period of its occurrence, all through
                    its progress, and especially during convalescence when the process of
                    desquamation is proceeding, and when the shed-off epidermis which contains the
                    germs of the disease in great abundance is apt to be inhaled, to become attached
                    to articles of clothing, to find entrance into food, or to be transmitted in
                    other ways to healthy persons. (2) It is a disease for the most part of early
                    life, young children being specially susceptible; but adults may also suffer if
                    they have not had this fever in childhood. (3) It occurs both in isolated cases
                    (sporadically) and in epidemics. (4) One attack in general, although not always,
                    confers immunity from a second. (5) Certain constitutional conditions act as
                    predisposing causes favouring the development of the fever. Thus, where
                    overcrowding prevails, and where the hygienic state of children is ill attended
                    to, the disease is more likely to prevail and spread, and to assume unfavourable
                    forms. Further, in the puerperal state in women there appears to be a special
                    susceptibility to suffer in a dangerous manner should there be exposure to the
                    infection of the fever. As to the nature of the infecting agent, nothing
                    positive is known, although from the analogy of similar diseases it is probable
                    that specific micro-organisms or germs are concerned in its production.</p>
                <p>The period of incubation in scarlet fever (that is, the time elapsing between the
                    reception of the poison and the development of symptoms) appears to vary.
                    Sometimes it would seem to be as short as one or two days, but in most instances
                    it is probably about a week. The invasion of this fever is generally sudden and
                    sharp, consisting in rigors, vomiting, and sore throat, together with a rapid
                    rise of temperature and increase in the pulse. Occasionally, especially in young
                    children, the attack is ushered in by convulsions. These premonitory symptoms
                    usually continue for about twenty-four hours, when the characteristic eruption
                    makes its appearance. It is first seen on the neck, chest, arms, and hands, but
                    quickly spreads all over the body, although it is not distinctly marked on the
                    face. This rash consists of minute thickly-set red spots, which coalesce to form
                    a general diffuse redness, in appearance not unlike that produced by the
                    application of mustard to the skin. In some instances the redness is accompanied
                    with small vesicles containing fluid. In ordinary cases the rash conies out
                    completely in about two days, when it begins to fade, and by the end of a week
                    from its first appearance it is usually gone. The severity of a case is in some
                    degree measured by the copiousness and brilliancy of the rash, except in the
                    malignant varieties, where there may be little or no eruption. The tongue, which
                    at first was furred, becomes about the fourth or fifth day denuded of its
                    epithelium and acquires the peculiar “strawberry” appearance characteristic of
                    this fever. The interior of the throat is red and somewhat swollen, especially
                    the uvula, soft palate, and tonsils, and a considerable amount of secretion
                    exudes from the inflamed surface. There is also tenderness and slight swelling
                    of the glands under the jaw. In favourable cases the fever departs with the
                    disappearance of the eruption and convalescence sets in with the commencement of
                    the process of “desquamation” or peeling of the cuticle, which first shows
                    itself about the neck, and proceeds slowly over the whole surface of the body.
                    Where the skin is thin the desquamation is in the form of fine branny scales;
                    but where it is thicker, as about the hands and feet, it comes off in large
                    pieces, which sometimes assume the form of casts of the fingers or toes. The
                    duration of this process is variable, but it is rarely complete before the end
                    of six or eight weeks, and not unfrequently goes on for several weeks beyond
                    that period. It is during this stage that complications are apt to appear,
                    particularly those due to cold, such as inflammation of the kidneys; and all
                    throughout its continuance there is the further danger of the disease being
                    communicated to others by the cast-off epidermic scales.</p>
                <p>Scarlet fever shows itself in certain well-marked varieties, of which the
                    following are the chief :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Scarlatina Simplex</hi> is tho most common form; in this the
                    symptoms, both local and general, are moderate, and the case usually runs a
                    favourable course. It is always, however, to be borne in mind that the duration
                    and the infectiveness of the disease, including its convalescence, are
                    uninfluenced by the mildness of the attack. In some rare instances it would seem
                    that the evidences of tho disease are so slight, as regards both fever and rash,
                    that they escape observation and only become known by the patient subsequently
                    suffering from some of the complications associated with it. In such cases the
                    name <hi rend="italic">latent scarlet fever (scarlatina latens)</hi> is
                    applied.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Scarlatina Anginosa</hi> is a more severe form of the fever,
                    particularly as regards the throat symptoms. The rash may be well marked or not,
                    but it is often slow in developing and in subsiding. There is intense
                    inflammation of the throat, the tonsils, uvula, and soft palate being swollen
                    and ulcerated, or having upon them membranous patches not unlike those of
                    diphtheria, while externally the gland tissues in the neck are enlarged and
                    indurated and not unfrequently become the seat of abscesses. There is difficulty
                    in opening the mouth; an acrid discharge exudes from the nostrils and excoriates
                    the lips; and the countenance is pale and waxy-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n398/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0398-0377"/> looking. This form of the disease is marked by
                    great prostration of strength, and it is much more frequently fatal than the
                    preceding.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Scarlatina Maligna</hi> is the most serious form of all. The
                    malignancy may be variously displayed. Thus a case of scarlatina anginosa may
                    acquire such a severe character, both as to throat and general symptoms, as
                    rapidly to produce profound exhaustion and death. But the typically malignant
                    forms are those in which the attack sets in with great violence and the patient
                    sinks from the very first. In such instances the rash either does not come out
                    at all or is of the slightest amount and of livid rather than scarlet
                    appearance, while the throat symptoms are often not prominent. Death in such
                    cases may take place in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and is frequently
                    preceded by great elevation of the temperature of the body and by delirium,
                    coma, or other nervous symptoms. A further example of a malignant form is
                    occasionally observed in cases where the rash, which had previously been
                    well-developed, suddenly recedes, and convulsions or other nervous phenomena and
                    rapid death supervene.</p>
                <p>The complications and effects of scarlet fever are, as already indicated, among
                    the most important features in this disease, and, although their occurrence is
                    exceptional, they appear with sufficient frequency, and are of such a nature, as
                    ought to make the medical attendant carefully watch every case for any of their
                    early indications. The most common and serious of these is inflammation of the
                    kidneys, which may arise during any period in the course of the fever, but is
                    specially apt to appear in the convalescence, while desquamation is in progress.
                    Its onset is sometimes announced by a return of feverish symptoms, accompanied
                    with vomiting and pain in the loins; but in a large number of instances it
                    occurs without these and comes on insidiously. One of the most prominent
                    symptoms is slight swelling of the face, particularly of the eyelids, which is
                    rarely absent in this complication. If the urine is examined it will probably be
                    observed to be diminished in quantity and of dark smoky or red appearance, due
                    to the presence of blood; while it will also be found to contain a large
                    quantity of albumen. This, together with the microscopic examination which
                    reveals the presence of tube casts containing blood, epithelium, &amp;c.,
                    testifies to a condition of acute inflammation of the kidney (glomerular and
                    tubal nephritis). In favourable cases these symptoms may soon disappear, but
                    they may on the other hand prove extremely serious,—the risks being the
                    suppression of urine, leading to uraemic poisoning and causing convulsions which
                    may terminate fatally, or, further, the rapid development of general dropsy, and
                    death from this cause. Although thus a very formidable complication, it is yet
                    one which is amenable to treatment, and by the prompt and judicious application
                    of remedies lives may often be saved, even in desperate circumstances.
                    Occasionally this condition does not wholly pass off, and consequently lays the
                    foundation for <hi rend="smallcaps">Bright’s Disease</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.).</hi> Another of the more common complications or results of scarlet
                    fever is suppuration of the ears, due to the extension of the inflammatory
                    process from the throat along the Eustachian tube into the middle ear. This not
                    unfrequently leads to permanent ear-discharge, with deafness from the disease
                    affecting the inner ear and temporal bone, a condition implying a degree of risk
                    from its proximity to the brain. Other maladies affecting the heart, lungs,
                    pleura, &amp;c., occasionally arise in connection with scarlet fever, but they
                    are of less common occurrence than those previously mentioned. Apart, however,
                    from such definite forms of disease there may remain as the result of scarlet
                    fever simply a general weakening of health, which may render the patient
                    delicate and vulnerable for a long time.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of scarlet fever, one of the first requirements is the isolation
                    of the case, with the view of preventing the spread of the disease. In large
                    houses this may be possible, but in most instances it can only be satisfactorily
                    accomplished by sending away those other members of the family who have not
                    suffered from the fever. The establishment in many large towns of hospitals for
                    infectious diseases, which provide accommodation for patients of all classes,
                    affords the best of all opportunities for thorough isolation. In large families,
                    where few or none of the members have had the disease, the prompt removal of a
                    case to such an hospital will in many instances prevent the spread of the fever
                    through the household, as well as beyond it, and at the same time obviate many
                    difficulties connected with the cleansing and purification of the house, which,
                    however carefully done, may still leave remaining some risk in the case of a
                    fever the contagious power of which is so intense.</p>
                <p>When, however, the patient is treated at home, the sick room should contain only
                    such furniture as may be required, and the attendants should come as little as
                    possible in contact with other members of the household. Should other children
                    be in the house, they should be kept away from school during all the time that
                    the risk of infection continues. The possibility of the fever being communicated
                    by letters sent from the sick room should not be forgotten by those in
                    attendance. Disinfectants, such as carbolic acid, Condy’s fluid, &amp;c., may be
                    used freely in the room and passages, and all body or bed clothes when removed
                    should be placed at once in boiling water, or in some disinfecting fluid. In
                    convalescence, with the view of preventing the transmission of the desquamated
                    cuticle, the inunction of the body with carbolized oil (1 in 40) and the
                    frequent use of a bath containing soda are to be recommended.</p>
                <p>All books, toys, &amp;c., used by the patient during the illness should be
                    carefully destroyed or given to fever hospitals, as their preservation has
                    frequently been known to cause an outbreak of the disease at a subsequent time.
                    With respect to the duration of the infective period, it may be stated generally
                    that it is seldom that a patient who has suffered from scarlet fever can safely
                    go about before the expiry of eight weeks, while on the other hand the period
                    may be considerably prolonged beyond this, the measure of the time being the
                    completion of the process of desquamation in every portion of the surface of the
                    body. As to general management during the progress of the fever,—in favourable
                    cases little is required beyond careful nursing and feeding. The diet all
                    through the fever and convalescence should be of light character, consisting
                    mainly of milk food. Soups may be taken, but solid animal food should as far as
                    possible be avoided. During the febrile stage a useful drink may be made by a
                    weak solution of chlorate of potash in water (1 drachm to the pint), and of this
                    the patient may partake freely. In the more severe forms of the disease, where
                    the throat is much affected, the application with a brush of a strong solution
                    of Condy’s fluid or other disinfectant, such as boroglyceride, glycerine of
                    carbolic acid, quinine, &amp;c., may be required, or gargling with these
                    substances when this can be done. In the malignant variety, where the eruption
                    is not appearing, or is but ill developed, stimulants internally, and the hot
                    bath or pack, may sometimes afford a chance, or the hypodermic use of
                    pilocarpin,—although it must be confessed that in such cases little can be
                    expected from any remedies. The treatment of the kidney complication and its
                    accompanying dropsy is similar to that for acute Bright’s disease. Depletion by
                    leeching or cupping the loins, and the promotion of cutaneous action by a hot
                    air bath or a hot wet pack, or by pilocarpin, are the most useful measures, and
                    will often succeed in saving life. The abscesses of the neck which occasionally
                    occur as complications should be opened antiseptically, while the ear disorders,
                    which are apt to continue long after the termination of convalescence, will
                    demand the special attention of the aurist. (J. O. A <hi rend="smallcaps"
