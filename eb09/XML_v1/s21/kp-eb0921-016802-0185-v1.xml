                    Saint-Denis, Seigneur de</hi></label> ( 1613-1703), was born at
                    Saint-Denis-le-Guast near Coutances, the seat of his family in Normandy, on 1st
                    April 1613. He was a younger son, but took his designation from one of the
                    smaller estates of the family and appears to have had a sufficient portion. He
                    was a pupil of the Jesuits at the Collége de Clermont, Paris, then a student at
                    Caen. For a time he followed the law at the Collége d’Harcourt. He soon,
                    however, took to arms and in 1629 went with Bassompierre to Italy. He served
                    through great part of the Thirty Years’ War, chiefly in Germany, and, meeting
                    Gassendi at Paris, became strongly imbued with his doctrines. He was present at
                    Rocroy, at Nordlingen, and at Lens. For a time he was attached to Condé, but is
                    said to have offended him by some satirical speech or speeches. During the
                    Fronde, Saint-Évremond, unlike most of his contemporaries, never changed sides,
                    but was a steady royalist. The duke of Candale (of whom he has left a very
                    severe portrait) gave him some appointments in Guienne, and Saint-Évremond is
                    said to have saved 50,000 livres in less than three years. He was one of the
                    numerous victims of the fate of Fouquet. His letter to Créqui on the peace of
                    the Pyrenees, which is said to have been discovered by Colbert’s agents at the
                    seizure of the superintendent’s papers, seems a very inadequate cause for exile,
                    and it has been supposed that there was more behind; but nothing is known
                    certainly. Saint-Évremond went to Holland and England, where he was received
                    with open arms by Charles IL, and was pensioned. He found himself very much at
                    home in England, and though after James II.’s flight to France Saint-Évremond
                    was invited to return he declined. Hortense Mancini, the most attractive of
                    Mazarin’s strangely attractive group of nieces, came to England and set up a <hi
                    rend="italic">salon</hi> for love-making, gambling, and witty conversation, and
                    here Saint-Évremond was for many years at home. He died on Michaelmas Day 1703,
                    and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his monument still is in Poet’s
                    Corner close to that of Prior.</p>
                <p>Saint-Évremond is perhaps the most remarkable instance of the curious
                    17th-century fancy for circulating literary work in manuscript or clandestinely.
                    He never himself authorized the printing of any of his works during his long
                    lifetime, though Barbin in 1668 published an unauthorized collection. But he
                    empowered Des Maizeaux to publish his works after his death, and they duly
                    appeared, the earliest form and date being 3 vols. 4to, 1705. They were often
                    reprinted in various forms during the first half of the 18th century.
                    Saint-Évremond, however, had made his mark and established his influence long
                    before the earliest of these books appeared. He was an older man than Pascal, a
                    very much older man than Anthony Hamilton, and he probably preceded the first,
                    as he certainly long preceded the second, in the employment for literary
                    purposes of a singularly light, polished, and graceful irony, which taught a
                    great deal to Voltaire, but which Voltaire was never able to imitate with quite
                    the air of good company which distinguishes his teacher. The masterpiece of
                    Saint-Évremond’s style in this respect is the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conversation du Maréchal d'Hocquincourt avec le Père Canaye</hi> (the latter a
                    Jesuit and Saint-Évremond’s master at school), which has been frequently classed
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Provinciales,</hi> but which with less of
                    moral purpose and of cutting reproof even excels those famous compositions in
                    dramatic power and in subtle good-humoured irony. The remainder of
                    Saint-Évremond’s works are desultory in the extreme. Some elaborate letters
                    contain the exposition of an Epicurean philosophy of life which had a very great
                    influence on the polite society of his day. others, and the most important of
                    all, exhibit the writer as a literary critic of singular discrimination and
                    taste. His comparisons of Corneille and Racine, his remarks on English drama
                    (chiefly that of Ben Jonson), his sketches of criticism on Roman character and
                    literature, all show a remarkable union of acute and orderly generalization with
                    freedom from the merely academic spirit which had in his time already begun to
                    beset France. Altogether, Saint-Evremond may be said with greater right to
                    deserve the phrase which used to be applied to Sir William Temple. He is the
                    first master of the genteel style in French literature, and the lively poignancy
                    of his irony prevents this gentility from ever becoming insipid. His influence
                    indeed was hardly less in his adopted than in his native country, and it may be
                    traced in the Queen Anne essayists to a not much less degree than in Hamilton
                    and Voltaire.</p>
                <p>Saint-Évremond’s complete works have not recently been reprinted, but there are
                    selections by Hippeau, Giraud, and others.</p>
