                    this legend is recounted as follows. Demetrius Phalereus, keeper of the
                    Alexandrian library, proposed to King Ptolemy II. Philadelphus to have a Greek
                    translation of the Jewish law made for the library. The king consented and sent
                    an embassy, of which the author of the letter was a member, to the high priest
                    Eleazar at Jerusalem asking him to send six ancient, worthy, and learned men
                    from each of the twelve tribes to translate the law for him at Alexandria.
                    Eleazar readily consented and sent the seventy-two men with a precious roll of
                    the law. They were most honourably received at the court of Alexandria and
                    conducted to the island (Pharus), that they might work undisturbed and isolated.
                    When they had come to an agreement upon a section Demetrius wrote down their
                    version; the whole translation was finished in seventy-two days. The Jewish
                    community of Alexandria was allowed to have a copy, and accepted the version
                    officially,—indeed a curse was laid upon the introduction of any changes in
                    it.</p>
                <p>There is no question that this <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> is spurious.<note

                <p>If now the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> is so old, it is incredible that it
                    should contain no elements derived from actual tradition as to the origin of the
                    LXX., and we must try to separate these from the merely fabulous. To this end we
                    must consider what is the main aim and object of the forgery. The chief thing in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> is the description of a seven days’ symposium
                    of the seventy translators at the Alexandrian court, during which each of them
                    has a question to answer, and raises the admiration of the king for the wisdom
                    produced among the Jews by their knowledge of the law. Further, very great
                    weight is laid on the point that the LXX. is the official and authoritative
                    Bible of the Hellenistic Jews, having been not only formally accepted by the
                    synagogue at Alexandria but authorized by the high priest at Jerusalem and the
                    seventy elders who are in fact its authors. Other matters receive no special
                    emphasis, and the presumption is that what is said about them is not deliberate
                    fiction and in part at least is true. Thus it has always been taken as a fact
                    that the version originated at Alexandria, that the law was translated first,
                    and that this took place in the time of Ptolemy II. On the other hand, it has
                    been thought difficult to believe that the scholarly tastes of the Alexandrians,
                    personified in Demetrius Phalereus as the presiding genius of the Alexandrian
                    library, could have furnished the stimulus to reduce the translation to writing.
                    One can hardly call this intrinsically improbable in view of the miscellaneous
                    literary tastes of the court of the Ptolemies. But it has been thought much more
                    likely that the Septuagint was written down to satisfy the religious needs of
                    the Jews by a translated Torah, since in fact the version is fitted for Jews and
                    could have been intelligible only to them, and indeed never came to be
                    circulated and known outside of their circles. Here, however, we must
                    distinguish between written and oral interpretation. If interpretation was
                    needed in the synagogue service, it was an oral interpretation that was given.
                    It was not a natural thing for the Jews to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> the
                    translation,—indeed they had religious scruples against such a course. Only
                    “Scripture” was to be written, and to put the contents of Scripture in writing
                    in any other than the old holy form was deemed almost a profanation,—a feeling
                    of which there is evidence in the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> itself.<note

                    orally for centuries before it was at last reduced to writing; and, if, on the
                    contrary, at Alexandria a written version came into existence so early, it is
                    far from improbable that this was due to some influence from without. That the
                    work is purely Jewish in character is only what was inevitable in any case. The
                    translators were necessarily Jews and were necessarily and entirely guided by
                    the living tradition which had its focus in the synagogal lessons. And hence it
                    is easily understood that the version was ignored by the Greeks, who must have
                    found it barbarous and unintelligible, but obtained speedy acceptance with the
                    Jews, first in private use and at length also in the synagogue service.</p>
                <p>The next direct evidence which we have as to the origin of the LXX. is the
                    prologue to Ecclesiasticus, from which it appears that about 130 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> not only the law but “the prophets and the other
                    books” were extant in Greek. With this it agrees that the most ancient relics of
                    Jewish-Greek literature, preserved in the extracts made by Alexander Polyhistor
                    (Eus., <hi rend="italic">Praep. Ev.,</hi> ix.), all show acquaintance with the
                    LXX. These later translations too were not made to meet the needs of the
                    synagogue, but express a literary movement among the Hellenistic Jews,
                    stimulated by the favourable reception given to the Greek Pentateuch, which
                    enabled the translators to count on finding an interested public. If a
                    translation was well received by reading circles amongst the Jews, it gradually
                    acquired public acknowledgment and was finally used also in the synagogue, so
                    far as lessons from other books than the Pentateuch were used at all. But
                    originally the translations were mere private enterprises, as appears from the
                    prologue to Ecclesiasticus and the colophon to Esther. It appears also that it
                    was long before the whole Septuagint was finished and treated as a complete
                    work.</p>
                <p>As the work of translation went on so gradually and new books were always added
                    to the collection the compass of the Greek Bible came to be somewhat indefinite.
                    The law always maintained its pre-eminence as the basis of the canon; but the
                    prophetic collection changed its aspect by having various Hagiographa
                    incorporated with it according to an arbitrary arrangement by subjects. The
                    distinction made in Palestine between Hagiographa and Apocrypha was never
                    properly established among the Hellenists. In some books the translators took
                    the liberty to make considerable additions to the original, and these additions—
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> those to Daniel—became a part of the Septuagint.
                    Nevertheless learned Hellenists were quite well aware of the limits of the canon
                    and respected them. Philo can be shown to have known the Apocrypha, but he never
                    cites them, much less allegorizes them or uses them in proof of his tenets. And
                    in some measure the widening of the Old Testament canon in the Septuagint must
                    be laid to the account of Christians. As regards the character of the version,
                    it is a first attempt, and so is memorable and worthy of respect, but at the
                    same time displays all the weaknesses of a first attempt. Though the influence
                    of contemporary ideas is sometimes perceptible, the Septuagint is no paraphrase,
                    but in general closely follows the Hebrew, —so closely indeed that we can hardly
                    understand it without a process of retroversion, and that a true Greek could not
                    have found any satisfaction in it. The same Greek word is forced to assume the
                    whole range of senses which belongs in Semitic speech to the derivatives of a
                    single root; a Hebrew expression which has various Greek equivalents according
                    to the context is constantly rendered in one way; the aorist, like the Hebrew
                    perfect, is employed as an inchoative with a much wider range of application
                    than is tolerated in classical Greek. At the same time, many passages are freely
                    rendered and turned where there is no particular need to do so, and that even in
                    books like the <hi rend="italic">Prophetae Priores,</hi> in which the rendering
                    is generally quite stiff. The literalness of the version is therefore due not to
                    scrupulousness but to want of skill, and probably in part also to accommodation
                    to a kind of Jewish Greek jargon which had already developed in the mouths of
                    the people and was really Hebrew or Aramaic in disguise. This Jewish dialect in
                    turn found its standard in the Septuagint.</p>
                <p>As the version is the work of many hands, it is naturally not of uniform
                    character throughout all its parts,—indeed considerable varieties of character
                    sometimes appear in one and the same book. The older constituents of the canon
                    have an unmistakable family likeness as contrasted with the later books; this
                    one may see by comparing Kings with Chronicles or Isaiah and Jeremiah with
                    Daniel. The Pentateuch is considered to be particularly well done and Isaiah to
                    be particularly unhappy. Some of the Hagiographa (Ecclesiastes, Canticles,
                    Chronicles) are reproduced with verbal closeness; others, on the contrary (Job,
                    Esdras, Esther, Daniel), are marked by a very free treatment of the text, or
                    even by considerable additions. It is not, however, always easy to tell whether
                    a Septuagint addition is entirely due to the translator or belongs to the
                    original text, which lay before him in a recension divergent from the
                    Massoretic. The chief impulse in recent times to thorough investigation of the
                    character of the several parts of the Septuagint was given by Lagarde in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Anmerkungen zur griechischen Uebersetzung der Proverbien,</hi>
                    Leipsic, 1863.</p>
                <p>The Septuagint came into general use with the Grecian Jews even in the synagogue.
                    Philo and Josephus use it, and so do the New Testament writers. But very early
                    small corrections seem to have been introduced, especially by such Palestinians
                    as had occasion to use the LXX., in consequence partly of divergent
                    interpretation, partly of differences of text or of pronunciation (particularly
                    of proper names). The Old Testament passages cited by authors of the first
                    century of the Christian era, especially those in the Apocalypse, show many such
                    variations from the Septuagint, and, curiously enough, these often correspond
                    with the later versions (particularly with Theodotion), so that the latter seem
                    to rest on a fixed tradition. Corrections in the pronunciation of proper names
                    so as to come closer to the Massoretic pronunciation are especially frequent in
                    Josephus. Finally a reaction against the use of the Septuagint set in among the
                    Jews after the destruction of the temple, —a movement which was connected with
                    the strict definition of the canon and the fixing of an authoritative text by
                    the rabbins of Palestine. But long usage had made it impossible for the Jews to
                    do without a Greek Bible, and to meet this want a new version was prepared
                    corresponding accurately with the canon and text of the Pharisees. This was the
                    version of Aquila, which took the place of the Septuagint in the synagogues, and
                    long continued in use there.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris Ciυ.,</hi> Nov.
                    cxlvl</p></note> A little later other translations were made by Jews or Jewish
                    Christians, which also followed the official Jewish canon and text, but were not
                    such slavish reproductions as Aquila’s version; two of these were Greek
                    (Theodotion, Symmachus) and one Syriac (Peshito).</p>
                <p>Meantime the Greek and Latin Christians kept to the old version, which now became
                    the official Bible of the catholic church. Yet here also, in process of time, a
                    certain distrust of the Septuagint began to be felt, as its divergence from the
                    Jewish text was observed through comparison of the younger versions based on
                    that text, or came into notice through the frequent discussions between Jews and
                    Christians as to the Messianic prophecies.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n694/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0694-0669"/> On the whole the Christians were disposed to
                    charge the Jews with falsifying their Scriptures out of hatred to
                    Christianity,—a charge which has left its echoes even in the Koran. But some
                    less prejudiced scholars did not share this current view, and went so far in the
                    other direction as simply to identify the Jewish text with the authentic
                    original. Thus they fell into the mistake of holding that the later Jewish text
                    was that from which the Septuagint translators worked, and by which their work
                    was to be tested and measured. On these critical principles Origen prepared his
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Hexapla,</hi> in which he placed alongside of the
                    Septuagint, in six parallel columns, the three younger versions and the Hebrew
                    text in Hebrew and in Greek characters. The Septuagint text he corrected after
                    the younger versions, marking the additions of the LXX. with a prefixed obelus (
                    —, ÷ ), as a sign that they should be deleted, and supplying omissions,
                    generally from Theodotion, with a prefixed asterisk («). The end of the passage
                    to which the obelus or asterisk applied was marked with a metobelus (∙&lt;). The
                    same signs were used for various readings, the reading of the LXX. being
                    obelized, and the variant, from another version corresponding to the Hebrew
                    text, following it with an asterisk. It was only in simpler cases, however, that
                    this plan could be carried through without making the text quite unreadable; the
                    more complicated variations were either tacitly corrected or left untouched, the
                    reader being left to judge of them by comparing the parallel columns. Origen
                    made most change in the proper names, which he emended in conformity with the
                    Jewish pronunciation of the period, and in the order of the text, which, to
                    preserve the parallelism in the columns, he made to follow the Hebrew.<note

                <p>Origen’s critical labours had a very great influence in shaping the text of the
                    Septuagint, though in quite another direction than he designed. Even before his
                    time the Septuagint was largely contaminated by admixture from the other
                    versions, but such alterations now began to be made systematically. Thus he
                    intensified a mischief which to be sure had begun before him, and even before
                    the labours of Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus. The most significant evidence
                    of this contamination of the text lies in the conflate readings, where the same
                    Hebrew words are translated twice, or sometimes even thrice, or where two Hebrew
                    readings of the same passage are represented, sometimes by simple juxtaposition
                    of renderings that differ but slightly, at other times by a complicating
                    interlacing of very different forms of the Greek. These conflate readings,
                    however, in which the true reading survives along with the false, are the least
                    fatal corruptions; in many cases the genuine text has disappeared altogether
                    before the correction, as can be seen by comparing different MSS. A faithful
                    picture of the corruption of the text of the Septuagint as it has come down to
                    us is given in the apparatus to the great Oxford edition of Holmes and Parsons
                    (5 vols., Oxford, 1798-1827).</p>
                <p>Not long after Origen there arose almost contemporaneously three recensions of
                    the Septuagint, which became established in three regions of the Greek Church.
                    “Alexandria et Aegyptus in Septuaginta suis Hesychium laudat auctorem,
                    Constantinopolis usque Antiochiam Luciani martyris exemplaria probat, mediae
                    inter has provinciae Palestinae codices legunt, quos ab Origene elaboratos
                    Eusebius et Pamphilus vulgaverunt; totusque orbis hac inter se trifaria
                    varietate compugnat,” says Jerome in the <hi rend="italic">Praef. in Paralip. ad
                    Chromatium.</hi> According to this the text of Eusebius is that of Origen, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a separate edition of the fifth column of the Hexapla,
                    which contained the</p>
                <p>Septuagint with asterisks and obeli. The text of Hesychius has not yet been
                    identified with certainty<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See, however, Ceriani’s note on the recensions of LXX. in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rendiconti</hi> of the R. Instituto Lombardo for 18th February
                    1886, where it is shown that the <hi rend="italic">Codex rescriptus
                    Dublinensis,</hi> Holmes, viii., edited at Dublin, 1880), and other MSS. written
                    in Egypt, which Ceriani had already cited in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monumenta</hi> (vol. iii. p. xx.) present many features of correspondence with
                    the Coptic versions and with the readings of Cyril of Alexandria. “All these
                    documents at any rate present the character of the Hesychian recension, being
                    all Egyptian testimonies contemporary with or little later than Jerome.” Most of
                    their characteristic readings appear also in MS. Holmes, 106, to which MSS. 26,
                    33, 86, 97, 198, 206 are also akin. For an attempt to determine the MSS.
                    containing or akin to the Hesychian recension in Ezekiel, see Cornill, <hi
                    rend="italic">Das Buch Ezechiel,</hi> Leipsic, 1886, p. 66 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi></p></note>; that of Lucian is, according to Field and Lagarde, most
                    probably given in <hi rend="italic">Codd. Holmes.,</hi> 19, 82, 93, 108, and
                    another series of MSS. for the prophets. It is by no means the case, however,
                    that all our MSS. can be arranged in three families; many belong to none of the
                    three recensions, and among these are such important codices as the Alexandrian
                    (A) and the Vatican (B).</p>
                <p>The divergences of the LXX. from the Hebrew are particularly great in the books
                    of Samuel and Kings, also in the prophets, especially in Ezekiel, and still more
                    in Jeremiah, and finally also in Job and Proverbs. In Jeremiah the differences
                    extend to the order of the chapters in the second half of the book, and
                    therefore have always attracted special attention. In Proverbs too the
                    individual proverbs are differently arranged in the LXX., and similar
                    differences can be traced in the versions of Ecclesiasticus. In the Pentateuch
                    there are considerable variations only in the last part of Exodus. The text of
                    the genuine Septuagint is generally shorter than the Massoretic text.</p>
                <p>The chief editions of the Septuagint are—(1) the Complutensis, 1514-17; (2) the
                    Aldine, 1516; (3) the Sixtine, 1587; (4) the first Oxford edition by Grabe,
                    1707-20; (5) the second Oxford edition by Holmes and Parsons, 1798-1827; (6)
                    Lagarde’s edition of Lucian, vol. i., Gottingen, 1883.</p>
                <p>The LXX. is of great importance in more than one respect: it is probably the
                    oldest translation of considerable extent that ever was written, and at any rate
                    it is the starting-point for the history of Jewish interpretation and the Jewish
                    view of Scripture. And from this its importance as a document of exegetical
                    tradition, especially in lexical matters, may be easily understood. It was in
                    great part composed before the close of the canon—nay, before some of the
                    Hagiographa were written—and in it alone are preserved a number of important
                    ancient Jewish books that were not admitted into the canon. As the book which
                    created or at least codified the dialect of Biblical Greek, it is also the key
                    to the New Testament and all the literature connected with it. But its chief
                    value lies in the fact that it is the only independent witness for the text of
                    the Old Testament which we have to compare with the Massoretic text. Now it may
                    seem that the critical value of the LXX. is greatly impaired, if not entirely
                    cancelled, by the corrupt state of the text. If we have not the version itself
                    in authentic form we cannot reconstruct with certainty the Hebrew text from
                    which it was made, and so cannot get at various readings which can be
                    confidently confronted with the Massoretic text; and it may be a long time
                    before we possess a satisfactory edition of the genuine Septuagint. But
                    fortunately in this case sound results in detail must precede and not follow the
                    establishment of a text sound throughout. The value of a Septuagint reading must
                    be separately determined in each particular case, and the proof that a reading
                    is good is simply that it necessarily carries us back to a Hebrew variant, and
                    cannot be explained by looseness of translation. It is therefore our business to
                    collect as many Greek passages as possible which point to a various<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n695/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0695-0670"/> reading in the Hebrew text of the translators as
                    compared with the Massoretic text. And for this we must not confine ourselves to
                    one recension but use all recensions that our MSS. offer. For, though one
                    recension may be better than another, none of them has been exempt from the
                    influences under which the genuine Septuagint was brought into conformity with
                    the received Hebrew text, and those influenced have affected each recension in a
                    different way, and even differently in the different books. In this process, as
                    indeed in all textual criticism, much of course must be dependent on individual
                    judgment. But that it should be so appears to have been the design of
                    providence, which has permitted the Old Testament text to reach us in a form
                    that is often so corrupt as to sin against both the laws of logic and of
                    grammar—of rhetorical and poetical form. (J. <hi rend="smallcaps">we.)</hi></p>
