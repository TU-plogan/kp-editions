                    Greek colonies in Sicily, near the rivers Hypsas and Selinus on the south-west
                    coast, was founded, probably about 628 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, by
                    colonists from Megara Hyblaea in the east of Sicily and others from the parent
                    city of Megara on the Saronic Gulf of Greece (see Thuc., vi. 4, vii. 57, and
                    Strabo, vi. p. 272). The name of the city and the little river (see H in fig.)
                    on which it stands was derived from the wild parsley (creλtvov) which grew there
                    in abundance (comp. vol. xvii. p. 639). Many autonomous coins of Selinus exist,
                    dating from the 5th and 4th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The
                    tetradrachms have on the obverse a youth, representing the river Selinus,
                    sacrificing at an altar,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Sculptured on the altar is a cock, in allusion to the aid given by
                    Aesculapius against the fever which was caused by the marshy site. Drainage
                    works directed by Empedocles are said to have rendered the site healthy (Diog.
                    Laer., viii. 2, 11).</p></note> and, in the field, a parsley leaf,— legend,
                    ΣΕΑΙΝΟΣ; on the reverse, Apollo and Artemis in a biga,—legend, ΣEAINONTION
                    (retrograde). Didrachms have a similar obverse with the river Hypsas,—legend,
                    HYΨAΣ; reverse, Heracles slaying a bull, — legend, ΣEΛIN0NTI0N. As early as 580
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the citizens of Selinus were at war with the
                    adjoining people of Segesta, a non-Hellenic race who occupied the province north
                    of Selinus; the success of the Segestans on this occasion was mainly owing to
                    aid given them by colonists from Rhodes and Cnidus. Little is known about the
                    early history of Selinus; but the city evidently grew rapidly in wealth and
                    importance, and soon extended its borders 15 miles westwards to the river
                    Mazarus and eastwards as far as the Halycus (Diod., xiii. 54; Herod., v. 46).
                    Thucydides (vi. 20) mentions its power and wealth and especially the rich
                    treasures in its temples. From its early oligarchical form of government Selinus
                    passed to a short-lived despotism under the tyrant Pithagoras, who was deposed
                    soon after 510 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In 480 B.C., when the Carthaginian
                    Hamilcar invaded Sicily, the city took his side against their fellow Hellenes.
                    In 416 B.c. a new dispute between Selinus and Segesta was eventually the cause
                    of the fatal Athenian expedition against Sicily, the Athenians acting as allies
                    of Segesta and the Syracusans as allies of Selinus. The conclusion of this
                    expedition (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Syracuse)</hi> left Segesta at the mercy of
                    the Selinuntines, whose rapacity and cruelty soon brought about their own
                    destruction, through the aid which the Segestans obtained from Carthage. In 409
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Hannibal, with an overwhelming force, took and
                    destroyed the city, the walls of which were razed to the ground. He killed about
                    16,000 of the inhabitants, took 5000 prisoners, and only a remnant of 2600
                    escaped to Agrigentum (Diod., xiii. 54-59). The survivors were afterwards
                    allowed to return and to rebuild Selinus as a city subject to the Carthaginians,
                    under whose yoke, in spite of their attempts to regain freedom, the Selinuntines
                    remained till <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 250, the close of the First Punic War;
                    after this the Carthaginians transferred the inhabitants of Selinus to
                    Lilybaeum, and completely destroyed the city (Diod. xxiv.). It was never
                    rebuilt, and is mentioned by Strabo (vi. p. 272) as being one of the extinct
                    cities of Sicily.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Roman
                    sulphur baths existed under the name Thermae Selinuntiae, but these were about

                <p>The ancient city occupied two elevated plateaus at the edge of the sea and also
                    part of the surrounding plain. The western of these elevations formed the
                    acropolis; on the other was the agora. The walls of the acropolis can still be
                    traced round the whole circuit; the only entrance was on the north-east. Remains
                    also exist of long walls connecting the city and its port. The chief glory of
                    Selinus was its double group of great temples,—three on the acropolis and three
                    in the agora, one of which was the largest peripteral temple in the world. All
                    are completely ruined, but the materials of each still remain almost perfect,
                    though scattered in confused heaps of stone; the extraordinary completeness of
                    these fragments is owing to the fact that the site has never been occupied since
                    the final transference of the inhabitants in 250 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    and thus the scattered blocks have never been taken as materials for later

                    in the quarry. It is a brown tufa-like stone.</p></note> none are later than the

                    date from about 628 B.c., soon after the first settlement. The sculptured
                    metopes from three of the temples are among the most important examples of early
                    Hellenic art (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Archaeology,</hi> vol. ii. p. 349, and
                    Benndorf, <hi rend="italic">Lie Metopen von Selinunt).</hi> The buildings
                    themselves are of the highest interest, being the earliest known examples of the
                    Doric style, and differing in many important details from all other examples,
                    even such early ones as the temples at Corinth and Syracuse.</p>
                <p>The three temples on the acropolis (A, C, D in fig.) stand side by side, with
                    their axes north-west to south-east; all are hexastyle and peripteral, with
                    either thirteen or fourteen columns on the sides. Their stylobates have four
                    high steps along the sides, with an easier approach of more steps at the
                    northwest fronts. To the middle one of the three belong the very archaic metopes
                    described in vol. ii. p. 349. All have a rather narrow cella with pronaos and
                    opisthodomus. Their archaic peculiarities are the rapid diminution of the
                    columns, the absence of entasis, the narrow mutules over the metopes, and
                    especially a curious cavetto or necking under the usual hypotrachelia. No other
                    example of this feature was known till 1884, when Dr Schliemann and Dr Dörpfeld
                    discovered a similar Doric capital among the ruins of the citadel of Tiryns. The
                    Tiryns capital dates probably from a little before 600 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> and appears to be nearly contemporary with that at Selinus. Between
                    temples A and C are remains of a small prostyle tetrastyle aedicula (B) of the
                    Doric order.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Strange to
                    say, Hittorff and Zanth (<hi rend="italic">Architecture Antique de Sicile,</hi>
                    Paris, 1870), in their elaborate work on this subject, restore this aedicula
                    with a Doric entablature on Ionic columns; a good many other similar absurdities
                    occur in this richly illustrated work. More judgment is shown in Serradifalco’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Antica Selinunto</hi> (Palermo, 1831-42), though it is not
                    always accurate in measurements.</p></note> The second group of three Doric
                    temples (E, F, G) belongs to a rather later date,—probably 500 to 440 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The first two (E and F) have very narrow cellae, so
                    that they are pseudodipteral. They also are hexastyle, with fourteen columns on
                    the sides. Though still early in detail, they are without the curious necking of
                    the acropolis temples. The sculptured metopes of temple E are of extraordinary
                    beauty and interest, and appear to date from the finest period of Greek art—the
                    age of Phidias or perhaps that of Myron. The chief subjects are Zeus and Hera on
                    Mount Olympus, Artemis and Actaeon, and Heracles defeating an Amazon. They are
                    of the noblest style, simple and highly sculpturesque in treatment, and full of
                    grace and expression. One remarkable peculiarity in their technique is that the
                    nude parts of the female figures (heads, feet, and hands) are executed in white
                    marble, while the rest of the reliefs are in the native grey tufa, which
                    originally was covered with marble-dust stucco and then painted. The whole of
                    the stonework of all the temples was treated in a similar way, and gives most
                    valuable examples of early Greek coloured decoration. Recent excavations at
                    Selinus have shown that in many cases the cornices and other architectural
                    features were covered with moulded slabs of terra cotta, all richly coloured<pb

                    peripteral temple of the whole Hellenic world, being almost exactly the same
                    size as the enormous pseudo - peripteral Olympeaeum at the neighbouring
                    Agrigentum. It was octastyle, pseudodipteral, with seventeen columns on the
                    sides, and measures 360 by 162 feet; the columns are 10 feet 7⅛ inches at the
                    base and were 48 feet 7 inches high. This gigantic building was never quite
                    completed, though the whole of the main structure was built. Most of the columns
                    still remain unfluted. In spite of the proportional narrowness of its cella, it
                    had an internal range of columns, probably two orders high, like those within
                    the cella at Paestum. The axes of these last three temples have exactly the same
                    inclination as those on the acropolis. The great temple of Zeus possesses some
                    of the curious archaisms of the acropolis temples, and, though never completed,
                    it was probably designed and begun at an earlier date than the two adjacent
                    buildings. These peculiarities are the ungracefully rapid diminution of the
                    shaft and the cavetto under the necking of the capitals. The whole of these six
                    massive buildings now lie in a complete state of ruin, a work of evidently
                    wilful destruction on the part of the Carthaginians, as the temple at Segesta,
                    not many miles distant, has still every column and its whole entablature quite
                    perfect; so it is impossible to suppose that an earthquake was the cause of the
                    utter ruin at Selinus. Few or no marks of fire are visible on the stone blocks.
