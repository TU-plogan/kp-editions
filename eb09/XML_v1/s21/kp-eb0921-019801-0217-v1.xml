                <p><label type="entry">SAINT-SIMON</label>, Louis <hi rend="smallcaps">de
                    Rouvray</hi> (or <hi rend="smallcaps">Rouvroy), Duc de</hi> (1675-1755), was
                    born at Versailles on 16th January 1675. He was the son of Claude de
                    Saint-Simon, who represented a family which had been established for many
                    centuries at La Ferté Vidame, between Mortagne and Dreux, and which claimed
                    descent from Charlemagne. Claude de Saint-Simon had been a page of Louis XIII.,
                    and, gaining the king’s favour as a sportsman, had received various preferments
                    and was finally created <hi rend="italic">duc et pair.</hi> This peerage is the
                    central fact in Saint-Simon’s history, and it is impossible to understand him
                    without understanding it. To speak, as one of his few biographers in English has
                    spoken, of “a young duke of recent creation,” and of the apparent absurdity of
                    such a young duke taking the aristocratic views which characterized Saint-Simon
                    through life, is to show the most deplorable ignorance of the facts. The French
                    peerage under the old <hi rend="italic">regime</hi> was a very peculiar thing,
                    difficult to comprehend at all, but quite certain to be miscomprehended if any
                    analogy of the English peerage, such as is implied in the observation just
                    quoted, is imported into the consideration. No two things could be more
                    different in France than ennobling a man and making him a peer. No one was made
                    a peer who was not ennobled, but men of the noblest blood in France and
                    representing their houses might not be, and in most cases were not, peers.
                    Derived at least traditionally and imaginatively from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >douze pairs</hi> of Charlemagne, the peers were supposed to represent the
                    chosen of the noblesse, and gradually, in an indefinite and constantly disputed
                    fashion, became associated with the parlement of Paris as a quasi-legislative
                    (or at least law-registering) and directly judicial body. But the peerage was
                    further complicated by the fact that not persons but the holders of certain
                    fiefs were made peers. Strictly speaking, neither Saint-Simon nor any one else
                    in the same case was made a peer, but his estate was raised to the rank of a <hi
                    rend="italic">duché pairie</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">comté pairie</hi> as the
                    case might be. If all analogies were not deceptive, the nearest idea of a French
                    peerage of the old kind may be obtained by an English reader if he takes the
                    dignity of a Scotch or Irish representative peer, then supposes that dignity to
                    be made hereditary, and then limits the heritableness of it not merely to
                    descent<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n218/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0218-0199"/> but to the tenure in direct succession of certain
                    estates. It must of course be understood that the peers were not elected but
                    nominated. Still they were in a way a standing committee representative of the
                    entire body of nobles, and it was Saint-Simon’s lifelong ideal and at times his
                    practical effort to convert them into a sort of great council of the nation.
                    These remarks are almost indispensable to illustrate his life, to which we may
                    now return. His mother, Claude de Saint-Simon’s second wife, was Charlotte de
                    l’Aubespine, who belonged to a family not of the oldest nobility but which had
                    been distinguished in the public service at least since the time of Francis I.
                    Her son Louis was well educated, to a great extent by herself, and he had had
                    for godfather and godmother no less persons than Louis XIV. and the queen. After
                    some tuition by the Jesuits (especially by Sanadon, the editor of Horace), he
                    betook himself in 1692, at the age of seventeen, to the career of arms, entering
                    the <hi rend="italic">mousquetaires gris.</hi> He was present at the siege of
                    Namur, and next year his father died. He still continued in the army and was
                    present at the battle of Neerwinden. But it was at this very time that he chose
                    to begin the crusade of his life by instigating, if not bringing, an action on
                    the part of the peers of France against Luxembourg, his victorious general, on a
                    point of precedence. He fought, however, another campaign or two (not under
                    Luxembourg), and in 1695 married Gabrielle de Durfort, daughter of the maréchal
                    de Lorges, under whom he latterly served. He seems to have regarded her with a
                    respect and affection not very usual between husband and wife at the time; and
                    she sometimes succeeded in modifying his aristocratic crotchets. But as he did
                    not receive the promotion he desired he flung up his commission in 1702. Louis,
                    who was already becoming sensitive on the point of military ill-success, and who
                    was not likely to approve Saint-Simon’s litigiousness on points of privilege,
                    took a dislike to him, and it -was only indirectly and by means of establishing
                    interest with the dukes of Burgundy and Orleans that he was able to keep
                    something of a footing at court. He was, however, intensely interested in all
                    the transactions of Versailles, and by dint of a most heterogeneous collection
                    of instruments, ranging from dukes to servants, he managed to obtain the
                    extraordinary secret information which he has handed down to us about almost
                    every event and every personage of the last twenty years of the “grand
                    monarque.” His own part appears to have been entirely subordinate. He was
                    appointed ambassador to Rome in 1705, but the appointment was cancelled before
                    he started. At last he attached himself to the duke of Orleans and, though this
                    was hardly likely to conciliate Louis’s good will to him, it gave him at least
                    (what was of the first importance in that intriguing court) the status of
                    belonging to a definite party, and it eventually placed him in the position of
                    tried friend to the acting chief of the state. He was able, moreover, to combine
                    attachment to the duke of Burgundy -with that to the duke of Orleans. Both
                    attachments were no doubt all the more sincere because of his undying hatred to
                    “the bastards,” that is to say, the illegitimate sons of Louis XIV. It does not
                    appear that this hatred was founded on moral reasons or on any real fear that
                    these bastards would be intruded into the succession. The true cause of his
                    wrath was that they had precedence of the peers.</p>
                <p>The death of Louis seemed to give Saint-Simon a chance of realizing his hopes.
                    The duke of Orleans was at once acknowledged regent and Saint-Simon was of the
                    council of regency, but no steps were taken to carry out his favourite vision of
                    a France ruled by the nobles for its good (it must always be understood that
                    Saint-Simon’s ideal was in no respect an aristocratic tyranny except of the
                    beneficent kind), and he had little real influence with the regent. He was
                    indeed gratified by the degradation of “the bastards,” and in 1721 he was
                    appointed ambassador to Spain to arrange for the marriage (not destined to take
                    place) of Louis XV. and the infanta. His visit was splendid; he received the
                    grandeeship, and, though he also caught the smallpox, he was quite satisfied
                    with the business. After his return he had little to do with public affairs. His
                    own account of the cessation of his intimacy with Orleans and Dubois, the latter
                    of whom had never been his friend, is, like his own account of some other events
                    of his life, obscure and rather suspicious. But there can be little doubt that
                    he was practically ousted by the favourite. He survived for more than thirty
                    years; but little is known of his life. His wife died in 1743, his eldest son a
                    little later; he had other family troubles, and he was loaded with debt. When he
                    died, at Paris on 2d March 1755, he had almost entirely outlived his own
                    generation (among whom he had been one of the youngest) and the prosperity of
                    his house, though not its notoriety. This last was in strange fashion revived by
                    a distant relation born five years after his own death, Claude Henri, Comte de
                    Saint-Simon, the subject of the preceding article.</p>
                <p>It will have been observed that the actual events of Saint-Simon’s life, long as
                    it was and high as was his position, are neither very numerous nor very
                    noteworthy. If nothing more had been known about him than was known at the time
                    of his death he would certainly not have deserved mention at length here.
                    Saint-Simon is, however, an almost unique example of a man who has acquired
                    great literary fame entirely by posthumous publications. He was an indefatigable
                    writer, and not merely from the time he left the army but much earlier he began
                    to set down in black and white all the gossip he collected, all his interminable
                    legal disputes of precedence, and a vast mass of unclassified and almost
                    unclassifiable matter. Host of his manuscripts came into the possession of the
                    Government, and it was long before their contents were published in anything
                    like fulness. Extracts and abstracts, however, leaked out and parts of the
                    manuscript were sometimes lent to privileged persons, so that some notion of the
                    unique value of Saint-Simon got abroad within twenty or thirty years of his
                    death. Partly in the form of notes on Dangeau’s <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi>
                    partly in that of original and independent memoirs, partly in scattered and
                    multifarious tracts and disquisitions, he had committed to paper an amount of
                    matter which has probably never been exceeded by any one except a professional
                    journalist, if indeed the parallel will hold even there. The new edition now
                    publishing of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> with the notes on Dangeau is
                    estimated to contain thirty large octavo volumes. Besides this, M. Drumont, M.
                    Faugère, and other independent workers are bringing out series of <hi
                    rend="italic">Oeuvres Inédites of</hi> a less gossiping and more technical
                    character found in different receptacles of the public archives. But the mere
                    mass of these productions is their least noteworthy feature, or rather it is
                    most remarkable as contrasting with their character and style. The voluminous
                    writer is usually thought of as least likely to be characterized by an original
                    and sparkling style. Saint-Simon, though careless and sometimes even
                    ungrammatical, ranks among the most striking memoir writers of France, the
                    country richest in memoirs of any in the world. His pettiness, his absolute
                    injustice to his private enemies and to those who espoused public parties with
                    which he did not agree, the bitterness which allows him to give favourable
                    portraits of hardly any one, his omnivorous appetite for gossip, his lack of
                    proportion and perspective, are all lost sight of in admiration of his
                    extraordinary genius for historical narrative and character-drawing of a certain
                    sort. He has been compared to Tacitus, and for once the comparison, so often
                    made and generally so ludicrously out of place, is just. In the midst of his
                    enormous mass of writing phrases scarcely inferior to the Roman’s occur
                    frequently, and here and there passages of sustained description equal for
                    intense concentration of light and life to those of Tacitus or of any other
                    historian. As may be expected from the vast extent of his work, it is in the
                    highest degree unequal. But he is at the same time not a writer who can be
                    “sampled” easily, inasmuch as his most characteristic phrases sometimes occur in
                    the midst of long stretches of quite uninteresting matter. Hence he has been
                    even since his discovery more praised than read, and better liked by critics
                    than by the general reader. A few critical studies of him, especially those of
                    Sainte-Beuve, are in fact the basis of much, if not most, that has been written
                    about him. Yet no one is so little to be taken at second-hand. Even his most
                    famous passages, such as the account of the death of the dauphin or of the bed
                    of justice where his enemy the duke of Maine was degraded, will not give a fair
                    idea of his talent. These are his gallery pieces,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n219/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0219-0200"/> his great “machines,” as French art slang calls
                    them. Much more noteworthy as well as more frequent are the sudden touches which
                    he gives. The bishops are “cuistres violets”; M. de Caumartin “porte sous son
                    manteau toute la fatuité que M. de Villeroy étale sur son baudrier"; another
                    politician has a “mine de chat fâché ”; a third is hit off as “comptant faire”
                    (“he would still be doing,” though Saint-Simon certainly did not know that
                    phrase). In short, the interest of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi>
                    independent of the large addition of positive knowledge which they make, is one
                    of constant surprise at the novel and adroit use of word and phrase. It is not
                    superfluous to inform the English reader that some of Macaulay’s most brilliant
                    portraits and sketches of incident are adapted and sometimes almost literally
                    translated from Saint-Simon.</p>
                <p>The 1st edition of Saint-Simon (some scattered pieces may have been printed
                    before) appeared in 1788. It was a mere selection in three volumes and was much
                    cut down before it was allowed to appear. Next year four more volumes made their
                    appearance, and in 1791 a new edition, still further increased. The whole, or
                    rather not the whole, was printed in 1829-30 and reprinted some ten years later.
                    The real creator of Saint-Simon, as far as a full and exact text is concerned,
                    was M. Chéruel, whose edition in 20 volumes dates from 1856 and was reissued
                    again revised in 1872. So immense, however, is the mass of Saint-Simon’s MSS.
                    that still another recension has been found necessary, and is now being
                    published by M. de Boislisle in the series of <hi rend="italic">Grands
                    Écrivains,</hi> but with M. Chéruel's sanction and assistance. Even this, as
                    above noted, will not exhaust available Saint-Simoniana, and it may be doubted
                    whether it will be possible for many years to place a complete edition on the
                    shelves. It must, however, be admitted that the matter other than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> is of altogether inferior interest and may be pretty
                    safely neglected by any one but professed antiquarian and historical students.
                    For criticism on Saint-Simon there is nothing better than Sainte-Benve’s two
                    sketches in the 3d and 15th volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Causeries du
                    Lundi.</hi> The latter was written to accompany M. Chéruel's 1st edition. In
                    English by far the most accurate treatment is in a recent Lothian prize essay by
                    E. Cannan (Oxford and London, 1885). (G. SA.)</p>
