                <p><label type="entry">SCOT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Michael</hi></label>, whose fame
                    as a magician has surrounded his history with legend, is sometimes claimed by
                    the Italians as a native of Salerno and by the Spaniards as a native of Toledo;
                    but there is no reason to doubt the Scottish origin to which his name testifies.
                    Scottish tradition is unanimous in identifying him with Sir Michael Scot of
                    Balwearie in Fifeshire, but the ascertainable dates place some difficulties in
                    the way of this. The traditional date of Scot’s birth is 1190, but this does not
                    harmonize well with the embassy to Norway attributed to Sir Michael Scot in
                    1290. Some accordingly have fixed the date of his birth approximately as 1214,
                    but apparently without any further reason than is afforded by the supposed date
                    of his death in 1291. But Jourdain<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Recherches sur les anciennes traductions
                    Latines d’Aristote,</hi> p. 133.</p></note> refers to certain manuscript
                    translations of Scot’s which are expressly dated “1217 at Toledo.” This would
                    accord fairly well with the date 1190, the translations being executed by Scot
                    soon after the conclusion of his student period. Scot is said to have studied at
                    Oxford, whence he proceeded, as was usual, to Paris, then the centre of
                    mediaeval learning, devoting himself especially to philosophy and mathematics.
                    Du Boulay, the historian of the university of Paris, adds that he received the
                    degree of doctor of theology and acquired a brilliant reputation in that
                    faculty. There is no evidence of this, however, in his writings. At Toledo,
                    where he also studied, Scot acquired a knowledge of Arabic. It is not likely
                    that his knowledge extended to Greek and the other Eastern tongues mentioned by
                    the earlier bibliographers. His knowledge of Arabic was sufficient to open up to
                    him the Arabic versions of Aristotle and the multitudinous commentaries of the
                    Arabians upon them, with which Western Christendom had only lately become
                    acquainted in Latin translations (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Scholasticism).</hi>
                    It also brought him into contact with the original works of Avicenna and
                    Averroes. His own first work was done as a translator. He was one of the savants
                    whom Frederick II. attracted to his brilliant court, and at the instigation of
                    the emperor he superintended (along with Hermannus Alemannus) a fresh
                    translation of Aristotle and the Arabian commentaries from Arabic into Latin.
                    There exist translations by Scot himself of the <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    Animalium,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">De Anima,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De
                    Coelo,</hi> along with the commentaries of Averroes upon them. This connexion
                    with Frederick and Averroes—both of evil reputation in the Middle Ages—doubtless
                    contributed to the formation of the legend which soon enveloped Michael Scot’s
                    name. His own books, however, dealing as they do almost exclusively with
                    astrology, alchemy, and the occult sciences generally, are mainly responsible
                    for his popular reputation. The chief of these according to the more critical
                    views of recent investigators are <hi rend="italic">Super Auctorem Spherεe,</hi>
                    printed at Bologna in 1495 and at Venice in 1631: <hi rend="italic">De Sole et
                    Luna,</hi> printed at Strasburg, 1622,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n491/mode/1up"

                    and containing more alchemy than astronomy, the sun and moon being taken as the
                    images of gold and silver; <hi rend="italic">De Chiromantia,</hi> an opuscule
                    often published in the 15th century; and, perhaps best known of all, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Physiognomia et de Hominis Procreatione,</hi> which saw no
                    fewer than eighteen editions between 1477 and 1660. This treatise is divided
                    into three books, of which the first deals with generation according to the
                    doctrine of Aristotle and Galen, the second with the signs by which the
                    character and faculties of individuals may be determined from observation of
                    different parts of the body. The <hi rend="italic">Physiognomia</hi> (which also
                    exists in an Italian translation) and the <hi rend="italic">Super Auctorem
                    Spherae</hi> expressly bear that they were undertaken at the request of the
                    emperor Frederick. To the above list should be added certain treatises in
                    manuscript,— <hi rend="italic">De Signis Planetarum; Contra Averrhoem in
                    Meteora; Notitia Convinctionis Mundi Terrestris cum Coelesti, et de Definitione
                    utriusque Mundi; De Praesagiis Stellarum et Elementaribus.</hi> Michael is said
                    to have foretold (after the double-tongued manner of the ancient oracles) the
                    place of Frederick’s death, which took place in 1250. The Italian tradition
                    makes Scot die in Sicily not long afterwards, stating that he foretold the
                    manner of his own death. Jourdain is inclined to agree with this approximate
                    date, observing that Scot is spoken of by Albert the Great as if he were already
                    dead, and that Vincent of Beauvais (d. <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 1268) quotes
                    him with the epithet “vetus.” But the generally received tradition makes him
                    return by way of England (where he was received with much honour by Edward I.)
                    to his native country. The ordinary account gives 1291 as the date of Scot’s
                    death. According to one tradition he was buried at Holme Cultram in Cumberland;
                    according to another, which Sir Walter Scott has followed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lay of the Last Minstrel,</hi> in Melrose Abbey. In the notes to
                    that poem, of which the opening of the wizard’s tomb forms the most striking
                    episode, Scott gives an interesting account of the various exploits attributed
                    by popular belief to the great magician. “In the south of Scotland any work of
                    great labour and antiquity is ascribed either to the agency of Auld Michael, of
                    Sir William Wallace, or the devil.” He used to feast his friends with dishes
                    brought by spirits from the royal kitchens of France and Spain and other lands.
                    His embassy to France alone on the back of a coal-black demon steed is also
                    celebrated, in which he brought the French monarch to his feet by the effects
                    which followed the repeated stamping of his horse’s hoof. Other powers and
                    exploits are narrated in Folengo’s Macaronic poem of <hi rend="italic">Merlin
                    Coccaius</hi> (1595). But Michael’s reputation as a magician was already fixed
                    in the age immediately following his own. He appears in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inferno</hi> of Dante (canto xx. 115-117) among the magicians and
                    soothsayers—</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>“Quell’ altro, che ne’ fianchi è cosi poco,</l>
                    <l>Michele Scotto fù; che veramente</l>
                    <l>Delle magiche frode seppe il giuoco.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>He is represented in the same character by Boccaccio, and is severely arraigned
                    by John Pico de Mirandola in his work against astrology, while Naudé finds it
                    necessary to defend his good name in his <hi rend="italic">Apologie pour les
                    grands personnages faussement accusés de magie.</hi></p>
