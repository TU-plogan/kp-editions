                <p><label type="entry">SAINT-JUST, <hi rend="smallcaps">Antoine</hi></label>
                    (1767-1794), French revolutionary leader, was born at Decize in the Nivernais on
                    25th August 1767. He was educated at Soissons, and showed his character at
                    school as ringleader of a plot to set the school buildings on fire. Saint-Just
                    was caught red-handed in the act of incendiarism, and, refusing to exhibit any
                    tokens of submission, was ignominiously expelled. His education, however, does
                    not appear to have been neglected; and the reports and speeches of his short and
                    stormy political career exhibit not a little scholarship, and in particular
                    considerable acquaintance with ancient history. Intoxicated with republican
                    ideas, Saint-Just threw himself with enthusiasm into the political troubles of
                    his time, had himself appointed an officer in the National Guard, and by
                    fraud—he being yet under age—admitted as a member of the electoral assembly of
                    his district. Ambitious of fame, he in 1789 published twenty cantos of
                    licentious verses under the title of <hi rend="italic">Organt,</hi> and this
                    work was afterwards reissued under the title of <hi rend="italic">My Pastimes;
                    or The New Organt.</hi> From that year onwards, however, the open turbulence of
                    his youth gave place to a rigorously stoical demeanour, which, united to a
                    policy tyrannical, uncompromisingly thorough, and pitilessly severe, became the
                    marked and startling characteristic of his life. He now entered into
                    correspondence with Robespierre, who thenceforward became his hero and ideal.
                    Robespierre invited him to Paris, felt flattered by his worship, saw that he
                    suited his purpose, and in a short time the two became hand and glove. Thus
                    supported, Saint-Just became deputy of the department of Aisne to the national
                    convention, where he made his first speech— gloomy, fanatical, remorseless in
                    tone—on 19th November 1792. He had but twenty months to live; but into these he
                    seemed to crowd the life of twenty years. In the convention, in the Jacobin
                    Club, and among the populace his relations with Robespierre became known, and he
                    was dubbed the “St John of the Messiah of the People.” Hardly a week passed
                    without the attention of France being arrested by his attitude or his
                    utterances. Both were anxiously watched, as the unfailing indication of the
                    trend of Robespierre’s designs. His appointment as a member of the committee of
                    public safety now placed him at the very height and centre of the political
                    fever-heat. In the name of this committee he was charged with the drawing up of
                    reports to the convention upon the absorbing themes of the overthrow of the
                    party of the Gironde, thereafter, when even the “Mountain” seemed to have fallen
                    in pieces, of the Hébertists, and finally, as the tragic sequel to the rupture
                    between Robespierre and Danton, of that denunciation of the latter which
                    consigned him and his followers to the guillotine. What were then called reports
                    were far less statements of fact than appeals to the passions; in Saint-Just’s
                    hands they furnished the occasion for a display of fanatical daring, of gloomy
                    eloquence, and of undoubted genius; and —with the shadow of Robespierre behind
                    them—they served their turn. Once a flash of cruel humour lighted up his angry
                    retorts, and it became memorable. Desmoulins, in jest and mockery, said of
                    Saint-Just—the youth with the beautiful cast of countenance and the long fair
                    locks—“He carries his head like a Holy Sacrament.”<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n196/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0196-0177"/> “And I,” savagely replied Saint-Just, “will make
                    him carry his like a Saint-Denis.” The threat was not vain: Desmoulins
                    accompanied Danton to the scaffold. The same ferocious inflexibility animated
                    Saint-Just with reference to the external policy of France. He proposed that the
                    national convention should itself, through its committees, direct all military
                    movements. This was agreed to, and Saint-Just was despatched to Strasburg, in
                    company with Lebas, to superintend operations. It was suspected that the enemy
                    without was being aided by treason within. Saint-Just’s remedy was direct and
                    terrible: he followed his experience in Paris, “organized the Terror,” and soon
                    the heads of all suspects were falling under the guillotine. The conspiracy was
                    defeated, and the armies of the Rhine and the Moselle having been inspirited by
                    success—Saint-Just himself taking a fearless part in the actual fighting—and
                    having effected a junction, the frontier was delivered. Later, with the army of
                    the North, he wrought similar magical changes in the aspect of affairs. Before
                    the generals he placed the terrible dilemma of victory over the enemies of
                    France or trial by the dreaded revolutionary tribunal; and before the eyes of
                    the army itself he organized a force which was specially charged with the
                    slaughter of those who should seek refuge from the enemy by flight. Success
                    again crowned his terrible efforts, and Belgium was gained for France. Meanwhile
                    affairs in Paris looked gloomier than ever, and Robespierre recalled Saint-Just
                    to the capital. As the storm was gathering Saint-Just gave it direction by
                    mooting the dictatorship of his master as the only remedy for the convulsions of
                    society. At last, at the famous sitting of the 9th Thermidor, he ventured to
                    present as the report of the committees of general security and public safety a
                    document expressing his own views, a sight of which, however, had been refused
                    to the other members of committee on the previous evening. Then the storm broke.
                    He was vehemently interrupted, and the sitting ended with an order for
                    Robespierre’s arrest (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Robespierre).</hi> On the
                    following day, 28th July 1794, twenty-two men, nearly all young, were
                    guillotined. Robespierre was one, aged thirty-six; Saint-Just another, aged
                    twenty-six.</p>
