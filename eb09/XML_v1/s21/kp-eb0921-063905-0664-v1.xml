                    spouse Semiramis, who was first the wife of his captain, Onnes, but won the
                    king’s love by an heroic exploit, the capture of Bactra, which had defied the
                    royal forces. Ninus died, and Semiramis, succeeding to his power, traversed all
                    parts of the empire, erecting great cities (especially Babylon) and stupendous
                    monuments or opening roads through savage mountains. She was unsuccessful only
                    in an attack on India. At length, after a reign of forty-two years, she
                    delivered up the kingdom to her son Ninyas and disappeared, or, according to
                    what seems to be the original form of the story, was turned into a dove and was
                    thenceforth worshipped as a deity. This legend is certainly not Assyrian or
                    Babylonian; Ctesias must have had it from Persians or Medes, and the fulness of
                    detail, the multitude of proper names, favour the conjecture that Ninus and
                    Semiramis were celebrated in some Median epic tale which went on to tell of the
                    fall of Assyria before the Medes (Duncker, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d.
                    Alt.,</hi> 5th ed., ii. 18 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> In this legend all the
                    conquests of Assyria were crowded together into one lifetime, and King Ninus and
                    his son Ninyas are mere eponyms of Nineveh, personifications of the Assyrian
                    monarchy. But it is round the figure of Semiramis that all the real interest of
                    the legend gathers; nor can she be the arbitrary creation of a poet, for it is
                    certain that her name was popularly connected with many famous places and
                    monuments. “The works of Semiramis,” says Strabo (xvi. 1, 2), “are pointed out
                    through almost the whole continent, earthworks bearing her name, walls and
                    strongholds, aqueducts, and stair-like roads over mountains, canals, roads, and
                    bridges.” Ultimately every stupendous work of antiquity by the Euphrates or in
                    Iran seems to have been ascribed to her,—even the Behistun inscriptions of
                    Darius (Diod., ii. 13). Of this we already have evidence in Herodotus, who,
                    though he does not know the legend afterwards told by Ctesias, ascribes to her
                    the banks that confined the Euphrates (i. 184) and knows her name as borne by a
                    gate of Babylon (iii. 155). Various places in Media bore the name of Semiramis,
                    but slightly changed, even in the Middle Ages (Hoffmann, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syrische Akten,</hi> p. 137), and the old name of Van was Shamirama-gerd,
                    Armenian tradition regarding her as its founder (St Martin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mém. sur L'Arménie,</hi> i. 138). These facts are to be explained by observing
                    that in her birth as well as in her disappearance from earth Semiramis clearly
                    appears not as a mere woman but as a great goddess. In Diodorus’s account she is
                    the daughter of the Derceto of Ascalon and miraculously brought up by doves, and
                    again she is finally transformed into a dove, and therefore the Assyrians pay
                    divine honours to this bird. Semiramis, therefore, is a dove-goddess associated
                    with Derceto the fish-goddess. The same association of the fish and dove
                    goddesses appears at Hierapolis (Bambyce, Mabbug), the great temple at which
                    according to one legend was founded by Semiramis <hi rend="italic">(De Dea
                    Syria,</hi> 14), and where her statue was shown with a golden dove on her head
                    <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> 33, comp. 39).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is noteworthy in this connexion that
                    Mabbug is the <hi rend="italic">Ninus vetus</hi> of Ammianus and Philostratus.
                    .</p></note> But the Semitic dove-goddess is Ishtar or Astarte, the great
                    goddess of Assyria and Babylon, and the irresistible charms of Semiramis, her
                    sexual excesses (see especially Dinon in Aelian, <hi rend="italic">V. H.,</hi>
                    vii. 1 ), and other features of the legend all bear out the view that she is
                    primarily a form of Astarte, and so fittingly conceived as the great queen of
                    Assyria. The word Semirāmis in Semitic form, as the Syrians write it, is
                    Shĕmirâm (Hoffmann, <hi rend="italic">ut supra</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> an
                    epithet rather than a proper name, which may be rendered “the highly
                    celebrated,” or perhaps rather “name [manifestation] of [the god] Rām.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cp. the Phoenician “Astarte
                    ⅛l2Dt}D ’ (C.I.S. i. 1, No. 3, 1. 18).</p></note> The historical inference from
                    all this is that Semitic worship was carried by the Assyrians far into Media and
                    Armenia.</p>
                <p>On an Assyrian inscription the name Sammuramat appears as borne by the “lady of
                    the palace” of Rammannivar (812-783 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.);</hi> see
                    Schrader, <hi rend="italic">K.A.T.,</hi> 2d ed., p. 366. E. Meyer <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gesch. des Alterth.,</hi> p. 409) combines this with the
                    statement of Herodotus that Semiramis lived five generations before Nitocris,
                    which would make her date 766 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Possibly Herodotus
                    identified the two names, but it is very doubtful whether they are really
                    connected. Shemiramoth (1 Chron. xv. 18) perhaps means “statues of Semiramis,”
                    and, if so, was originally a place-name (Ewald, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a.l</hi>.).</p>
