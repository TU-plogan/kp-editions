                    (1793-1864), a North-American traveller, ethnologist, and author, was born 28th
                    March 1793 at Watervliet (now called Guilderland), Albany county, New Vork, and
                    died at Washington 10th December 1864. After studying chemistry and mineralogy
                    at college he had several years’ experience of their practical application,
                    especially at a glass-factory of which his father was manager, and in 1817
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Vitreοlοgy.</hi> In the following year he was
                    appointed to the Geological Survey of Missouri and Arkansas, and in 1819 he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">View of the Lead Mines of Missouri.</hi> Soon
                    after he accompanied General Cass as geologist in his expedition to the Lake
                    Superior copper region, and evinced such capacity for good exploring work on the
                    frontier that in 1823 he was appointed “agent for Indian affairs.” He then
                    married the granddaughter of an Indian chief; and during several years’ official
                    work near Lake Superior he acquired a vast fund of accurate information as to
                    the physique, language, social habits, and tribal institutions of the American
                    natives. From 1828 to 1832 Schoolcraft was an active member of the Michigan
                    legislature, during the same period delivering lectures on the grammatical
                    structure of the Indian language, which procured him the gold medal of the
                    French Institute. In 1832 also, when on an embassy to some Indians, he
                    ascertained the real source of the Mississippi to be Lake Itasca.</p>
                <p>Previous to 1832 he had published <hi rend="italic">Travels in the Central
                    Portions of the Mississippi Valley,</hi> and in 1839 appeared his <hi
                    rend="italic">Algic Researches,</hi> containing “Memoirs of a Residence of
                    Thirty Years with the Indian Tribes,” and also, notably, “The Myth of Hiawatha
                    and other Oral Legends,”—probably the first occurrence of the name immortalized
                    (in 1855) in Longfellow’s poem. Schoolcraft’s literary activity was indeed
                    remarkable, since, besides his ethnological writings, he composed a considerable
                    quantity of poetry and several minor prose works, especially <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notes on the Iroquois</hi> (1848), <hi rend="italic">Statistics of the Six
                    Nations</hi> (1845), <hi rend="italic">Scenes and Adventures in the Ozark
                    Mountains</hi> (1853). His principal book, <hi rend="italic">Historical and
                    Statistical Information respecting the Indian Tribes of the United States,</hi>
                    illustrated with 336 well-executed plates from original drawings, was issued
                    under the patronage of Congress in six quarto volumes, from 1851 to 1857. It is
                    a vast mine of ethnological researches as to the Red Men of America,
                    systematically arranged and fully, if not exhaustively, detailed,—describing not
                    only their origin, history, and antiquities, but the physical and mental “type,”
                    the tribal characteristics, the vocabulary and grammar, the religion and
                    mythology. Schoolcraft’s diplomatic work on the Indian frontier was
                    important,—more than sixteen millions of acres being added to the States’
                    territory by means of treaties which he negotiated.</p>
