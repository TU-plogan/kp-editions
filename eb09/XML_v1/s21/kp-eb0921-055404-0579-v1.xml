                <p><label type="entry">SCRUB-BIRD</label>, the name (for want of a better, since it
                    is not very distinctive) conferred upon the members of an Australian genus, one
                    of the most curious ornithological types of the many furnished by that country.
                    The first examples were procured by the late Mr Gilbert between Perth and
                    Augusta in West Australia, and were described by Gould in the Zoological
                    Society’s <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for 1844 (pp. 1, 2) as forming a
                    new genus and species under the name of <hi rend="italic">Atrichia clamosa,</hi>
                    the great peculiarity observed by that naturalist being the absence of any
                    bristles around the gape, in which respect alone it seemed to differ from the
                    already known genus <hi rend="italic">Sphenura.</hi> In March 1866 Mr Wilcox
                    obtained on the banks of the Richmond river on the eastern side of Australia
                    some other examples, which proved the existence of a second species, described
                    by Mr Ramsay in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for that year (pp.
                    438-440) as <hi rend="italic">A. rufescens;</hi> but still no suspicion of the
                    great divergence of the genus from the ordinary Passerine type was raised, and
                    it was generally regarded as belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Maluridae</hi>
                    or Australian Warblers. However, the peculiar formation of the sternum in <hi
                    rend="italic">Atrichia</hi> attracted the present writer’s attention almost as
                    soon as that of <hi rend="italic">A. clamosa</hi> was exhibited in the museum of
                    the College of Surgeons, and at his request Mr Ramsay a little later sent to the
                    museum of the university of Cambridge examples in spirit of <hi rend="italic">A.
                    rufescens,</hi> which shewed a common structure. One of the sternal
                    peculiarities was noticed by Mr Sclater <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1874, p.
                    191, note); and in the present work <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> iii. p.
                    741) the Scrub-birds were declared to form a distinct Family, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atrichiidae,</hi> standing, so far as was known, alone with the Lyre-birds (see

                    the known species of Scrub-bird are about the size of a small Thrush— <hi
                    rend="italic">A. clamosa</hi> being the larger of the two. This species is brown
                    above, each feather barred with a darker shade; the throat and belly are reddish
                    white, and there is a large black patch on the breast; while the flanks are
                    brown and the lower tailcoverts rufous. <hi rend="italic">A. rufescens</hi> has
                    the white and black of the fore-parts replaced by brown, barred much as is the
                    upper plumage. Both species are said to inhabit the thickest “scrub” or
                    brushwood forest; but little has been ascertained as to their mode of life
                    except that the males are noisy, imitative of the notes of other birds, and
                    given to violent gesticulations. The nest and eggs seem never to have been
                    found, and indeed no example of the female of either species is known to have
                    been procured, whence that sex may be inferred to escape observation by its
                    inconspicuous appearance and retiring habits. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
