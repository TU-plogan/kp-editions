                    >The</hi></label>, according to the most common form of an old legend of Syrian
                    origin, first referred to in Western literature by Gregory of Tours <hi
                    rend="italic">(De Glor. Mart.,</hi> c. 95), were seven Christian youths of
                    Ephesus, who, to escape the rage of Decius, lived for some time in concealment
                    in a cave. The enemy at last, however, discovered their hiding place, and caused
                    great stones to be rolled to its mouth that they might die of hunger. The
                    martyrs fell asleep in a mutual embrace. The occurrence had long been forgotten,
                    when it fell out, in the thirtieth year of Theodosius II., 196 years afterwards,
                    that a certain inhabitant of Ephesus, seeking shelter for his cattle,
                    rediscovered the cave on Mount Coelian, and, letting in the light, awoke the
                    inmates, who sent one of their number down to buy food. Cautiously approaching
                    the city, the lad was greatly astonished to find the cross displayed over the
                    gates, and on entering to hear the name of Christ openly pronounced. By
                    tendering coin of the time of Decius at a baker’s shop he roused suspicion, and
                    in his confusion being unable to explain how he had come by the money he was
                    taken before the authorities as a dishonest finder of hidden treasure. He was
                    easily able to confirm the strange story he now had to tell by actually leading
                    his accusers to the cavern where his six companions were found, youthful and
                    rosy and beaming with a holy radiance. Theodosius, hearing what had happened,
                    hastened to the spot in time to hear from their lips that God had wrought this
                    wonder to confirm his faith in the resurrection of the dead. This message once
                    delivered, they again fell asleep.<pb break="no"

                    interpretation of “a certain Syrian”; in point of fact the story is very common
                    in Syriac sources. It forms the subject of a homily of Jacob of Sarug <hi
                    rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 521 A.D.), which is given in the <hi rend="italic">Acta
                    Sanctorum.</hi> Another Syriac version is printed in Land’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anecdota,</hi> iii. 87 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; see also Barhebraeus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrom Eccles.,</hi> i 142 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and compare
                    Assemani, <hi rend="italic">Bib. Or.,</hi> i. 335 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>
                    Some forms of the legend give, eight sleepers,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> an
                    ancient MS. of the 6th century now in the British Museum <hi rend="italic">(Cat.
                    Syr. MSS.,</hi> p. 1090). There are considerable variations as to their names.
                    The legend rapidly attained a wide diffusion throughout Christendom; its
                    currency in the East is testified by its acceptance by Mohammed (sur. xviii.),
                    who calls them <hi rend="italic">Ashāb al-Kalif,</hi> “the men of the cave.”
                    According to Al-Binúní <hi rend="italic">(Chronology,</hi> tr. by Sachau, p.
                    285) certain undecayed corpses of monks were shown in a cave as the sleepers of
                    Ephesus in the 9th century. The seven sleepers are a favourite subject in early
                    mediaeval art.</p>
