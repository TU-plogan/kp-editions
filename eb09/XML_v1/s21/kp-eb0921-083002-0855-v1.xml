                <p><label type="entry">SHOEMAKING</label>. The simplest foot-protector is the
                    sandal, which consists merely of a sole attached to the foot, usually by leather
                    thongs. The use of this the archaeologist can trace back to a very early period;
                    and the sandal of plaited grass, palm fronds, leather, or other material still
                    continues to be the most common foot-covering among Oriental races. Where
                    climate demanded greater protection for the foot, the primitive races shaped a
                    rude shoe out of a single piece of untanned hide; this was laced with a thong,
                    and so made a complete covering. Out of these two elements—sole without upper
                    and upper without sole—arose the perfected shoo and boot, which consist of a
                    combination of both. A collection illustrating the numerous forms and varieties
                    of foot-covering, formed by M. Jules Jacquemart, is now in the Cluny Museum in
                    Paris. It embraces upwards of 300 specimens of ancient, mediaeval, and modern
                    times, with a special series illustrating the artistic and historical side of
                    the subject in France from the 15th century, and contains examples of the many
                    varieties of foot-covering in use, especially in the East, at the present day.
                    (Compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Costume.)</hi><hi rend="italic">Wooden
                    Shoes.—</hi> The simplest foot-covering, largely used throughout Europe, is the
                    wooden shoe, made from a single piece of wood roughly cut into shoe form. The
                    towns of Mende and Villefort (dep. Lozère) are the headquarters of the wooden
                    shoe trade in France, about 1700 persons there finding employment in the manu
                    facture. Analogous to this industry is the clog-making trade of the midland
                    counties of England. Clogs, known also as pattens, are wooden soles to which
                    shoe or boot uppers are attached. Sole and heel are made of one piece from a
                    block of maple or ash two inches thick, and a little longer and broader than the
                    desired size of shoe. The outer side of the sole and heel is fashioned with a
                    long chisel-edged implement, called the dogger’s knife or stock; a second
                    implement, called the groover, makes a groove about one-eighth of an inch deep
                    and wide round the side of the solo; and by means of a hollower the contour of
                    the inner face of the sole is adapted to the shape of the foot. The uppers of
                    heavy leather, machine sewed or riveted, are fitted closely to the groove around
                    the sole, and a thin piece of leather-binding is nailed on all round the edges,
                    the nails being placed very close, so as to give a firm durable fastening. These
                    clogs are of great advantage to all who work in damp sloppy places, keeping the
                    feet dry and comfortable in a manner impossible with either leather or
                    india-rubber. They are consequently largely used on the Continent by
                    agricultural and forest labourers, and in England and the United States by
                    dyers, bleachers, tanners, workers in sugar - factories, chemical works,
                    provision packing warehouses, &amp;c. There is also a considerable demand for
                    expensive clogs, with finely trimmed soles and fancy uppers, for use by
                    clog-dancers and others on the stage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufacture of Leather Shoes.—</hi> There are two main
                    divisions of work comprised in ordinary shoemaking. The minor division— the
                    making of “turn shoes”—embraces all work in which there is only one thin
                    flexible sole, which is sewed to the upper while outside in and turned over when
                    completed. Slippers and ladies’ thin house boots are examples of this class of
                    work. In the other division the upper is united to an insole and at least one
                    outsole, with a raised heel. In this are comprised all classes, shapes, and
                    qualities of goods, from shoes up to long-top or riding boots which reach to the
                    knee, with all their variations of lacing, buttoning, elastic-web side gussets,
                    &amp;c. The accompanying cuts (figs. 1 and 2) show the parts and trade names of
                    a riding boot, which is the supreme product of the craft.</p>
                <p>Till within recent times shoemaking was a pure handicraft; but now machinery
                    effects almost every operation in the art. On the factory system all human feet
                    are treated alike; in the handicraft, the shoemaker deals with the individual
                    foot, and he should produce a boot which for fit, comfort, flexibility, and
                    strength cannot be approached by the product of machinery.</p>
                <p>The shoemaker, after measuring the feet, cuts out upper leathers according to the
                    size and pattern. These parts are fitted and stitched together by the “boot -
                    closers”; but little of this closing is now done by hand. The sole “stuff” is
                    next cut out and assembled, consisting of a pair of inner soles of soft leather,
                    a pair of outer soles of firmer texture, a pair of welts or bands about one inch
                    broad, of flexible leather, and lifts and top-pieces for the heels. These the
                    “maker” mellows by steeping in water. He attaches the insoles to the bottom of a
                    pair of wooden lasts, which are blocks the form and size of the boots to be
                    made, fastens the leather down with lasting tacks, and, when dried, draws it out
                    with pincers till it takes the exact form of the last bottom. Then he “rounds
                    the soles,” by paring down the edges close to the last, and forms round these
                    edges a small channel or feather cut about one-eighth of an inch in the leather.
                    Next he pierces the insoles all round with a bent awl, which bites into, but not
                    through, the leather, and comes out at the channel or feather. The boots are
                    then “lasted,” by placing the uppers on the lasts, drawing their edges tightly
                    round the edge of the insoles, and fastening them in position with lasting
                    tacks. Lasting is a crucial operation, for, unless the upper is drawn smoothly
                    and equally over the last, leaving neither crease nor wrinkle, the form of the
                    boot will be bad. The welt, having one edge pared or chamfered, is put in
                    position round<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n856/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0856-0831"/> the sides, up to the heel or "seat,” and the
                    maker proceeds to " inseam,” by passing his awl through the holes already made
                    in the insole, catching with it the edge of the upper and the thin edge of the
                    welt, and sewing all three together in one flat seam, with a waxed thread. He
                    then pares off inequalities and “levels the bottoms,” by filling up the
                    depressed part in the centre with a piece of tarred felt; and, that done, the
                    boots are ready for the outsoles. After the leather for them has been thoroughly
                    condensed by hammering on the “lap-stone,” they are fastened through the insole
                    with steel tacks, their sides are pared, and a narrow channel is cut round their
                    edges; and through this channel they are stitched to the welt, about twelve
                    stitches of strong waxed thread being made to the inch. The soles are now
                    hammered into shape; the heel lifts are put on and attached with wooden pegs,
                    then sewed through the stitches of the insole; and the top-pieces, similar to
                    the outsoles, are put on and nailed down to the lifts. The finishing operations
                    embrace pinning up the edge of the heel, paring, rasping, scraping, smoothing,
                    blacking, and burnishing the edges of soles and heels, scraping, sand-papering,
                    and burnishing the soles, withdrawing the lasts, and cleaning out any pegs which
                    may have pierced through the inner sole. Of course, there are numerous minor
                    operations connected with forwarding and finishing in various materials, such as
                    punching lace-holes, inserting eyelets, applying heel and toe irons,
                    hob-nailing, &amp;c. To make a pair of common stout lacing boots occupies an
                    expert workman from fourteen to eighteen hours.</p>
                <p>The principal difficulties to overcome in applying machinery to shoemaking were
                    encountered in the operation of fastening together the soles and uppers. The
                    first success in this important operation was effected when means other than
                    sewing were devised. In 1809 David Meade Randolph obtained a patent for
                    fastening the soles and heels to the inner soles by means of little nails,
                    &amp;c. The lasts he used were covered at the bottom with plates of metal, and
                    the nails, when driven through the inner soles, were turned and clinched by
                    coming against the metal plates. To fix the soles to the lasts during the
                    operation the metal plates were each perforated with three holes, in which
                    wooden plugs were inserted, and to these the insoles were nailed. This invention
                    may be said to have laid the foundation of machine boot-making. In the following
                    year (1810) the inventor Μ. I. Brunel patented a range of machinery for
                    fastening soles to uppers by means of metallic pins or nails, and the use of
                    screws and staples was patented by Richard Woodman in the same year.</p>
                <p>Apart from sewing by machine or hand, three principal methods of attaching soles
                    to uppers are in use at present. The first is “pegging” with small wooden pins
                    or pegs driven through outsole and insole, catching between them the edges of
                    the upper. The points of the pegs which project through the insole are cut away
                    and smoothed level with the leather either by hand or by a machine pegging rasp.
                    The second is the system of “riveting or clinching” with iron or brass nails,
                    the points of the nails being turned or clinched by coming in contact with the
                    iron last used. The third method, screwing, has come into extensive use since
                    the standard screwing machine was introduced in America by the Mackay
                    Association of Boston, Massachusetts, and in Europe by the Blake &amp; Goodyear
                    Company of London. The standard screw machine, which is an American invention,
                    is provided with a reel of stout screw-threaded brass wire, which by the
                    revolution of the reel is inserted into and screwed through outsole, upper edge,
                    and insole. Within the upper a head presses against the insole directly opposite
                    the point of the screw, and the instant screw and head touch the wire is cut
                    level with the outsole. The screw, making its own hole, fits tightly in the
                    leather, and the two soles, being both compressed and screwed firmly together,
                    make a perfectly water-tight and solid shoe. The surface of the insole is quite
                    level and even, and as the work is really screwed the screws are steady in their
                    position, and they add materially to the durability of the soles. The principal
                    disadvantage in the use of standard screwed soles is the great difficulty met
                    with in removing and levelling down the remains of an old sole when repairs are
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>The various forms of sewing-machine by which uppers are closed, and their
                    important modifications for uniting soles and uppers, are also principally of
                    American origin. But the first suggestion of machine sewing was an English idea.
                    The patent secured by Thomas Saint in the English Patent Office in 1790, while
                    it foreshadowed the most important features of the modern sewing-machine,
                    indicated more particularly the devices now adopted in the sewing of leather.
                    After the introduction of the sewing-machine for cloth work its adaptation to
                    stitching leather both with plain thread and with heated waxed thread was a
                    comparatively simple task. The first important step in the more difficult
                    problem of sewing together soles and uppers by a machine was taken in the United
                    States by Lyman R. Blake in 1858. Blake’s machine was ultimately perfected as
                    the Mackay sole-sewing machine,—one of the most successful and lucrative
                    inventions of modern times. Blake secured his first English patent in 1859, his
                    invention being thus described: " This machine is a chain-stitch sewing-machine.
                    The hooked needle works through a rest or supporting surface of the upper part
                    of a long curved arm which projects upwards from the table of the machine. This
                    arm should have such a form as to be capable of entering a shoe so as to carry
                    the rest into the toe part as well as any other part of the interior of it; it
                    carries at its front end and directly under the rest a looper, which is
                    supported within the end of the arm so as to be capable of rotating or partially
                    rotating round the needle, while the said needle may extend into and through the
                    eye of the looper, such eye being placed in the path of the needle. The thread
                    is led from a bobbin by suitable guides along in the curved arm, thence through
                    a tension spring applied to the arm, and thence upwards through the notch of the
                    looper. The needle carrier extends upwards with a cylindrical block which can be
                    turned round concentrically with it by means of a handle. The feed wheel by
                    which the shoe is moved along the curved arm during the process of sewing is
                    supported by a slider extending downwards from the block, and applied thereto so
                    as to be capable of sliding up and down therein. The shoe is placed on the arm
                    with the sole upwards. The feed wheel is made to rest on the sole.” Blake’s
                    original machine was very imperfect and was incapable of sewing round the toe of
                    a shoe; but a principal interest in it coming into the hands of Gordon Mackay,
                    he in conjunction with Blake effected most important improvements in the
                    mechanism, and they jointly in 1860 procured United States patents which secured
                    to them the monopoly of wholly machine-made boots and shoes for twenty-one
                    years. On the outbreak of the Civil War in America a great demand arose for
                    boots, and, there being simultaneously much labour withdrawn from the market, a
                    profitable field was opened for the use of the machine, which was now capable of
                    sewing a sole right round. Machines were leased out to manufacturers by the
                    Mackay Company at a royalty of from 1/2 to 3 cents on every pair of soles sewed,
                    the machines themselves registering the work done. The income of the association
                    from royalties in the United States alone increased from $38,746 in 1863 to
                    $589,973 in 1873, and continued to rise till the main patents expired in 1881,
                    when there were in use in the United States about 1800 Blake-Mackay machines
                    sewing 50,000,000 pairs of boots and shoes yearly. The monopoly secured by the
                    Mackay Company barred for the time the progress of invention, notwithstanding
                    which many other sole-sewing machines were patented. Among the most important of
                    these is the Goodyear &amp; Mackay machines for welted shoes,—the first
                    mechanism adapted for sewing soles on lasted boots and shoes. These machines
                    originated in a patent obtained in 1862 in the United States by August Destory
                    for a curved-needle machine for sewing outsoles to welts, but the mechanism was
                    not successful till taken in hand by Charles Goodyear, son of the well-known
                    inventor in india-rubber fabrics. The Goodyear &amp; Mackay Company make two
                    machines for welted goods, one for sewing the inseam and the second for
                    stitching on the outsole. A large number of the latter form of machine are in
                    use, many manufacturers preferring to secure the welt or a midsole by the
                    standard screw machine, sewing to that the outsole with the Goodyear-Mackay
                    machine. The same company adapt a circular-needle machine to the sewing of turn
                    shoes, and this, with other similar machines, is in extensive use.</p>
                <p>The range of machinery used in a well-equipped shoe-factory is very extensive,
                    embracing machines for cutting leather, pressing rollers for sole leather, and
                    presses with cutting-dies for stamping out sole and heel pieces. There are also,
                    in addition to many kinds of sewing-machine, blocking or crimping appliances for
                    moulding uppers or vamps, vamp-folding machines, eyeleting machines, lasting
                    machines, trimming and paring machines for planing and smoothing the edges of
                    soles and heels. For finishing there are scouring, sand-papering, and burnishing
                    machines for the soles, and stamping machines for marks and monograms, with
                    peg-cutting and nail-rasping machines for smoothing, cleaning out, and dressing
                    the surface of the insole. In short, there is not a single operation necessary
                    in shoemaking, however insignificant, for which machinery has not been
                    devised.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of india-rubber goloshes, shoes, and fishing-boots, &amp;c.,
                    forms an important branch of the india-rubber industry rather than a department
                    of shoemaking (see <hi rend="smallcaps">India-rubber,</hi> vol. xii. p. 842). A
                    very considerable trade exists in boots and shoes with outer soles of
                    gutta-percha (see vol. xi. p. 339) in place of leather, the headquarters of that
                    trade being in Glasgow. (J. PA.)</p>
