                <p><label type="entry">SAN FRANCISCO</label>, a city of the United States, the
                    largest commercial city of California and of the Pacific coast, is situated in
                    37° 47' 22"·55 N. lat. and 122° 25' 40 ' 76 W. long., on the end of a peninsula
                    which has the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Bay of San Francisco on the
                    other. The width of this tongue of land within the city limits is about 6 miles,
                    and its whole length about 26. The original site of San Francisco was so
                    uninviting that many of the pioneers doubted if a place of much importance could
                    ever spring up there. The hills (Russian Hill, 360 feet; Telegraph Hill, 294
                    feet; and a number of others, ranging from 75 to 120 feet) were barren and
                    precipitous, and the interspaces, especially on the westerly side, were made up
                    largely of shifting sand-dunes; on the east side, however, the land sloped
                    gently towards the bay, and there was the further advantage of a small cove
                    extending inland nearly to the present line of Montgomery Street. This cove has
                    since been filled up and built over. After an attempt to found the commercial
                    metropolis at Benicia, 30 miles north on the Straits of Carquinez, it was
                    evident that no other place within easy distance from the ocean possessed so
                    many advantages for the site of a city as this barren peninsula. The Bay of San
                    Francisco is reached from the ocean through the Golden Gate, a strait about 5
                    miles long and averaging 1 mile in width, with a depth of 30 feet on the bar at
                    the entrance and from 60 to 100 feet within. The bay, which extends past the
                    city in a southsouth-east direction for about 40 miles, is about seven miles
                    wide in front of the city, while its greatest width is 12. Connected with the
                    Bay of San Francisco on the north by a strait 3 miles wide is San Pablo Bay,
                    about 10 miles in length and the same in breadth, having at its extreme
                    northerly end Mare Island, the site of the navy yard. This bay, again, is
                    connected by the Straits of Carquinez with Suisun Bay, 8 miles long and 4 wide.
                    The total length of these bays and connecting straits is 65 miles. This great
                    inland water, sheltered and for the most part navigable by the largest craft,
                    receives the two great rivers of California, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin.
                    In the Bay of San Francisco are Alcatraz Island (30 acres), strongly fortified;
                    Angel Island (800 acres), fortified; and Yerba Buena, or Goat Island (about 300
                    acres).</p>
                <p>The presidio or fortified settlement of San Francisco was founded on 17th
                    September 1776, and the mission (San Francisco de los Dolores) in the following
                    October. In 1830 the population of the presidio consisted of about fifty Spanish
                    soldiers and officers; these added to the number at the mission made an
                    aggregate population of about 200. Beechy, who visited the harbour and presidio
                    in 1826, has left the following description:—</p>
                <p>“The governor’s abode was in a corner of the presidio, and formed one end of a
                    row of which the other was occupied by a chapel; the opposite side was broken
                    down, and little better than a heap of rubbish and bones, on which jackals,
                    dogs, and vultures were constantly preying. The other two sides of the
                    quadrangle contained stone houses, artificers’ shops, and the jail, all built in
                    the humblest style with badly burned bricks and roofed with tiles. The chapel
                    and the Government house were distinguished by being whitewashed.”<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n282/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0282-0263"/> The presidio enclosure was about 300 yards
                    square. In 1834, when it was secularized and began to be known by the secular
                    name of Yerba Buena, the mission Dolores had a population of 500. In the summer
                    of 1846 an American man-of-war took possession of the place. In the early part
                    of 1849 the inhabitants numbered about 2000, and the embryo city had already
                    come to be known by its future name of San Francisco. In consequence of the
                    discovery of gold in California a strong drift of population set in towards the
                    placer mines, and at the end of 1849 there were 20,000 people in the city. The
                    first legislature of California granted a charter to San Francisco on 1st May
                    1850. Prior to that date the government of the pueblo had been administered by
                    an alcalde. The pueblo grant originally made by the king of Spain contained four
                    square (Spanish) leagues of land; this grant was subsequently confirmed to San
                    Fran cisco by an Act of Con gress. The jurisdiction of the municipality ex tends
                    over the islands in the bay. The area in cluded in the limits of the city
                    exceeds the original four square leagues con siderably, including what were
                    originally denomi nated “swamp and over flowed lands” (see Dwi-</p>
                <p>nelle’s <hi rend="italic">Colonial History).</hi></p>
                <p>In the first stages of its history the buildings of the city were chiefly of
                    wood,—in many cases the frames and coverings having been brought from the
                    Atlantic States round Cape Horn in sailing vessels. Within a few months of the
                    establishment of municipal government the city suffered severely on more than
                    one occasion from fire.</p>
                <p>The fire of 4th May 1850 destroyed property to the value of about $3,000,000;
                    another in the following month was still more destructive ($4,000,000); and the
                    damage resulting from a third in September was estimated at $500,000.</p>
                <p>These occurrences naturally led to the employment of more substantial building
                    material in some cases, granite being imported from China for some buildings,
                    and iron and brick being used to a considerable extent on others; but to this
                    day nearly all the private dwellings of the city are of wood. Since 1850,
                    however, the damage from fire in the portion of the city occupied by private
                    houses has been remarkably small,—partly because of the use of redwood instead
                    of pine. In the business houses erected recently the increase of solidity and
                    costliness has been very marked.</p>
                <p>Throughout a considerable part of the city the streets are laid out in
                    rectangular form, and nowhere with any reference to the natural elevations. The
                    most important business thoroughfare is Market Street, extending from the water
                    front at the ferry landings to the hills on the west, a distance of 3 miles or
                    more. The more important streets are paved for the most part with cobble stones
                    and basalt blocks; but asphalt on a stone or concrete foundation has begun to be
                    used. Among the public buildings and institutions of San Francisco are the mint,
                    appraisers’ stores, subtreasury, custom-house, merchants’ exchange, stock
                    exchange, city-hall, industrial school, house of correction, almshouse, Masonic
                    Temple, new Oddfellows’ building, safe deposit, and seven theatres and
                    opera-houses. The Palace Hotel cost $3,250,000, and can accommodate 1200 guests.
                    The city has eleven public squares. Its greatest attraction is the Golden Gate
                    Park of 1050 acres, 3 miles long and half a mile wide, having the ocean for its
                    extreme westerly boundary. The greater part of this area was formerly a shifting
                    sand-dune. An extensive glass-house in a central position is filled with the
                    rarest tropical and semi-</p>
                <p>tropical plants and shrubs; a large part of the area is planted with forest
                    trees, or is laid down in grass; the walks and drives are well planned and well
                    kept.</p>
                <p>San Francisco is traversed in various directions by horse railroads, which extend
                    from the water front to the suburbs. There are also 50 miles of wire cable
                    roads, which are yearly increasing. These cable tramways extend 2 miles on Clay
                    Street, overcoming an elevation of 120 feet. The cost of their construction and
                    equipment has ranged from $100,000 to $125,000 per mile. The speed is usually
                    about 5 miles an hour. San Francisco is the terminus of two continental
                    railways, viz., the Union and Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific; while a
                    third, the Atlantic and Pacific, enters the city over a leased line from Mohave.
                    Two narrow-gauge lines and one broad-gauge, each less than a hundred miles long,

                    the city by means of ferries.</p>
                <p>The population of San Francisco, as shown by the census returns, was 34,000 in
                    1850; in 1860, 56,802; in 1870, 149,473; and in 1880, 233,959 (132,608 males,
                    101,351 females); in 1885 it was estimated, on the basis of the school census,
                    at 275,000 (Chinese, 30,000). At the last presidential election (1884) the total
                    vote cast in the city was 50,167, the total foreign vote being 25,254; of these
                    12,837 were British (10,206 of them Irish) and 7052 Germans. Of the 90,468
                    children in the city under seventeen reported for the fiscal year 1884-85,
                    50,973 had foreign-born parents, and 15,460 more had one parent of foreign
                    origin. In social customs, trade usages, amusements, and religious observances,
                    the large foreign population of San Francisco contributes materially to the
                    formation of its liberal and cosmopolitan character.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration, Ac.—</hi> In July 1856 the city and county,
                    which until then had maintained separate governments, were consolidated in one
                    organization. The government is administered by a mayor and a board of twelve
                    supervisors, with the usual officers common to municipal and county
                    organizations. There is also a superior court having twelve departments, with
                    one judge for each, a police court, and justices’ courts. The supreme court of
                    the State holds a number of terms each year in San Francisco. The U.S. district
                    and circuit courts also hold regular terms in the city. There is a
                    well-organized and efficient police force of 400 men. On 1st July 1884 the fire
                    department had 315 men. The city is supplied with gas by two companies. Water is
                    supplied by the Spring Valley Company, principally from San Mateo county. The
                    water is brought in three lines of wrought-iron pipe; the largest, which
                    connects the Crystal Springs reservoir with the city, is 44 inches in diameter
                    and 23 miles in length. The daily consumption of water is about 18,000,000
                    gallons. The company is able to supply 25,000,000 gallons daily.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Finance.—</hi> The assessment roll of personal property in 1885
                    showed a value of $56,634,860,—that of real estate and improvements being
                    returned at $171,433,126. The actual value is not less than $350,000,000. The
                    debt of the municipality is 3 1/2 million dollars. There are twelve incorporated
                    commercial or discount banks, with an aggregate paid-up capital of $21,047,965,
                    and a surplus (1st July 1885) of $8,945,647. The total assets are set down at
                    $50,894,972. There are also a number of private banks. There are eight savings
                    banks, all but one of these having some paid-up capital, the aggregate of which
                    is $1,651,200. These banks on the 1st of July 1885 held deposits to the amount
                    of $52,577,746; they had also a surplus beyond the paid-up capital of
                    $2,067,209. The banks having a subscribed and paid-up capital pay regular
                    dividends on the entire amount of nominal capital and about 4½ per cent. per
                    annum to depositors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> The exports by water for the fiscal year
                    1884-85 amounted to $37,170,800, and the imports to $37,171,100; the items of
                    import and export by rail bring the total up to $80,000,000. The duties
                    collected on imports were $6,610,400. The treasure shipped amounted to
                    $17,540,000; and the exports of quicksilver were 14,900 flasks, valued at
                    $438,800. The receipts of treasure from all productive sources west of the
                    Missouri, including Mexico, reached a total of $40,253,635, and the coinage at
                    the mint in San Francisco was of the value of $23,750,000, with an addition of
                    $1,500,000 on foreign account The sailing ships entering the port numbered 619
                    (604,200 tons); the steamers were 225. Among the imports were—coffee, 19,505,800
                    lb; sugar, 152,374,870 lb; coal, 900,000 tons; lumber, 297,234,000 feet
                    (92,754,000 feet redwood, 177,305,000 feet pine, the remainder miscellaneous).
                    The exports of wheat were 1,001,900 tons, valued at $26,791,500; this quantity
                    was exported in 366 ships, the freights to Europe ranging from 25s. to 48s. 6d.
                    per ton. British iron sailing vessels have the preference for wheat exportation,
                    and obtain the highest rates. A much larger class of vessels is employed in this
                    trade than formerly, the cargoes now averaging about 3000 tons. There are
                    regular steamship lines connecting San Francisco with Mexican, Central American,
                    Australian, Hawaiian, Japanese, and Chinese ports, and with the chief port of
                    British Columbia. The Pacific Whaling Company owns five or six ships,
                    principally steamers, employed in the Arctic whale fishery. The same company has
                    also extensive works for refining the oil in San Francisco. There is one stone
                    dry dock admitting vessels of 6000 tons, and two or more floating docks which
                    can tike on vessels from 500 to 800 tons burthen. A sea-wall is in process of
                    construction by State authority round the deep-water front to prevent the
                    shoaling of the water in the slips resulting in part from the gradual washing
                    down of debris from the hills and steep slopes of the city.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> For many years manufactures made slow pro
                    gress. The city was remote from the great centres of population, and labour was
                    very costly. But these disadvantages have been gradually overcome. In 1875 there
                    were 18,000 persons employed in manufacturing establishments, and the value
                    produced was $40,000,000. In 1885 38,919 persons were so employed, and the
                    estimated value for the business year ending 1st July was $86,417,200. Subjoined
                    are some of the leading manufactures, with the number of persons employed and
                    the annual value of their production :—bags, 300, $1,500,000; boots and shoes,

                    may be added, 935 whites and 1300 Chinese were employed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Churches and Charities.—</hi> There are 70 Protestant churches
                    in the city, representing nearly all the denominations of the country. Besides
                    these there are 19 Roman Catholic churches and a number of chapels connected
                    with the various hospitals and schools. There are 7 synagogues and 1 Greek
                    church (Russian). Including the chapels, the total number of places of worship
                    may be set down at 100. With few exceptions, the church edifices are not
                    imposing. In consequence of the rapid growth of the city wood has been employed
                    in a majority of cases, but this is now being discarded for stone. The asylums
                    and benevolent associations are numerous and well-supported. The more prominent
                    of these institutions are the Protestant Orphan Asylum (214 children), Catholic
                    Orphan Asylum, Pacific Hebrew Orphan Asylum, Magdalen Asylum, Old People’s Home,
                    Ladies’ Protection and Relief Society, Little Sisters’ Infant Shelter, Seamen’s

                    Benevolent Society, San Francisco Fruit and Flower Mission, Young Men’s
                    Christian Association, Pacific Homoeopathic Dispensary, Lying-in Hospital.
                    Besides these there are a great number of associations which care for their
                    members, and in some instances provide the best medical attendance in private
                    hospitals. Nearly all classes of foreign nativity have established benevolent
                    associations; British, French, and German institutions have large resources, and
                    are managed with great efficiency. Nearly all the secret orders (Masonic,
                    oddfellows, &amp;c.) devoted in whole or in part to works of benevolence are
                    strongly represented.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Public Schools.—</hi> The first public school was established
                    in April 1849. There are now sixty-one free schools, with 43,265 pupils and an
                    average daily attendance of 32,183. The number of children in the city between
                    the ages of five and seventeen years according to the census report of 1880 was
                    69,000. The number of teachers, male and female, employed in the public school
                    department was 734, the number of schoolhouses 65, and the expenditure for the
                    fiscal year $817,168. The public schools are graded, the highest grades being
                    two high schools for boys and girls respectively. Besides the day schools a
                    number of evening schools are provided. There are upwards of 25,000 children who
                    arc to a large extent provided with instruction in public and private schools
                    other than those belonging to the free-school department. There are about 100
                    schools in the city, of all grades, which are supported wholly by fees and
                    voluntary contributions. Of these the Roman Catholics have the greatest number,
                    the latter including two colleges and a number of convent schools. The
                    Protestant denominations also have a number of classical and secondary schools
                    of great excellence. The public-school system of the State culminates in the
                    university of California, which has an aggregate endowment equal to about
                    $3,000,000. The institution is situated in the beautiful suburban town of
                    Berkeley, on the opposite side of the bay (named in honour of Bishop Berkeley).
                    Instruction is furnished free to all pupils who comply with the terms of
                    admission. There are also a number of professional schools in the city, chief
                    among which are the law, medical, and dental departments of the university, the
                    Cooper Medical College, the Hahnemann Medical College, the San Francisco
                    Theological Seminary, and an art school with an average attendance of about 75
                    students. The late James Lick left a bequest of $540,000 for the endowment of a
                    School of Mechanic Arts, and among other bequests a large one for the Academy of
                    Sciences, founded in the early period of the city. The public-school department
                    of San Francisco is under the immediate supervision of a superintendent and
                    twelve school directors, one for each ward of the city. There are eighteen
                    public libraries, including the free library with 52,970 volumes. The Mercantile
                    Library Association has 52,000 volumes, the Mechanics’<pb break="no"

                    Association 39,000, and the Law Library 23,355. There is also a rich and
                    extensive State mineralogical collection. (W. C. B.)</p>
