                <p><label type="entry">SEARCH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Right of</hi></label>. “The
                    right of visiting and searching ships on the high seas,” says Lord Stowell,
                    “whatever be the ships, whatever be the cargoes, whatever be the destinations,
                    is an incontestible right of the lawfully commissioned ship of a belligerent
                    nation; because till they are visited and searched it does not appear what the
                    ships or the cargoes or the destinations are; and it is for the purpose of
                    ascertaining these points that the necessity of this right of visitation and
                    search exists. This right is so clear in principle that no man can deny it who
                    admits the right of maritime capture, because if you are not at liberty to
                    ascertain by sufficient enquiry whether there is property which can be legally
                    captured, it is impossible to capture” (“The Maria,” 1 C. Robinson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 36). This right of search or visitation and search
                    has not been at all times recognized. The second armed neutrality of the Baltic
                    powers in 1800 attempted to withdraw their vessels from the right. The
                    bombardment of Copenhagen in 1801 was one of the results of this policy. Since
                    the convention which followed that event the right has been regarded as
                    established within proper limits, and is often regulated by treaty, especially
                    as to the search of vessels suspected of being engaged in the slave trade. Apart
                    from treaty, the main rules which govern the right are these. (1) It is a
                    belligerent right, and can be exercised only in time of war, unless in the case
                    of a vessel reasonably suspected of piracy or breach of revenue regulations. (2)
                    It can be exercised only by a ship of war duly commissioned by the sovereign of
                    the belligerent power and only in the case of a merchant vessel, whether of an
                    enemy or neutral power. (3) It cannot be exercised in neutral waters, and an
                    attempt to exercise it in such waters is a gross violation of neutrality. (4) It
                    can be exercised only for certain purposes, such as to examine the ship’s papers
                    and to see whether she carries any contraband goods. (5) After the ship of war
                    has raised her flag an affirming gun <hi rend="italic">(coup d’assurance)</hi>
                    loaded with blank cartridge must be fired to bring the merchant vessel to. (6)
                    In case of reasonable suspicion it is the duty of the ship of war to detain the
                    merchant vessel for the decision of a prize court. Resistance by a neutral
                    vessel, whether alone or in convoy, renders her liable to capture according to
                    the English and United States doctrine. But most Continental authorities lay
                    down that the declaration of the officer in charge of the convoy is to be
                    accepted, and that a refusal to accept such declaration may justify the convoy
                    in resisting search. There is also a conflict of opinion as to whether a neutral
                    loses his neutral rights by loading his goods on board an armed ship of the
                    enemy. It has been held in England that such a proceeding is a violation of
                    neutrality, as affording a presumption of resistance to search.</p>
                <p>The right of search is historically interesting, as on two occasions it has
                    brought Great Britain into collision with the United States. One of the causes
                    of the war of 1812 was the right then claimed (but since abandoned) by Great
                    Britain of searching vessels of the United States for British subjects serving
                    in them as seamen, with a view to impressing them for the royal navy. In 1861
                    the British mail steamer “Trent” was stopped on the high seas by a United States
                    ship of war, and Messrs Slidell and Mason, two commissioners of the Confederate
                    States proceeding to Europe, were taken out of her and afterwards imprisoned in
                    the United States. On diplomatic representations being made at Washington by the
                    ambassadors of Great Britain and other powers the commissioners were released,
                    and a war was avoided.</p>
