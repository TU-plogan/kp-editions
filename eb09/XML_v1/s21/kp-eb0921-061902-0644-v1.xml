                <p><label type="entry">SEDAN</label>, a town of France, the chef-lieu of an
                    arrondissement in the department of Ardennes, lies on the right bank of the
                    Meuse, 13 miles east-south-east of Mezières by the railway to Thionville
                    (Lorraine), and is surrounded by heights of about 1000 feet. Since its
                    fortifications were <hi rend="italic">déclassés,</hi> a process of embellishment
                    has been going on. Place Turenne takes its name from the statue of the
                    illustrious marshal, who was born in the town in 1611. The public buildings
                    include a Protestant church, a synagogue, a museum, and a college. The
                    manufacture of fine black cloth has long been, and still continues to be, the
                    staple industry, employing in the town and neighbourhood more than 10,000
                    workmen, and producing to the value of 40,000,000 francs annually. Several
                    spinning-mills have been erected by Alsatian refugees since 1871. Considerable
                    activity is also displayed in various departments of metal-working, especially
                    in the surrounding villages. The population was 13,807 in 1872, and 19,240 in
                    1881 (19,556 in the commune).</p>
                <p>Sedan was in the 13th century a dependency of the abbey of Mouzon, the possession
                    of which was disputed by the bishops of Liege and Rheims. United to the crown of
                    France by Charles V., it was ceded by Charles VI. to Guillaume de Braquemont,
                    who sold it to the La Mareks. For two centuries this powerful family managed to
                    continue masters of the place in spite of the bishops of Liege and the dukes of
                    Burgundy and Lorraine; and in the person of Henri Robert they adopted the title
                    “prince of Sedan.” In the 16th century the town was an asylum for many
                    Protestant refugees, who laid the basis of its industrial prosperity, and it
                    became the seat of a Protestant seminary. The last heiress of the La Marek
                    family brought Sedan and the duchy of Bouillon to Henri de la Tour d’Auvergne,
                    viscount of Turenne. When the new duke attempted to maintain his independence,
                    Henry IV. captured Sedan in three days; and the second duke (eldest brother of
                    the great marshal), who had several times revolted against Louis XIII., was at
                    last, after his share in the conspiracy of Cinq-Mars, obliged to surrender his
                    principality. Sedan thus became part of the royal domain in 1641. On 1st
                    September 1870 the fortress was the centre of the most disastrous conflict of
                    the Franco-German War. Shut in by the Germans, who had occupied the surrounding
                    heights, the whole French army, after a terrific contest, was obliged to
                    capitulate,—the emperor, 39 generals, 230 staff-officers, 2600 officers, and
                    83,000 men becoming prisoners of war. The village of Bazeilles was the scene of
                    the heroic stand made by the marines under Martin des Pallières. It now contains
                    the great ossuary, and a monument to the memory of the marines; and the house
                    which has been rendered famous by Neuville’s painting, “Les Dernières
                    Cartouches,” is a museum of objects found on the battlefield.</p>
