                    early, and of course has been repeated late, that this case or sheath was

                    its bill. It was first made known from having been met with on New-Year Island,
                    off the coast of Staten Land, where Cook anchored on New Year’s eve 1774.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Doubtless some of the earlier
                    voyagers had encountered it, as Forster suggests <hi rend="italic">(L·escr.
                    Animalium,</hi> p. 330) and Lesson asserts <hi rend="italic">(Man.
                    d'Ornithologie,</hi> ii. p. 343); but for all practical purposes we certainly
                    owe its discovery to the naturalists of Cook’s second voyage. By some error,
                    probably of transcription, New Zealand, instead of New-Year Island, appears in
                    many works as the place of its discovery, while not a few writers have added
                    thereto New Holland. Hitherto there is no real evidence of the occurrence of a
                    Sheathbill in the waters of Australia or New Zealand.</p></note> A few days
                    later he discovered the islands that now bear the name of South Georgia, and
                    there the bird was again found,—in both localities frequenting the rocky shores.
                    On his third voyage, while seeking some land reported to have been found by
                    Kerguelen, Cook in December 1776 reached the cluster of desolate islands now
                    generally known by the name of the French explorer, and here, among many other
                    kinds of birds, was a Sheathbill, which for a long while no one suspected to be
                    otherwise than specifically identical with that of the western Antarctic Ocean;
                    but, as will be seen, its distinctness has been subsequently admitted.</p>
                <p>The Sheathbill, so soon as it was brought to the notice of naturalists, was
                    recognized as belonging to a genus hitherto unknown, and the elder Forster in
                    1788 <hi rend="italic">(Enchiridion,</hi> p. 37) conferred upon it, from its
                    snowy plumage, the name <hi rend="italic">Chionis,</hi> which has most properly
                    received general acceptance, though in the same year the compiler Gmelin termed
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Vaginalis,</hi> as a rendering of Pennant’s English
                    name, and the species <hi rend="italic">alba.</hi> It has thus become the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chionis alba</hi> of ornithology. It is about the size of and has
                    much the aspect of a Pigeon;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the Falkland Isles it is called the “Kelp-Pigeon,” and by
                    some of the earlier French navigators the “Pigeon blanc antarctique.” The
                    cognate species of Kerguelen Land is named by the sealers “Sore-eyed Pigéon,”
                    from its prominent fleshy orbits, as well as “Paddy-bird”—the last doubtless
                    from its white plumage calling to mind that of some of the smaller Egrets,
                    so-called by the English in India and elsewhere.</p></note> its plumage is pure
                    white, its bill somewhat yellow at the base, passing into pale pink towards the
                    tip. Round the eyes the skin is bare, and beset with cream-coloured papillae,
                    while the legs are bluish-grey. The second or eastern species, first
                    discriminated by Dr Hartlaub <hi rend="italic">(Rev. Zoologique,</hi> 1841, p.

                    distinct, was at a loss to reconcile the discrepancies of the latter’s
                    description with that given of the other species by earlier authors.</p></note>
                    as <hi rend="italic">C. minor,</hi> is smaller in size, with plumage just as
                    white, but having the bill and bare skin of the face black and the legs much
                    darker. The form of the bill’s “sheath” in the two species is also quite
                    different, for in <hi rend="italic">C. alba</hi> it is almost level throughout,
                    while in <hi rend="italic">C. minor</hi> it rises in front like the pommel of a
                    saddle. Of the habits of the western and larger species not much has been
                    recorded. It gathers its food, consisting chiefly, as Darwin and others have
                    told us, of sea-weeds and shell-fish, on rocks at low water; but it is also
                    known to eat birds’ eggs. There is some curiously conflicting evidence as to the
                    flavour of its flesh, some asserting that it is wholly uneatable, and others
                    that it is palatable,—a difference which may possibly be due to the previous
                    diet of the particular example tasted, to the skill of the cook, or the need of
                    the taster. Though most abundant as a shore-bird, it is frequently met with far
                    out at sea, and its most northern recorded limit is by Fleurieu <hi
                    rend="italic">(Voy. de Marchand,</hi> i. p. 19), in lat. 44° S., some 260 miles
                    from the eastern coast of Patagonia. It is not uncommon on the Falkland Isles,
                    where it is said to breed <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1861, p. 154), though
                    confirmation of the report is as yet wanting, and from thence is found at both
                    extremities of the Strait of Magellan, and southward to Louis-Philippe Land in
                    lat. 60° S. On the other hand, thanks to the naturalists of the British and
                    United States expeditions to Kerguelen Land for the observation of the transit
                    of Venus in 1874, especially Mr Eaton <hi rend="italic">(Philos.

                    the eastern and smaller species, which had already been ascertained by Mr Layard
                    <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1871, p. 57, pl. iv. fig. 7) to

                    possession of the present writer, proving to be that of a Gull—a fact unknown to

                    numerously on Kerguelen, while it probably frequents Prince Edward’s Islands for
                    the same purpose. The eggs, of which a considerable number have now been
                    obtained, though of peculiar appearance, bear an unmistakable likeness to those
                    of some Plovers, while occasionally exhibiting a resemblance—of little
                    significance, however—to those of the Tropic-birds.</p>
                <p>The systematic position of the Sheathbills has been the subject of much
                    hesitation—almost useless since 1836, when De Blainville <hi rend="italic">(Ann.
                    Sc. Naturelles,</hi> ser. 2, vi. p. 97) made known certain anatomical facts
                    proving their affinity to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Oyster-catchers</hi> (vol.
                    xvii. p. 111), though pointing also to a more distant relationship with the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gulls</hi> (vol. xi. p. 274). These he afterwards described
                    more fully <hi rend="italic">(Vοy. “Bonite” Zoologie,</hi> i. pt. 3, pp.
                    107-132, pl. 9), so as to leave no doubt that <hi rend="italic">Chionis</hi> was
                    a form intermediate between those groups. Yet some writers continued to refer it
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Gallinae</hi> and others to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Columbae.</hi> The matter may now be regarded as settled for ever. In 1876 Dr

                    agreeing with him in the main, but concluding that the Sheathbills formed a
                    distinct group <hi rend="italic">Chionomorphae,</hi> in rank equal to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cecomorphae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Charadriomorphse</hi> of
                    Prof. Huxley (which are, to speak roughly, the <hi rend="italic">G avise</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Limicolae</hi> of older systematists), and regarding this
                    group as being “still nearer the common ancestral stock of both.” These authors
                    also wish to separate the two species generically; but their proposals are
                    considered needless by Garrod <hi rend="italic">(P. Z. S.,</hi> 1877, p. 417)
                    and M. Alph. Milne-Edwards <hi rend="italic">(Ann. Sc. Naturelles,</hi> ser. 6,
                    xiii. art. 4, p. 24). The opinions of De Blainville and Dr Reichenow are borne
                    out by the observations of Mr Eaton <hi rend="italic">(loc. cit.),</hi> and no
                    one knowing the habits of an Oyster-catcher can read his remarks without seeing
                    how nearly related the two forms are. Their differences may perhaps justify the
                    separation of each form into what is vaguely called a “Family,” but the
                    differences will be seen by the comparative anatomist to be of slight
                    importance, and the intimate affinity of the <hi rend="italic">Gaviae</hi> and
