                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Sennár,</hi> a country of east Central Africa, commonly
                    identified with the “Island of Meroe” of the ancients, and included in the
                    central division of Egyptian (Eastern) Súdán, as reorganized in the year 1882.
                    By European writers the term is often applied to the whole region lying between
                    the Atbára (Takazze) and the White Nile, but by native usage is restricted to
                    the district confined between the latter river and the Bahr-el-Azrak (Blue
                    Nile), and its eastern tributaries, the Rahad and the Dender. It is bordered
                    north and north-east by Upper Nubia, east by Abyssinia, west by the White Nile
                    (Bahr-el-Abiad), separating it from Kordofán, and stretches from the confluence
                    of the two Niles at Khartum southwards, in the direction of the Berta highlands
                    in the east and the Búrún and Dinka plains in the west. As thus defined, Sennár
                    extends across five degrees of latitude (16° to 11° N.), with a total length of
                    about 350 miles, a mean breadth of 120 miles, an area of 40,000 square miles,
                    and an approximate population of 300,000. It comprises two physically distinct
                    tracts, the densely wooded and well-watered Jezírat el-Jesírát ("Isle of Isles”)
                    between the Rahad and the Blue Nile, and the “island” of Sennár proper, a nearly
                    level steppe land confined between the two main streams. This western and much
                    larger division, which has a mean elevation of under 2000 feet above sea-level,
                    consists mainly of alluvial and sandy matter, resting on a bed of granite and
                    porphyritic granite, which first crops out some ten days’ journey south of
                    Khartúm, in the Jebel es-Segati and the Jebel el-Moye, near the town of Sennár
                    on the Bahr-el-Azrak. Between these two groups the plain is dotted over with
                    isolated slate hills containing iron and silver ores. But beyond Sennár the
                    boundless steppe, either under a tall coarse grass, or overgrown with mimosa
                    scrub, or else absolutely waste, again stretches uninterruptedly for another ten
                    or eleven days’ journey to the Roséres (Rosaires) district, where the isolated
                    Okelmi and Keduss Hills, containing quartz with copper ore, rise 1000 feet above
                    the right bank of the Blue Nile and 3000 above the sea. Here the plain is
                    furrowed by deep gullies flushed during the rainy season; and farther south the
                    land, hitherto gently sloping towards the north-west, begins to rise rapidly,
                    breaking into hills and ridges 4000 feet high in the Fazogl district, and
                    farther on merging in the Berta highlands with an extreme altitude of 9000 to
                    10,000 feet. In these metalliferous uplands, recently explored by Marno and
                    Schuver, rises the Tumat, which is washed for gold, and which after a northerly
                    course of nearly 100 miles joins the left bank of the Blue Nile near Fazogl and
                    Famaka. South of and parallel with the Tumat flows the still unexplored Jabus
                    (Yabus), on which stands Fadasi, southernmost of the now abandoned Egyptian
                    stations in the Bahr-el-Azrak basin. This point also marks the present limit of
                    geographical exploration in the direction of the conterminous Galla country,
                    Schuver being the only European traveller who has hitherto succeeded in
                    penetrating to any distance south of the Jabus.</p>
                <p>Sennár lies within the northern limits of the tropical rains, which reach to
                    Khartum, and fall between June and September. In this part of its course the
                    Blue Nile rises from May to August, when the northern and western winds prevail,
                    nearly coinciding with the cool and healthy season. But they are followed by the
                    hot khaúsín from the south or the samúm (simoom) from the north-west charged<pb

                    dreaded are the miasmatic exhalations caused by the glowing sun playing on
                    stagnant waters after the floods and giving rise to the “Sennar fever,” which
                    drives the natives themselves from the plains to the southern uplands. The
                    temperature, which rises at times to over 120° Fahr., is also very changeable,
                    often sinking from 100° Fahr. during the day to under 60° Fahr. at night.</p>
                <p>The soil, mainly alluvial, is naturally fertile, and wherever water and hands are
                    available yields bounteous crops of maize, pulse, cotton, tobacco, sesame, and
                    especially durra, of which as many as twenty varieties are said to be
                    cultivated. The forest vegetation, mainly confined to the “Isle of Isles” and
                    the southern uplands, includes the <hi rend="italic">Adansouia</hi> (baobab),
                    which in the Fazogl district attains gigantic proportions, the tamarind, of
                    which bread is made, the deleb palm, several valuable gum trees (whence the term
                    Sennári often applied in Egypt to gum arabic), some dyewoods, ebony, ironwood,
                    and many varieties of acacia. These forests are haunted by the two-horned
                    rhinoceros, the elephant, lion, panther, numerous apes and antelopes, while the
                    crocodile and hippopotamus frequent all the rivers. The chief domestic animals
                    are the camel, horse, ass, ox, buffalo (used both as a beast of burden and for
                    riding), sheep with a short silky fleece, the goat, cat, dog, and pig, which
                    last here reaches its southernmost limit. The tsetse fly appears to be absent,
                    but is replaced in some districts by a species of wasp, whose sting is said to
                    be fatal to the camel in the rainy season.</p>
                <p>The “African Mesopotamia” is occupied by a partly settled partly still nomad
                    population of an extremely mixed character, including representatives of nearly
                    all the chief ethnical divisions of the continent. But the great plain of Sennár
                    is mainly occupied by Hassanieh Arabs in the north, by Abu-Rof (Rufaya) Hamites
                    of Beja stock (Robert Hartmann) in the cast as far as Fazogl, and elsewhere by
                    the Funj (Fung, Fungheh), traditionally from beyond the "White Nile, and
                    affiliated by some to the Kordofán Nubas, by others more probably to the Nilotic
                    Negro Shillúks. These Funj, who have been the dominant race since the 15th
                    century, have become almost everywhere assimilated in speech, religion, and
                    habits to the Arabs. Nevertheless on their sacred Mount Guleh the traveller
                    Pruyssenaere found them still performing pagan rites, while according to Marno
                    the Búrúns, the southernmost branch of the race between the Berta highlanders
                    and the Nilotic Dcnkas, are addicted to cannibalism. The Berta highlanders
                    themselves (Jebalain, as the Arabs collectively call them) are of more or less
                    pure Negro stock and number about 80,000, grouped in several semi-independent
                    principalities. The " no-man’s-land” stretching north of Dar-Berta and east of
                    the Tumat valley is also occupied by distinct nationalities, such as the Kadalos
                    in the extreme north, the Sienetjos and Gumus in the east, here bordering on the
                    Abyssinian Agaws, the Jabus and Gánti in the south. Most of these appear to be
                    of Negro or Negroid stock; but the Sienetjos, said to he a surviving remnant of
                    the primitive population of the whole country, are doubtless akin to the
                    Sienetjos of Damot and Gojam in Abyssinia. They are certainly not blacks, and
                    have a yellow or fair complexion, lighter than that of southern Europeans.</p>
                <p>The Sennári people cultivate a few industries, such as cottonweaving, pottery,
                    gold, silver, and iron work, matting, and leather work (camel saddles, sandals,
                    &amp;c.), noted throughout Sudan. But their chief pursuits are stock-breeding,
                    agriculture, and trade,— exporting to Egypt and Abyssinia gold, hides, durra,
                    sesame, gums, ivory, horses, and slaves. The chief centres of population, all on
                    the Bahr-el-Azrak, are Fazogl (Fazoklo), now replaced by Famaka, at the Tumat
                    confluence; Roséres, formerly capital of an independent state; Sennár, also an
                    old capital, which gives its name to the whole region; Wod-Medineh at the Rahad
                    confluence; and Khartum, just above the junction of the two Niles. A few miles
                    above Khartum are the extensive ruins of Soba, former capital of the Funj
                    empire, which at one time stretched from Wady Haifa to Dar-Berta and from Suakin
                    to beyond Kordofán, but which was overthrown by Ismail Pasha in the year 1822.
