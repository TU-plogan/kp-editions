                    though knowing it had already been received into scientific nomenclature, he
                    called it anew <hi rend="italic">Microdactylus marcgravii.</hi> In 1811 Illiger,
                    without having seen an example, renamed the genus <hi rend="italic"

                    >(Ornithology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 46, note 1), has since been frequently
                    applied to it—placing it in the curious congeries of forms having little
                    affinity which he called <hi rend="italic">Alectorides.</hi> In the course of
                    his travels in Brazil (1815-17), Prince Max of Wied met with this bird, and in
                    1823 there appeared from his pen (N. <hi rend="italic">Act. Acad. L.-C. Nat.
                    Curiosorum,</hi> xi. pt. 2, pp. 341-350, tab. xlv.) a very good contribution to
                    its history, embellished by a faithful life-sized figure of its head. The same
                    year Temminck figured it in the <hi rend="italic">Planches Coloriées</hi> (No.
                    237). It is not easy to say when any example of the bird first came under the
                    eyes of British ornithologists; but in the Zoological <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proceedings</hi> for 1836 (pp. 29-32) Martin described the visceral and
                    osteological anatomy of one which had been received alive the preceding

                <p>The Seriema, owing to its long legs and neck, stands some two feet or more in
                    height, and in menageries bears itself with a stately deportment. Its bright red
                    beak, the bare greenish blue skin surrounding its large yellow eyes, and the
                    tufts of elongated feathers springing vertically from its lores, give it a
                    pleasing and animated expression; but its plumage generally is of an
                    inconspicuous ochreous grey above and dull white beneath,—the feathers of the
                    upper parts, which on the neck and throat are long and loose, being barred by
                    fine zigzag markings of dark brown, while those of the lower parts are more or
                    less striped. The wing-quills are brownish black, banded with mottled white, and
                    those of the tail, except the middle pair, which are wholly greyish brown, are
                    banded with mottled white at the base and the tip, but dark brown for the rest
                    of their length. The legs are red. The Seriema inhabits the <hi rend="italic"
                    >campos</hi> or elevated open parts of Brazil, from the neighbourhood of
                    Pernambuco to the Rio de la Plata, extending inland as far as Matto Grosso
                    (long. 60°), and occurring also, though sparsely, in Paraguay. It lives in the
                    high grass, running away in a stooping posture to avoid discovery on being
                    approached, and taking flight only at the utmost need. Yet it builds its nest in
                    thick bushes or trees at about a man’s height from the ground, therein laying
                    two eggs, which Prof. Burmeister likens to those of the Land-Rail in
                    colour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    distinguished author twice cites the figure given by Thienemann <hi

                    though taken from a genuine specimen; but little that can be called Ralline in
                    character is observable therein. The same is to be said of an egg laid in
                    captivity at Paris; but a specimen in Mr Walter’s possession undeniably shows it
                    (cf. <hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1881, p. 2).</p></note> The
                    young are hatched fully covered with grey down, relieved by brown, and remain
                    for some time in the nest. The food of the adult is almost exclusively
                    animal,—insects, especially large ants, snails, lizards, and snakes; but it also
                    eats certain large red berries.</p>
                <p>Until 1860 the Seriema was believed to be without any near relative in the living

                    has since been regarded as entitled to generic division under the name of <hi

                    seems to be known in its native country as the “Chunnia,” differs from the
                    Seriema by frequenting forest or at least bushy districts. It is also darker in
                    colour, has less of the frontal crest, shorter legs, a longer tail, and the
                    markings beneath take the form of bars rather than stripes. In other respects
                    the difference between the two birds seems to be immaterial.</p>
                <p>There are few birds which have more exercised the taxonomer than this, and the
                    reason seems to be plain. The Seriema must be regarded as the not greatly
                    modified heir of some very old type, such as one may fairly imagine to have
                    lived before many of the existing groups of birds had become differentiated.
                    Looking at it in this light, we may be prepared to deal gently with the
                    systematists who, having only the present before their eyes, have relegated it
                    positively to this, that, or the other Order, Family, or other group of birds.
                    There can be no doubt that some of its habits point to an alliance with the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bustard</hi> (vol. iv. p. 578) or perhaps certain Plovers (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Plover,</hi> vol. xix. p. 227), while its digestive organs
                    are essentially, if not absolutely, those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Heron</hi>
                    (vol. xi. p. 760). Its general appearance recalls that of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Secretary-Bird</hi><hi rend="italic">(supra,</hi> p. 617); but
                    this, it must be admitted, may be merely an analogy and may indicate no affinity
                    whatever. On the one hand we have authorities, starting from bases so opposed as
                    Prof. Parker <hi rend="italic">(P.Z.S.,</hi> 1863, p. 516) and Sundevall,
                    placing it among the <hi rend="italic">Accipitres,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The author of vol. i. of the British Museum

                    the type of a distinct sub-Order, thereby showing a want of penetration which it
                    is difficult to excuse. Here it needs only be said that, whereas in a few points
                    <hi rend="italic">Pandion</hi> differs from the normal <hi rend="italic"
                    >Falconidae, Cariama</hi> diverges in characters too numerous to mention. The
                    suggestion that the Order <hi rend="italic">Accipitres</hi> might be justifiably
                    enlarged so as to include the Seriema has before <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Ornithology,</hi> vol. xviii. pp. 45, 46) met with conditional approval; but
                    that this remarkable and peculiar form should be treated in the way just
                    described indicates an amount of neglect of evidence hardly to be expected at
                    the present day.</p></note> while on the other we have Nitzsch, Prof.

                    give no help as to the systematic position of the bird.</p></note> Martin <hi

                    respects it approaches the birds of prey,” adds that “the ossified part of the
                    nasal septum does not unite below with the maxillo-palatines,” and that in this
                    respect it is unlike the <hi rend="italic">Accipitres;</hi> finally he declares
