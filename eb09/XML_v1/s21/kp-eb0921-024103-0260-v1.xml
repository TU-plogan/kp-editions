                <p><label type="entry">SÁMÁNID DYNASTY</label>, the name of the third among those
                    native dynasties which sprang up in the 9th and 10th centuries in the eastern
                    portions of Persia, and, although nominally provincial governors under the
                    suzerainty of the caliphs of Baghdad, succeeded in a very short time in
                    establishing an almost independent rule over the vast territories round the Oxus
                    and Jaxartes. The Ma’mún, Hárún-al-rashid’s son, to whose patronage the Táhirid
                    family owed their supremacy in Khorásán and Transoxiana (820-872, 205-259 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.h.)</hi> appointed three sons of Sámán, originally a Tartar
                    chief who claimed descent from the old Sásánian kings, governors of Herát and
                    some districts beyond the Oxus; and these soon gained such an ascendency over
                    all rival clanships that in 872, when the Táhirids were overthrown by the
                    Saffárids under the leadership of Ya'ḳúb b. Laith (868-878), they were strong
                    enough to retain in their family the governorship of Transoxiana, with the
                    official sanction of the caliph Mo'tamid (870-892), and to establish a
                    semi-royal court in Bokhárá, the seat of the new Sámánid government. During the
                    reign of Ya'ḳúb’s brother 'Amr b. Laith (878-900) Isma'il b. Ahmad, Sámán’s
                    great-grandson (892-907, 279-295 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> crossed the
                    Oxus with a powerful army, invaded the territory of the Saffárids, sent 'Amr as
                    prisoner to Baghdad, and gradually extended his rule over Khorásán, Khwárizm,
                    Jurján, and the neighbouring countries. His successors, all renowned by the high
                    impulse they gave both to the patriotic feelings and the national poetry of
                    modern Persia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 655 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.),</hi> were Ahmad b. Isma'íl (907-913, 295-301 <hi

                    rend="smallcaps">a.h.);</hi> and 'Abd al-Malik II. b. Núḥ (999), with whom the
                    Sámánid dynasty came to a rather abrupt end. The rulers of this powerful house,
                    whose silver dirhems had an extensive currency during the 10th century all over
                    the northern part of Asia, and were brought, through Russian caravans, even so
                    far as to Pomerania, Sweden, and Norway, where Sámánid coins have lately been
                    found in great number, suffered in their turn the fate they had prepared for
                    their predecessors; they were overthrown by a more youthful and vigorous race,
                    that of Sabuktagín, which founded the illustrious Ghaznawid dynasty and the
                    Mussulman empire of India. Under 'Abd al-Malik I. a Turkish slave, Alptagín, had
                    been entrusted with the government of Bokhárá, but, showing himself hostile to
                    'Abd al-malik’s successor Mansur I., he was compelled to fly and to take refuge
                    in the mountainous regions of Ghazna, where he soon established a
                    semi-independent rule, to which, after his death in 977 (367 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> his son-in-law Sabuktagín, likewise a former
                    Turkish slave, succeeded. Núḥ II., in order to retain at least a nominal sway
                    over those Afghán territories, confirmed him in his high position and even
                    invested Sabuktagín’s son Maḥmtúd with the governorship of Khorásán, in reward
                    for the powerful help they had given him in his desperate struggles with a
                    confederation of disaffected nobles of Bokhárá under the leadership of Fá’iḳ and
                    the troops of the Dailamites, a dynasty that had arisen on the shores of the
                    Caspian Sea and wrested already from the hands of the Sámánids all their western
                    provinces. Unfortunately, Sabuktagín died in the same year as Núḥ II. (997, 387
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.),</hi> and Mahmud, confronted with an internal contest
                    against his own brother Isma'íl, had to withdraw his attention for a short time
                    from the affairs in Khorásán and Transoxiana. This interval sufficed for the old
                    rebel leader Fa’iḳ, supported by a strong Tartar army under Ilekkhán, to turn
                    Núḥ’s successor Manṣúr II. into a mere puppet, to concentrate all the<pb

                    nominal master to reject Maḥmúd’s application for a continuance of his
                    governorship in Khorásán. Maḥmúd refrained for the moment from vindicating his
                    right; but, as soon as, through court intrigues, Mansur II. had been dethroned,
                    he took possession of Khorásán, deposed Manṣúr’s successor ‘Abd al-Malik II.,
                    and assumed as an independent monarch for the first time in Asiatic history the
                    title of “sultán.” The last descendant of the house of Sámán, Prince Muntaṣir, a
                    bold warrior and a poet of no mean talent, carried on for some years a kind of
                    guerilla warfare against both Maḥmúd and Ilekkhán, who had occupied Transoxiana,
                    till he was assassinated in 1005 (395 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.).</hi>
                    Transoxiana itself was annexed to the Ghaznawid realm eleven years later, 1016
