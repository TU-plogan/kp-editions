                    >Sachsen-Koburg-Gotha),</hi> a duchy in Thuringia, and an independent member of
                    the German empire, consists of the two formerly separate duchies of Coburg and
                    Gotha, which lie at a distance of 14 miles from each other, and of eight small
                    scattered exclaves, the most northerly of which is 70 miles from the most
                    southerly. The total area is 760 square miles (about 2 square miles more than
                    the county of Surrey in England), of which 217 are in Coburg and 543 in Gotha.
                    The duchy of Coburg is bounded on the S.E., S., and S.W. by Bavaria, and on the
                    other sides by Saxe-Meiningen, which, with part of Prussia, separates it from
                    Gotha. The considerable exclave of Königsberg in Bavaria, 10 miles south,
                    belongs to Coburg, Lying on the south slope of the Thuringian Forest, and in the
                    Franconian plain, this duchy is an undulating and fertile district, reaching its
                    highest point in the Senichshöhe (1716 feet) near Mirsdorf. Its streams, the
                    chief of which are the Itz, Steinach, and Rodach, all find their way into the
                    Main. The duchy of Gotha, more than twice the size of Coburg, stretches from the
                    south borders of Prussia along the northern slopes of the Thuringian Forest, the
                    highest summits of which (Grosse Beerberg, 3225 feet; Schneekopf, 3179 feet;
                    Inselberg, 2957 feet) rise within its borders. The more open and level district
                    on the north is spoken of as the “open country” (“das Land ”) in contrast to the
                    wooded hills of the “forest” (“der Wald ”). The Gera, Hörsel, Unstrut, and other
                    streams of this duchy flow to the Werra or to the Saale.</p>
                <p>In both duchies the chief industry is agriculture, which employs 33 per cent. of
                    the entire population. According to the returns for 1883, 53½ per cent. of the
                    area was occupied by arable land, 10 per cent. by meadow-land and pasture, and
                    30 per cent. by forest. In the same year the chief crops were oats (43,715
                    acres, yielding 19,229 tons), barley (37,387 acres, 20,148 tons), rye (29,077
                    acres, 12,048 tons), wheat (24,255 acres, 9,272 tons), and potatoes (24,546
                    acres, 116,695 tons). A small quantity of hemp and flax is raised (less than
                    1000 acres of each), but a considerable quantity of fruit and vegetables is
                    annually produced. Cattle-breeding is an important resource, especially in the
                    valley of the Itz in Coburg. In 1883 the two duchies contained 8187 horses,
                    58,196 cattle, 73,249 sheep, 51,549 pigs, and 27,015 goats. The mineral wealth
                    of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha is insignificant; small quantities of coal, lignite,
                    ironstone, millstone, &amp;c., are annually raised. There are also saltworks and
                    some deposits of potter’s clay.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of the duchies, especially in the mountainous parts less
                    favourable for agriculture, are tolerably brisk, but there is no large
                    industrial centre in the country. Iron goods and machinery, safes, glass,
                    earthenware, chemicals, and wooden articles, including large quantities of toys,
                    are produced; and various branches of textile industry are carried on. Ruhla
                    (two-fifths of which is situated in Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach) is famous for its
                    meerschaum pipes and cigar-holders, which are exported to all parts of the
                    world; and the maps of Perthes’s geographical institute at Gotha may also be
                    reckoned among the national products. Coburg (15,791 inhabitants in 1881) and
                    Gotha (28,100 in 1885) are the chief towns of the duchies, to which they
                    respectively give name; the latter is the capital of the united duchy. There are
                    seven other small towns, and 320 villages and hamlets. The villages of Fried-<pb

                    Schneekopf and other-picturesque points annually attract an increasing number of
                    summer visitors and tourists. Neudietendorf or Gnadenthal is a Moravian
                    settlement founded in 1742.</p>
                <p>The population in 1880 was 194,716, or 256 per square mile, of whom 56,728 (261
                    per square mile) were in Coburg and 137,988 (254 per square mile) in Gotha. In
                    the former duchy the people belong to the Franconian and in the latter to the
                    Thuringian branch of the Teutonic family. In 1880 there were 192,025 Lutherans,
                    2062 Roman Catholics, 490 Jews, and 139 others. In 1885 the population was
                    198,717,—57,355 in Coburg and 141,362 in Gotha.</p>
                <p>Saxe-Coburg-Gotha is a limited hereditary monarchy, its constitution resting on a
                    law of 1852, modified in 1874. For its own immediate affairs each duchy has a
                    separate diet (in Coburg of 11, in Gotha of 19 members); but in more important
                    and general matters a common diet, formed of the members of the separate diets,
                    meeting at Coburg and Gotha alternately, exercises authority. The members are
                    elected for four years; the franchise is extended to all male taxpayers of
                    twenty-five years of ago and upwards. The ministry has special departments for
                    each duchy, but is under a common president. In finance the duchies are also
                    separate, the budget in Coburg being voted for a term of six years, and in Gotha
                    for four years. After long disputes between the duke and the Government a
                    compromise was effected in 1855, by which the greater part of the public lands
                    is regarded as a <hi rend="italic">fideicommissum</hi> in the possession of the
                    reigning duke, while the income from the rest is regarded as state-revenue.
                    There are thus two budgets for each duchy. The annual income of the public lands
                    in Coburg is estimated for the period 1886-92 at £20,700, and the expenditure at
                    £11,900; in Gotha (period 1886-90) the same source is estimated to yield
                    £102,621 and to cost £61,996 ;—together producing a surplus of £49,425, of which
                    the duke receives £29,700 and the state-treasury £19,725. The annual
                    state-revenue in the same periods was estimated for Coburg at £51,520, or £2246
                    more than the estimated expenditure, and in Gotha at £106,020, or £2244 more
                    than the expenditure. Besides the civil list the duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha
                    enjoys a very large private fortune, amassed chiefly by Ernest I., who sold the
                    principality of Lichtenberg to Prussia in 1834 for an annual payment of £12,000.
                    The congress of Vienna had bestowed the principality upon him in recognition of
                    his services in 1813. The house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha is directly connected with
                    five of the royal houses of Europe, and the actual rulers or the heirs of three
                    kingdoms trace their descent from it. The succession is hereditary in the male
                    line; and by the deed of succession of 1855 the heir to the throne is the duke
                    of Edinburgh, nephew of the present duke.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The elder line of Saxe-Coburg was founded in
                    1680 by Albert, the second son of Ernest the Pious. On his dying childless in
                    1699, however, the line became extinct, and his possessions became the subject
                    of vehement contention amongst the other Saxon houses, until they were finally
                    distributed at the end of the 18th century. The present reigning family is the
                    posterity of John Ernest, the seventh son of Ernest the Pious, who originally
                    ruled in Saxe-Saalfeld. His two sons, ruling in common, acquired possession of
                    Coburg, and, changing their residence, styled themselves dukes of
                    Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Under the son and successor of the survivor (who
                    introduced the principle of primogeniture), Ernest Frederick I. (1764-1800), the
                    land was plunged into bankruptcy, so that an imperial commission was appointed
                    on his death to manage the finances. The measures adopted to redeem the
                    country’s credit were successful, but imposed so much hardship on the people
                    that a rising took place, which had to be quelled with the aid of troops from
                    the electorate of Saxony. The duke Francis Frederick Antony died in December
                    1806, and was succeeded by his son Ernest III. (1806-1844), although the country
                    was occupied by the French from 1807 until the peace of Tilsit in 1816. In the
                    redistribution of the Saxon lands in 1826, Ernest resigned Saalfeld to
                    Meiningen, receiving Gotha in exchange and assuming the title of Ernest I. of
                    Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The line of Saxe-Gotha had been founded in 1680 by the eldest
                    son of Ernest the Pious, and had become extinct in 1825. When Ernest II. (b.
                    1818) succeeded in 1844 both the public finances and the private fortune of the
                    ducal family (see above) were flourishing. In his reign various liberal reforms
                    have been achieved, and the union of the duchies has been made closer.</p>
