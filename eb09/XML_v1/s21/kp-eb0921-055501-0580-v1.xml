                <p><label type="entry">SCUDÉRY</label> is the name of a family which is said to have
                    been of Italian origin and to have transferred itself to Provence, but which is
                    only known by the singular brother and sister who represented it during the 17th
                    century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Georges de Scudéry</hi> (1601-1667), the elder of the pair,
                    was born at Havre, whither his father had moved from Provence, in 1601. He
                    served in the army for some time, and, though in the vein of gasconading which
                    was almost peculiar to him he no doubt exaggerated his services, there seems
                    little doubt that he was a stout soldier. But he conceived a fancy for
                    literature before he was thirty, and during the whole of the middle of the
                    century he was one of the most characteristic figures of Paris. Despite his own
                    merit, which was not inconsiderable, and his sister’s, which was more, he was
                    unlucky in his suits for preferment. Indeed from some stories told by men not
                    his friends he seems to have hurt his own chances by independence of spirit. He
                    received, however, the governorship of the fortress of Notre Dame de la Garde
                    near Marseilles in 1643, and in 1650 was elected to the Academy. Long before he
                    had made himself conspicuous by a letter attacking Corneille’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cid,</hi> which he addressed to that body. He was himself an industrious
                    dramatist, <hi rend="italic">L’Amour Tyrannique</hi> being the chief piece which
                    (and that only partially) has escaped oblivion. His other most famous work was
                    the epic of <hi rend="italic">Alaric</hi> (1654). He lent his name to his
                    sister’s first romances, but did little beyond correcting the proofs. His death
                    occurred at Paris on 14th May 1667. Scudéry’s swashbuckler affectations (he
                    terminates his introduction to the works of Théophile de Viaud by something like
                    a challenge in form to any one who does not admit the supremacy of the deceased
                    poet), the bombast of his style, and his various oddities have been rather
                    exaggerated by literary gossip and tradition. Although probably not quite sane,
                    he had some poetical power, a fervent love of literature, a high sense of honour
                    and of friendship.</p>
                <p>His sister <hi rend="smallcaps">Madeleine</hi> (1607-1701), born also at Havre in
                    1607, was a writer of much more ability and of a much better regulated
                    character. She was very plain and had no fortune, but her abilities were great
                    and she was very well educated. Establishing herself at Paris with her brother,
                    she was at once admitted to the Rambouillet coterie, afterwards established a
                    salon of her own under the title of the <hi rend="italic">Société du
                    Samedi,</hi> and for the last half of the 17th century, under the pseudonym of
                    “Sapho” or her own name, was acknowledged as the first blue-stocking of France
                    and of the world. Her celebrated novels, <hi rend="italic">Artamène ou le Grand
                    Cyrus, Clélie, Ibrahim ou l'Illustre Bassa, Almahide,</hi> and others are known
                    by quotation to every one, and were the delight of all Europe, including persons
                    of the wit and sense of Madame de Sévigné. But for at least a century and a half
                    they have lain unread, and their immense length has often been satirized even by
                    persons well read in letters with the term “folio,” when in fact they were
                    originally issued in batches of small octavos, sometimes (allowing for two parts
                    to each volume) running to a score or so. Neither in conception nor in execution
                    will they bear criticism as wholes. With classical or Oriental personages for
                    nominal heroes and heroines, the whole language and action are taken from the
                    fashionable ideas of the time, and the personages can be identified either
                    really or colour-ably with Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s contemporaries. The
                    interminable length of the stories is made out by endless conversations and, as
                    far as incidents go, chiefly by successive abductions of the heroines, conceived
                    and related in the most decorous spirit, for Mademoiselle de Scudéry is nothing
                    if not decorous. Nevertheless, although the books can hardly now be read
                    through, it is still possible to perceive their attraction for the wits, both
                    male and female, of a time which certainly did not lack wit. In that early day
                    of the novel prolixity did not repel. “Sapho” had really studied mankind in her
                    contemporaries and knew how to analyse and describe their characters with
                    fidelity and point. She was a real mistress of conversation, a thing quite new
                    to the age at least as far as literature was concerned, and proportionately
                    welcome. She could moralize—a favourite employment of the time— with sense and
                    propriety, and the purely literary merits of the style which clothed the whole
                    were considerable. Madeleine survived her brother more than thirty years
                    (scandal says that she was not sorry to be relieved from his humours), and in
                    her later days published numerous volumes of conversations (to a great extent
                    extracted from her novels) and short moral writings. Dryden says that he had
                    heard of an intention on her part to translate the <hi rend="italic">Canterbury
                    Tales,</hi> and it is not impossible. She never lost either her renown or her
                    wits or her good sense, and died at Paris on 2d June 1701. It is unfortunate and
                    rather surprising that no one has recently attempted an anthology from her
                    immense work.</p>
