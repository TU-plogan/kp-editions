                <p><label type="entry">SARPI, PIETRO</label> (1552-1623), was born at Venice, August
                    14, 1552, and was the son of a small trader, who left him an orphan at an early
                    age. Quiet, serious, devoted to study, endowed with great tenacity of
                    application and a prodigious memory, the boy seemed born for a monastic life,
                    and, notwithstanding the opposition of his relatives, entered the order of the
                    Servi di Maria, a minor Augustinian congregation of Florentine origin, at the
                    age of thirteen. He assumed the name of Paolo, by which, with the epithet <hi
                    rend="italic">Servita,</hi> he was always known to his contemporaries. In 1570
                    he sustained no fewer than three hundred and eighteen theses at a disputation in
                    Mantua, with such applause that the duke attached the youthful divine to his
                    service by making him court theologian. Sarpi spent four years at Mantua,
                    applying himself with the utmost zeal to mathematics and the Oriental languages.
                    He there made the acquaintance of Olivo, formerly secretary to a papal legate at
                    the council of Trent, from whom he learned much that he subsequently introduced
                    into his <hi rend="italic">History.</hi> After leaving Mantua for some
                    unexplained reason, he repaired to Milan, where he enjoyed the protection of
                    Cardinal Borromeo, another authority in the council, but was soon transferred by
                    his superiors to Venice, as professor of philosophy at the Servite convent. In
                    1579 he was sent to Rome on business connected with the reform of his order,
                    which occupied him several years, and brought him into intimate relations with
                    three successive popes, as well as the grand inquisitor and other persons of
                    influence. The impression which the papal court made upon him may be collected
                    from his subsequent history. Having successfully terminated the affairs
                    entrusted to him, he returned to Venice in 1588, and passed the next seventeen
                    years in quiet study, occasionally interrupted by the part he was compelled to
                    take in the internal disputes of his community. In 1601 he was recommended by
                    the Venetian senate for the small bishopric of Caorle, but the papal nuncio, who
                    wished to obtain it for a protégé of his own, informed the pope that Sarpi
                    denied the immortality of the soul, and had controverted the authority of
                    Aristotle. An attempt to procure another small bishopric in the following year
                    also failed, Clement VIII. professing to have taken umbrage at Sarpi’s extensive
                    correspondence with learned heretics, but more probably determined to thwart the
                    desires of the liberal rulers of Venice. The sense of injury, no doubt,
                    contributed to exasperate Sarpi’s feelings towards the court of Rome, but a man
                    whose master passions were freedom of thought and love of country could not have
                    played any other part than he did in the great contest which was impending. For
                    the time, however, he tranquilly pursued his studies, writing those notes on
                    Vieta which establish his proficiency in mathematics, and a metaphysical
                    treatise now lost, which, if Foscarini’s account of it may be relied upon,
                    anticipated the sensationalism of Locke. His anatomical pursuits probably date
                    from a somewhat earlier period. They illustrate his versatility and thirst for
                    knowledge, but are far from possessing the importance ascribed to them by the
                    affection of his disciples. His claim to have anticipated Harvey’s discovery
                    rests on no better authority than a memorandum, probably copied from Caesalpinus
                    or Harvey himself, with whom, as well as with Bacon and Gilbert, he maintained a
                    correspondence. The only physiological discovery which can be safely attributed
                    to him is that of the contractility of the iris. It must be remembered, however,
                    that his treatises on scientific subjects are lost, and only known from
                    imperfect abstracts.</p>
                <p>The prudent Clement died in March 1605; and after one ephemeral succession and
                    two very long conclaves Paul V. assumed the tiara with the resolution to strain
                    papal prerogative to the uttermost. At the same time Venice was adopting
                    measures to restrict it still further. The right of the secular tribunals to
                    take cognizance of the offences of ecclesiastics had been asserted in two
                    remarkable cases; and the scope of two ancient laws of the city of Venice,
                    forbidding the foundation of churches or ecclesiastical congregations without
                    the consent of the state, and the acquisition of property by priests or
                    religious bodies, had been extended over the entire territory of the republic.
                    In January 1606 the papal nuncio delivered a brief demanding the unconditional
                    submission of the Venetians. The senate having promised protection to all
                    ecclesiastics who should in this emergency aid the republic by their counsel,
                    Sarpi presented a memoir, pointing out that the threatened censures might be met
                    in two ways,— <hi rend="italic">de facto,</hi> by prohibiting their publication,
                    and <hi rend="italic">de jure,</hi> by an appeal to a general council. The
                    document was received with universal applause, and Sarpi was immediately made
                    canonist and theological counsellor to the republic. When in the following April
                    the last hopes of accommodation were dispelled by Paul’s excommunication of the
                    Venetians and his attempt to lay their dominions under an interdict, Sarpi
                    entered with the utmost energy into the controversy. He prudently began by
                    republishing the anti-papal opinions of the famous<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n331/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0331-0312"/> canonist Gerson. In an anonymous tract published
                    shortly afterwards <hi rend="italic">(Risposta di un Dottore in Teologia)</hi>
                    he laid down principles which struck at the very root of the pope’s authority in
                    secular things. This book was promptly put upon the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Index,</hi> and the republication of Gerson was attacked by Bellarmine with a
                    severity which obliged Sarpi to reply in an <hi rend="italic">Apologia.</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">Considerazioni sidle Censure</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trattato dell' Interdetto,</hi> the latter partly prepared under his direction
                    by other theologians, speedily followed. Numerous other pamphlets appeared,
                    inspired or controlled by Sarpi, who had received the further appointment of
                    censor over all that should be written at Venice in defence of the republic. His
                    activity registers the progress of mankind, and forms an epoch in the history of
                    free discussion. Never before in a religious controversy had the appeal been
                    made so exclusively to reason and history; never before had an ecclesiastic of
                    his eminence maintained the subjection of the clergy to the state, and disputed
                    the pope’s right to employ spiritual censures, except under restrictions which
                    virtually abrogated it. In so doing he merely gave expression to the convictions
                    which had long been silently forming in the breasts of enlightened men, and
                    this, even more than his learning and acuteness as a disputant, insured him a
                    moral victory. Material arguments were no longer at the pope’s disposal. The
                    Venetian clergy, a few religious orders excepted, disregarded the interdict, and
                    discharged their functions as usual. The Catholic powers refused to be drawn
                    into the quarrel. At length (April 1607) a compromise was arranged through the
                    mediation of the king of France, which, while salving over the pope’s dignity,
                    conceded the points at issue. The great victory, however, was not so much the
                    defeat of the papal pretensions as the demonstration that interdicts and
                    excommunications had lost their force. Even this was not wholly satisfactory to
                    Sarpi, who longed for the toleration of Protestant worship in Venice, and had
                    hoped for a separation from Rome and the establishment of a Venetian free church
                    by which the decrees of the council of Trent would have been rejected, and in
                    which the Bible would have been an open book. But the controversy had not lasted
                    long enough to prepare men’s minds for so bold a measure. The republic rewarded
                    her champion with the further distinction of state counsellor in jurisprudence,
                    and, a unique mark of confidence, the liberty of access to the state archives.
                    These honours exasperated his adversaries to the uttermost; and after citations
                    and blandishments had equally failed to bring him to Rome he began to receive
                    intimations that a stroke against him was preparing in that quarter. On October
                    5 he was attacked by a band of assassins and left for dead, but the wounds were
                    not mortal. The bravos found a refuge in the papal territories. Their chief,
                    Poma, declared that he had been moved to attempt the murder by his zeal for
                    religion, a degree of piety and self-sacrifice which seems incredible in a
                    bankrupt oil-merchant. “Agnosco stylum Curiae Romanae,” Sarpi himself pleasantly
                    said, when his surgeon commented upon the ragged and inartistic character of the
                    wounds, and the justice of the observation is as incontestable as its wit. The
                    only question can be as to the degree of complicity of Pope Paul V., a good man
                    according to his light, but who must have looked upon Sarpi as a revolted
                    subject, and who would find casuists enough to assure him that a prince is
                    justified in punishing rebels by assassins when they are beyond the reach of
                    executioners.</p>
                <p>The remainder of Sarpi’s life was spent peacefully in his cloister, though plots
                    against him continued to be formed, and he occasionally spoke of taking refuge
                    in England. When not engaged in framing state papers, he devoted himself to
                    scientific studies, and found time for the composition of several works. A
                    Machiavellian tract on the fundamental maxims of Venetian policy <hi
                    rend="italic">(Opinione come debba governarsi la repubblica di Venezia),</hi>
                    used by his adversaries to blacken his memory, though a contemporary production,
                    is undoubtedly not his. It has been attributed to a certain Gradenigo. Nor did
                    he complete a reply which he had been ordered to prepare to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Squitinio della Lbertà Veneta,</hi> which he perhaps found
                    unanswerable. In 1610 appeared his <hi rend="italic">History of Ecclesiastical
                    Benefices,</hi> “in which,” says Ricci, “he purged the church of the defilement
                    introduced by spurious decretals.” In the following year he assailed another
                    abuse by his treatise on the right of asylum claimed for churches, which was
                    immediately placed on the <hi rend="italic">Index.</hi> In 1615 a dispute
                    between the Venetian Government and the Inquisition respecting the prohibition
                    of a book led him to write on the history and procedure of the Venetian
                    Inquisition; and in 1619 his chief literary work, the <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the Council of Trent,</hi> was printed at London under the name of Pietro
                    Soave Polano, an anagram of Paolo Sarpi Veneto. The editor, Marco Antonio de
                    Dominis, has been accused of falsifying the text, but a comparison with a MS.
                    corrected by Sarpi himself shows that the alterations are both unnecessary and
                    unimportant. This memorable book, together with the rival and apologetic history
                    by Cardinal Pallavicini, is minutely criticized by Ranke <hi rend="italic"
                    >(History of the Popes,</hi> appendix No. 3), who tests the veracity of both
                    writers by examining the use they have respectively made of their MS. materials.
                    The result is not highly favourable to either, nor wholly unfavourable; neither
                    can be taxed with deliberate falsification, but both have coloured and
                    suppressed. They write as advocates rather than historians. Each had access to
                    sources of information denied to the other; so that, although it may be true in
                    a sense that the truth lies between them, it cannot be attained by taking the
                    middle way between their statements. Ranke rates the literary qualities of
                    Sarpi’s work very highly. “Sarpi is acute, penetrating, and sarcastic; his
                    arrangement is exceedingly skilful, his style pure and unaffected. In power of
                    description he is without doubt entitled to the second place among the modern
                    historians of Italy. I rank him immediately after Machiavelli.” Sarpi never
                    acknowledged his authorship, and baffled all the efforts of the Prince de Condé
                    to extract the secret from him. He survived the publication four years, dying on
                    January 15, 1623, labouring for his country to the last. The day before his
                    death he had dictated three replies to questions on affairs of state, and his
                    last words were “Esto perpetua.” His posthumous <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Interdict</hi> was printed at Venice the year after his death, with the
                    disguised imprint of Lyons.</p>
                <p>Sarpi’s services to mankind are now acknowledged by all except the most extreme
                    Ultramontane partisans; and of his general character it is enough to say that
                    even thcological hatred has been unable to fix the least personal imputation
                    upon him. To the highest qualities of the scholar, the statesman, and the
                    patriot he added charity, magnanimity, and disinterestedness. The only point on
                    which his conduct may be thought to require apology is the reserve in which ho
                    shrouded his religious opinions. Great light has been thrown upon his real
                    belief and the motives of his conduct by the letters of Christoph von Dohna,
                    envoy of Christian, prince of Anhalt, to Venice, published by Moritz Ritter in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Briefe und Acten zur Geschichte des dreissigjährigen
                    Krieges, vol.</hi> ii. (Munich, 1874). Sarpi told Dohna that he greatly disliked
                    saying mass, and celebrated it as seldom as possible, but that he was compelled
                    to do so, as he would otherwise seem to admit the validity of the papal
                    prohibition, and thus betray the cause of Venice. This supplies the key to his
                    whole behaviour; he was a patriot first and a religious reformer afterwards. He
                    was most anxious to obtain liberty of Protestant worship at Venice, but scarcely
                    proceeded beyond good wishes, partly from prudence, partly from being “rooted”
                    in what Diodati described to Dohna as “the most dangerous maxim, that God does
                    not regard externals so long as the mind and heart are right before<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n332/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0332-0313"/> Him.” “It is of little avail,” adds Diodati, “to
                    dispute with him, for all blows fall ineffectually upon the sweetness and
                    maturity of affections and spirit which raise him above well nigh every
                    emotion.” Sarpi had another maxim, which he thus formulated to Dohna: “<hi
                    rend="italic">Le falsità non dico mai mai, ma la verità non a ognuno."</hi> It
                    must further be considered that, though Sarpi admired the English prayer-book,
                    ho was neither Anglican, Lutheran, nor Calvinist, and might have found it
                    difficult to accommodate himself to any Protestant church. On the whole, the
                    opinion of Le Courayer, “qu’ il était Catholique en gros et quelque fois
                    Protestant en détail,’’seems not altogether groundless, though it can no longer
                    be accepted as a satisfactory summing up of the question. His discoveries in
                    natural science have been overrated, but his scientific attainments must have
                    been great. Galileo would not have wasted his time in corresponding with a man
                    from whom he could learn nothing; and, though Sarpi did not, as has been
                    asserted, invent the telescope, he immediately turned it to practical account by
                    constructing a map of the moon.</p>
                <p>Sarpi’s life was written by his enthusiastic disciple, Father Fulgenzio Mieanzio,
                    whose work does honour to his heart, but is both meagre and uncritical.
                    Bianchi-Giovini’s modern biography (1836) is greatly marred by digressions, but
                    is on the whole the most satisfactory extant, though inferior in some respects
                    to that by Miss Arabella Georgina Campbell (1869), a labour of love, enriched by
                    numerous references to MSS. unknown to Bianchi-Giovini. The numerous misprints
                    which disfigure the English edition of this work have been corrected in an
                    Italian translation. T. A. Trollope’s <hi rend="italic">Paul the Pope and Paul
                    the Friar</hi> (1861) is in the main a mere abstract of Bianchi-Giovini, but
                    adds a spirited account of the conclave of Paul V. The incidents of the Venetian
                    dispute from day to day are related in the contemporary diaries published by
                    Enrico Cornet (vicuna, 1859). Giusto Fontanini’s <hi rend="italic">Storia Arcana
                    della Vita di Pietro Sarpi</hi> (1863), a bitter libel, is nevertheless
                    important for the letters of Sarpi it contains, as Griselini’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memorie Anedote</hi> (1760) is from the author’s access to Sarpi’s unpublished
                    writings, afterwards unfortunately destroyed by fire. Foscarini's <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Venetian Literature</hi> is important on the same
                    account. Sarpi’s memoirs on state affairs remain in the Venetian archives.
                    Portions of his correspondence have been printed at various times, and inedited
                    letters from him are of frequent occurrence in public libraries. The King’s
                    Library in the British Museum has a valuable collection of tracts in the
                    Interdict controversy, formed by Consul Smith. (R. G.)</p>
