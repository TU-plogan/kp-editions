                    or <hi rend="italic">Selachoidei</hi> in the class of Fishes, their
                    classification, and their general external and anatomical characteristics have
                    been already sufficiently noticed under <hi rend="smallcaps">Ichthyology</hi>
                    (vol. xii. pp. 630 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>), and we have here to supplement
                    that article only by a fuller reference to the natural history of the more
                    common and more important types of the group.</p>
                <p>Sharks are almost exclusively inhabitants of the sea, but some species freely
                    enter the mouths of large rivers, and one species <hi rend="italic">(Carcharias
                    gangeticus)</hi> occurs frequently high up in the large rivers of India, and in
                    the Tigris about Baghdad, at a distance of 350 miles from the Persian Gulf in a
                    straight line, and has even been reported from a lake in Viti Levu (Fiji
                    Islands) which is shut off from the sea by a cataract. Sharks are found in all
                    seas; most numerous between the tropics, they become scarcer beyond, a few only
                    reaching the Arctic circle; it is not known how far they advance southwards in
                    the Antarctic region. Altogether some hundred and fifty different species have
                    been described.</p>
                <p>With regard to their habits many are littoral species, the majority pelagic, and
                    a few are known to belong to the bathybial fauna, having hitherto been obtained
                    down to a depth of 500 fathoms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Littoral Sharks.—</hi> The littoral forms are of small size,
                    and generally known under the name of "dog-fishes,” "hounds,” Ac. Some pelagic
                    sharks of larger size also live near the shore on certain parts of a coast, but
                    they are attracted to it by the abundance of food, and are as frequently found
                    in the open sea, which is their birthplace; therefore we shall refer to them
                    when we speak of the pelagic kinds.</p>
                <p>The majority of the littoral species live on the bottom, sometimes close inshore,
                    and feed on small marine animals or on any animal substance. The following are
                    deserving of special notice.</p>
                <p>The Tope <hi rend="italic">(Galeus)</hi> is common on the coasts not only of
                    England, Ireland, and of the more southern parts of Europe, but also of South
                    Africa, California, Tasmania, and New Zealand. Its teeth are equal in both jaws,
                    of rather small size, flat, triangular, with the point directed towards the one
                    side, and with a notch aud denticulations on the shorter side (fig. 1). It is of
                    a uniform slaty-grey colour, and attains to a length of 6 feet. The female
                    brings forth some thirty living young at one birth in May. It cannot be regarded
                    as a very destructive fish, but becomes troublesome at times to fishermen by
                    taking their bait and driving away other fish they desire to catch.</p>
                <p>The Hounds proper <hi rend="italic">(Mustelus)</hi> possess a very different
                    dentition, the teeth being small, obtuse, numerous, arranged in several rows
                    like pavement (fig. 2). Five or six species are known from the shores of the
                    various temperate and subtropical seas, one (<hi rend="italic">M. vulgaris)</hi>
                    being common on the coasts of Great Britain and the United States on the Pacific
                    as well as the Atlantic side. It is of a uniform grey colour or sparingly
                    spotted with white, and attains to a length of 3 or 4 feet. The young, about
                    twelve in number, are brought forth alive in November. It is a comparatively
                    harmless fish, which feeds on shells, crustaceans, and decomposing animal
                    substances.</p>
                <p>Of the Dog-Fishes proper <hi rend="italic">(Scyllium, Chiloscyllium,</hi>
                    &amp;c.) some twenty species are known, which are spread over nearly all the
                    temperate and tropical seas. Their teeth are small, in several series, with a
                    longer pointed cusp in the middle, and generally one or two smaller ones on each
                    side (figs.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n800/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0800-0775"/> 3 and 5). They are ail oviparous, their oblong
                    egg-shells being produced at each corner into a long thread by which the egg is
                    fastened to some fixed object. Some of the tropical species are ornamented with
                    a pretty pattern of coloration.</p>
                <p>The two British species, the</p>
                <p>Lesser and the Larger Spotted</p>
                <p>Dog-Fish <hi rend="italic">(Sc. canicula</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sc.
                    catulus),</hi> belong to the most common fishes of the coast, and are often con
                    founded with each other.</p>
                <p>But the former is finely dotted with brown above, the latter having the same
                    parts covered with larger rounded brown spots, some of which are nearly as large
                    as the eye. As regards size, the latter exceeds somewhat the other species,
                    attaining to a length of 4 feet. Dogfishes may become extremely troublesome by
                    the large numbers in which they congregate at fishing stations; nor do they
                    compensate for the injury they cause to fishermen, being but rarely used as
                    food, ex cept at certain seasons by the poorer classes of the Mediterranean
                    countries, in China and</p>
                <p>Japan, and in the Ork neys, where they are dried for home consumption.</p>
                <p>The Black-mouthed Dog-Fish <hi rend="italic">(Pristiurus melanostomus)</hi> is
                    another European species which is rarely caught on the British coasts, and is
                    recognized by a series of small, fiat spines with which each side of the upper
                    edge of the caudal fin is armed.</p>
                <p>The Tiger-Shark <hi rend="italic">(Stegostoma tigrinum)</hi> is one of the
                    commonest and handsomest sharks in the Indian Ocean. The ground colour is a
                    brownish-yellow, and the whole fish is ornamented with black or brown transverse
                    bands or rounded spots. It is a littoral species, but adult specimens, which are
                    from 10 to 15 feet long, are not rarely met far from land. It is easily
                    recognized by its enormously long bladelike tail, which is half as long as the
                    whole fish. The teeth are small, trilobed, in many series. The fourth and fifth
                    gill-openings are close together.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Crossorhinus,</hi> of which three species are known
                    from the coasts of Australia and Japan, is remarkable as the only instance in
                    this group of fishes in which the integuments give these inactive ground-sharks,
                    whilst they lie concealed watching for their prey, what may be called a
                    “celative” rather than a “protective” resemblance to their surroundings. Skinny
                    frond-like appendages are developed near the angle of the mouth, or form a
                    wreath round the side of the head, and the irregular and varied coloration of
                    the whole body closely assimilates that of a rock covered with short vegetable
                    and coralline growth. This peculiar development reminds us of the similar
                    condition in the sea-devil <hi rend="italic">(Lophius),</hi> where it serves
                    also to conceal the fish from its prey, rather than to protect it from its
                    enemies. The species of <hi rend="italic">Crossorhinus</hi> grow to a length of
                    10 feet.</p>
                <p>The so-called Port Jackson Shark <hi rend="italic">(Cestracion)</hi> is likewise
                    a littoral form. Besides the common species (C. <hi rend="italic"
                    >philippi),</hi> three other closely allied kinds from the Indo-Pacific are
                    known. This genus, which is the only existing type of a separate family, is one
                    of special interest, as similar forms occur in Primary and Secondary strata. The
                    jaws are armed with small obtuse teeth in front, which in young individuals are
                    pointed, and provided with from three to five cusps. The lateral teeth are
                    larger, pad-like, twice as broad as long and arranged in oblique series (fig.
                    7),—an arrangement admirably adapted for the prehension and mastication of
                    crustaceans and hard-shelled animals. The fossil forms far exceeded in size the
                    living, which scarcely attain to a length of 5 feet. The shells of their eggs
                    are not rare in collections, being found thrown ashore like those of our
                    dog-fishes. The shell is pyriform, with two broad lamellar ridges each wound
                    edgewise five times round it (fig. 8). .</p>
                <p>The Spiny or Piked Dog-Fish <hi rend="italic">(Acanthias)</hi> inhabits, like the
                    majority of littoral genera of sharks, the temperate seas of both the northern
                    and southern hemispheres. For some part of the year it lives in deeper water
                    than the sharks already noticed, but at uncertain irregular times it appears at
                    the surface and close inshore in almost incredible numbers. Couch says that he
                    has heard of 20,000 having been taken in a sean at one time; and in March 1858
                    the newspapers reported a prodigious shoal reaching westward to Uig, whence it
                    extended from 20 to 30 miles seaward, and in an unbroken phalanx eastward to
                    Moray, Banff, and Aberdeen. In the deep fjords of Norway, and indeed at every
                    station of which a shoal of these fishes has taken temporary possession,
                    line-fishing has to be suspended during the time of their visit, as they cut the
                    lines with their scissors-like teeth. As expressed by the name, these<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n801/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0801-0776"/> fishes are distinguished from the other British
                    littoral sharks by each of the two dorsal fins being armed in front by an acute
                    spine. They do not possess an anal fin. Their teeth are rather small, placed in
                    a single series, with the point so much turned aside that the inner margin of
                    the tooth forms the cutting edge (fig. 9). The spiny dogfish are of a greyish
                    colour, with some whitish spots in young specimens, and attain to a length of 2
                    or 3 feet. They are viviparous, the young being pro duced throughout the summer
                    months.</p>
                <p>It is stated that in the northern islands of Great Britain they are dried for
                    food, and that their livers yield a large quantity of oil.</p>
                <p>Finally, we have to notice among the littoral sharks the “Angel-Fish” or
                    “Monk-Fish” (<hi rend="italic">Rhina squatina),</hi> which, by its broad flat
                    head and expanded pectoral fins approaches in general appearance the rays. It
                    occurs in the temperate seas of the southern as well as the northern hemisphere,
                    and is not uncommon on sandy parts of the coast of England and Ireland. It does
                    not seem to exceed a length of <hi rend="italic">5</hi> feet, is not used as
                    food, and is too rare to do any perceptible injury to other fish. It is said to
                    produce about twenty young at a birth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pelagic Sharks.—</hi> All these are of large size, and some are
                    surpassed in bulk and length only by the larger kinds of cetaceans. Those armed
                    with powerful cutting teeth are the most formidable tyrants of the ocean and
                    dangerous to man, whilst others, which are provided with numerous but very small
                    teeth, feed on small fishes only or marine invertebrates, and are otherwise
                    almost harmless and of a timid disposition, which causes them to retire into the
                    solitudes of the open sea. On this account we know very little of their life;
                    indeed, some are known from a few individuals only which have accidentally come
                    ashore. All pelagic sharks have a wide geographical range, and many are found in
                    all seas within the limits of the equatorial zone,—some being almost
                    cosmopolitan. All seem to be viviparous.</p>
                <p>Of the more remarkable forms which we propose to notice here the genus most
                    abundantly represented in species and individuals is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carckarias.</hi> Perhaps nine-tenths of the sharks of which we read in books of
                    travel belong to this genus. Between thirty and forty species have been
                    distinguished, all of which are found in tropical seas. They are the sharks
                    which so readily attach themselves to sailing vessels, following them for weeks,
                    and thus exhibiting an endurance of muscular power scarcely found in any other
                    class of animals. Others affect more the neighbourhood of land, congregating at
                    localities where nature or the vicinity of man provides them with an abundant
                    supply of food. One of the most common species, and one of those which extend
                    far into the temperate zones, is the Blue Shark <hi rend="italic">(Carcharias
                    glaucus),</hi> of which small specimens (4 to G feet long) are frequently caught
                    on the south coasts of England and Ireland. Other species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carcharias</hi> attain a length of 25 feet. The mouth of all is armed with a
                    series of large flat triangular teeth, which have a sharp, smooth, or serrated
                    edge (fig. 10).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Galeocerdo</hi> is likewise a large shark very dangerous to
                    man, differing from the preceding chiefly by having the outer side of its teeth
                    deeply notched. It has long been known to occur in the North Atlantic, close to
                    the Arctic Ocean <hi rend="italic">(G. arcticus),</hi> but its existence in
                    other parts has been ascertained within a recent period; in fact, it seems to be
                    one of the most common and dangerous sharks of the Indo-Pacific, the British
                    Museum having obtained specimens from Mauritius, Kurrachee, Madras, and the west
                    coast of Australia.</p>
                <p>Hammerheaded Sharks <hi rend="italic">(Zygaena)</hi> are sharks in which the
                    anterior portion of the head is produced into a lobe on each side, the extremity
                    of which is occupied by the eye. The relation of this unique configuration of
                    the head to the economy of the fish is unknown. Otherwise these sharks resemble
                    <hi rend="italic">Carcharias,</hi> and are equally formidable, but seem to be
                    more stationary in their habits. They occur in all tropical and subtropical
                    seas, even in the Mediterranean, where <hi rend="italic">Z. malleus</hi> is by
                    no means rare. In the Indian Ocean it is common, and Cantor states that
                    specimens of this species may be often seen ascending from the clear blue depths
                    of the ocean like a great cloud.</p>
                <p>The Porbeagles <hi rend="italic">(Lamna)</hi> differ from the preceding sharks in
                    their dentition (fig. 11), the teeth being large, lanceolate in shape, not
                    adapted for cutting, but rather for seizing and holding the prey, which consists
                    chiefly in fish. These sharks are therefore not dangerous<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n802/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0802-0777"/> to man; at least, there is no instance known of a
                    person having been attacked by the species common on the British coast (<hi
                    rend="italic">L</hi>. <hi rend="italic">cornubiea).</hi> It grows to a length of
                    10 feet, and ranges to New Zealand and Japan. See vol. xix. p. 518.</p>
                <p>To the genus <hi rend="italic">Carcharodon</hi> particular interest is attached,
                    because the single still existing species is the most formidable of all sharks,
                    as were those which preceded it in Tertiary times. The existing species (C. <hi
                    rend="italic">rondeletii)</hi> occurs in almost all tropical and subtropical
                    seas, but seems to be verging towards extinction. It is known to attain to a
                    length of 40 feet. The tooth figured here of the natural size (fig. 12) is taken
                    from a jaw much shrunk in drying, but still 20 inches wide in its transverse dia
                    meter, and taken from a specimen 36 1/2 feet long. The extinct spe cies must
                    have been still more gigantic in bulk, as we may judge from teeth which are
                    found in the crag or which have been dredged up from the bottom of the
                    Pacific</p>

                <p>expedition, and which are 4 inches wide at the base and 5 inches long measured
                    along their lateral margin. In some Tertiary strata these teeth are extremely
                    abundant, so much so that—for instance, in Florida—the strata in which they
                    occur are quarried to obtain the fossil remains for export to England, where
                    they are con verted into artificial manure.</p>
                <p>The Fox-Shark or Thresher (<hi rend="italic">Alopecias vulpes),</hi> of which
                    every year specimens frequently seen during the summer months, generally in
                    companies, at a distance of from three to a hundred miles off the shore, it is
                    chased by the more courageous of the fishermen for the sake of the oil which is
                    extracted from the liver, one fish yielding from a ton to a ton and a half. Its
                    capture is not unattended with danger, as one blow from the enormously strong
                    tail is sufficient to stave in the sides of a large boat. The simple method used
                    at present of harpooning the fish entails much patience and loss of time upon
                    the captors, as the fish generally sinks to the bottom and sulks for many hours
                    before it rises again in a more or less exhausted condition; and the use of more
                    modern appliances could not fail of securing more speedy and better success. The
                    basking shark is gregarious, and many individuals may be seen in calm weather
                    lying are captured on the British coast, but which is common in all the
                    temperate seas of the northern and southern hemispheres, is readily recognized
                    by its extremely slender tail, the length of which exceeds that of the remainder
                    of the body. Its teeth are small, flat, triangular, and without serrature (fig.
                    13; the single tooth is of the natural size). It follows the shoals of herrings,
                    pilchards, and sprats in their migrations, destroying incredible numbers and
                    frequently injuring the nets by getting entangled in them. When feeding it uses
                    the long tail in splashing the surface of the water, whilst it swims in
                    gradually decreasing circles round a shoal of fishes which are thus kept crowded
                    together, falling an easy prey to their enemy. Sometimes two threshers may be
                    seen working together. Statements that it has been seen to attack whales and
                    other large cetaceans rest upon erroneous observations; its dentition is much
                    too weak to bite through their skin, although, as Couch says, by one splash of
                    its tail on the water it may put a herd of dolphins or porpoises to flight like
                    so many hares. The same effect may be produced by the splash of an oar. The
                    thresher attains to a length of 15 feet, the tail included.</p>
                <p>The Basking Shark <hi rend="italic">(Selache maxima),</hi> sometimes erroneously
                    called “Sun-Fish,” is the largest fish of the North Atlantic, growing to a
                    length of more than 30 feet. It is one of the few types of sharks which up to a
                    very recent time were considered to be peculiar to the North-Atlantic fauna; but
                    Prof. F. M'Coy has just recorded its occurrence on the Australian coast, a
                    specimen 30 feet long having been captured in November 1883 at Portland, on the
                    west coast of Victoria. The mouth is of an extraordinary width, and, like the
                    gill-cavity, capable of great expansion, so as to enable the fish to take at one
                    gulp an enormous quantity of the small fish and other marine creatures on which
                    it subsists. Also the gill-openings are of great width. The teeth are very
                    small, numerous, arranged in several series, conical, and probably without use
                    in feeding. This shark is therefore quite harmless if not attacked. On the west
                    coast of Ireland, where it is together motionless, with the upper part of the
                    back raised above the surface of the water, a habit which it has in common with
                    the true sun-fish <hi rend="italic">(Orthagoriscus),</hi> and from which it has
                    derived its name.</p>
                <p>A shark similar in many points to the basking shark (which it exceeds in size),
                    and an inhabitant of the Indo-Pacific Ocean, is <hi rend="italic">Rhinodon
                    typicus.</hi> In fact, so far as our present knowledge goes, it is the largest
                    of all sharks, as it is known to exceed a length of 50 feet, but it is stated to
                    attain that of 70. The captures of only a few specimens are on record, viz., one
                    at the Cape of Good Hope, one or two near the Seychelles, where it is known as
                    the “chagrin,” one on the coast of California, and one (quite recently) on the
                    coast of Peru. The snout is extremely short, broad, and flat, with the mouth and
                    nostrils placed at its extremity; the gill-openings very wide, and the eye very
                    small. The teeth are, as in the basking shark, extremely small and numerous,
                    conical in shape. No opportunity should be lost of obtaining exact information
                    on this shark.</p>

                    a much larger size, specimens 15 feet long being frequently met with. The two
                    dorsal fins are small and destitute of spines. The teeth (fig. 11) in the upper
                    jaw are small, narrow, conical in shape; those of the lower flat, arranged in
                    several series, one on the top of the other, so that only the uppermost forms
                    the sharp dental edge of the jaw. The points of these lower teeth are so much
                    turned aside that the inner margin only enters the dental edge.</p>
                <p>The Greenland shark is an inhabitant of the Arctic regions, sometimes straying to
                    the latitudes of Great Britain and of Cape Cod in the western Atlantic; it is
                    one of the greatest enemies of the whale, which is often found with large pieces
                    bitten out of the tail·by this shark. Its voracity is so great that, as Scoresby
                    tells us, it is absolutely fearless in the presence of man whilst engaged in
                    feeding on the carcase of a whale, and that it will allow itself to be stabbed
                    with a lance or knife without being driven away.</p>
                <p>The Spinous Shark <hi rend="italic">(Echinorhinus spinosus)</hi> is readily
                    recognized by the short bulky form of its body, its short tail, and the large
                    round bony tubercles which are scattered all over its body, each of which is
                    raised in the middle into a pointed conical spine. More frequent in the
                    Mediterranean, it has been found also not very rarely on the English coasts and
                    near the Cape of Good Hope. It is always living on the ground, and probably
                    descends to some depth. It does not seem to exceed a length of 10 feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bathybial Sharks.—</hi> Sharks do not appear to have yet
                    reached the greatest depths of the ocean; and so far as we know at present we
                    have to fix the limit of their vertical distribution at 500 fathoms. Those which
                    we find to have reached or to pass the 100 fathoms line belong to generic types
                    which, if they include littoral species, are ground-sharks,—as we generally find
                    the bottom-feeders of our littoral fauna much more strongly represented in the
                    deep sea than the surface swimmers. All belong to two families only, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scylliidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Spinacidae,</hi> the
                    littoral members of which live for the greater part habitually on the bottom and
                    probably frequently reach to the 100 fathoms line. Distinctly bathybial species
                    are two small dog-fishes,— <hi rend="italic">Spinax granulatus</hi> from 120
                    fathoms, and <hi rend="italic">Scyllium canescens</hi> from 400 fathoms, both on
                    the south-west coast of South America; also <hi rend="italic">Centroscyllium
                    granulatum</hi> from 245 fathoms in the Antarctic Ocean, whose congener from the
                    coast of Greenland probably descends to a similar depth. The sharks which reach
                    the greatest depth recorded hitherto belong to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Centrophorus,</hi> of which some ten species are known, all from deep water in
                    the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, the Molucca and Japanese seas. The Japanese
                    species were discovered by the naturalists of the “Challenger” on the Hyalonema
                    ground off Inosima in 345 fathoms. Dr E. P. Wright found <hi rend="italic">C.
                    coelolepis</hi> at a still greater depth on the coast of Portugal. The fishermen
                    of Sétubal fish for these sharks in 400 or 500 fathoms, with a line of some 600
                    fathoms in length. “The sharks caught were from 3 to 4 feet long, and when they
                    were hauled into the boat fell down into it like so many dead pigs”; in fact, on
                    being rapidly withdrawn from the great pressure under which they lived they were
                    killed, like other deep-sea fishes under similar circumstances. It is noteworthy
                    that the organization of none of these deep-sea sharks has undergone such a
                    modification as would lead us to infer that they are inhabitants of great
                    depths.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting types of the division of sharks is the small family
                    of <hi rend="italic">Notidanidae,</hi> which is externally distinguished by the
                    presence of a single dorsal fin only, without spine and opposite to the anal,
                    and by having six or seven wide branchial openings. They represent an ancient
                    type, the presence of which in Jurassic formations is shown by teeth extremely
                    similar to those of the living species. Their skeleton is notochordal. Only four
                    species are known, of which one <hi rend="italic">(Notidanus griseus)</hi> has
                    now and then strayed northwards to the</p>
                <p>English coast. A member of this family has been recently discovered in Japan, and
                    is so scarce that only two specimens are known—one in the museum at Cambridge,
                    U.S., and the other in the British Museum. It was named by its first describer,
                    S. Garman, <hi rend="italic">Chlamy-doselachus anguineus</hi> (fig. 1G). It
                    resembles somewhat in shape a conger, and differs from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notidani</hi> proper by its elongate body, wide lateral and terminal mouth,
                    extremely wide gill-openings, and peculiarly formed teeth. The teeth are similar
                    in both jaws, each composed of three slender curved cusps separated by a pair of
                    rudimentary points, and with a broad base directed backwards. These teeth
                    resemble some fossils of the Middle Devonian, described as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cladodus,</hi> and North-American<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n804/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0804-0779"/> naturalists regard, therefore, this fish as “the
                    oldest living type of vertebrate.” The <hi rend="italic">Notidani</hi> are very
                    probably ground-sharks, perhaps descending into deep water; and, although
                    nothing positive is known at present of the habits of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chlamydoselachus,</hi> the fact that this singular type has escaped so long the
                    observation of the numerous collectors in Japan renders it probable that it
                    inhabits depths the exploration of which has been initiated only recently.</p>
                <p>A few words have to be added with reference to the economic uses of this group of
                    fishes. Their utility to man is insignificant in comparison with the havoc they
                    commit among food-fishes and at fisheries, and with the loss of life which is
                    caused by the larger kinds. As mentioned above, some of the smaller dog-fishes
                    are eaten at certain seasons by the captors, and by the poorer classes of the
                    population. An inferior kind of oil, chiefly used for the adulteration of
                    cod-liver oil, is extracted on some of the northern fishing-stations from the
                    liver of the spiked dog-fishes, and occasionally of the larger sharks.
                    Cabinet-makers make extensive use of shark's-skin under the name of “shagreen”
                    for smoothing or polishing wood. This shagreen is obtained from species (such as
                    our dog-fishes) whose skin is covered with small, pointed, closely-set,
                    calcified papillae, whilst very rough skins, in which the papillae are large or
                    blunt, are useless for this purpose. The dried fins of sharks (and of rays) form
                    in India and China an important article of trade, the Chinese preparing gelatin
                    from them, and using the better sort for culinary purposes. They are assorted in
                    two kinds, viz., “white” and “black.” The former consists exclusively of the
                    dorsal fins, which are on both sides of the same light colour, and reputed to
                    yield more gelatin than the other fins. The pectoral, ventral, and anal fins
                    constitute the “black” sort; the caudal are not used. One of the principal
                    places where shark fishing is practised as a profession is Kurrachee, and the
                    principal kinds of sharks caught there are species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carcharias, Galeocerdo,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zygaena.</hi> Dr Buist,
                    writing in 1850, states that there are thirteen large boats, with crews of
                    twelve men each, constantly employed in this pursuit, that the value of the fins
                    sent to the market varies from 15,000 to 18,000 rupees, that a boat will capture
                    sometimes at a draught as many as a hundred sharks of various sizes, and that
                    the number of sharks captured annually amounts probably to not less than 40,000.
                    Large quantities are imported from the African coast and the Arabian Gulf, and
                    various ports on the coast of India. In the year 1845-46 8770 cwt. of sharks’
                    fins were exported from Bombay to China. (A. C. G.)</p>
