                    (1791-1861), the most popular playwright of France, was born at Paris on 24th
                    December 1791, and died there on 20th February 1861. His father was a silk
                    merchant and he was well educated, being destined for the bar. But, having a
                    real gift for the theatre (a gift which unfortunately was not allied with
                    sufficient literary power to make his works last), he very soon broke away from
                    professional study and at the age of twenty produced, in collaboration, as is
                    common in France, the first of a series of dramas which continued for fifty
                    years. <hi rend="italic">Les Demis</hi> (1811). is usually cited as the first
                    play in which he took a hand, though, as for some time he did not sign his work,
                    identification is somewhat difficult. He achieved no distinct success till 1816,
                    when <hi rend="italic">Une Nuit de Garde Nationale</hi> made him in a way
                    famous. Thenceforward his fertility was unceasing and its results prodigious.
                    There may be in existence a complete list of Scribe’s works, but we have never
                    seen any that pretended to be such. He wrote every kind of drama—vaudevilles,<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n579/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0921-0579-0554"/> comedies, tragedies, opera-libretti. To one
                    theatre alone he is said to have furnished more than a hundred pieces. But his
                    life was entirely uneventful, and his election to the Academy in 1834 is almost
                    the only incident which deserves chronicling. It ought to be said to Scribe’s
                    credit that, although he was the least original of writers and was more an
                    editor of dramas than a dramatist, although he was for many years an object of
                    the bitterest envy to impecunious geniuses owing to his pecuniary success, and
                    although he never has pleased and never can please any critic who applies purely
                    literary tests, his character stands very high for literary probity and indeed
                    generosity. He is said in some cases to have sent sums of money for “copyright
                    in ideas” to men who not only had not actually collaborated with him but who
                    were unaware that he had taken suggestions from their work. His industry was
                    untiring and his knowledge both of the mechanism of the stage and of the tastes
                    of the audience was wonderful. Nevertheless he hardly deserves a place in
                    literature, his style being vulgar, his characters commonplace, even his plots
                    lacking power and grasp. He wrote a few novels, but none of any mark. The best
                    known of Scribe’s pieces after his first successful one are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Une Chaîne</hi> (1842), <hi rend="italic">Le Verre d' Eau</hi> (1842), <hi
