                    of</hi></label> (1625— 1672), general and admiral, was the son of Sir Sidney
                    Montagu, youngest brother of Edward Lord Montagu of Boughton, and was born 27th
                    July 1625. In August 1643 he raised a regiment in the service of the Parliament,
                    with which he specially distinguished himself at Marston Moor, Naseby, and the
                    siege of Bristol. He was a member of the “Little Parliament” (1653), and one of
                    the committee for regulating the customs. In November he was elected to the
                    council of state. In the first Protectorate parliament he sat for
                    Huntingdonshire. In January 1656 he succeeded Penn as admiral, and he was
                    associated with Blake in his expedition to the Mediterranean in the same year.
                    After the treaty with France against Spain in 1657 he held command of the fleet
                    sent to prevent the relief of the three coast towns—Gravelines, Mardike, and
                    Dunkirk—besieged by the French, and was successful in defeating an attempt by a
                    great Spanish force to retake Mardike. After the death of Cromwell he was sent
                    with a fleet to the North Sea to enter into negotiations with the Northern
                    powers, but, communications having been opened with him on behalf of Charles
                    II., he returned to England only to find that the conspiracy of Sir George Booth
                    had miscarried, whereupon, after a lame explanation, he was dismissed from his
                    command. At the Restoration, having commanded the fleet which conveyed the king
                    to England, he was made Knight of the Garter, and soon afterwards elevated to
                    the peerage as Baron Montagu of St Neots, Viscount Hinchinbroke, and Earl of
                    Sandwich. During the war with the Dutch in 1664-65 he commanded the Blue
                    squadron under the duke of York, and specially distinguished himself in the
                    great battle of 3d June 1665. After his return to England he was sent to
                    negotiate a peace between Spain and Portugal, and also a treaty of commerce with
                    Spain. On a renewal of the war in 1672 he again commanded the Blue squadron
                    under the duke of York, and during the fight in Southwold Bay, on the 28th May,
