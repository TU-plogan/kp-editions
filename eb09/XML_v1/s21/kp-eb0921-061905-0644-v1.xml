                    House of Parliament, or the administration of justice, or to excite Her
                    Majesty's subjects to attempt otherwise than by lawful means the alteration of
                    any matter in church or state by law established, or to raise discontent or
                    disaffection amongst Her Majesty’s subjects, or to promote feelings of ill-will
                    and hostility between different classes of Her Majesty’s subjects. An intention
                    to show that Her Majesty has been misled or mistaken in her measures, or to
                    point out errors or defects in the Government or constitution as by law
                    established, with a view to their reformation, or to excite Her Majesty’s
                    subjects to attempt by lawful means the alteration of any matter in church or
                    state by law established, or to point out, in order to their removal, matters
                    which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and
                    ill-will between different classes of Her Majesty’s subjects, is not a seditious
                    intention. In determining whether the intention with which any words were
                    spoken, any document was published, or any agreement was made, was or was not
                    seditious, every person must be deemed to intend the consequences which would
                    naturally follow from his conduct at the time and under the circumstances in
                    which he so conducted himself” <hi rend="italic">(Digest of the Criminal
                    Law,</hi> §§ 91-94).</p>
                <p>The principal enactments now in force dealing with seditious offences were all
                    passed during the last twenty-five years of the reign of George III. They are 37
                    Geo. III. c. 123, prohibiting the administering or taking of unlawful oaths (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Oath)</hi> or the belonging to an unlawful confederacy; 60
                    Geo. III. and 1 Geo. IV. c. 1, prohibiting unlawful drilling and military
                    exercises; and the Acts for the suppression of corresponding societies, 39 Geo.
                    III. c. 79 and 57 Geo. III. c. 19. No proceedings can be instituted under these
                    last two Acts without the authority of the law officers of the crown (9 and 10
                    Vict. c. 33). Under the head of statutes aimed at seditious offences may also be
                    classed 2 Ric. II. st. 1, c. 5 and 12 Ric. II. c. 11, against <hi rend="italic"
                    >scandalum magnatum</hi> or slander of great men, such as peers, judges, or
                    great officers of state, whereby discord may arise within the realm, and 13 Car.
                    II. c. 5, against tumultuous petitioning (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Petition).</hi> There has been no prosecution in recent times for seditious
                    words as distinguished from seditious libel, but such words have been admitted
                    as evidence in proceedings for seditious <hi rend="smallcaps">Conspiracy</hi>
                    (q.v.), as in the prosecution of O’Connell in 1844 and of Mr Parnell and others
                    in 1880 (see Reg. <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Parnell, Cox’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Criminal Cases,</hi> vol. xiv. 508). By the Prison Act, 1877, any prisoner
                    under sentence for sedition or seditious libel is to be treated as a
                    misdemeanant of the first division (40 and 41 Vict. c. 21, s. 40).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> "All acts by which the minds of the people may
                    be incited to defeat the Government or control legislation by violent or
                    unconstitutional means are seditious” (Macdonald, <hi rend="italic">Criminal
                    Law,</hi> 229). Sedition is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both (6 Geo.
                    IV. c. 47). A very large number of Acts of the Scottish Parliament dealt with
                    sedition, beginning as early as 1184 with the assize of William the Lion, c. 29.
                    Leasing-making is to be distinguished from sedition, as it attacked only the
                    sovereign individually, not the Government.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> In the Acts of Congress the word
                    “sedition” appears to occur only in the army and navy articles. A soldier
                    joining any sedition or who, being present at any sedition, does not use his
                    utmost endeavour to suppress the same is punishable with death. A sailor
                    uttering seditious words is punishable at the discretion of a court-martial. In
                    1798 an Act of Congress called the Sedition Act was passed, which expired by
                    effluxion of time in 1801. Its constitutionality was violently assailed at the
                    time. (See Story on the constitution of the United States, §§ 1293-4.) Several
                    prosecutions under the Act will be found in Wharton’s <hi rend="italic">State
                    Trials.</hi> Sedition is also dealt with by the State laws mostly in a very
                    liberal spirit. Thus the Louisiana Code, § 394, enacts that “there is no such
                    offence known to our law as defamation of the Government or either of its
                    branches, either under the name of libel, slander, seditious writing, or other
                    appellation.” By § 111, to constitute the offence of sedition “there must be not
                    only a design to dismember the State, or to subvert or change its constitution,
                    but an attempt must be made to do it by force.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Continent of Europe.—</hi> The Continental codes as a rule are
                    little more definite than English law in their treatment of sedition. In Germany
                    a distinction is drawn between <hi rend="italic">Auflauf,</hi> the remaining
                    together of a mob after the authorities have thrice bid it disperse, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Aufruhr</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aufstand,</hi> an organized
                    resistance to the authorities; but no definition is given of the terms. The
                    Hungarian penal code defines <hi rend="italic">Aufstand</hi> to be an armed
                    assembly which has the intention of attacking a class of citizens, a
                    nationality, or a religious body. The French penal code recognizes a difference
                    between <hi rend="italic">sédition</hi> and <hi rend="italic">réunion
                    séditieuse.</hi> If carried out with sufficient numbers and sufficient force <hi
                    rend="italic">sédition</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">rébellion.</hi> Section
                    100 exempts from the penalties of sedition those who have merely been present at
                    a seditious meeting without taking any active part therein, and have dispersed
                    at the first warning of the military or civil authorities.</p>
