                <p><label type="entry">CADMIUM</label>, a metaI closely allied to zinc. It was
                    discovered in 1817 by Stromeyer and Hermann, independently, but in a similar
                    manner. The former chemist, in the execution of his duties as inspector of
                    pharmaceutical products in Hanover, found a substance, sold as oxide, to be
                    really carbonate of zinc, and, applying to the manufacturer for explanation of
                    the reason of the substitution of the latter product for the former was informed
                    that, although the best zinc, in which no iron could be detected, was employed,
                    the oxide could not be produced without a slight discoloration from oxide of
                    iron. On investigation by Stromeyer, it was found that the discoloration was due
                    not to iron but to the oxide of anew metal, which he succeeded in isolating, and
                    named cadmium, from the old chemical name for zinc oxide <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cadmia</hi><hi rend="italic">fossilis).</hi> About the same time, the sale of
                    an oxide of zinc supplied by Hermann, a chemical manufacturer, who produced it
                    from the waste of the Silesian zinc furnaces, was stopped in Prussia as being
                    contaminated with arsenic,—the reason obviously being that the acid solution of
                    the substance in question gave a bright yellow precipitate when heated with
                    sulphuretted hydrogen. The erroneous character of this inference was, however,
                    soon demonstrated by Hermann, who made a careful investigation 'of the subject,
                    and discovered the nature of the new metal, but not before Stromeyer had
                    published the results of his observations.</p>
                <p>Cadmium does not occur in the metallic state in nature, and there is only one
                    definite mineral known which contains it in quantity, namely, the sulphide, or
                    greenockite, which occurs at Bishopstown, in Renfrewshire, in small isolated
                    crystals of a bright orange-yellow colour, belonging to the hexagonal system, in
                    a doleritic rock associated with prehnite. This contains 77'7 per cent, of
                    cadmium and 22'3 per cent, of sulphur, corresponding to the formula CdS, and is
                    isomorphous with voltzite, the rhombohedral form of sulphide of zinc. Although
                    an extremely rare mineral in the pure state, being confined to the single
                    locality mentioned above, sulphide of cadmium is often present in zinc blende,
                    the richest varieties containing -3 per cent, of cadmium. Among these are the
                    yellow radiated blende of Przibram in Bohemia, Eaton in New Hampshire, and Engis
                    and Corfali in Belgium. It is also found in the carbonates and silicates of zinc
                    from most of the localities producing these ores, but in what state of
                    combination is doubtful, as it is not generally found in quantity s ∙.fiicient
                    to be appreciated by the analysis of samples,— being only discoverable when the
                    ore is treated for zinc on the large scale, in the first products of the
                    reducing processes.</p>
                <p>Cadmium is a white metal with a slight bluish tinge by reflected light; it is
                    whiter than lead or zinc, but less so than silver, has a high lustre when
                    polished, and breaks, under a gradually increasing strain, with the fibrous or
                    scaly fracture characteristic of a soft tough metal. It may be readily
                    crystallized in octohedra, differing in this respect from the allied metal zinc
                    which is rhombohedral. It is somewhat harder than tin, but less so than zinc,
                    and like the former metal it emits a peculiar crackling sound when bent. It is
                    malleable, and may be rolled into thin sheets. The specific gravity after fusion
                    is 8'604, which is increased by hammering to 8 ’ 694. The specific heat is
                    0'05669 (Régnault), or 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 0576 (Dulong and Petit).
                    The electric conductivity is 22'10, or somewhat lower than that of zinc; the
                    thermal conductivity does not appear to have been determined. It melts at a
                    temperature below redness (315° to 320° C.), and boils at the temperature of
                    860° C., giving off a vapour of an orange-yellow tint. The principal coloured
                    lines with their relative intensity observed in the spectrum of cadmium vapour
                    are, according to Huggins’s notation, 502 <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi>, 639

                <p>Chemically cadmium belongs to the diatomic group of elements; its symbol is Cd,
                    and its equivalent 58. It unites readily with most of the heavy metals, forming
                    alloys, which with gold, copper, and platinum, are brittle, while those with
                    lead and tin are malleable and ductile. The alloy of ∙∣ silver and ½ cadmium is
                    very tenacious; but that, in the reverse proportion, of ½ silver and -∣ cadmium
                    is brittle. An alloy of two parts of cadmium, two of lead, and four of tin,
                    known as Wood’s fusible metal, melts at a somewhat lower point than the similar
                    alloy where bismuth takes the place of cadmium, or Darcet’s fusible metal (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Bismuth).</hi> It forms several amalgams, among which those
                    containing equal parts of mercury and cadmium and two of mercury to one of
                    cadmium are remarkable for their cohesive power and malleability; whereas that
                    containing 22 per cent, of cadmium is hard and brittle. The amalgams of the
                    former class have been proposed at different times for use in stopping teeth,
                    but are not now so employed. When exposed to damp air cadmium becomes rapidly
                    covered with a dull film of suboxide, but as with zinc the oxidation is only
                    superficial, the crust formed protecting the metal below from further change.
                    When heated to a redness in air it burns, forming a yellowish brown oxide. It
                    also, when in a state of vapour, decomposes water at a red heat, with the
                    formation of oxide of [cadmium, hydrogen being evolved. It is soluble with
                    evolution of hydrogen, in sulphuric, hydrochloric, nitric, and even acetic acid,
                    forming colourless salts. When treated with an aqueous solution of sulphurous
                    acid, it dissolves without evolution of hydrogen, sulphite and sulphide of
                    cadmium being found in the liquid.</p>
                <p>Oxide of cadmium, CdO, is a yellowish brown powder of the specific gravity 6'95,
                    varying in depth of tint according to the temperature at which it is prepared.
                    It may be produced by burning the metal in air or by calcining the nitrate or
                    carbonate. It is readily reducible by hydrogen or carbon, at a high temperature,
                    but below that necessary for the reduction of zinc oxide. If a mixture of the
                    oxides of the two metals be heated in a current of hydrogen in a glass tube, the
                    oxide of cadmium is reduced, volatilizes, and condenses in the cooler part of
                    the tube, while the oxide of zinc remains unchanged. Oxide of cadmium is a
                    strong base, forming salts similar in constitution to those formed by oxide of
                    zinc, and those of the earthy and alkaline metals. The most important of these
                    is the sulphate, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n700/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0700-0629"/> CdSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, which is
                    produced when the metal or its oxide is dissolved in sulphuric acid, forming
                    crystals containing cither one or four atoms of water, the former being
                    deposited from a boiling solution, and the latter at the ordinary temperature of
                    the air. The uses of cadmium salts are very limited; the sulphate is employed to
                    a small extent as a lotion in inflammation of the eyes, similarly to the
                    sulphate of zinc, and the iodide in photography and in medicine for the same
                    purposes as iodide of potassium. The only compound of any real importance is the
                    sulphide, CdS, which produces several brilliant yellow and orange colours. These
                    are quite permanent, unlike the yellow produced by lead, chromium, or other
                    metals, which are all more or less subject to discoloration when exposed to the
                    action of sulphuretted hydrogen in the atmosphere. It is produced when
                    sulphuretted hydrogen, or an alkaline sulphide, is added to the solution of any
                    cadmium salt, as an orange-red powder, which becomes carmine-red when heated. At
                    a white heat it melts, and solidifies on cooling in lemon-yellow scales of a
                    micaceous structure. When the precipitated sulphide is heated in hydrogen it is
                    decomposed, forming cadmium vapour and sulphuretted hydrogen, which reunite in
                    the cooler part of the tube, producing crystals exactly similar to the native
                    mineral greenockite.</p>
                <p>The best test for cadmium is afforded by the colour of the deposit formed on
                    charcoal when it is volatilized and oxidized before the blowpipe flame. This is
                    of a reddish brown colour, and usually shows the colours of thin plates from the
                    tenuity of the film; whereas zinc under the same conditions gives a deposit
                    which is bright yellow while hot, but becomes white on cooling. The
                    precipitation as a yellow sulphide from an acid solution is another
                    distinguishing character, as sulphide of zinc does not separate except from
                    neutral or alkaline solutions. In quantitative analysis it is always estimated
                    as oxide, being separated from solution as carbonate by precipitation with
                    carbonate of sodium, which is converted into oxide by calcination. Cadmium, like
                    lead, may also be separated from its solution in acids by means of zinc, which
                    precipitates it in a dendritic form, like the well-known lead tree.</p>
                <p>The production of cadmium is restricted to a very few localities. At Engis in
                    Belgium it occurs in zinc blende to the extent of about 0 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> 2 per cent. The oxide formed, together with oxide of zinc in the
                    calcination of the blende, is in the subsequent reducing process in the ordinary
                    Belgian zinc furnace (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Zinc),</hi> reduced and
                    volatilized in the first period of the operation, before the heat is raised
                    sufficiently to produce much zinc vapour, and the vapour, on coming in contact
                    with the air, burns with a characteristic brown flame as distinguished from that
                    of zinc, which is bluish green. The deposit formed in the condensing tubes, and
                    in the nozzles <hi rend="italic">(allonges)</hi> in front of the retorts, during
                    this part of the process is comparatively rich in cadmium oxide, averaging about
                    1½ per cent. It is put aside until a sufficiency is collected, when it is
                    enriched by a second distillation up to about 6 per cent., this second product
                    being finally reduced by a third distillation with carbon at a dull red heat.
                    The furnace contains fifteen retorts, four of which are reserved for the
                    reduction of the enriched oxide. Castiron tubes are used, as the vapour of the
                    metal readily penetrates clay retorts. The loss on the process is very
                    considerable, only 30 ’ 12 per cent, of the whole amount of cadmium contained in
                    the material treated being recovered; 21 ∙17 per cent, is left in the residues,
                    and 48 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 71 per cent, escapes condensation. The
                    total produce of cadmium is very small; about one-half of the amount is produced
                    at Engis, and the remainder in Silesia. In 1874 the production of cadmium in
                    Lower Silesia amounted to 25 cwt., valued at £990 or about £800 per ton; but
                    owing to the small demand many works had given up the manufacture. ∕H. B.)</p>
