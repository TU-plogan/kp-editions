                    in Estremadura, in Spain, 20 miles south of the Tagus, and 24 miles west of
                    Truxillo, on a ridge of hills which stretch from east to west. It is the
                    residence of the bishop of Corias, and contains a handsome episcopal palace, as
                    well as a public school, a college, and several charitable institutions. The
                    monastery and college of the Jesuits was one of the finest in the kingdom, but
                    has been secularized and converted into a hospital. In the neighbourhood are
                    large gardens, well-cultivated fields, and extensive pasture grounds; while in
                    the town are oil and fulling mills, soap-works, tanneries, and lime-kilns. There
                    is also some trade in wool. Caceres occupies the site of the ancient <hi
                    rend="italic">Castra</hi><hi rend="italic">Caecilia,</hi> and was a place of
                    some importance both under the Romans and under the Moors. There are several
                    fine specimens of the domestic architecture of the Middle Ages, such as the
                    houses of the duke of Abrantes, the count de la Torre, and the count de los
                    Carbajales. The bull-ring, a modern structure of granite, is one of the most
                    remarkable buildings of its kind in Spain. Population, 13,466.</p>
                <p>C ACHAO, or, as it is variously spelled, <hi rend="smallcaps">Kacho, Kecho,
                    Hecho,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Kesho,</hi> formerly known as Donk-king and
                    now officially as Bacthian or Bac-king, is the largest city of Anam, and the
                    capital of the province of Tonquin. It is situated on the west side of the
                    Tonquin River, about eighty miles from the sea, in 105° 35' E. long., 21° N.
                    lat. It is of great extent. The principal streets are wide and airy, and for the
                    most part are paved with bricks and small stones, but the others are narrow and
                    ill paved. Most of the houses are constructed of mud or sun-burned bricks and
                    timber, and thatched with leaves, straw, or reeds, and are generally one story
                    in height. The public edifices are spacious, particularly the royal palace,
                    which is several miles in circuit, and is surrounded by high walls. Besides this
                    palace there are to be seen the ruins of one still more magnificent, said to
                    have been six miles in circumference. Cachao is a place of some commercial
                    resort; its imports are long cloths, chintz, arms, pepper, and other articles,
                    which are exchanged for gold and manufactured goods, namely, beautiful silks and
                    lackered ware, which last is generally reckoned superior to any in the East. The
                    English factory, which stood on the banks of the river north of the city, and
                    that of the Dutch, south of it, have long been withdrawn. Cachao is peculiarly
                    liable to fires; and to prevent or extinguish these, the city is governed by a
                    rigid police, and divided into wards. Fires for domestic use are only permitted
                    during certain hours of the day. About the middle of the 18th century the city
                    was nearly burnt to the ground by a conflagration, which was the work of
                    incendiaries. In 1873 François Garnier, the famous French explorer, with an
                    expedition of two hundred men and two ships, having come into collision with the
                    authorities, took possession of the city after capturing the fort of Hanoi,
                    which was constructed on European principles and defended by a large garrison.
                    Not long after he was assassinated by the natives; but his victory led to a
                    treaty between the French Government and the Anamese, by which the port is
                    declared open to the flags of all nations.</p>
