                <p><label type="entry">CALCUTTA</label>, the capital of India, and seat of the
                    Supreme Government, is situated on the east bank of the Húglí River, in latitude
                    22° 33' 47" N. and longitude 88° 23' 34" E. It lies about 80 miles from the
                    seaboard, and receives the accumulated produce which the two great river systems
                    of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra collect throughout the provinces of Bengal and
                    Assam. From a cluster of mud villages at the close of the 17th century, it has
                    advanced with a rapid growth to a densely inhabited metropolis, which, with its
                    four suburbs, contains a population^of 892,429 souls. The central portion, which
                    forms the Calcutta municipality, has a population returned in 1872 at 447,601.
                    In the same year its maritime trade amounted to 52½ millions sterling, of which
                    the exports formed 31∣ millions, and the imports 20∣, showing an excess of
                    exports over imports of 11 millions sterling.</p>
                <p>The history of Calcutta practically dates from the year 1686. In 1596 it had
                    obtained a brief entry as a rent-designed to form a semicircle round the town,
                    and to be connected at both ends with the river, but which was never completed,
                    combined with the natural position of Calcutta to render it one of the safest
                    places for trade in India during the expiring struggles of the Mughul empire. It
                    grew up without any fixed plan, and with little regard to the sanitary
                    arrangements required for a town. Some parts of it lie below water mark on the
                    ĭĭúglí, and its low level throughout rendered its drainage a most difficult
                    problem. Until far on in the last century, the jungle and paddy fields closely
                    hemmed in the European mansions with a circle of malaria; the vast plain <hi
                    rend="italic">(maiddn)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> with its gardens
                    and promenades, where the fashion of Calcutta now displays itself every evening,
                    was then a swamp during three months of each year; the spacious quadrangle known
                    as Wellington Square was built upon a filthy creek. A legend relates how
                    one-fourth of the European inhabitants perished in twelve months, and paying
                    village iu the survey of Bengal executed by command of the Emperor Akbar. But it
                    was not till 90 years later that it emerged into history. In 1686 the English
                    merchants at Húglí, finding themselves compelled to quit their factory in
                    consequence of a rupture with the Mughul authorities, retreated about 26 miles
                    down the river to Sutánatí, a village on the banks of the Húglí, now within the
                    boundaries of Calcutta. Their new settlement soon extended itself along the
                    river bank to the then village of Calcutta, and by degrees the cluster of
                    neighbouring hamlets grew into the present town. In 1689-90 the Bengal servants
                    of the East India Company determined to make it their headquarters. In 1696 they
                    built the original Fort William, and in 1700 they formally purchased the three
                    villages of Sutánatí, Calcutta, and Gobíndpur from Prince Azim, son of the
                    Emperor Aurungzebe.</p>
                <p>The site thus chosen had an excellent anchorage, and was defended by the river
                    from the Marhattás, who harried the districts on the other side. A fort,
                    subsequently rebuilt on the Vauban principle, and a moat, during seventy years
                    the mortality was so great that the name of Calcutta, derived from the village
                    of Kálighát, was identified by mariners with Golgotha, the place of a skull.</p>
                <p>The chief event in the history of Calcutta is the sack of the town and the
                    capture of Fort William in 1756, by Suráj-ud-Daulá, the Nawáb of Bengal. The
                    majority of the English officials took ship and fled to the mouth of the Húglí
                    River. The Europeans who remained were compelled, after a short resistance, to
                    surrender themselves to the mercies of the young prince. The prisoners,
                    numbering 146 persons, were driven at the point of the sword into the
                    guard-room, a chamber scarcely 20 feet square, with but two small windows. Next
                    morning only 23 were taken out alive, among them Mr Holwell, the annalist of the
                    “Black Hole.” This event took place on June 20, 1756. The Mahometans retained
                    possession of Calcutta for about seven months, and during this brief period the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n728/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0728-0657"/> name of the town was changed in official
                    documents to Alinagar. In January 1757 the expedition despatched from Madras,
                    under the command of Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive, regained possession of
                    the city. They found many of the houses of the English residents demolished, and
                    others damaged by fire. The old church of St John’s lay in ruins. The native
                    portion of the town had also suffered much. Everything of value had been swept
                    away, except the merchandise of the Company within the fort, which had been
                    reserved for the Nawáb. The battle of Plassey was fought on June 23d, 1757,
                    exactly twelve months after the capture of Calcutta. Mir Jáfar, the nominee of
                    the English, was created Nawáb of Bengal, and by the treaty which raised him to
                    this position he agreed to make restitution to the Calcutta merchants for their
                    losses. The English received £500,000, the Hindus and Mahometans £200,000, and
                    the Armenians £70,000. By another clause in this treaty the Company was
                    permitted to establish a mint, the visible sign in India of territorial
                    sovereignty, and the first coin, still bearing the name of the Delhi emperor,
                    was issued on August 19th, 1757. The restitution money was divided among the
                    sufferers by a committee of the most respectable inhabitants. Commerce rapidly
                    revived, and the ruined city was rebuilt. Modern Calcutta dates from 1757. The
                    old fort was abandoned, and its site devoted to the Customs House and other
                    Government offices. A new fort, the present Fort William, was commenced by
                    Clive, a short distance lower down the River Húglí. It was not finished till
                    1773, and is said to have cost two millions sterling. At this time also the <hi
                    rend="italic">maidán,</hi> the park of Calcutta, was formed; and the salubrity
                    of its position induced the European inhabitants gradually to shift their
                    dwellings eastward, and to occupy what is now the Chauringhi (Chowringhee)
                    quarter.</p>
                <p>From this time the history of Calcutta presents a smooth narrative of advancing
                    prosperity. No outbreak of civil war nor any episode of disaster* has disturbed
                    its progress, nor have the calamities of the.climate ever done mischief which
                    could not be easily repaired. A great park <hi rend="italic">(maidán),</hi>
                    intersected by roads, and ornamented by a garden, stretches along the river
                    bank. The fort rises from it on its western side, the stately mansions of
                    Chauringhi with Government House, the high court, and other public offices, line
                    its eastern and northern flank. Beyond the European quarter lie the densely
                    populated clusters of huts or “villages” which compose the native city and
                    suburbs. Several fine squares, with large reservoirs and gardens, adorn the
                    city, and broad well-metalled streets connect its various extremities.</p>
                <p>Up to 1707, when Calcutta was first declared a presidency, it had been dependent
                    upon the older English settlement at Madras. From 1707 to 1773 the presidencies
                    were maintained on a footing of equality; but in the latter year the Act of
                    Parliament was passed, which provided that the presidency of Bengal should
                    exercise a control over the other possessions of the Company; that the chief of
                    that presidency should be styled GovernorGeneral; and that a supreme court of
                    judicature should be established at Calcutta. In the previous year, 1772, Warren
                    Hastings had taken under the immediate management of the Company’s servants the
                    general administration of Bengal, which had hitherto been left in the hands of
                    the old Mahometan officials, and had removed the treasury from Murshidábád to
                    Calcutta. The latter town thus became the capital of Bengal, and the seat of the
                    Supreme Government in India. In 1834: the GovernorGeneral of Bengal was created
                    Governor-General of India, and was permitted to appoint a Deputy-Governor to
                    manage the affairs of Lower Bengal during his occasional absence. It was not
                    until 1854 that a separate head was appointed for Bengal, who, under the style
                    of Lieutenant-Governor, exercises the same powers in civil matters as those
                    vested in the Governors in Council of Madras or Bombay, although subject to
                    closer supervision by the Supreme Government. Calcutta is thus at present the
                    seat both of the Supreme and the Local Government, each with an independent set
                    of offices. Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General of
                    India, or Viceroy, is a magnificent pile of buildings to the north of the fort
                    and the <hi rend="italic">maidán,</hi> built by Lord Wellesley in 1804. The
                    official residence of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal is a house called
                    Belvedere, in Alipur, the southern suburb of Calcutta. Proposals have been made
                    from time to time to remove the seat of the Supreme Government from Calcutta.
                    Its unhealthiness, especially in the rainy season, its remoteness from the
                    centre of Hindustán, and its distance from England, have each been animadverted
                    upon. These disadvantages of Calcutta have now, however, been almost entirely
                    removed, or their consequences have been mitigated, by the conquests of science
                    and modern engineering. The railway and the telegraph have brought the Viceroy
                    at Calcutta into close contact with every corner of India; while an ample water
                    supply, improved drainage, and other sanitary reforms, have rendered Calcutta
                    the healthiest city in the East,—healthier, indeed, than some of the great
                    European towns. English civilization has thus enabled Calcutta to remain the
                    political capital of India. The same agency still secures the city in her
                    monopoly of the sea-borne trade of Bengal. The River Húglí has long ceased to be
                    the main channel of the Ganges; but Calcutta alone of all the successive river
                    capitals of Bengal has overcome the difficulties incident to its position as a
                    deltaic centre of commerce. Strenuous efforts of engineering are required to
                    keep open the “Nadiyá Rivers,” namely, the three off-shoots of the Ganges which
                    combine to form the Húglí. Still greater watchfulness and more extensive
                    operations are demanded by the Húglí itself below Calcutta, to save it from the
                    fate of other deltaic streams, and prevent it from gradually silting up. In 1853
                    the deterioration òf the Húglí channel led to a proposal to found an auxiliary
                    port to Calcutta on the Matlah, another mouth of the Ganges. A committee, then
                    appointed to inquire into the subject, reported that “the River Húglí was
                    deteriorating gradually and progressively.” At that time “science had done
                    nothing to aid in facilities for navigation,” but since then everything has been
                    done which the foresight of modern knowledge could suggest, or the power of
                    modern capital could achieve. Observations on the condition of the river are
                    taken almost hourly, gigantic steam dredgers are continually at work, and the
                    shifting of the shoals is carefully recorded. By these means the port of
                    Calcutta has been kept open for ships of the largest tonnage, and now seems to
                    have out-lived the danger which threatened it.</p>

                    sense, be said to extend across the Húglí, and to include Howrah on the western
                    side of the river, as well as the three separate municipalities on the eastern
                    bank, known as the suburbs of Calcutta, the north suburban town, and the south
                    suburban town. The total <hi rend="italic">population</hi> of the area thus
                    defined was returned by the census of 1872 at 892,429 souls. Calcutta proper, or
                    the central portion, which lies, roughly speaking, between the old Marhatta
                    ditch and the Húglí, is governed by a distinct municipality. In 1752 Mr Hol well
                    estimated the number of houses within its limits at 51,132, and the inhabitants
                    at 409,056 persons; but both these estimates were probably much too high; in
                    1822 the number of inhabitants was returned at 179,917; in 1831 at 187,081; in
                    1850 at 361,369; and in 1866 at 377,924. In 1872 a regular census was taken
                    under the conduct of the municipality. The results present features of doubtful
                    accuracy. They were as follows :— Area, 8 square miles; number of houses,
                    38,864; population,— Hindus, 291,194; Mahometans, 133,131; Buddhists, 869;

                    11; number of persons per square mile, 55,950. The length of the <hi
                    rend="italic">roads</hi> in the town is about 120 miles. The present <hi
                    rend="italic">governing body</hi> was created in accordance with the provisions
                    of Act 6 of 1863 (Bengal Council). It consists of the justices of the peace for
                    Calcutta, with a salaried chairman, who is a member of the civil service. All
                    the members are nominated by the Government, but a deputy chairman is chosen by
                    the justices out of their own body. As the justices are not in any sense
                    representative, the power and responsibility are to a great extent centred in
                    the chairman; but of late years, by means of departmental committees, the
                    co-operation of the ordinary members has been enlisted. Out of about 100
                    justices who are resident in Calcutta exactly one-half are Europeans. In 1874
                    the ordinary revenue of the municipality amounted to £240,656, of which £160,000
                    was raised by rates, and £37,000 by licences. The ordinary expenditure for the
                    same year amounted to £233,374, of which £80,000 was devoted to interest on
                    loans and sinking fund, £32,000 to general expenses, £30,000 to roads, two items
                    of £22,000 to lighting and water supply, and £13,000 to conservancy. Including
                    capital account, receipts, loans, suspense account, and cash balances, the total
                    amount at the disposal of the justices during the year was £433,938. The
                    aggregate expenditure under both revenue and capital account amounted to
                    £382,823. The total loan liabilities of the corporation are £1,466,060, and the
                    total of interest and sinking fund payable yearly is £100,474. The average rate
                    of municipal taxation per head of the population is about 10s. 8d. The most
                    important undertaking under the care of the municipality is the <hi
                    rend="italic">water supply.</hi> The present system dates from 1865, when the
                    sanction of Government was given to the construction of works which now pour
                    upwards of 6 million gallons a day of filtered water into the city. The source
                    of supply is from the Húglí at Palta, about 16 miles above Calcutta. The works
                    there consist of two large suction pipes, 30 inches in diameter, through which
                    the water is drawn from the river by three engines, each of 50 horse power
                    nominal; the water is then passed into six settling tanks, each 500 feet long by
                    250 feet wide. Here it is allowed to stand for 36 hours, when it is permitted to
                    run off to the filters, eight in number, the area of each being 200 by 100 feet.
                    After filtration the water is made to flow over a marble platform, where its
                    purity can be observed. It is then conducted to Calcutta by a 42-inch iron main.
                    These works cost £525,432. They were finished in 1870, and connected with pipes
                    laid under 100 miles of streets. The total number of house connections up to
                    December 31,1874, was 8159. The total quantity of water delivered during that
                    year amounted to 2,524,566,300 gallons, being considerably over the estimated
                    average of 6 million gallons daily, or about 13 gallons per head of the
                    population. The total cost for the same year of the water-supply (inclusive of
                    interest) was £55,547, or about 5d. per 1000 gallons.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">drainage</hi> works are on an equally effective scale. The
                    main sewers are underground, and for the proper discharge of their contents in
                    the direction of the Salt Lake, a pumping station is maintained at an annual
                    cost of £3000. The system of underground drainage, although not entirely
                    completed, had cost in 1874 a capital sum of £620,000 In 1863, on the
                    constitution of the present municipality, a <hi rend="italic">health
                    officer</hi> with an adequate establishment was appointed The practice of

                    All refuse and night-soil are removed by the municipality, and conveyed by a
                    special railway to the Salt Lake. The town is lighted by a private <hi

                    at the public expense. The fire brigade consists of 2 steam fire-engines, and 5
                    hand engines, its annual cost being about £2000. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >police</hi> of Calcutta is under the control of a commissioner, who is also the
                    chairman of the justices Beneath him there is a deputy-commissioner. The force
                    consists of 4 superintendents, 155 subordinate officers of various grades, 1292
                    constables, and 6 mounted constables, maintained in 1873 at a cost of £41,227,
                    of which Government contributed one-fourth. Several minor bodies, such as the
                    river police, Government guards, &amp;c., bring the entire strength of the force
                    in the town and on the river to 2313 men. The great majority are natives, the
                    number of European sergeants and constables being only 50.</p>
                <p>In 1872-73 the statistics of <hi rend="italic">education</hi> in Calcutta were as
                    follows: —There were 3 Government colleges, namely, the Presidency College,
                    founded in 1855, and attended by 709 pupils; the Sanskrit College, established
                    in 1824, attended by 26 adult pupils, of whom 17 are Brahmans; the Calcutta
                    Madrasá or Mahometan College founded in 1781, number of pupils 528. There are
                    also five colleges mainly supported by missionary efforts, aided by Government,
                    and attended by 305 pupils The total number of schools in Calcutta reported on
                    by the Educational Department is 260, with 19,445 scholars; 157 of them are male
                    schools, teaching 16,155 boys; the remaining 103 are for girls, and teach 3290
                    pupils. According to a different principle of classification, 36 schools teach
                    English to 9445 boys, 121 teach the vernacular only to 6620 boys, 99 are
                    vernacular schools for girls with 3244 pupils, and 4 are normal schools,
                    instructing 90 male teachers and 46 female. Of the total number of pupils in
                    these schools, 47 '7 per cent, are ascertained to be Hindus, 13 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 Christians, 2 ’ 6 Musalmáns, and the remaining 36'2
                    per cent, are of unascertained religions. The total ascertained expenditure was
                    £25,011, of which sum the Government contributed £9160. The Government School of
                    Art was attended in 1872-73 by 94 students, of whom 88 are Hindus, 4 Musalmáns,
                    and 2 Eurasians. Calcutta has also an important school of medicine, or medical
                    college, with a large hospital attached and every facility for a thorough
                    scientific training.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">medical charities</hi> of Calcutta comprise the Medical
                    College Hospital, just named the General Hospital, the Native or Mayo Hospital,
                    the Municipal Pauper Hospital, and minor dispensaries. Of these the General
                    Hospital is confined almost solely to Europeans. The total amount contributed by
                    Government to these institutions is £30,000. The number of persons treated
                    during the year 1872-73 was 251,039, of whom 20,805 were indoor patients. Of
                    these 64 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9 percent, were men, 16 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 women, and 18 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8
                    children. The rate of mortality in cholera cases was 484 ’ 3 for every thousand
                    treated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mortuary returns</hi> are collected in Calcutta by the police
                    inspectors, and compared with the registers kept by paid clerks of the
                    municipality at the burning <hi rend="italic">gháts</hi> and burial-grounds. In
                    1873 the total number of deaths thus ascertained was 11,557, or 25 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 82 per thousand. The death rate among the Christians
                    was 31 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5, among the Hindus 26’1, and among the
                    Mahometans 24 ’ 7. The highest death rate was in January, November, and
                    December, and the lowest in June and July.</p>
                <p>The mean temperature of Calcutta is about 79° Fahr. The highest temperature
                    recorded during the last 18 years is 106° in the shade, and the lowest 52° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7. The extreme range is therefore a little over 53“,
                    while the mean temperatures of December and May, the coldest and hottest months,
                    are 68° ’ 5 and 85° respectively. The average rainfall during 36 years has been
                    66 inches,—the. highest rainfall on record being 93 ’ 31 inches in 1871, and the
                    lowest 43 ’ 61 inches in 1837. By far the greater part of the rain falls between
                    the months of June and October.</p>
                <p>Like the rest of the seaboard of the Bay of Bengal, Calcutta is exposed to
                    periodical cyclones, which do much mischief. The greatest pressure of the wind
                    registered is 50 lb to the square foot. In the storms of 1864 and 1867 the
                    anemometer was blown away. A great loss of life and property was caused along
                    the Húglí by the storm of October 5th 1864. In Calcutta and its suburbs 49
                    persons were killed, and 16 wounded, 102 brick houses were destroyed, and 563
                    severely damaged; 40,698 tiled and straw huts were levelled with the ground. The
                    destruction of shipping in the port of Calcutta appears greatly to have exceeded
                    that on record in any previous storm. Out of 195 vessels only 23 remained
                    uninjured, and 31, with an aggregate tonnage of 27,653 tons, were totally
                    wrecked. On November 2, 1867, the force of the wind was not less violent, but
                    there was no storm wave, and consequently the amount of damage done was much
                    less.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Port of Calcutta,</hi> extending 10 miles along the
                    Húglí, with an average width of working channel of 250 yards, and with moorings
                    for 169 vessels, is under the management of a body of 9 European gentlemen
                    styled “Commissioners for making Improvements in the Port of Calcutta.” This
                    body was constituted in 1870, and has since that date received considerable
                    additions to its powers. In 1871 they were appointed “Bridge Commissioners,” to
                    take charge of the floating bridge over the Húglí, and to work it when
                    completed. This bridge, finished in 1874, now supplies a permanent connection
                    between Calcutta and the railway terminus on the Howrah side of the river. It is
                    constructed on pontoons, and affords a continuous roadway for foot passengers
                    and vehicles. The traffic returns for 41 weeks in 1875 were £7593; the cost of
                    the bridge has been £220,000. The main duty of the Port Commissioners has
                    hitherto consisted in providing accommodation, by jetties and warehouses, for
                    the shipping and native boats, which carry on the great and increasing trade of
                    Calcutta.</p>
                <p>In the year 1873-74 the income of the commissioners from all sources was
                    £114,709, and the expenditure £78,260. The total amount of capital expended up
                    to that year was £580,339, including a debt of £400,123. The number of vessels
                    arriving and departing in 1861-62 was 1793, with an aggregate tonnage of
                    1,337,632 tons; in 1873-74, the number of vessels was 1927, tonnage 2,437,447.
                    The number of steamers, and especially of steamers passing through the Suez
                    Canal, is greatly on the increase.</p>

                <p>The growth of the commerce of Calcutta may be seen from the following figures:—In
                    1820 21 the total value of the exports and imports, including treasure, was
                    £10,454,910; in 1830-31,£8,756,382; in 1840-41, £15,202,697; in 1850-51,
                    £18,754,025; in 1860-61, £31,794,671; in 1870-71, £49,316,738. The value of the
                    customs duties (including salt) was in 1820-21, £151,817; 1830-31, £121,321;
                    1840-41, £495,515; 1850-51, £1,038,365; 1860-61, £2,270,654; 1870-71,
                    £3,548,926. Cotton goods first became an important article of import in 1824;
                    oil seeds were first exported in 1835; the exports of jute on a large scale date
                    from 1860, those of tea from 1864. Among the chief articles of import in 1870-71
                    were—apparel, value £186,767; beer, £140,859; coal, £109,185; cotton
                    manufactured, £11,624,712; machinery, £194,198; metals, £1,311,547; railway
                    materials, £710,357; salt, £652,632; spices, £150,150; spirits, £162,635; wine,
                    £214,191; wood, £156,903; woollen manufactures, £347,116; treasure, £2,255,244;
                    Government shipments, £981,557; total value of imports, £21,198,478. Among the
                    chief articles of export in 1870-71 were—cotton raw, £2,020,159; cotton
                    manufactured, £811,825; dyeing materials, £153,113; grain and pulse, £2,630,451;
                    hides and skins, £1,573,655; indigo, £2,285,202; jute, £2,585,390; jute

                <p>The internal trade of Calcutta is conducted partly by railway, and partly by
                    water traffic. There is no railway station within the limits of the
                    municipality, but three separate railways have their terminus in the immediate
                    neighbourhood. The East Indian Railway, whose terminus is across the river at
                    Howrah, brings down the produce of the North-Western Provinces and Behar, and
                    connects Calcutta with the general railway system of the Peninsula. The Eastern
                    Bengal Railway and the South-Eastern Railway have their terminus at Siáldah, an
                    eastern suburb of Calcutta. The former is an important line running across the
                    Delta to the junction of the Ganges and Brahmaputra at Goalandá. The latter is a
                    short railway, intended to connect the metropolis with Port Canning, in the
                    Sundarbans. The three chief lines of water traffic are—(1), the Calcutta canals,
                    a chain of channels and rivers passing round and through the Sundarbans, open at
                    all seasons of the year, and affording the main line of communication with the
                    Ganges and the Brahmaputra; (2), the Nadiyá rivers, three in number, which
                    branch off in a more directly southern course from the Ganges, above its
                    junction with the Brahmaputra, and ultimately become the Húglí—these are with
                    difficulty navigable during the dry season; (3), the Midnapur and Hijili canals,
                    leading south towards Orissa. (w. w. H.)</p>
