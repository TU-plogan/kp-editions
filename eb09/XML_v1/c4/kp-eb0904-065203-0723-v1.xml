                    grandson of the preceding, was born in London, April 5, 1671. He was educated at
                    a private academy, and studied at the university of Utrecht. While there, he
                    declined an offer of a professor’s chair in the university of Edinburgh made to
                    him by Principal Carstairs, who had gone over on purpose to find a person
                    properly qualified for such an office. After his return to England in 1691 he
                    began to study divinity; and having joined the Nonconformists, he was in 1692
                    unanimously chosen assistant to Matthew Sylvester at Blackfriars. In 1694 he was
                    ordained at Annesley’s meeting-house in Little St Helen’s, and soon afterwards
                    was invited to become assistant to Daniel Williams in Hand-Alley. In 1702 he was
                    chosen one of the lecturers in Salters’ Hall, and in 1703 he succeeded Vincent
                    Alsop as pastor of a large congregation in Westminster. He drew up the table of
                    contents to <hi rend="italic">Baxter’s History of his Life and Times,</hi> which
                    was sent to the press in 1696; made some remarks on the work itself, and added
                    to it an index; and, reflecting on the usefulness of the book, he saw the
                    expediency of continuing it, as Baxter’s history came no farther than the year
                    1684. Accordingly, he composed an abridgment of it, with an account of many
                    other ministers who were ejected after the restoration of Charles II.; their
                    apology, containing the grounds of their nonconformity and practice as to stated
                    and occasional communion with the Church of England; and a continuation of their
                    history until the year 1691. This work was published in 1702. He afterwards
                    published a moderate defence of nonconformity, in three tracts, in answer to
                    some tracts of Dr Hoadly. In 1709 Calamy made a tour to Scotland, and had the
                    degree of doctor of divinity conferred on him by the universities of Edinburgh,
                    Aberdeen, and Glasgow. In 1713 he published a second edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Abridgment of Baxter's History of his Life and Times,</hi> in
                    which, among various additions, there is a continuation of the history through
                    the reigns of William and Anne, down to the passing of the Occasional Bill. At
                    the end is subjoined the reformed liturgy, which was drawn up and presented to
                    the bishops in 1661. In 1718 he wrote a vindication of his grandfather and
                    several other persons against certain reflections cast upon them by Archdeacon
                    Echard in his History of England; and in 1728 appeared his continuation of the
                    account of the ministers, lecturers, masters, and fellows of colleges, and
                    schoolmasters, who were ejected, after, the Restoration in 1660, by or before
                    the Act of Uniformity. He died June 3, 1732. Besides the pieces already
                    mentioned, he published many occasional sermons.</p>
