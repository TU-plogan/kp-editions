                    (1766—1821), brother of the preceding, was born at Kensington in 1766, and was
                    the son of a builder. At the age of seven he was sent to a neighbouring day
                    school, where he continued for five years, studying chiefly Latin and Greek.
                    During this time he frequently went to Kensington church, in the repairs of
                    which his father was employed, and the impression he received on hearing the
                    organ of that church seems to have roused his love for music. The organist at
                    that time was Henry Whitney, from whom Callcott received his first musical
                    instruction. He did not, however, choose music as a profession, being desirous
                    to become a surgeon, only when on witnessing a surgical operation he found his
                    nervous system seriously affected by the sight, he determined to devote himself
                    to music. His intimacy with Dr Arnold and other leading musicians of the day
                    procured him access to artistic circles; and his successful competition for the
                    prize offered by a musical society called the “Catch Club” soon spread his
                    reputation as composer of glees, catches, canons, and other pieces of concerted
                    vocal music. On these his reputation as a creative musician is mainly founded.
                    In them he displays considerable skill and talent, and some of his glees retain
                    their popularity at the present day. They are well adapted to the voice, and
                    their melodies are pleasing and not without feeling. As an instrumental composer
                    Callcott never succeeded, not even after he had taken lessons from Haydn. But of
                    far greater importance than his compositions are his theoretical writings, and
                    it is chiefly for the sake of the latter that he is noteworthy beyond other
                    English composers of equal merit. His <hi rend="italic">Musical Grammar,</hi>
                    published in 1806 (3d edition, 1817), was long considered as the standard work
                    of musical instruction in this country, and has not been superseded up to the
                    present day by any other book produced by an English musician. It is a scholarly
                    and lucid treatment of the rudiments of the art, but at present, of course,
                    antiquated to a great extent, and, indeed, all but useless to the student of
                    modern music. Callcott was a much esteemed teacher of music for many years. He
                    also held the position of organist at various churches. In 1800 he took his
                    degree of Mus. D. at Oxford, and in 1805 he succeeded Dr Crotch as musical
                    lecturer at the Royal Institution. Towards the end of his life his artistic
                    career was frequently interrupted by ill-health. He died, after much suffering,
                    in 1821. A posthumous collection of his most favourite vocal pieces was
                    published with a memoir of his life by his son-in-law, Mr W. Horsley, himself a
                    composer of note. Numerous other works remain in manuscript.</p>
