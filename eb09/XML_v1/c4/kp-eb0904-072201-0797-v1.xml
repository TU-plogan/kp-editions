                    de</hi></label> (1753-1824), an eminent French statesman under the first
                    republic and the first empire, was born at Montpellier the 18th October 1753, of
                    an old and distinguished family. Being destined for the profession of law, he
                    began his studies in that department at an early age, and was soon recognized as
                    one of the ablest jurists in France. And as his legal learning was one of the
                    main sources of his fame, so it was his chief means of rendering service to his
                    country. Cambacérès was a decided though moderate disciple of the new principles
                    now everywhere diffused in France, and on the assembling of the States-general
                    in 1789 was chosen as a second representative for the nobility of the district
                    of Montpellier. The right of Montpellier to send a second noble deputy was
                    disputed, and Cambacérès did not sit. But he was a member of the National
                    Convention in 1792. Foreseeing the violent courses into which the Convention
                    should be impelled, Cambacérès, from principle as well as necessity, held aloof,
                    and sought to avoid the perils and excesses of the time by confining himself to
                    the neutral province of jurist and legislator. The trial of the king, however,
                    compelled him to declare himself. In the first place, he maintained that the
                    Convention was not competent to try the king; and when the trial had been
                    decided on, he insisted that aÚ latitude of defence ought to be accorded to the
                    royal counsel. As to the sentence, he found the king guilty, and worthy of the
                    punishment due to one who had conspired against his country; but moved for delay
                    in the execution of it, till peace should be restored, or the French soil
                    invaded. This moderation made Cambacérès “suspect” in the eyes of the Mountain,
                    and he confined himself more circumspectly than ever to his proper work of
                    revising and codifying the new laws. On the downfall of Robespierre in 1794, he
                    was a leading man in the restoration of a milder régime. He was sometime
                    president of the Convention, and, subsequently, president of the Committee of
                    Public Safety, in which capacity he helped to the conclusion of peace with
                    Prussia and Spain. Under the Directory he again fell under the suspicion of the
                    extreme party, and was obliged to retire -from the presidency of the Five
                    Hundred, to which he had been called. He took no part in the revolution of the
                    18th Brumaire (9th November 1799), which overturned the Directory and set up the
                    consulate; but Napoleon had such confidence in him that he made him second
                    consul. This confidence Cambacérès continued to enjoy all through the consulate
                    and the empire. On the establishment of the empire he became arch-chancellor,
                    being life-president of the Senate, and the right-hand man of'Napoleon in the
                    civil administration generally. While loyal to his master, his influence was on
                    the whole beneficial to France. He took an important part in the redaction of
                    the Code Napoléon, tried to dissuade Napoleon from the murder of the Due
                    d’Enghien and from the disastrous campaigns of 1812 and 1813, and only gave in
                    his adhesion to the act of abdication of 1814 when resistance was manifestly
                    hopeless, while he resumed office with reluctance during the Hundred Days.</p>
                <p>After the final restoration of Louis XVIII. in 1815, Cambacérès again became an
                    object of persecution, this time as a regicide, and was obliged to retire into
                    Belgium. A royal decree of 1818 restored him to all his civil and political
                    rights, but he did not again emerge from private life. He died in 1824.
                    Cambacérès was a great contrast to most of the leading men in the stormy days of
                    the Revolution. He was moderate in his opinions and in his advocacy of them; he
                    had a clear, penetrating and luminous understanding; and was a great master of
                    sena torial eloquence. He had been created duke of Parma in 1808, and by this
                    name is sometimes known in history.</p>
