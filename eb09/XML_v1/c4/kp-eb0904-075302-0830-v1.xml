                <p><label type="entry">CAMPANILE</label>, the bell tower attached to the churches
                    and town-halls in Italy. Bells are supposed to have teen first used for
                    announcing the sacred offices by Pope Sabinian (604), the immediate successor to
                    St Gregory; and their use by the municipalities came with the rights granted by
                    kings and emperors to the citizens to enclose their towns with fortifications,
                    and assemble at the sound of a great bell. It is to the Lombard architects of
                    the north of Italy that we are indebted for the introduction and development of
                    the campanile, which, when used in connection with a sacred building, is a
                    feature peculiar to Christian architecture,—Christians alone making use of the
                    bell to gather the multitude to public worship. The campanile of Italy serves
                    the same purpose as the tower or steeple of the churches in the north and west
                    of Europe, but differs from it in design and position with regard to the body of
                    the church. In the north and west the tower forms an integral part of the
                    building; it is frequently placed at the west end or at the south or north side
                    of the nave, in which case the ground story forms a porch to the church;
                    sometimes it is at the intersection of the nave and transepts, in which case it
                    rises as a grand central feature round which everything else groups, as seen at
                    Salisbury, Lincoln, Norwich, Ac. In Italy the campanile is almost always
                    detached from the church, or at most connected with it by an arcaded passage. In
                    Italy there are (with one or two exceptions, such as San Ambrosio, Milan, and at
                    Novara) never more than one campanile to a church, whereas in the north and west
                    the number varies from one to seven.</p>
                <p>The design of the campanile differs entirely from its northern type. It never has
                    buttresses, is very tall and thin in proportion to its height, and is square on
                    plan, occasionally round, as at Ravenna and Pisa, and in one or two cases, as at
                    San Gottardo, Milan, octagonal. The campanile generally rises from base to
                    summit without break; the faces are divided vertically by flat pilasters, and
                    horizontally by string-courses, arcades, or windows. As a rule the openings
                    increase in number with the height of the stage. Many, perhaps the finest
                    examples, have openings at the top only.</p>
                <p>The chief architectural defect of the square campanile is the covering. This is
                    generally a short conical roof, either square, circular, or octagonal on plan;
                    but its junction with the tower was never successfully managed. The campanili in
                    the north of Italy and in Rome are nearly all built of brick. In Tuscany, as at
                    Pisa and Siena, and further south, as at Viterbo, they are veneered with marble
                    of various colours. ’</p>
                <p>The tallest campanile is the one at Cremona; it rises to a height of 393 feet.
                    Probably the grandest and richest is that designed by Giotto in 1334 for the
                    cathedral at Florence. It measures 275 feet high and 45 feet square; it is
                    entirely veneered with black, red, and white marble, and is divided into five
                    stages, the upper three only having windows. Giotto intended to have finished it
                    with a spire 90 feet high, but Taddio Gaddi, who succeeded Giotto as architect,
                    thinking that the tower would not be improved by it, left it as it now exists.
                    Some of the best examples of church campanili are to be found in Venice, Verona,
                    Modena, Cremona, Parma, and Pisa.</p>
                <p>The campanili belonging to the municipalities have generally a distinct character
                    from those attached to sacred edifices; they have a smaller section on plan in
                    proportion to the height. They want the conical roof, and are generally
                    battlemented; some have an upper and smaller stage, wherein the bells are hung,
                    as at Florence, Siena, Volterra, and Montepulciano. Their faces are rarely
                    divided by pilasters; there are few windows, generally small openings only to
                    light the staircase; and they are more frequently incorporated with the body of
                    the building than the church campanüi, often rising from the wall heads and not
                    from the ground to great heights. The most remarkable campanili are those at
                    Venice, Florence, Pisa, and Siena. The campanile of St Mark’s at Venice stands
                    in the great square in front of the cathedral. Its erection was commenced about
                    the beginning of the 10th, and completed up to the belfry about the middle of
                    the 12th century. The belfry was erected and finished by Bartolomeo Buono in
                    1517. From the level of the piazza to the belfry stage, it is constructed of
                    brick; the belfry and surmounting pyramid are of marble. The total height is 323
                    feet, and it is 42 feet square at the base. The gallery at top is reached by an
                    inclined plane, and there are no windows other than small openings lighting the
                    ascent.</p>
                <p>The leaning tower or campanile of Pisa, built by the citizens to rival that of
                    Venice, was erected by Bonanno, and begun in the year 1174. It is circular on
                    plan, and about 51 feet in diameter and 172 feet high. Not including the belfry
                    it is divided vertically into seven stages, all of which, with the exception of
                    the lowest, are decorated with an open arcade. The conical covering of the
                    belfry was never constructed. This tower overhangs its base upwards of 13 feet,
                    and for Jong it was supposed to have been built so. It is founded on wooden
                    piles driven into boggy ground. When the tower had been carried up about 35 feet
                    it began to settle to one side. That no such settlement was ever anticipated may
                    be asserted from the fact that a gurgoyle or water-spout to throw off the water
                    from the first arcade, may be observed on what is now the highest side. As the
                    work was carried on, the levels were altered so as to keep the centre of gravity
                    within the base. This tower was finished by an architect called William of
                    Innspruck. The outside is entirely constructed <pb break="no"

                    Verruca. There are many campanili, notably the Garisendi and Asihelli towers at
                    Bologna, that incline to one side,—all from the same cause as at Pisa.</p>
                <p>The campanili of Florence and Siena are somewhat similar in design. The one at
                    Florence is built of stone, and is about 20 feet square and about 300 feet high.
                    That at Siena is built entirely of brick, and measures about 21 feet square and
                    282 feet high. Both are battlemented and have a smaller upper stage for the
                    belfry. Several other important examples exist at Volterra, Montepulciano,
                    Figline, Oppi, &amp;c., &amp;c. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. an.)</hi></p>
