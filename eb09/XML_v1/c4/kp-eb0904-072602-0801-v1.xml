                    town of France, in the department of Nord situated on the right bank of the
                    Scheldt, 32 miles S. of Lille, in 50° 10' N. lat. and 3° <hi rend="italic"
                    >14'</hi> E. long. It is well built, contains a large number of ancient gabled
                    houses, and is surrounded by strong walls flanked with round towers. The
                    principal building is the Cathedral of St Sepulchre, occupying the site of an
                    earlier structure, which was greatly damaged during the French Revolution, and
                    suffered still more severely from a conflagration in 1859. It still contains a
                    monument by David to the memory of Fénelon, but the tomb in which the archbishop
                    was buried was broken open in 1793, and his coffin melted into bullets. Of the
                    old archiépiscopal palace the only thing left is a Renaissance portal; and the
                    archbishop now has his residence in what was formerly the convent of the
                    Benedictines. Besides these may be mentioned the church of St Gery, and the
                    belfry of St Martin; the town-house, dating from 1873; the citadel; and the
                    public library, containing upwards of 35,000 volumes, in what was formerly the
                    church of the hospital of St John. Cambray is the chief town of an
                    arrondissement, and has judicial and commercial tribunals of the first instance.
                    A college, two theological seminaries, a medical school, and a school of design
                    are its chief educational establishments; it has also various learned societies.
                    The town has long been famous for its manufacture of fine muslin, to which it
                    gave the name Cambric; and it also contains manufactories of cotton cloth, lace,
                    and thread, as well as sugar-factories, oil refineries, distilleries, breweries,
                    and other industrial establishments. Its trade consists of grain, wine, hemp,
                    hops, cattle, butter, and coal. The Scheldt begins to be navigable at the town,
                    and communicates with St Quentin by means of a canal. Population in 1872,
                    22,897.</p>
                <p>Cambray is the ancient Nervian town of <hi rend="italic">Camaracwm,</hi> which is
                    first mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary. In the 5th century it was the capital
                    of the Frankish king Ragnachar. Fortified by Charlemagne, it was captured and
                    pillaged by the Normans in 870, and unsuccessfully besieged by the Hungarians in
                    953. During the 1 Oth, 11 th, and 12th centuries it was the scene of frequent
                    hostilities between the bishop and his supporters on the one hand and the
                    citizens on the other; but the latter ultimately effected their independence. In
                    1478 Louis XL, who had obtained possession of the town on the death of the last
                    duke of Burgundy, handed it over to the emperor, and in the 16th century Charles
                    the Fifth caused it to be fortified with a strong citadel, for the erection of
                    which the castles of Cavillers, Escaudoeuvres, and many others were demolished.
                    From that date to the peace of Nimeguen, which assigned it to France, it
                    frequently passed from hand to hand by capture or treaty. In 1793 it was
                    besieged in vain by the Austrians. The League of Cambray is the name given to
                    the alliance of Pope Julius IL, Louis XII., Maximilian I., and Ferdinand the
                    Catholic against the Venetians in 1508; and the Peace of Cambray, or as it is
                    also called, the Ladies’ Peace, was concluded in the town by Louise of Savoy,
                    mother of Francis I., and Margaret of Austria, aunt of Charles V., in name of
                    these monarchs. The bishopric of Cambray dates from the 5th century, and it was
                    erected in 1559 into an archbishopric, which continued till the Revolution, and
                    has since been restored. The bishops received the title of count from the
                    Emperor Henry I., and in 1510 were raised to the dignity of dukes, their
                    territory including, besides the town itself, the district called Cambresis.</p>
