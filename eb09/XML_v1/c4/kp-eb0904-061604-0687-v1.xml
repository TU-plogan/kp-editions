                    (1757-1808), a distinguished French physiologist, was born at Cosnac in 1757.
                    His father was a lawyer of eminence, and chief magistrate of a district in the
                    Lower Limousin. His education was at first entrusted to the priests, but at the
                    age of ten he was transferred to the College of Brives. He showed great aptitude
                    for study, but his independence of spirit was so excessive that he was almost
                    constantly in a state of rebellion against his teachers, and was finally
                    dismissed from the school. After a year’s residence at home he was taken to
                    Paris by his father and left to carry on his studies at his own discretion. He
                    attended classes at the university, and read with particular delight Locke’s
                    essay <hi rend="italic">On the Human Understanding.</hi> Two years had been
                    spent in close and assiduous study, when in 1773 he received the offer of the
                    post of secretary to the princebishop of Wilna. He accepted it and passed two
                    years at Warsaw, viewing with disgust and contempt the petty intrigues and
                    jealousies that accompanied the first partition of Poland.</p>
                <p>On his return to Paris he devoted himself mainly to poetry, for which he had
                    always a strong inclination. He was intimate with the poet Roucher, and was
                    introduced by Turgot to the society of Mme. Helvetius, where he met such men as
                    Diderot, D’Alembert, D’Holbach, Condillac, Franklin, and Jefferson. About this
                    time he ventured to send in to the Academy a translation of the passage from
                    Homer proposed for their prize, and though his attempt passed without notice, he
                    received so much encouragement from his friends that he contemplated translating
                    the whole of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi></p>
                <p>At the earnest desire of his father he relinquished these pleasant literary
                    employments, and resolved to engage in some settled profession. After
                    deliberation he fixed upon that of medicine, and began his studies under
                    Dubreuil. In 1789 his <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur
                    les Hôpitaux</hi> procured him an appointment as administrator of hospitals in
                    Paris. From inclination and from weak health he never engaged much in practice
                    as a physician. His interest lay entirely in the deeper problems of medical and
                    physiological science, and these he investigated with unusual closeness and
                    minuteness. Nor had he quite given up his fondness for literary society; his
                    residence at Auteuil on the outskirts of the capital enabled him still to
                    continue his intercourse with Diderot, Condillac, and others. He had even the
                    pleasure of reading to Voltaire part of his translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> and of receiving warm commendation from the veteran critic. But he
                    had long ceased to occupy himself with that work; and in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Serment</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">un</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Médecin,</hi> which appeared in 1789, he bade a formal adieu to
                    poetry.</p>
                <p>In the great political struggle of the time Cabanis espoused with enthusiasm the
                    cause of the Revolution, to which he was attached from principle, and of which
                    the opening prospects were congenial to his active and ardent mind. During the
                    two last years of Mirabeau’s life he was intimately connected with that
                    extraordinary man, who had the singular art of pressing into his service the
                    pens of all his literary friends. Cabanis united himself with this disinterested
                    association of labourers, and contributed the <hi rend="italic">Travail</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">VEducation</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Publique</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> a tract which was found among
                    the papers of Mirabeau at his death, and was edited by the real author soon
                    afterwards in 1791. During the illness which terminated his life, Mirabeau
                    confided himself entirely to the professional skill of Cabanis. Of the progress
                    of the malady, and the circumstances attending the death of Mirabeau, Cabanis
                    drew up a very detailed narrative, which is not calculated, however, to impress
                    us with any high idea of his skill in the treatment of an acute inflammatory
                    disease. Condorcet was another distinguished character with whom Cabanis was
                    intimate, and whom he endeavoured, though without success, to save from the
                    destiny in which he afterwards became involved by the calamitous events of the
                    Revolution. Shortly after this he married Charlotte Grouchy, sister to Madame
                    Condorcet and to General Grouchy,—a union which was a great source of happiness
                    to him during the remainder of his life.</p>

                <p>After the subversion of the Government of the terrorists, Cabanis, on the
                    establishment of central schools, was named professor of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hygiène</hi> in the medical schools of the metropolis. Next year he was chosen
                    member of the National Institute, and was subsequently appoint≡d clinical
                    professor. He was afterwards member of the Council of Five Hundred, and then of
                    the Conservative Senate. The dissolution of the Directory was the result of a
                    motion which he made to that effect. But his political career was not of long
                    continuance. A foe to tyranny in every shape, he was decidedly hostile to the
                    policy of Bonaparte, and constantly rejected every solicitation to accept a
                    place under his Government.</p>
                <p>For some years before his death his health became gradually more impaired, and he
                    retired from the laborious duties of his profession, spending the greatest part
                    of his time at the chateau of his father-in4aw at Meulan. Here he solaced
                    himself with reading his favourite poets, and even had it in contemplation to
                    resume that translation of the <hi rend="italic">Ilιacl</hi> which had been the
                    first effort of his youthful muse. The rest of his time was devoted to acts of
                    kindness and beneficence, especially towards the poor, who flocked from all
                    parts to consult him on their complaints. Cabanis died May 5 1808, leaving a
                    widow and a daughter.</p>
                <p>A complete edition of Cabanis’s works was begun in 1825, and five volumes were
                    published. One of his minor works, <hi rend="italic">Coup</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d'oeil sur les révolutions et les réformes de la médecin,</hi> has been
                    translated into English. His principal work, <hi rend="italic">Rapports</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du physique et</hi><hi rend="italic">du moral</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de l’homme,</hi> consists in part of memoirs, read in 1796 and
                    1797 to the Institute, and printed among their Transactions. It is an admirable
                    sketch of physiological psychology, and is replete with information. Psychology
                    is with Cabanis directly linked on to biology, for sensibility, the fundamental
                    fact, is the highest grade of life and the lowest of intelligence. All the
                    intellectual processes are evolved from sensibility, and sensibility itself is a
                    property of the nervoqs system. The soul is not an entity, but a faculty;
                    thought is the function of the brain. Just as the stomach and intestines receive
                    food and digest it, so the brain receives impressions, digests them, and has as
                    its organic secretion, thought. Alongside of this harsh mιterialism Cabanis held
                    another principle, the application of which altogether changes his theory. He
                    belonged in biology to the school of Stahl, the vitalist or animist, and in the
                    posthumous work, <hi rend="italic">Lettre sur les</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >causes</hi><hi rend="italic">premières,</hi> the consequences ot this opinion
                    became clear. Life is something added to the organism; over and above the
                    universally diffused sensibility there is some living and productive power to
                    which we give the name of Nature. But it is impossible to avoid ascribing to
                    this power both intelligence and will. In us this living power constitutes the
                    ego, which is truly immaterial and immortal. These results Cabanis did not think
                    out of harmony with his earlier theory, and it is possible that a point of view
                    may be attained whence both appear justified. The <hi rend="italic">Lettre</hi>
                    was not published till 1824, when it appeared with notes by F, Berard.</p>
