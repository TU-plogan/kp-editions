                <p><label type="entry">CACTUS</label>. This word, applied in the form of <hi
                    rend="italic">κάκτος</hi> by the ancient Greeks to some prickly plant, was
                    adopted by Linnaeus as the family title of a group of curious succulent or
                    fleshy-stemmed plants, most of them prickly and leafless, some of which produce
                    beautiful flowers, and are now so popular in our gardens that the name has
                    become familiar. As applied by Linnaeus, the name <hi rend="italic">Cactus</hi>
                    is almost conterminous with what is now regarded as the natural order <hi
                    rend="italic">Cactaceoe,</hi> which embraces several modern genera. It is one of
                    the few Linnaean generic terms which have been entirely set aside by the names
                    adopted for the modern divisions of the group.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cacti</hi> may be described in general terms as plants
                    having a woody axis, overlaid with thick masses of cellular tissue forming the
                    fleshy stems. These are extremely various in character and form, being globose,
                    cylindrical, columnar, or flattened into leafy expansions or thick joint-like
                    divisions, the surface being either ribbed like a melon, or developed into
                    nipple-like protuberances, or variously angular, but in the greater number of
                    the species furnished copiously with tufts of horny spines, some of which are
                    exceedingly keen and powerful. These tufts show the position of buds, of which,
                    however, comparatively few are developed. The stems are in most cases leafless,
                    using the term in a popular sense; the leaves, if present at all, being
                    generally reduced to minute scales. In one genus, however, that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pereskia,</hi> the stems are less succulent, and the leaves,
                    though rather fleshy, are developed in the usual form. The flowers are
                    frequently large and showy, and are generally attractive from their high
                    colouring. In one group, represented by <hi rend="italic">Cercus,</hi> they
                    consist of a tube, more or less elongated, on the outer surface of which,
                    towards the base, are developed small and at first inconspicuous scales, which
                    gradually increase in size upwards, and at length become crowded, numerous, and
                    petaloid, forming a funnel-shaped blossom, the beauty of which is much enhanced
                    by the multitude of conspicuous stamens which with the pistil occupy the centre.
                    In another group, represented by <hi rend="italic">Opuntia,</hi> the flowers are
                    rotate, that is to say, the long tube is replaced by a very short one. At the
                    base of the tube, in both groups, the ovary becomes developed into a fleshy
                    (often edible) fruit, that produced by the <hi rend="italic">Opuntia</hi> being
                    known as the prickly pear or Indian fig-</p>
                <p>The principal modern genera are ranged under two subdivisions, which are
                    separated by the differences in the flower-tube just explained. Those with

                    <hi rend="italic">Cacteoe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cactaceoe,</hi> belong
                    almost entirely, if not exclusively, to the New World; but some of the Opuntias
                    have been so long distributed over certain parts of Europe, especially on the
                    shores of the Mediterranean and the volcanic soil of Italy, that they appear in
                    some places to have taken possession of the soil, and to be distinguished with
                    difficulty from the aboriginal vegetation. The habitats which they affect are
                    the hot dry regions of tropical America, the aridity of which they are enabled
                    to withstand in consequence of the thickness of their skin, and the paucity of
                    evaporating pores or stomates with which they are furnished,—these conditions
                    not permitting the moisture they contain to be carried off too rapidly.
                    Occurring thus as they do in situations where ordinary vegetation could not
                    exist, they may be considered as one of the means which nature has provided for
                    the support of man and animals where other means of subsistence fail. The stems
                    are filled with wholesome though insipid fluid, and the succulent fruit are not
                    only edible but agreeable. In fevers the fruits are freely administered as a
                    cooling drink, and when bruised are regarded as a valuable remedy for the cure
                    of ulcers. The Spanish Americans plant the Opuntias around their houses, where
                    they serve as impenetrable fences.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Melocactus,</hi> the family of Melon-thistle or Turk’s-cap
                    Cactuses, contains, according to Labouret, a monographer of the order, about
                    thirty species, which inhabit chiefly the West Indies, Mexico, and Brazil, a few
                    extending into New Granada. The typical species, <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    communis,</hi> forms a succulent mass of roundish or ovate form, from 1 foot to
                    2 feet high, the surface divided into numerous furrows like the ribs of a melon,
                    with projecting angles, which are set with a regular series of stellated
                    spines,—each bundle consisting of about five larger spines, accompanied by
                    smaller but sharp aculei or bristles,—and the tip of the plant being surmounted
                    by a cylindrical crown called a cephalium, 3 to 5 inches high, composed of
                    reddish-brown acicular bristles, closely packed with cottony tomentum. At the
                    summit of this crown the small rosy-pink flowers are produced, half protruding
                    from the mass of wool, and these are succeeded by small red beιries. These
                    strange plants usually grow in rocky places with little or no earth to support
                    them; and it is said that in times of drought the cattle resort to them to allay
                    their thirst, first ripping them up with their horns and tearing off the outer
                    skin, and then devouring the moist succulent parts. The fruit, which has an
                    agreeably acid flavour, is frequently eaten in the West Indies. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Μelocαcti</hi> are distinguished by the distinct cephalium or

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mammillaria.</hi> —This group, which comprises nearly 300
                    species, mostly Mexican, with a few Brazilian and West Indian, is called Nipple
                    Cactus, and consists of globular or cylindrical succulent plants, whose surface
                    instead of being cut up into ridges with alternate furrows, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Melocactus,</hi> is broken up into teat-like cylindrical or
                    angular tubercles, spirally arranged, and terminating in a radiating tuft of
                    spines which spring from a little woolly cushion. The flowers issue from between
                    the mammillae, towards the upper part of the stem, often disposed in a zone just
                    below the apex, and are either purple, rose-pink, white, or yellow, and of
                    moderate size. The spines are variously coloured, white and yellow tints
                    predominating, and from the symmetrical arrangement of the areolae or tufts of
                    spines they are very pretty objects, and are hence frequently kept in
                    drawing-room plant cases.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Echinocactus</hi> is the name given to the group bearing the
                    popular name of Hedgehog Cactus. It comprises some 200 species, of which more
                    than half are natives of Mexico, and the rest are scattered through South
                    America, extending as far south as Buenos Ayres. They have the fleshy stems
                    characteristic of the order, these being either globose, oblong, or cylindrical,
                    and either ribbed as in <hi rend="italic">Melocactus,</hi> or broken up into
                    distinct tubercles, and most of them armed with stiff sharp spines, set in
                    little woolly cushions occupying the place of the buds. The flowers, produced
                    near the apex of the plant, are generally large and showy, yellow and rose being
                    the prevailing colours. They are succeeded by succulent fruits, which are
                    exserted, and frequently scaly or spiny, in which respects this genus differs
                    both from <hi rend="italic">Melocactus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammillaria,</hi> which have the fruits immersed and smooth. One of the most
                    interesting species is the <hi rend="italic">E. Visnaga,</hi> of which some very
                    large plants have been from time to time imported. A specimen weighing one ton,
                    and measuring 9 feet high, and 3 feet in diameter, was received at Kew some
                    years since, but owing to injuries received during transit, it did not long
                    survive. These large plants have from forty to fifty ridges, on which the buds
                    and clusters of spines are sunk at intervals, the aggregate number of the spines
                    having been in some cases computed at upwards of 50,000 on a single plant. These
                    spines are used by the Mexicans as toothpicks, whence the name Visnaga.</p>

                    but in the greater number of species the stems are columnar or elongated, some
                    of the latter creeping on the ground or climbing up the trunks of trees, rooting
                    as they grow. One of the former group, <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pectinatus,</hi> produces a purplish fruit resembling a
                    gooseberry, which is very good eating; and the fleshy part of the stem itself,
                    which is called Cabeza del Viego by the Mexicans, is eaten by them as a
                    vegetable after removing the spines. To the latter group belongs <hi
                    rend="italic">C. giganteus,</hi> the largest and most striking species of the
                    genus, a native of hot arid desert regions of New Mexico, growing there in rocky
                    valleys and on mountain sides, where the tall stems with their erect branches
                    have the appearance of telegraph poles. The stems grow to a height of from 50
                    feet to 60 feet, and have a diameter of from 1 foot to 2 feet, often unbranched,
                    but sometimes furnished with branches which grow out at right angles from the
                    main stem, and then curve upwards and continue their growth parallel to it;
                    these stems have from twelve to twenty ribs, on which at intervals of about an
                    inch are the buds with their thick yellow cushions, from which issue five or six
                    large and numerous smaller spines. The fruits of this plant, which are green
                    oval bodies from 2 to 3 inches long, contain a crimson pulp from which the Pimos
                    and Papagos Indians prepare an exce∏ent preserve; and they also use the ripe
                    fruit as an article of food, gathering it by means of a forked stick attached to
                    a long pole. The Cereuses include some of our most interesting and beautiful
                    hothouse plants.</p>

                    with tallish erect fleshy angulate stems, on which, with the tufts of spines,
                    are developed hair-like bodies, which, though rather coarse, bear some
                    resemblance to the hoary locks of an aged man. The plants are nearly allied to
                    <hi rend="italic">Ccreus,</hi> differing chiefly in the floriferous portion
                    developing these longer and more attenuated hair-like spines, which surround the
                    base of the flowers, and form a dense woolly head or cephalium. The most
                    familiar species is <hi rend="italic">P. senilis,</hi> a Mexican plant, which
                    though seldom seen more than a foot or two in height in greenhouses, reaches
                    from 20 feet to 30 feet in its native country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Echinopsis</hi> is another small group of species, separated
                    by some authors from <hi rend="italic">Cercus.</hi> They are dwarf, ribbed,
                    globose, or cylindrical plants; and the flowers, which are produced from the
                    side instead of the apex of the stem, are large, and in some cases very
                    beautiful, being remarkable for the length of the tube, which is more or less
                    covered with bristly hairs. There are about thirty species known, their
                    geographical range extending from Mexico and Texas to Brazil, Bolivia, and
                    Chili.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Phyllocactus,</hi> the Leaf Cactus family, consists of about
                    a dozen species, found in Mexico and Brazil. They differ from all the forms
                    already noticed in being shrubby and epiphytal in habit, and in having the
                    branches compressed and dilated so as to resemble thick fleshy leaves, with a
                    strong median axis, and terete woody base. The margins of these leaf-like
                    branches are more or less crenately notched, the notches representing buds, as
                    do the spine-clusters in the spiny genera; and from these crenatures the large
                    showy flowers are produced. As garden plants the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phyllocacti</hi> are amongst the most ornamental of the whole family, being of
                    easy culture, free blooming, and remarkably showy, the colour of the flowers
                    ranging from rich crimson, through rose-pink, to creamy white. They are often
                    called <hi rend="italic">Epiphyllum,</hi> which name is, however, properly
                    restricted to the group next to be mentioned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Epiphyllum.</hi> —This name is now restricted to two or
                    three dwarf branching Brazilian epiphytal plants of extreme beauty, which agree
                    with <hi rend="italic">Phyllocactus</hi> in having the branches dilated into the
                    form of fleshy leaves, but differ in haying them divided into short truncate
                    leaf-like portions, which are articulated, that is to say, provided with a joint
                    by which they separate spontaneously; the margins are crenate or dentate, and
                    the flowers, which are large and showy, magenta or crimson, appear at the apex
                    of the terminal joints. In <hi rend="italic">E. truncatum</hi> the flowers have
                    a very different aspect from that of other <hi rend="italic">Cacteoe,</hi> from
                    the mouth of the tube being oblique and the segments all reflexed at the tip.
                    The short separate pieces of which these plants are made up grow out of each
                    other, so that the branches may be said to resemble leaves joined together
                    endwise.</p>

                    having a broad scar at the top, furnished on ,theιr soft fleshy rind with tufts

                    remaining generic type; and this differs from the rest in having woody stems and
                    leaf-bearing branches, the leaves being somewhat fleshy, but otherwise of the
                    ordinary laminate character. The flowers are subpaniculate, white or yellowish.

                <p>C ADAH ALSO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jose de</hi> (1741-1782), a Spanish poet and
                    writer, was born at Cadiz in 1741. He was educated at Paris, and before
                    completing his twentieth year had travelled through Italy, Germany, England, and
                    Portugal, and had studied with care the languages and literatures of these
                    countries. On his return to Spain he entered the army, and rose to the rank of
                    colonel. He was killed at the siege of Gibraltar, 27th February 1782. His first
                    published work was a tragedy after the French model, <hi rend="italic">Don
                    Sancho Garcia,</hi> printed in 1771. In the following year he published his <hi

                    >Violeta</hi> (Fashionable Learning), a satire on superficial knowledge, which
                    was very successful. In 1773 appeared a volume of miscellaneous poems, and after
                    his death there was found among his MSS. a series of fictitious letters,
                    somewhat after the style of the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Persanes,</hi> or the
                    <hi rend="italic">Citizen of the World,</hi> which were published as <hi
                    rend="italic">Moorish Letters,</hi> and have been frequently reprinted. The
                    complete edition of his works, with life by Navarrete, appeared at Madrid, in 3
                    vols., 1818.</p>
