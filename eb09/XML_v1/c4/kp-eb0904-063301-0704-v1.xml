                    (1519-1603), one of the most distinguished of the Italian natural philosophers
                    of the Renaissance, was born at Arezzo in Tuscany in 1519. Of his family nothing
                    is recorded, nor does he appear to have left any progeny, or to have been
                    married.</p>
                <p>We have no account of his life till we find him seated in the botanical chair of
                    the university of Pisa, where also he studied, if he did not teach, anatomy and
                    medicine. His first publication was entitled <hi rend="italic">Speculum Artis
                    Medixoe JIippocraticum,</hi> in which it were too much to expect he should have
                    released himself from the shackles of his venerable guide; but he has left
                    evident proofs, in a passage often quoted, of his having a clear idea of the
                    circulation of the blood, at least through the lungs. In botany his inquiries
                    were conducted on a more original plan, and their result was one of the most
                    philosophical works in that science, issued from the press at Florence in 1583,
                    in one volume quarto. The title-page is sufficiently arrogant in tone,— <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantis libri</hi><hi rend="italic">XVI.
                    Andreoe Coesalpini Aretini, Medici</hi><hi rend="italic">clarissimi</hi><hi

                    ac subtilissimi;</hi> yet Caesalpinus appears to have been the editor, and
                    prefixed, in his own name, an elegant and learned epistle dedicatory to Francis
                    de’ Medici, grand duke of Tuscany. This book, now rarely to be met with, is not
                    only the unacknowledged source from which various subsequent writers, and
                    especially Morison, derived their ideas of botanical arrangement, but it was a
                    mine of science to which Linnaeus himself gratefully avowed his obligations.
                    Linnaeus’s copy of the book evinces the great assiduity with which he studied
                    it; he has laboured throughout to remedy the defect of which Haller complains of
                    the want of synonyms, has subjoined his own generic names to nearly every
                    species, and has particularly indicated those remarkable passages, at pages 13
                    and 15, where the germination of plants and their sexual distinctions are
                    explained. In the former we trace the first rudiments of a natural
                    classification of plants by the differences in their cotyledons, or, in other
                    words, we find the origin of the natural systems of Linnaeus and Jussieu; in the
                    latter passage we detect the fundamental principle of the Linnean artificial
                    system. Nor were these merely incidental suggestions of the author. He pursued
                    his inquiries to a conclusion on which the existence of botany as a science
                    depends, and which the no less eminent Conrad Gesner detected about the same
                    time, though his ideas respecting it were not then made public. The principle to
                    which we allude is the classification of plants by their parts of fructification
                    alone. This was afterwards extended, by the greatest writers on the subject, as
                    Ray and Tournefort, and more completely by Linnaeus, to the discrimination of
                    their genera by the same parts, more particularly considered and contrasted. To
                    this more extensive conclusion, indeed, the principle directly and inevitably
                    leads. Caesalpinus used it himself with such success as to develop some of the
                    most important characters for generic distinctions, such as the flower being
                    superior or inferior with respect to the fruit; the heart of the seed situated
                    at its summit or base; the seeds, or the cells of the seedvessels, solitary or
                    otherwise; the partitions of certain pericarps parallel or contrary to their
                    valγes. Linnaeus remarks that Caesalpinus, though the first systematical
                    botanist, found out as many natural classes, or orders, as his followers. He did
                    not indeed define well the philosophical limits of genera in the vegetable
                    kingdom, and therefore his work cannot be regularly quoted throughout for
                    generic synonyms. The want of plates of his own, and of references to other
                    authors, renders, as we have already hinted, some of his names and descriptions
                    unintelligible. Yet Linnaeus has iu manuscript filled up many blanks which he
                    had been obliged to leave in his own <hi rend="italic">Classes Plantarum,</hi>
                    where the system of Caesalpinus first assumed a synoptical form. The latter
                    might probably have adopted a more clear and methodical mode of arranging and
                    explaining the botanical part of his subject, had he not had in view the vague
                    and desultory manner of Pliny, whom he closely imitates in the materials of his
                    numerous chapters, as well as in his style of description. A small and
                    unimportant <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> to this work, of nineteen pages,
                    appeared at Rome in 1603, which is of very rare occurrence, but may be found
                    reprinted in Boccone’s <hi rend="italic">Museo</hi><hi rend="italic">di</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Piante</hi><hi rend="italic">Jiare,</hi> p. 125. The <hi
                    rend="italic">herbarium</hi> of over 760 plants which he left is said to be
                    still preserved at Florence.</p>
                <p>Caesalpinus having been settled at Pisa when the great Galileo first presumed to
                    doubt the infallibility of the Aristotelian philosophy, and, most likely, at the
                    time when that rising philosopher became professor of mathematics in the same
                    university, we can hardly imagine him to have been free from the party-spirit
                    which so disgracefully manifested itself there. He seems to have retained his
                    professorship till 1592, when he removed to Rome in attendance on Pope Clement
                    VIII. He died in 1603 at the age of eighty-four.</p>
                <p>Caesalpinus printed at Borne, in 1596, a quarto volume of above two hundred
                    pages, entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Metallicis,</hi>
                    dedicated to Pope Clement VIII. which, like his botanical publications, is now
                    extremely rare. In the philosophy of this work Aristotle is his guide; in its
                    method and composition, Pliny. A prefatory address to the pope declares it to
                    have been undertaken in opposition to a certain treatise on the same subject,
                    which, though written with diligence and elegance, contained many things
                    inconsistent with the principles of philosophy, and subversive of the
                    Peripatetic doctrines, ana with the author of which, as being excommunicated by
                    the holy church of Rome, no measures were to be kept.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Quaestionum Peripateticarum libri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quinque,</hi> published at Rome in 1603, diverge considerably from the pure
                    doctrine of Aristotle, and by the emphasis laid on the universal and common
                    intelligence inherent in matter, approximate rather to the pantheism of the
                    Stoics.</p>
