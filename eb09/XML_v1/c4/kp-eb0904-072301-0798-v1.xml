                <p><label type="entry">CAMBAY, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Kambay</hi></label>, a town
                    of Western India, in Guzerat, or the northern division of the province of
                    Bombay, and forming the capital of the native state of the same name, which has
                    an area of about 350 square miles, and a population of about 175,000. It is
                    situated on the River Mahi, at the upper part of the Gulf of Cambay, 230 miles
                    N. of Bombay, in 22° 18' N. lat. and 72° 39' E. long. It is supposed to be the
                    <hi rend="italic">Camanes</hi> of Ptolemy, and was formerly a very flourishing
                    city, the seat of an extensive trade, and celebrated for its manufactures of
                    silk, chintz, and gold stuffs; but owing principally to the gradually increasing
                    difficulty of access by water, its commerce has long since fallen away, and the
                    town has become poor and dilapidated. The tides rise upwards of 30 feet, and at
                    high water ships anchor near the town. The trade is chiefly confined to the
                    export of cotton. The town is celebrated for its agates and carnelians, which
                    are wrought into a variety of trinkets of reputation principally in China. The
                    houses in many instances are built of stone (a circumstance which indicates the
                    former wealth of the city, as the material had to be brought from a very
                    considerable distance); and a brick wall, three miles in circumference,
                    surrounds the town, enclosing four large reservoirs of good water and three
                    bazaars. To the south-east there are very extensive ruins of subterranean
                    temples and other buildings half-buried in the sand by which the ancient town
                    was overwhelmed. These temples belong to the Jains, and contain two massive
                    statues of their deities, the one black, the other white. The principal one, as
                    the inscription intimates, is Pariswanath, or Parswanatha, carved in the reign
                    of the Emperor Akbar; the black one has the date of 1651 inscribed. It is
                    supposed that Cambay about the 5 th century was the capital of the Hindu
                    emperors of Western India. In 1780 it was taken possession of by the army of
                    General Goddard, was restored to the Mahrattas in 1783, and was afterwards ceded
                    to the British by the Peishwa under the treaty of 1803. The nawab, who is one of
                    the 153 feudatory princes of British India by <hi rend="italic">Sunηud</hi> or
                    patent, pays £5876 of annual tribute to the viceroy of India from his revenue of
                    £35,000. His military establishment consists of 800 horse and foot, who are
                    employed indiscriminately in revenue, police, and miscellaneous duties; and a
                    few pieces of ordnance complete his resources.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Gulf of Cambay,</hi> which is shallow and abounds in
                    shoals and sand-banks, penetrates the coast of India for about 80 miles. It is
                    supposed that the depth of water in this gulf has been decreasing for more than
                    two cen turies past. The tides, which are very high, run into it with amazing
                    velocity, but at low water the bottom is left nearly dry for some distance below
                    the latitude of the town of Cambay. It is, however, an important inlet, being
                    the channel by which the valuable produce of central Guzerat and the British
                    districts of Ahmedabad and Broach is exported; but the railway from Bombay to
                    Baroda and Ahmedabad, near Cambay, is gradually attracting the trade to itself.
                    The gulf extends between 21° and 22° 10' N. lat., and 71° 50' and 72° 40' E.
                    long.</p>
