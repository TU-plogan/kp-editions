                    hoofs completely enveloping the toes, and in the separation of the navicular and
                    cuboid bones of the tarsus, show an affinity with certain of the Perissodactyle

                    ruminants, the camel has two upper incisor teeth, conical and laterally
                    compressed, and somewhat resembling canine teeth, of which in the upper jaw
                    there are two, in addition to twelve molars. Beneath there are six incisors, two
                    canines, and ten molar teeth, the whole forming a dentition admirably suited for
                    the tearing asunder and mastication of the coarse dry shrubs on which the camel
                    usually feeds. It possesses besides many other peculiarities in form and
                    structure specially adapted to its mode of life. Its nostrils are in the form of
                    oblique slits, which can be opened or shut at will, and thus the organ of smell,
                    which in the camel is of extraordinary acuteness, is preserved from contact with
                    the hot acrid sand that, like a “pillar of cloud,” frequently sweeps across the
                    desert. The extremities only of the two toes which form the foot are free, and
                    are each terminated by a short and somewhat curved nail, the rest of the toes
                    being connected together by means of a broad elastic pad on which the foot
                    rests, and which buoys the camel up as it moves on the soft and ever-shifting
                    surface. The horny callosities on the breast and limb-joints, on which the camel
                    rests when being loaded, may possibly have resulted from the long ages of
                    servitude to which it has been subjected, but whether they existed in the wild
                    camel or not, traces of them are said to be now found on the new-born young. The
                    hump or humps on the camel’s back are mere masses of fat, without any
                    corresponding curve on the vertebral column of the animal, and form a reserve of
                    nourishment to be used when other supplies fail; consequently during lengthened
                    periods of privation, and during the rutting season, when the males almost cease
                    to eat, these masses greatly diminish in size. The camel <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0811-0736"/> driver knows well the value of this natural
                    storehouse, and takes care before starting on a lengthened journey to have the
                    humps of his beasts well distended. In its native deserts, however, the camel is
                    more liable to suffer from lack of water than of food, and accordingly the
                    stomach is so modified as to allow of a certain quantity of water being stored
                    for future use. On the walls of the paunch or first stomach, little pouches with
                    narrow mouths are developed; these are the so called “water cells,” the biggest
                    of which in an adult camel measures when dilated about three inches in width and
                    depth, and these serve to strain off a considerable quantity of water from the
                    contents of the paunch, retaining it for future use by means of powerful
                    sphincter muscles. The upper divided lip of the camel is slightly extensile, and
                    is used as a feeler with which to touch and examine its food before turning the
                    same into its mouth. The animal is further characterized externally by its long
                    neck, the dusky colour of its fur, the shaggy masses of long woolly hair on
                    certain parts of its body, and the disproportionate shortness of its legs.
                    These, together with the peculiarities already mentioned, combine to make it one
                    of the most ungainly of known animals, and almost justify the recent description
                    given of it by Dr Russell, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent, as
                    “an abominably ugly necessary animal.” Nevertheless, it is as indispensable
                    where great deserts are to be traversed as is the ship on the ocean highway, and
                    this fact seems to have completely blinded the Arab to its undoubted déficiences
                    in form, for in his poetry allusion is sometimes made to the motions of the
                    camel as to a recognized standard of elegance.</p>
                <p>The camel is one of the oldest mammals now living, and fossil remains have been
                    found in the Miocene of the Seva-lik Hills of a species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Camelus</hi><hi rend="italic">sivαlensis)</hi> somewhat larger, but otherwise
                    scarcely distinguishable from recent forms. “The difference is so slight,” says
                    Andrew Murray, “it pleases us to think that we may have here, in this most
                    ancient animal, a species which saw the Miocene epoch, and which has survived
                    all the chances and changes which have taken place since then.” That it was one
                    of the earliest of domesticated animals is evident from the frequent allusions
                    made to it in the oldest written records of the human race Six thousand camels
                    are said to have formed part of the wealth of the patriarch Job; they also
                    formed part of the present which Pharaoh gave to Abraham, and it was to a
                    company of Ishmaelites travelling from Gilead to Egypt on camels, laden with
                    spices, much as their Arabian descendants do at the present day, that Joseph was
                    sold by his brethren. Naturalists are able to indicate with more or less
                    certainty the wild progenitors of most of the domestic animals, but they have
                    hitherto failed to obtain any reliable evidence of the existence, at the present
                    day, of the wild ancestor of the camel. In the eastern hemisphere it stands
                    alone, sole representative of the family to which it belongs, its only allies,
                    the llamas, being confined to the slopes of the Andes and the southern parts of
                    South America. Palaeontologists, however, by the discovery of several fossil
                    forms, have been able to bridge over the geographical gap which at present
                    separates the two branches of the Camelidae</p>
                <p>During the rutting season the male camel becomes exceedingly savage and
                    dangerous, and engages in fierce contests with its fellows The gravid female
                    carries her young for fully eleven months, and produces only one calf at a time,
                    which she suckles for a year. Eight days after birth the Arabian camel stands
                    three feet high, but it does not reach its full growth till its sixteenth or
                    seventeenth year. It lives from forty to fifty years. The flesh of the young
                    camel resembles veal, and is a favourite food of the Arabs, while camel’s milk
                    forms an excellent and highly nutritious beverage, although, according to
                    Layard, it does not furnish butter. The woolly hair, which grows to a great
                    length on the under side of the neck, the upper part of the legs, and on the
                    humps, is shorn every summer, and is woven into a variety of stuffs used by the
                    Arab for clothing himself and his family, and in covering his tent. It was in
                    raiment of camel’s hair that John the Baptist appeared as a preacher. The hair
                    imported into this country is chiefly used in the manufacture of small brushes
                    used by painters, while the thick hide is formed into a very durable leather.
                    The dung is used as fuel, and from the incinerated remains of this sal-ammoniac
                    is extracted, which was at one time largely exported from Egypt.</p>
                <p>But it is as “the ship of the desert,” without which vast tracts of the earth’s
                    surface would probably have remained for ever unexplored, that the camel is
                    chiefly valuable. In its fourth year its training as a beast of burden begins,
                    when it is taught to kneel down and to rise at a given signal, and is gradually
                    accustomed to bear increasing loads. These vary in weight from 500 to 1000 lb,
                    according to the variety of camel employed, for of the Arabian camel there are
                    almost as many breeds as there are of the horse in more temperate regions. When
                    crossing a desert the camels are expected to carry their load 25 miles a day for
                    three days without drink, getting a supply of water, however, on the fourth; but
                    the fleeter varieties will carry their rider and a bag of water 50 miles a day
                    for five days without drinking. When too heavily laden the camel refuses to
                    rise, but on the march it is exceedingly patient under its burden, only yielding
                    beneath it to die; relieved from its load it does not, like other animals, seek
                    the shade, even when that is to be found, but prefers to kneel beside its burden
                    in the broad glare of the sun, seeming to luxuriate in the burning sand. When
                    overtaken by the deadly simoom it falls on its knees, and stretching its
                    snake-like neck along the sand, closes its nostrils, and remains thus motionless
                    till the atmosphere clears; and in this position it affords some shelter to its
                    driver, who, wrapping his face in his mantle, crouches behind his beast. Of
                    still greater service is it, when, the whole caravan being on the point of
                    perishing for want of water, the acute sense of smell which the camel possesses
                    enables it to perceive the presence of water more than a mile off; then it will
                    break its halter and make an unerring track for the well. The food of the camel
                    consists chiefly of the leaves of trees, shrubs, and dry hard vegetables, which
                    it is enabled to tear down and masticate by means of its upper incisors and
                    powerful canine teeth. It is, however, fond of luxurious living when such is to
                    be had, and, according to Sir Samuel Baker, when it arrives in good pasture,
                    after several days of sharp desert marching, it often dies in a few hours of
                    inflammation caused by repletion; but when other animals are starving, the
                    camel, according to the same authority, thrives “on the ends of barren leafless
                    twigs, the dried sticks of certain shrubs, and the tough dry paper-like
                    substance of the dome palm, about as succulent a breakfast as would be a green
                    umbrella and a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper.” The docility of the
                    camel has become wellnigh proverbial throughout Europe, but recent travellers
                    who have studied the animal in Arabia and Africa have said much to lessen, if
                    not to extinguish, its reputation in this particular. “If docile means stupid,”
                    says Palgrave, who had ample opportunity of observing the camel during his
                    romantic sojourn in Arabia, “well and good; in such a case the camel is the very
                    model of docility. But if the epithet is intended to designate an animal that
                    takes an interest in its rider so far as a beast can, that in some way
                    understands his intentions, or shares them in a subordinate fashion, that obeys
                    from a sort of submissive or half-fellow-feeling with his master, like the horse
                    or elephant, then I say that the camel is by no means docile—very much the
                    contrary. He takes no heed of his rider, pays no attention whether he be on his
                    back or not, walks straight on when <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n812/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0812-0737"/> once set agoing, merely because he is too stupid
                    to turn aside, and then should some tempting thorn or green branch allure him
                    out of the path, continues to walk on in the new direction simply because he is
                    too dull to turn back into the right road. In a word, he is from first to last
                    an undomesticated and savage animal rendered serviceable by stupidity alone,
                    without much skill on his master’s part, or any co-operation on his own, save
                    that of an extreme passiveness. Neither attachment nor even habit impress him
                    never tame, though not wide-awake enough to be exactly wild.” So also Sir S.
                    Baker, in his recent work <hi rend="italic">The A lbert Nyanza,</hi> bears
                    testimony to its extreme dulness, for while other nuninants in feeding select
                    wholesome herbs, the camel is stupid enough to eat indiscriminately every green
                    vegetable; it is thus often poisoned through eating a plant known to the Arabs
                    as “camel poison,” and on this account it is customary to set watchers over them
                    while grazing in districts where this plant is found. The camel, however, is
                    revengeful, and in satisfying this passion is said to display a far-thoughted
                    malice scarcely consistent with the extreme stupidity attributed to it by
                    Palgrave. Of this vindictiveness the camel driver is well aware, and of the
                    certainty that sooner or later it will seek revenge; accordingly it is customary
                    for the person who has reason to fear its malice to throw his clothes before the
                    camel, meanwhile concealing himself until the infuriated animal has expended its
                    rage in tossing and trampling upon them, when the injury, real or supposed, is
                    immediately forgotten.</p>
                <p>The camel is probably a native of the desert countries of the south-west of Asia,
                    whence it has spread into most of the arid regions of the eastern hemisphere,
                    carrying with it wherever it goes a mark of its desert origin in the antipathy
                    which it shows to cross a stream of water. It has lately been introduced into
                    Australia, the great central desert of which was recently crossed by Warburton
                    with a caravan of camels. It has now also obtained a footing in the New World,
                    ten camels having been landed at New York some years ago, all of them, however,
                    with the exception of a single male and female, dying soon after. The surviving
                    pair were transferred to Nevada, where the soil was sandy and sterile, producing
                    abundance of prickly shrubs which no other animal would touch, but on which the
                    pair of camels flourished and bred. This female has already given birth to
                    twenty-four young, all of which are still (1875) alive, and some of these having
                    also bred, there are now ninety-six camels, all, with the exception of the
                    original couple, born in Nevada. In Europe the camel is only reared in the
                    neighbourhood of Pisa, having been introduced there by one of the dukes of
                    Tuscany, and is employed as a beast of burden, but is said to be gradually
                    deteriorating.</p>
                <p>There are two species of camel—the Arabian and the Bactrian. The former or
                    single-humped species <hi rend="italic">(Camelus dromedarius)</hi> is found in
                    greatest perfection in Arabia, whence it has spread eastwards to India, where it
                    is now extensively used, although the stony nature of much of the ground it has
                    to pass over does not give it in India that superiority over other beasts of
                    burden, which it undoubtedly possesses in desert countries. It seems to have
                    spread westwards with the Koran along the North African shores, and to have been
                    introduced by the Moors into Spain, where, however, it did not succeed in
                    establishing itself. It also accompanied the followers of Mahomet into European
                    Turkey. Iu Arabia several breeds, each possessing special qualities, are
                    carefully cultivated. The chief of these are the thick-built, heavy-footed, and
                    slow-paced variety, used for carrying heavy loads, and the dromedary— a name
                    often applied to all the members of the single-humped species, but properly
                    belonging only to a thin, comparatively elegant, and fine-haired breed,
                    celebrated for its fleetness, carrying its rider when necessary 100 miles a day.
                    The dromedary, says Palgrave, “is the race-horse of its species,” and the
                    difference between it and the heavy variety is exactly the same “as between the
                    race-horse and a hack.” Another breed, belonging to a tribe of Arabs who dwell
                    near the western shores of the Red Sea, is specially adapted for journeying with
                    loads over mountainous districts,and Baker, who made use of them, states that
                    they accomplished feats in mountain climbing which would have been impossible to
                    any other domestic animal so loaded. The Bactrian or two-humped camel <hi
                    rend="italic">(Camelus</hi><hi rend="italic">bactrianus)</hi> is a somewhat
                    larger and more robust species, and is much rarer than the Arabian. It is found
                    throughout the region lying to the north and east of that inhabited by the
                    dromedary, from the Black Sea to China and northward to Lake Baikal, where in
                    winter it sustains severe ccld, subsisting meanwhile upon the leaves and twigs
                    of the willow and birch. The pads on its feet are harder than in the other
                    species, and are thus better fitted to bear the changes wrought on the soil by
                    the frequent alternations of rain and drought, while its fur is also thicker and
                    more plentiful. In Central Asia both species occur, and hybrids are not
                    uncommon, the latter being, it is alleged, occasionally fertile among
                    themselves. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">gi. )</hi></p>
