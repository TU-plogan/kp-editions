                <p><label type="entry">CAGLIARI</label>, the capital of the island of Sardinia, and
                    chief town of its southern province, is situated in the recess of the bay to
                    which it gives its name, not far from the mouth of the River Mulargia, in 39°
                    33' 14" N. lat. and 9° 7' 48" E. long. It has a splendid appearance from the
                    sea, occupying as it does the slope and summit of a hill, which is crowned by a
                    noble castle. This building gives the name of Castello, or, in Sardinian,
                    Casteddu, to the district containing the vice-regal palace, the cathedral, the
                    university, the theatre, the chief mansions of the nobility, and the public
                    seminaries. To the west of the Castello lies the district of Stampace, with the
                    Corso, and to the east that of Villanuova with its pleasant promenades,—both
                    consisting for the most part of narrow, irregular, and ill-paved streets, but
                    the former inhabited by the wealthier citizens. The slope between the castle and
                    the bay is occupied by the Marina, a well-built quarter, containing the
                    residences of the merchants and consuls, the bonded warehouses, and the
                    lazaretto; while to the west of the town is the spacious suburb of St Avandrace,
                    nearly a mile in length. The university, which possesses the four faculties of
                    theology, law, medicine, and arts, was founded in 1596 by Philip of Spain, was
                    restored in 1720, and was remodelled in 1764. It has a library of upwards of
                    22,000 volumes, and numbers from 100 to 200 students. Besides the cathedral,
                    which was built by the Pisans during the 14th century (though the present front
                    only dates from 1703), Cagliari contains about thirty churches and twenty
                    convents, of which the Capuchin monastery is interesting for remains of Roman
                    reservoirs. There is a considerable museum both of antiquities and natural
                    history, as well as a recently erected observatory; and the benevolent
                    institutions comprise an orphanage, and a large civil hospital, under the
                    superintendence of a medical board and the sisters of mercy, with a separate
                    wing set apart for the accommodation of lunatic patients. There are also in the
                    town a mint, an extensive custom-house, and barracks. Cagliari is the see of an
                    archbishop, and the seat of the Sardinian Cortes, and of the judicial court for
                    the southern division of the island. The bay, formed by the projection of Cape
                    Carbonara and Cape Pula, and stretching inland for a distance of 12 miles, with
                    an extreme width of 24 miles, contributes greatly to the commercial importance
                    of the city; and the harbour, situated at the south angle of the wall of the
                    Marina quarter, is one of the safest in the Mediterranean, being well sheltered
                    from every wind except the south. Frequent proposals have been made to extend
                    the area by the construction of a breakwater, but this has not as yet been
                    effected. Cagliari is the chief port of Sardinia, and possesses by far the
                    greatest part of the export trade, which principally consists of corn, fruits,
                    oil, wine, cork, lead, and a few native manufactures. Most important of the last
                    class is salt, procured, at the rate of 683,000 quintals per annum, from the
                    salt-pans to the west of the town. In 1873 the total value of exports from the
                    province, most of which pass through the port, was &lt;£519,234; while the
                    imports of the same year were of the value of £368,028. There is regular steam
                    communication with Naples, Leghorn, and Genoa, as well as less frequently with
                    other ports. The railway from Cagliari to Iglesias, a distance of 33½ miles,
                    opens up the most important lead mines at present in operation, and a line of
                    58⅛ miles leads to Oristano. There is a submarine telegraph to Malta and another
                    to Bone in Algeria. The climate of the town, in spite of the proximity of the
                    salt swamp already mentioned, is excellent; and water, the want of which was
                    formerly severely felt, is now supplied by an English company. Population in
                    1871, 33,039.</p>
                <p>The modern city occupies the site of the ancient <hi rend="italic">Curdles</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Cαrαlis,</hi> which was founded by the Carthaginians, and
                    passed into the hands of the Romans after the first Punic war. Of the buildings
                    erected by the latter people there are several extensive remains,—those of an
                    amphitheatre cut out in great part from the rock, a large aqueduct, a circular
                    temple, &amp;c.; while in the suburb of St Avandrace are <pb break="no"

                    interesting is that of Atilia Pomptilla. In the civil war between Caesar and
                    Pompey, and during the empire, Cagliari was an important naval station; and,
                    though it never obtained the status of a Boman colony, its inhabitants received
                    the right of citizenship. Under Tiberius its population was augmented by the
                    introduction of 4000 Jews, whose descendants were only expelled by the Spaniards
                    in 1492. After the fall of the Western empire the city continued under the
                    Vandals to be the capital of the island, and retained its importance during the
                    Middle Ages. In 1353 the Genoese were disastrously beaten in the neighbouring
                    sea by the Aragonese and the Venetians. In 1708 the town was bombarded by the
                    English under Admiral I ake; in 1717 it was captured by the Spaniards; in 1779
                    it suffered from a great famine; and in 1793 it was bombarded by the French.
                    From 1799 to 1815, while Savoy was in the hands of the French, Cagliari afforded
                    a residence to the king of Sardinia.</p>
