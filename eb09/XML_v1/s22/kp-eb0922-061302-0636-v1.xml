                    Croatia and Carniola, and on the W. by Carinthia and Salzburg. Its area is 8630
                    square miles. Almost the entire district is mountainous, being occupied by
                    various chains and ramifications of the eastern Alps; and, though Northern (or
                    Upper) and Southern (or Lower) Styria are distinguished, the latter is low only
                    in a relative sense. The North Limestone Alps touch Styria to the north of the
                    Enns, beginning with the huge Dachstein (9830 feet), which rises on the
                    north-west border of the duchy. To the south of the Enns the central chain of
                    the Alps traverses Styria from south-west to north-east in two huge ranges,
                    separated by the valleys of the Mur and the Mürz, and conveniently grouped under
                    the name of Styrian Alps. The more northerly of these two branches, forming a
                    prolongation of the Tauern ridge, is the loftier, and culminates in the
                    Hochgolling (9392 feet), the highest summit in Styria. The lower branch to the
                    south is broken by the valley of the Mur, which turns abruptly to the right at
                    its confluence with the Mürz, and still farther to the north-east is crossed by
                    the Semmering Pass. To the south of the Drave the duchy is traversed by the
                    Karawanken Mountains (highest peak, the Stou, 7346 feet), forming a continuation
                    of the Carnic Alps. The mountains decrease in height from west to east, and the
                    south-east part of Styria may be described as hilly rather than mountainous.
                    There is nowhere level ground enough to form a plain in the proper acceptation
                    of the term, but some of the valleys contain a good deal of fertile land. The
                    rivers of Styria all drain into the Danube; the Save and the Traun are the most
                    important of those not already mentioned. There are numerous small mountain
                    lakes. The climate, of course, varies with the configuration of the surface, and
                    there is a mean annual difference of about 7° Fahr, between the temperature of
                    the north-west and the south-east.</p>
                <p>In spite of the irregular nature of the surface, but little of the soil can be
                    called unproductive. About 21·40 per cent. is under tillage, 1275 in meadow, and
                    1675 in pasture, while nearly a half of the total area is covered with fine
                    forests. The chief crops are oats, maize, rye, wheat, buckwheat, potatoes, and
                    flax. Wine is produced in the valleys of Lower Styria, where large quantities of
                    chestnuts are also grown. In the mountains dairy-farming is successfully carried
                    on in the Alpine fashion, and good horses are reared in the valley of the Enns.
                    Sheep are comparatively few, but there are large numbers of goats and swine,
                    while poultry-rearing and bee-keeping are very general in the Slavonic districts
                    to the south. Some fairly successful attempts have also been made to breed
                    silkworms. Trout and other fish are abundant in the rivers and mountain lakes
                    and chamois are hunted among the higher Alps.</p>
                <p>The great wealth of Styria, however, lies underground. Its extensive and
                    important iron mines yield nearly one-third of the iron ore raised in the
                    Austrian empire, and its other mineral resources include brown coal, pit-coal,
                    copper, zinc, lead, graphite, a little gold and silver, nickel, alum, cobalt,
                    salt, dyer’s earth, potter’s clay, marble, and good mill and building stones.
                    The best known of its numerous mineral springs are the thermal springs of
                    Tüffer, the alkaline springs of Rohitsch, and the brine springs of Aussee.</p>
                <p>The chief industry of Styria is determined by its mineral richness, and
                    iron-foundries, machine-shops, and manufactures of various kinds of iron and
                    steel goods are very numerous. A special branch is the making of scythes and
                    sickles, which are sent out of the country in large quantities. Among its other
                    industrial products are glass, paper, cement, oil and perfumery, shoes, cotton
                    goods, chemicals, and gunpowder. Linen-weaving is prosecuted as a household
                    industry. An active trade is carried on in the above-named manufactures, and in
                    brown coal, cattle, wine, and fruit. In addition to three navigable rivers
                    (Drave, Save, Mur), the traffic of the duchy is facilitated by 600 miles of
                    railway.</p>
                <p>The population of Styria in 1880 was 1,213,597, equivalent to 140 per square
                    mile, a proportion which, while not high in itself, is considerably above the
                    rate in the other mountainous regions of the empire. Nearly the whole of these
                    profess the Roman Catholic faith, the Protestants numbering only 8000 and the
                    Jews about 1000. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are Germans; the remainder,
                    chiefly found in the south parts of the duchy, in the valleys of the Drave and
                    Save, are Slavs (Slovenes). About 65 per cent. are supported by agricultural
                    pursuits, including forestry. The education of the crownland centres in the
                    university of Gratz, which is attended by about 1200 students. The capital and
                    seat of the administration is Gratz (100,000 inhabitants), which is also the
                    headquarters of the third corps of the Austrian army; the only other town of any
                    size is Marburg (17,600). The provincial estates consist of 63 members,
                    including the two Roman Catholic bishops, the rector of the university, 12
                    representatives of the large landowners, 23 of the peasants, 19 of the towns,
                    and 6 of the chambers of commerce. Styria sends 23 members to the imperial
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>In the Roman period Styria, which even thus early was famed for its iron and
                    steel, was inhabited by the Celtic Taurisci, and divided geographically between
                    Noricum and Pannonia. Subsequently it was successively occupied or traversed by
                    Visigoths, Huns, Ostrogoths, Langobardi, Franks, and Avars. Towards the end of
                    the 6th century the last-named began to give way to the Slavs (Wends), who
                    ultimately made themselves masters of the entire district. Styria was included
                    in the conquests of Charlemagne,, and was henceforth comprised in the German
                    marks erected against the Avar and the Slav. At first the identity of Styria is
                    lost in the great duchy of Carinthia, corresponding more or less closely to the
                    Upper Carinthian mark. This duchy, however, afterwards fell to pieces, and a
                    distinct mark of Styria was recognized, taking its name from the margrave
                    Ottocar of Steier (1056). A century or so later it was created a duchy. In 1192
                    the duchy of Styria came by inheritance to the house of Austria, and from that
                    time it shared the fortunes of Upper and Lower Austria, passing like them to the
                    Hapsburgs in 1282. The Protestant Reformation met an early and general welcome
                    in Styria, but the dukes took the most stringent measures to stamp it out,
                    offering their subjects recantation or expatriation as the only alternatives. At
                    least 30,000 Protestants preferred exile, and it was not till about 100 years
                    ago that religious liberty was recognized. The modern history of Styria has been
                    similar to that of the other Austrian crownlands, and calls for no special
                    remark.</p>
