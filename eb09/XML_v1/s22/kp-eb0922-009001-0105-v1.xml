                <p><label type="entry">SIND</label>, the westernmost territorial subdivision of
                    India, and a frontier province of considerable importance in a geographical and
                    political aspect, lies between the 23d and 28th parallels of N. latitude and
                    between the 66th and 71st meridians of E. longitude. Its length from north to
                    south is estimated at 360 miles, and the average of its breadth from east to
                    west at 170. On the north it is bounded by the Khelat state (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Baluchistan),</hi> the Punjab, and Baháwalpúr; on the E. by
                    Jaisalmir and Mulani, or generally the more desert tracts of Western Rajputana;
                    on the S. by the Runn of Cutch (Rann of Kachh) and the Indian Ocean; and on the
                    W. by Khelat, which overlaps it on the north. Including the alienated district
                    of Khairpur and the extensive tract to the south called the political
                    superintendency of the Thar and Parkar, its area is set down as between 56,000
                    and 57,000 square miles.</p>
                <p>The one great geographical feature in Sind is the lower Indus, passing, as it
                    does, through the entire length of the province, first in a south-westerly
                    direction, then turning somewhat to the east, then returning to a line more
                    directly south, and finally inclining to the west, to seek an outlet at the sea.
                    Though there is much similarity in the appearance of the landscape on the two
                    sides of the broad river, the distant line of mountains between Sakhar and
                    Sehwan, the steep pass overhanging the water at Lakki, and the hill country
                    below Sehwan give a distinctive character to the right bank, and lend it special
                    attraction when contrasted with the flat lowlands, merging into desert, on the
                    left. Sind has been aptly likened to Egypt. If the one depends for life and
                    fertility on the Nile, so does the other on the Indus. The cities and towns are
                    not so readily to be compared. Hyderabad, notwithstanding its remarkable
                    fortress and handsome tombs, can scarcely vie in interest as a native capital
                    with Cairo; nor can Kurrachee, as a Europeanized capital, be said to have
                    attained the celebrity of Alexandria. Yet there are some respects in which this
                    particular province would not be wholly eclipsed, even in its outside pictures.
                    It contains many monuments of archaeological and architectural interest, and to
                    the traveller descending the river from the Punjab, or ascending it from Kotri,
                    the <hi rend="italic">coup d'oeil</hi> on the approach to Rohri is at times
                    singularly striking. The beautiful little island of Khwája Kidhr is a gem in
                    itself; and there is at certain seasons undoubted poetry in the very dreariness
                    of Sakhar and Bakhar.</p>
                <p>Owing to the deficiency of rain, the continuance of hot weather in Sind is
                    exceptional. Lying between two monsoons, it just escapes the influence of both.
                    The south-west monsoon stops short at Lakhpat Bandar, the north-west monsoon at
                    Kurrachee, and even here the annual rainfall is not reckoned at more than six or
                    eight inches. At times there is no rainfall for two or three years, while at
                    others there is a whole season’s rainfall in one or two days. The average
                    temperature of the summer months rises to 95° F., and the winter average is 60°,
                    the summer maximum being 120° and the winter minimum 32°. The temperature on the
                    sea-coast is much more equable than elsewhere. In Northern Sind we find frost in
                    winter, while both there and in Lower Sind the summer heat is extreme and
                    prolonged. This great heat, combined with the poisonous exhalations from the
                    pools left after the annual inundation and the decaying vegetable deposits,
                    produces the fever and ague with which the name of the country is associated,
                    and to which even the natives themselves fall a prey.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0106-0091"/> The soil is largely dependent on the river
                    overflow. This grand provision of nature is, however, uncertainly exercised; and
                    not only is the actual volume of water supplied from the upper Indus liable to
                    fluctuation, but the particular lands inundated or untouched by inundation vary
                    according to the caprices of the river. Questions of alluvion and diluvion are
                    therefore of frequent occurrence; and it is often as hard to say whether
                    newly-thrown-up lands belong to the state or an individual proprietor as it is
                    to decide who is the loser in the case of lands newly submerged. In the lands
                    which, as a rule, are reached annually and in fair proportion by the inundation,
                    the soil is so rich as to produce two crops or even more in the year without the
                    assistance of manure. Salt is present in great quantity. The two principal
                    yearly crops are the vernal, known as <hi rend="italic">rabi,</hi> sown in
                    autumn and reaped in spring, and the autumnal, known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >kharif,</hi> sown in summer while the river is high and reaped from October to
                    December. In some districts there is a distinct third crop called <hi
                    rend="italic">peshras,</hi> sown in March and reaped in July and August. The
                    implements of husbandry are the plough (<hi rend="italic">har</hi>), drawn by
                    two bullocks; the harrow (<hi rend="italic">sahar</hi>), a heavy log of wood
                    drawn by four bullocks, a man standing on each end; the seed-sower <hi
                    rend="italic">(nári),</hi> a tube fixed to the plough with a wooden funnel on
                    the top, used while the ground is being ploughed for the last time; a curved
                    hook <hi rend="italic">(dátro)</hi> with teeth like a saw, for reaping; and a
                    hoe (<hi rend="italic">kúriah</hi>), for weeding.</p>
                <p>The principal products are <hi rend="italic">bájri</hi> (a well-known Indian
                    grain), and <hi rend="italic">juári</hi> (the Indian millet), rice, cotton,
                    sugar-cane, tobacco, oil-seeds, wheat, barley, and indigo. Of these, wheat may
                    be considered the staple produce of Upper, and <hi rend="italic">bájri</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">juári</hi> of Middle and Lower Sind. Dates, plantains,
                    mangoes, limes, oranges, pomegranates, citrons, figs, grapes, apples, tamarinds,
                    mulberries, and melons are said to be fruits common to the country; and it is
                    added that of late years nectarines, peaches, apricots, and other fruit trees
                    have been successfully introduced, but the statement must be received with some
                    reservation in respect of quantity and quality. There is no doubt that the
                    fruits imported by the Afghan traders find more favour than any home
                    products.</p>
                <p>Among the chief manufactures may be mentioned the gold, silver, and silk
                    embroideries, carpets, cloths, lacquered ware, horse-trappings and other
                    leather-work, paper, pottery, tiles, swords, and matchlocks, and the boxes and
                    other articles of inlaid work introduced more than a century ago from Shiraz.
                    The lac work, a widely extended industry in India, is also in vogue in Sind.
                    Variously coloured lac is laid in succession on the boxes, &amp;c., while
                    turning on the lathe, and the design is then cut through the different colours.
                    Hyderabad has long been famous for its silks and cottons, silver and gold work,
                    and lacquered ornaments, and the district could once boast of skilled workmen in
                    arms and armour; but, unless the demand for the products of its industries
                    increase, it is to be feared that its old reputation will not long be
                    maintained. In the cloths called <hi rend="italic">sudi,</hi> silk is woven with
                    the striped cotton—a practice possibly due to the large Mohammedan population of
                    the country, as no Moslem can wear a garment of pure silk without infraction of
                    the law. As regards the carpets, Sir George Birdwood states that those from Sind
                    are the cheapest, coarsest, and least durable of all made in India. Formerly
                    they were fine in design and colouring, but of late years they have greatly
                    deteriorated. The cheap rugs, which sell for about 9s. each, are made with the
                    pile (if not altogether) of cow hair, woven upon a common cotton foundation,
                    with a rough hempen shoot. The patterns are bold and suited to the material, and
                    the dyes good and harmonious.</p>
                <p>In 1837 the zoology of Sind was reported by Burnes to comprise of genera and
                    species 20 mammals, 191 birds, 36 fishes, 11 reptiles, besides 200 in other
                    departments of natural history. Of wild animals we find the tiger (in the
                    jungles of Upper Sind), the hyaena, the <hi rend="italic">gúrkhar</hi> or wild
                    ass (in the south part of the Thar and Parkar district), the wolf, jackal, fox,
                    wild hog, antelope, <hi rend="italic">pharho</hi> or hog deer, hares, and
                    porcupines. Of birds of prey, the vulture and several varieties of falcon may be
                    mentioned. The flamingo, pelican, stork, crane, and Egyptian ibis frequent the
                    shores of the delta. Besides these there are the <hi rend="italic">ubára</hi>
                    (bustard) or <hi rend="italic">tilúr</hi>, the rock-grouse, quail, partridge,
                    and various kinds of parrots. Waterfowl are plentiful; in the cold season the
                    lakes or <hi rend="italic">dhandhs</hi> are covered with wild geese, <hi
                    rend="italic">kulang,</hi> ducks, teal, curlew, and snipe. Among other animals
                    to be noted are scorpions, lizards, centipedes, and many snakes.</p>
                <p>The domestic animals include camels (one-humped), buffaloes, sheep and goats,
                    horses and asses (small but hardy), mules, and bullocks. Of fish there are, on
                    the sea-coast, sharks, saw-fish, rays, and skate; cod, <hi rend="italic">sir,
                    cavalho,</hi> red-snapper, <hi rend="italic">gassir, begti, dangára,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> abound. A kind of sardine also frequents the coast.
                    In the Indus, the finest flavoured and most plentiful fish is the <hi
                    rend="italic">palo,</hi> generally identified with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hilsa</hi> fish of the Ganges. <hi rend="italic">Dambhro (Labeo rohita)</hi>
                    and mullet, m <hi rend="italic">oráko (Cirrhina mrigala), gandan (Notopterus
                    kapirat), khago</hi> or catfish <hi rend="italic">(Rita buchanani), popri
                    (Barbus sarana), shakúr, jerkho,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">singhári (Macrones
                    aor)</hi> are also found. Otter, turtle, and porpoise are frequently met with;
                    so too are long-snouted alligators and water-snakes.</p>
                <p>The extent of forest land is relatively small. The forests (about eighty-seven in
                    number) are situated for the most part on the banks of the Indus, and extend
                    southward from Ghotki in the Rohri deputy collectorate to the middle delta. They
                    are described as narrow strips of land, from two to three miles in length, and
                    ranging from two furlongs to two miles in breadth. The largest are between 9000
                    and 10,000 acres in area, but are subject to diminution owdng to the
                    encroachments of the stream. The wood is principally <hi rend="italic">bábul
                    (Acacia arabica), bahan (Populus euphratica),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kandi
                    (Prosopis spicigera).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">táli (Dalbergia Sissú)</hi>
                    grows to some extent in Upper Sind; the iron-wood tree <hi rend="italic">(Tocoma
                    undulata)</hi> is found near the hills in the Mehar districts. There are,
                    besides, the <hi rend="italic">nim (Melia Azadirachta),</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">pipal (Ficus religiosa),</hi> the <hi rend="italic">bér (Zizyphus
                    Jujuba).</hi> The delta has no forests, but its shores abound with mangrove
                    trees. Of trees introduced by the forest department we have the tamarind (<hi
                    rend="italic">Tamarindus indica),</hi> several Australian wattle trees, the
                    water-chestnut (<hi rend="italic">Trapa natans),</hi> the <hi rend="italic">aula
                    (Emblica officinalis),</hi> the <hi rend="italic">bahera (Terminalia
                    Bellerica),</hi> the carob tree <hi rend="italic">(Ceratonia Siliqua),</hi> the
                    China tallow <hi rend="italic">(Stillingia sebifera),</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bél (Aegle Marmelos),</hi> and the manah <hi rend="italic">(Bassia
                    latifolia).</hi> There is a specially organized forest department.</p>
                <p>For administrative purposes the province has five well-understood divisions :—(1)
                    <hi rend="italic">Frontier, Upper Sind,</hi> of which the principal town is
                    Jacobabad, named after the late General John Jacob, C. B., its founder; the
                    hamlet which occupied its site in 1843 was a mere speck in the desert, and its
                    name, Khangarh, can hardly be associated with the fine canal and abundant
                    vegetation now marking the locality; (2) <hi rend="italic">Shikarpur,</hi> with
                    its capital of the same name and Sakhar, both notable places on the right bank
                    of the Indus; in this division also are the towns of Larkhána and Rohri, the
                    last on the left bank of the river; (3) <hi rend="italic">Hyderabad
                    (Haidarabad),</hi> of which the chief town, having the same name, was the
                    capital of the province prior to the British occupation; (4) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kurrachee (Karachi),</hi> with its modern Europeanized capital and harbour and
                    Tattha, a town of interesting local associations; (5) <hi rend="italic">Thar and
                    Parkar,</hi> an outlying district on the south-east, more or less part of the
                    desert tract extending far and wide in that particular quarter. Besides these
                    there is the territory of Mir' Ali Murad, Talpur, greatly curtailed of its
                    original dimensions, but still forming a large land alienation in Upper
                    Sind.</p>
                <p>Where cultivation depends so much on the character of the year’s inundation, it
                    is natural that the revenue should be uncertain. In 1883-84, for instance, the
                    river was abnormally low. Consequently the area of cultivation was contracted,
                    and, while considerable remissions had to be granted, collections were with
                    difficulty carried out. The rainfall, moreover, except in the Thar and Parkar
                    district, was not only scanty but unseasonable. In Thar and Parkar the rainfall
                    was especially favourable, and owing to an early inundation and wise
                    preparations lands never before cultivated were brought under the plough.</p>
                <p>The gross canal revenue in Sind amounted in 1883-84 to Rs. 3,686,754, and the
                    land revenue to Rs. 1,171,925. In round numbers and English figures—without
                    reference to the deterioration of the rupee—the total is about £487,000, of
                    which three-fourths is due to canal irrigation.</p>
                <p>The population may be roughly reckoned at two millions and a half, an estimate
                    which is borne out by the census of 1881. Kurrachee is now’ the most populous of
                    the capitals, and its numbers far exceed those of Shikarpur and Hyderabad. But
                    the character of its inhabitants differs from that of other large towns in Sind.
                    They are for the most part foreign and migratory, and do not represent the true
                    Sindis.</p>
                <p>Of the two great divisions of the people in Sind the Mohammedans comprise about
                    two-thirds of the whole, the Hindus the remaining third. The Mohammedans may be
                    divided into two great bodies—the Sindis proper and the naturalized Sindis. The
                    Sindi proper is a descendant of the original Hindu. In religion he is a Súni,
                    though some of the Sindis belong to the Shia sect. There are probably more than
                    three hundred families or clans among the Sindis. There is, as a rule, no
                    distinction of caste, except that followers of certain vocations—such as
                    weavers, leather-workers, sweepers, huntsmen—are considered low and vile. The
                    six different classes of naturalized Sindis are—the four families of the Saiyids
                    (the Bokhari, Mathari, Shirázi, and Lakhiráyi); the Afghans, from Khorasan; the
                    Baluchis; the slaves or Sídís— originally Africans; the Memans; and the Khwájas.
                    The Hindu population of Sind may be divided into the following principal castes
                    :—the Brahmans, Kshatrias, Waishias, and Sudras, with their subdivisions.
                    Besides these there are the Sikhs, and the religious mendicants—the Sandsi,
                    Jogi, Gosáín, and Ogar,—all of Brahman origin.</p>
                <p>The educational progress made in Sind during the quarter of a century succeeding
                    the mutiny has been very great. In 1858 there was but one Government English
                    school, with 82 boys, at Kurrachee, and one with 25 boys at Hyderabad; and of
                    the 82 only 8 of the pupils were Sindi. In 1884-85 Sind could boast of a
                    Government high school at Kurrachee with 400 pupils, of another high school
                    at<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0107-0092"/> Hyderabad with 338 pupils, and of a third at
                    Shikarpur with 228 boys. The three passed 39 out of 48 candidates for
                    matriculation at the Bombay university. Of vernacular or Sindi-Persian schools
                    under native masters there were 34 which came under Government supervision in
                    1858, whereas there were in 1884-85 no less than 23 middle schools—teaching the
                    vernacular and English—with 1165 pupils; and in the primary schools the number
                    of pupils was nearly 20,000.</p>
                <p>Captain (now Sir Richard) Burton has given a clear and instructive account of the
                    language and literature of Sind. The large proportion of Sanskrit and Arabic
                    words admitted, the anomalous structure of the grammar, and the special sounds
                    of certain letters of its alphabet render the first remarkable; and the original
                    romantic poems and translations of Arabic religious works command the attention
                    of scholars to the second. Among the more celebrated of the native writers are
                    Makhdum Hashim, Makhdum Abdullah, and Saiyid Abdu’l-Latif.</p>
                <p>The leading features of the two years’ campaign of Alexander the Great in the
                    Punjab and Sind have been touched on elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >India,</hi> vol. xii. p. 787). About 711 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the
                    Hindus of Sind were conquered by Muhammad Kasim, the young general of the caliph
                    Walid, but his successors were unable to hold their ground. In reality it was
                    the overwhelming irruption of Mahmud of Ghazni three centuries later which
                    finally subjugated the province. Nearly six centuries later still, Sind was
                    annexed by the great Akbar to Delhi. In the meanwhile it had been governed by
                    princes and petty chiefs, all of whom are celebrated in local history. After
                    Akbar, and up to the time of Nadir Shah’s invasion of India, there is little
                    historically important to distinguish the province, separated from the other
                    divisions of the Mughal empire, though its governors possessed a certain
                    delegated power which might well have tempted the more ambitious to revolt. When
                    Nadir took possession of the lands west of the Indus, one Núr Muhammad Kalhora
                    was the <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> ruler in Sind. The tribe to which he
                    belonged claimed lineal descent from Abbas, uncle of the prophet, and had a
                    widely-spread repute for sanctity. Their political influence had been, moreover,
                    increasing for many years, and in the person of one or two of their stronger
                    chiefs they had on sundry occasions risen in arms against the imperial troops.
                    In 1701, or thirty-eight years before the Persian invasion, Yar Muhammad Kahora
                    had obtained possession of Shikarpur, and managed to get from the Mughal emperor
                    a firman conferring upon him the “subahdári” of the Déra districts, with the
                    title of “Khuda Yár Khan.” On his death in 1719 he had extended his territory by
                    the acquisition of the Kandiára and Larkhána districts, and of Síbí, a vast
                    tract of country then including within its limits Sakhar as well as Shikarpur.
                    He was succeeded by his son Núr Muhammad, who, as above shown, was in the
                    unenviable position of having to account for his actions to no less notable an
                    antagonist than Nadir himself. The latter was eventually appeased by an annual
                    tribute of 20 lakhs of rupees, and on his return to Persia conferred upon the
                    Kalhora prince the title of “Shah Kuli Khan.” On Nadir’s death the Sind lands of
                    Núr Muhammad became tributary to Ahmad Shah of Kandahar, the transfer being
                    sealed by the bestowal of a new title, “Shah Nawaz Khan.” This occurred in 1748,
                    from which date till 1783—when Abdul Nabi, the last of the Kalhora princes, was
                    defeated by Mir Fath Ali Khan, and the ruling dynasty forcibly superseded by the
                    Talpúr Baluch chiefs—the local history is a mere record of conflicts and
                    reconciliations, treaties and evasions of treaty, as regards outside powers, and
                    of revolution and bloodshed within. The seat of government had become
                    established at Hyderabad, founded by Ghulam Shah Kalhora in 1768. We now come to
                    the Talpúrs. These Baluchis had immigrated to Sind from their native hills under
                    a Mir Shahdad in the early part of the 18th century, and had taken service under
                    Nur Muhammad Kalhora. Shahdad, raised to rank and influence, died, leaving four
                    sons, the third of whom, Mir Bahram, succeeded as head of the tribe. His murder
                    by a grandson of Nur Muhammad was one of the main causes of the ill-feeling
                    which had culminated in bitter hostility when later acts of treachery and
                    barbarism sealed the fate of the tyrant rulers. The Talpúrs entered Hyderabad as
                    conquerors; but unfortunately for the consolidation of their sovereignty the
                    suspicious nature of Mir Fath Ali, the head of the house, alarmed his near
                    relatives. His nephew Sohrab fled to Upper Sind, and founded the principality of
                    Khairpur, while Tara, moving eastward, became the independent chief of Mirpur.
                    Later on, Mir Fath Ali, undeterred by divisions which he had no power to
                    prevent, admitted to a share of his own government of Hyderabad his three
                    younger brothers, Ghulam Ali, Karm Ali, and Murad Ali. On the death of Fath Ali
                    in 1801 the three continued to rule together; and when Ghulam Ali was killed in
                    1811 the duumvirate remained supreme; but, on the death of Karm Ali in 1828 and
                    Murad Ali a few years later, the old system was revived, and a government of
                    four again instituted. Such was the state of things when British relations with
                    the province had become necessarily an urgent consideration, owing to the Afghan
                    expedition of 1838 (see vol. xii. p. 807).</p>
                <p>During this crisis of Anglo-Indian history the political officers in</p>
                <p>Sind and Baluchistan had a difficult task to perform, and it is infinitely to
                    their credit that more mischief did not ensue in these countries from the many
                    and heavy British disasters in the north. But the amirs of Sind were to be dealt
                    with for infractions of treaty if not for open hostility; and Sir Charles Napier
                    had to call them to account soon after his arrival at Sakhar in the autumn of
                    1842. The long and complex narrative need not be here repeated. Suffice it to
                    state that the outcome was the conquest of Sind,—the immediate result of the
                    battle of Miáni, fought in the vicinity of Hyderabad in February 1843. A course
                    of wise, firm, and kindly administration inaugurated by Sir Charles Napier
                    himself, and continued by Messrs Pringle, Frere, Inverarity, Gen. John Jacob,
                    Sir W. Merewether, and later commissioners, has since made the province an
                    important section of the western presidency of India. The story of the eight
                    years’ rule of Sir Bartle Frere in Sind has yet to be written, but his name is
                    associated with numerous matters of paramount importance,—in relation especially
                    to the position and fortunes of the deposed amírs, the rights and immunities of
                    the old privileged landholders, the organization of municipal institutions, the
                    promotion of systematic education, the due administration of justice, and the
                    erection of public works of utility.</p>
