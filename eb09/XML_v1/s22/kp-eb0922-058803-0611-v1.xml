                    Fr. <hi rend="italic">Strasbourg),</hi> the principal town of Alsace, and a
                    fortress of the first rank, is situated at the junction of the Ill and the
                    Breusch, about two miles to the west of the Rhine, in one of the most fertile
                    districts in the upper Rhenish plain. It lies about 90 miles to the north of
                    Basel, 250 miles to the east of Paris, and 370 miles to the south-west of
                    Berlin. Since 1871</p>
                <p>it has been the seat of government for the</p>
                <p>German crownland of</p>
                <p>Alsace-Lorraine (Elsass-</p>
                <p>Lothringen); and it is also the see of a</p>
                <p>Roman Catholic bishop and the headquarters of the 15th corps of the German
                    army.</p>
                <p>The town proper is divided by the arms of the Ill into three parts, of which the
                    central is the largest and most important. Most of the streets are narrow and
                    irregular, and the quaint aspect of a free mediaeval town has to a considerable
                    extent been maintained. The quarters which suffered most in the bombardment of
                    1870 have, however, been rebuilt in a more modern fashion, and the recent
                    widening of the circle of fortifications, with the destruction of the old walls,
                    has given the city opportunity to expand in all directions.</p>
                <p>By far the most prominent building is the minster, or cathedral, which in its
                    present form represents the activity of four centuries. Part of the crypt dates
                    from about 1015; the apse shows the transition from the Romanesque to the Gothic

                    the elaborate west façade, with its singular screen of double tracery, the
                    original design was furnished by Erwin of Steinbach (c. 1318). The upper part of
                    the façade and the towers were afterwards completed in accordance with a
                    different plan, and the intricate open-work spire on the north tower, 465 feet
                    high, was added in 1435. The sculptural ornamentation both without and within is
                    very rich. The astronomical clock in the south transept, constructed in 1838-42,
                    contains some fragments of the famous clock built by Dasypodius in 1571. The
                    church of St Thomas, a Gothic building of the 13th and 14th centuries, contains
                    a fine monument to Marshal Saxe, considered the <hi rend="italic">chef
                    d'oeuvre</hi> of the sculptor Pigalle. Other notable buildings are the
                    Temple-Neuf, or Neukirche, rebuilt since 1870; the old episcopal palace
                    (1731-41), now the library; the old prefecture; the theatre; the townhouse; and
                    the so-called “aubette,” containing the conservatorium of music. The university
                    of Strasburg, which was suppressed in the French Revolution as a stronghold of
                    German sentiment, was reopened in 1872, and now occupies a handsome new building
                    erected for it in 1884. The university and town library, containing about
                    600,000 volumes, consists largely of the books sent from all parts of Germany to
                    compensate for the town library destroyed in the bombardment of 1870. The
                    precious incunabula and manuscripts which then perished are, however,
                    irreplaceable. General Kleber, who was a native of Strasburg, and Gutenberg, who
                    spent part of his life here, are both commemorated by statues. Many private
                    houses are most quaint and interesting illustrations of timber architecture.
                    Pleasant public parks and gardens fringe the town.</p>
                <p>The population in 1880 was 104,471, including 51,859 Roman Catholics, 48,691
                    Protestants, and 3521 Jews. In 1885 the total population had risen to 112,091,
                    showing an increase of 7·29 per cent. The town, strictly so called, does not
                    contain more than 90,000 inhabitants, the rest belonging to the suburban
                    villages. Even before the war of 1870- 71 more than half of the inhabitants
                    spoke German as their mother-tongue, and this proportion has probably been
                    somewhat increased since. The sympathies of the people, however, like those of
                    most of the Alsatians, lay with France, and it will require the growth of a new
                    generation to bring about a complete reconciliation to German rule.</p>
                <p>The chief industries of Strasburg are tanning, brewing, and the making of steel
                    goods, machinery, and tobacco. To these must be added the stall-fattening of
                    geese for its celebrated <hi rend="italic">pâtés de foie gras,</hi> an
                    occupation which forms a most useful source of income to the poorer classes. The
                    annual value of these "fat liver pies” sent out from Strasburg is over £100,000.
                    The position of the town at the intersection of natural highways between France
                    and Germany, Switzerland and Belgium, early made it a place of considerable
                    commercial importance, and it now carries on a brisk trade in agricultural
                    produce, hams, sausages, sauerkraut, and hops. Its full development in this
                    direction, though favoured by the canals connecting the Rhine with the Rhone and
                    the Marne, has been somewhat hampered by the iron girdle of fortifications.</p>
                <p>Strasburg has always been a place of great strategic importance, and as such
                    strongly fortified. The pentagonal citadel constructed by Vauban in 1682-84 was
                    destroyed during the siege of 1870. The new German system of fortifications
                    consists of a girdle of fourteen detached forts, at a distance of three to five
                    miles from the centre of the town. Kehl, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tête-de-pontoï</hi> Strasburg, and several villages are included within this
                    enceinte, and three of the outworks lie on the right bank of the Rhine, in the
                    territory of Baden. In case of need a great part of the environs can be laid
                    under water by the garrison.</p>
                <p>The site of Strasburg seems to have been originally occupied by a Celtic
                    settlement, which the Romans conquered and replaced by the fortified station of
                    <hi rend="italic">Argentoratum,</hi> afterwards the headquarters of the eighth
                    legion. In the year 357 the emperor Julian saved the frontier of the Rhine by a
                    decisive victory gained here over the Alemanni, but about half a century later
                    the whole of the district now called Alsace fell into the hands of that Teutonic
                    people. Towards the end of the 5th century the town passed to the Franks, who
                    named it <hi rend="italic">Strataburgum.</hi> The famous “Strasburg oaths” (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Germany,</hi> vol. x. p. 480) were taken here in 842; and
                    in 923, through the homage paid by the duke of Lorraine to Henry I., began the
                    connexion of the town with the kingdom of Germany which was to last for more
                    than seven centuries. The bishopric of Strasburg was founded in the Merovingian
                    period, and soon attained great wealth and importance. The early history of
                    Strasburg, as in the case of most episcopal cities, consists mainly of a record
                    of the struggle between the bishops and the citizens,— the latter, as they grew
                    in wealth and power, feeling the fetters of ecclesiastical rule inconsistent
                    with their full development. The conflict was finally decided in favour of the
                    citizens by the battle of Oberhausbergen in 1262; and the position of free
                    imperial city, which had been conferred upon Strasburg by Philip of Swabia, was
                    not again disputed. The throwing off of the episcopal yoke was followed by an
                    internal revolution (1332), which admitted the guilds to a share in the
                    government of the city and impressed upon it the democratic character that it
                    bore down to the French Revolution. Strasburg now became one of the most
                    flourishing of all the imperial towns, and the names of natives or residents
                    like Sebastian Brant, Tauler, Fischart, and Geiler von Kaysersberg show that its
                    pre-eminence was not confined to the material sphere. On the other hand, its
                    fair fame is sullied by such acts as the burning in 1349 of 2000 Jews, accused
                    of causing a pestilence by poisoning the wells. In 1381 Strasburg joined the
                    Städtebund, or Swabian League, and about a century later it rendered efficient
                    aid to the Swiss confederates at Granson and Nancy. The Reformation found ready
                    acceptance at Strasburg, its foremost champion here being Martin Bucer, and the
                    city was skilfully piloted through the ensuing period of religious dissension by
                    its “stadtmeister” Jacob Sturm, who secured for it very favourable terms at the
                    end of the Schmalkald War. In the Thirty Years’ War Strasburg escaped without
                    molestation by observing a prudent neutrality. In 1681, during a time of peace,
                    it was suddenly seized by Louis XIV., and this unjustifiable action received
                    formal recognition at the peace of Ryswick in 1697. The immediate effect of the
                    change of superiors was a partial reaction in favour of Roman Catholicism, but
                    the city remained essentially German until the French Revolution, when it was
                    deprived of its. privileges as a free town and sank to the level of a French
                    provincial capital. It was at Strasburg that Louis Napoleon made his first
                    ineffectual attempt to grasp power. In the war of 1870 Strasburg, with its
                    garrison of 17,000 men, surrendered to the Germans after a siege of seven weeks.
                    The town and cathedral suffered considerably from the bombardment, but all
                    traces of the havoc have now disappeared.</p>
