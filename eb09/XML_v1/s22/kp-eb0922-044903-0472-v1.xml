                    (1776-1839), the eldest child of the third Earl Stanhope (noticed above), by his
                    first wife Lady Hester Pitt, eldest daughter of the first earl of Chatham, lived
                    for the earlier part of her life amid the surroundings of a noble mansion, or in
                    close communion with her uncle William Pitt, the most prominent minister of his
                    age, and on his early death withdrew whilst still young to brood over the past
                    in the solitudes of Palestine. She was born on 12th March 1776, and dwelt at her
                    father’s seat of Chevening in Kent until early in 1800, when his excitable and
                    wayward disposition drove her to her grandmother’s house at Burton Pynsent. A
                    year or<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n473/mode/1up"

                    after distinction were not satisfied until she became the chief of her uncle’s
                    household in August 1803. She sat at the head of his table and assisted in
                    welcoming his guests, gracing the board with her stately beauty and enlivening
                    the company by her quickness and keenness of conversation. Although her
                    brightness of style cheered the declining days of Pitt and amused most of his
                    political friends, her satirical remarks sometimes created enemies when more
                    consideration for the feelings of her associates would have converted them into
                    friends. Lady Hester Stanhope possessed great business talents, and when Pitt
                    was out of office she acted as his private secretary. She was with him in his
                    dying illness, and some of his last thoughts were concerned with her future, but
                    any anxiety which might have arisen in her mind on this point was dispelled
                    through the grant by a nation grateful for her uncle’s qualities of a pension of
                    £1200 a year, dating from 30th January 1806, which Lady Hester Stanhope enjoyed
                    for the rest of her days. On her uncle’s death she lived in Montague Square,
                    London, but life in London without the interest caused by associating with the
                    principal politicians of the Tory party proved irksome to her, and she sought
                    relief from lassitude in the fastnesses of Wales. Whilst she remained on English
                    soil happiness found no place in her heart, and her native land was finally
                    abandoned for the East in February 1810. After many wanderings she settled on
                    Mount Lebanon, and from this solitary position she wielded an almost absolute
                    authority over the surrounding districts. Her control over the natives was
                    sufficiently commanding to induce Ibrahim Pasha, when about to invade Syria in
                    1832, to solicit her neutrality, and this supremacy was maintained by her
                    commanding character and by the belief that she possessed the gift of
                    divination. Her cherished companion Miss Williams, and her trusted physician Dr
                    Charles Lewis Meryon, dwelt with her for some time; but the former died in 1828,
                    and the latter was not with Lady Hester when she died. In this lonely residence,
                    the villa of Djoun, 8 miles from Sidon, in a house “hemmed in by arid
                    mountains,” and with the troubles of a household of twenty-three servants,
                    unregulated by a single English attendant or friend and only waiting for her
                    death to plunder the house, Lady Hester Stanhope’s strength slowly wasted away,
                    and at last she died on 23d June 1839, aged sixty-three. The disappointments of
                    her life, and the necessity of overaweing her servants as well as the chiefs who
                    surrounded Djoun, had intensified a temper naturally imperious. In appearance as
                    in voice she resembled her grandfather, the first Lord Chatham, and like him she
                    domineered over the circle, large or small, in which she was placed.</p>
                <p>Some years after her death there appeared three volumes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs of the Lady Hester Stanhope as related by herself in Conversations with
                    her Physician (j.e.,</hi> Dr Meryon), 1845, and these were followed in the
                    succeeding year by three volumes of <hi rend="italic">Travels of Lady Hester
                    Stanhope, forming the Completion of her Memoirs narrated by her Physician.</hi>
                    They presented a lively picture of this strange woman’s life and character, and
                    contained many anecdotes of Pitt and his colleagues in political life for a
                    quarter of a century before his death,</p>
