                    (1692-1770), mathematician, third son of Archibald Stirling of Garden, and
                    grandson of Sir Archibald Stirling of Keir (Lord Garden, a lord of session), was
                    born at Garden, Stirlingshire, in 1692. Part of his early education was probably
                    obtained at Glasgow, but at eighteen years of age he went to Oxford, where,
                    chiefly through the influence of the earl of Mar he was nominated (1711) one of
                    Bishop Warner’s exhibitioners at Balliol. During his residence at Oxford he made
                    for himself considerable reputation as a student of mathematics. In 1715,
                    however, he was expelled on account of his correspondence with members of the
                    Keir and Garden families, who were noted Jacobites, and had been accessory to
                    the “Gathering of the Brig of Turk” in 17 08. From Oxford he made his way to
                    Venice, where he occupied himself as a professor of mathematics. In 1717
                    appeared his <hi rend="italic">Lineae Tertii Ordinis Newtonianae, sive</hi>....
                    (8vo, Oxford), which contained one or two notable additions to the theory. While
                    in Venice, also, he communicated,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n579/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0579-0556"/> through Sir Isaac Newton, to the Royal Society a
                    paper entitled “Methodus Differentialis Newtoniana illustrata” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1718, p. 1050; Abridg., vi. p. 428). Fearing assassination
                    on account of having discovered a trade secret of the glass-makers of Venice, he
                    returned with Newton’s help to London about the year 1725. In London he remained
                    for ten years, being most part of the time connected with an academy in Tower
                    Street, and devoting his leisure to mathematics and correspondence with eminent
                    mathematicians. In 1730 his most important work was published, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Methodus Differentialis, sive Tractatus de Summatione et
                    Interpolatione Serierum Infinitarum</hi> (4to, London), which, it must be noted,
                    is something more than an expansion of the paper of 1718. In 1735 he
                    communicated to the Royal Society a paper “On the Figure of the Earth, and on
                    the Variation of the Force of Gravity at its Surface” <hi rend="italic">(Phil.
                    Trans.,</hi> Abridg., viii. pp. 26-30). In the same year his worldly fortunes
                    changed permanently for the better, through his appointment to be manager for
                    the Scots Mining Company at Leadhills, an appointment which gave scope both to
                    his scientific talents and to his great, though hitherto latent, administrative
                    ability, and which was eminently fortunate for his employers. We are thus
                    prepared to find that his next paper to the Royal Society was concerned, not
                    with pure, but with applied science—“Description of a Machine to blow Fire by
                    the Fall of Water” <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1745, p. 315; Abridg.,
                    ix. pp. 109, 110). His name is also connected with another practical undertaking
                    since grown to vast dimensions. The accounts of the city of Glasgow show that
                    the very first instalment of ten millions sterling spent in making Glasgow a
                    seaport, viz., a sum of £28, 4s. 4d., was for a silver tea-kettle to be
                    presented to “James Stirling, mathematician, for his service, pains, and trouble
                    in surveying the river towards deepening it by locks.” This was in 1752.
                    Stirling died in Edinburgh on 5th December 1770.</p>

                    remains, consisting of papers, letters, and two manuscript volumes of a treatise
                    on weights and measures, are still preserved at Garden by Stirling’s
                    great-grandson and namesake.</p>
