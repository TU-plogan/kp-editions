                    (1764-1840), English admiral, was the second son of Captain John Smith of the
                    Guards, and was born at Westminster on 21st July 1764. He entered the navy,
                    according to his own account, “at the beginning of the American War,” being only
                    about eleven years of age. For his bravery under Rodney in the action near Cape
                    St Vincent in January 1780, he was on 25th September appointed lieutenant of the
                    “Alcide.” After serving in the actions against the French fought by Graves off
                    Chesapeake in 1781 and by Rodney at the Leeward Islands in 1782, he was on 6th
                    May of the latter year promoted to be commander of the “Fury” sloop, and on 18th
                    October advanced to the rank of captain. His ship having been paid off in the
                    beginning of 1784, he spent two years in France and afterwards visited Spain.
                    From 1790 to 1792 he was employed in advising the king of Sweden in the war with
                    Russia, receiving for his services the honour of knighthood. After his return to
                    England he was sent on a mission to Constantinople, and, having joined Lord Hood
                    at Toulon from Smyrna in December 1793, he burnt the enemy’s ships and arsenal.
                    In the following years he cleared the Channel of French privateers; but, having
                    with the boats of his squadron boarded in Havre-de-Grâce harbour a lugger which
                    was driven by the tide above the French forts, he was on 19th April 1796
                    compelled to surrender and sent a prisoner to Paris. By means of forged orders
                    for his removal to another prison he made his escape from the Temple, and,
                    crossing the Channel in a small skiff picked up at Havre, arrived in London on
                    8th May 1798. In October he was sent as plenipotentiary to Constantinople.
                    Learning of Buonaparte’s approach to St Jean d’Acre, he hastened to its relief,
                    and on 16th March 1799 captured the enemy’s flotilla, after which he
                    successfully defended the town against several furious attacks of the French,
                    compelling Napoleon on 20th May to raise the siege and retreat in disorder,
                    leaving all his artillery behind. For this brilliant exploit he received the
                    special thanks of' the Houses of Parliament and was awarded an annuity of £1000.
                    Subsequently he co-operated with Abercromby, under whom he served as
                    brigadier-general at the battle of Aboukir, where he was wounded. On his return
                    to England he was in 1802 elected M.P. for the city of Rochester. In March 1803
                    he was commissioned to watch the preparations of the French for an invasion of
                    England. Having on 9th November 1805 been promoted to be rear-admiral of the
                    blue, he was in the following January despatched on secret service for the
                    protection of Sicily and Naples. He relieved Gaeta and captured Capri, but on
                    25th January 1807 received orders to proceed to Malta, whence he joined Sir John
                    Duckworth, who was sent to act against the Turks. On 7th February, with the rear
                    division of the squadron, he destroyed the Turkish fleet and spiked the
                    batteries off Abydos. In November following he was sent to blockade the Tagus
                    and was mainly instrumental in embarking the Portuguese prince regent and royal
                    family and sending them under safe protection to Rio de Janeiro, after which he
                    was sent as commander-in-chief to the coast of South America. On 31st July 1810
                    he was made vice-admiral of the blue and on 18th July 1812 was despatched as
                    second in command under Sir Edward Pellew to the Mediterranean, but the
                    expedition was uneventful. His term of active service practically closed in
                    1814. He was made K.C.B. in 1815 and in 1821 admiral. The later years of his
                    life were spent at Paris, where he died on 26th May 1840.</p>
