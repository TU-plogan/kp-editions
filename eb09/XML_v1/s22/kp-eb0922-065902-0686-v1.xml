                        (bilá kaifa). Freer allegorical views, however, were admitted on some
                        specially perplexing points, such as the doctrine of the eternity of the
                        Koran, the crude anthropomorphisms of the sacred text, &amp;c.; and, since
                        Mo'tazilite views had never taken deep root among the masses, while the
                        caliphs required the help of the clergy, and from the time of Motawakkil
                        (847 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> became ever more closely bound to
                        orthodox views, the freethinking tendency was thoroughly put down, and to
                        the present day no rationalizing movement has failed to be crushed in the
                        bud. Philosophy still means no more than scholastic dialectic, and is the
                        humble servant of orthodoxy, no man venturing on devious paths except in
                        secret. In the years 1872-78 the Afghan Jamál al-Dín, a professor in the
                        Azhar mosque at Cairo, attempted to read Avicenna with his scholars, and to
                        exercise them in things that went beyond theology, bringing, for example, a
                        globe into the mosque to explain the form of the earth. But the other
                        professors rose in arms, forbade him to enter the mosque, and in 1879
                        procured his exile on the pretext that he entertained democratic and
                        revolutionary ideas. Thus the later movements of thought in Islam never
                        touch on the great questions that exercised Mohammedanism in its first
                        centuries, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the being and attributes of God, the
                        freedom of the will, sin, heaven and hell, &amp;c. Religious earnestness,
                        ceasing to touch the higher problems of speculative thought, has expressed
                        itself in later times exclusively in protest against the extravagances of
                        the dervishes, of the worship of saints, and so forth, and has thus given
                        rise to movements analogous to Puritanism.</p>
                    <p>That even in early times the masses were never shaken in their attachment to
                        the traditional faith, with all its crude and grotesque conceptions, is due
                        to the zeal of the ulema, or clergy, for the protection of Islam from every
                        alien influence. Mohammedanism has no priesthood standing between God and
                        the congregation, but Koran and Sunna are full of minute rules for the
                        details of private and civil life, the knowledge of which is necessarily in
                        the hands of a class of professed theologians. These are the ' <hi
                        rend="italic">ulemá ("</hi> knowers,” singular ' <hi rend="italic"
                        >álim),</hi> theology being briefly named “the knowledge” (' <hi
                        rend="italic">ilm).</hi> Their influence is still enormous and hardly has a
                        parallel in the history of religions. For it is not supported by temporal
                        agencies like the spiritual authority of the Christian priesthood in the
                        Middle Ages, but is a pure power of knowledge over the ignorant masses, who
                        do nothing without consulting their spiritual advisers. When the vigorous
                        Spanish sultan Manṣúr b. Abí 'Ámir proposed to confiscate a religious
                        foundation and the assembled ulema refused to approve the act, and were
                        threatened by his vizier, one of them replied, “All the evil you say of us
                        applies to yourself; you seek unjust gains and support your injustice by
                        threats; you take bribes and practise ungodliness in the world. But we are
                        guides on the path of righteousness, lights in the darkness, and bulwarks of
                        Islam; we decide what is just or unjust and declare the right; through us
                        the precepts of religion are maintained. We know that the sultan will soon
                        think better of the matter; but, if he persists, every act of his government
                        will be null, for every treaty of peace and war, every act of sale and
                        purchase, is valid only through our testimony.” With this answer they left
                        the assembly, and the sultan’s apology overtook them before they had passed
                        the palace gate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Von

                        authority and strength still survives among the ulema. Thus the sheikhu
                        'l-Islám 'Abbásí (who was deposed by the professors of the Azhar in 1882)
                        had in the first period of his presidency a sharp conflict with 'Abbás
                        Pasha, viceroy of Egypt, who asked of him an unjust legal opinion in matters
                        of inheritance. When bribes and threats failed, the sheikh was thrown into
                        chains and treated with great severity, but it was the pasha who finally
                        yielded, and 'Abbásí was recalled to honours and rich rewards.</p>
                    <p>The way in which the ulema are recruited and formed into a hierarchy with a
                        vigorous <hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi> throws an instructive light
                        on the whole subject before us. The brilliant days are past when the
                        universities of Damascus, Baghdád, Níshápúr, Cairo, Ḳairowán (Kairwan),
                        Seville, Cordova, were thronged by thousands of students of theology, when a
                        professor had often hundreds or even, like Bokhárí, thousands of hearers,
                        and when vast estates in the hands of the clergy fed both masters and
                        scholars. Of the great universities but one survives—the Azhar mosque at
                        Cairo—where thousands of students still gather to follow a course of study
                        which gives an accurate picture of the Mohammedan ideal of theological
                        education.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of the
                        126 madrasa or colleges which once belonged to the university of Damascus
                        but five remained in 1880.</p></note></p>
                    <p>The students of theology generally begin their course in early youth, but not
                        seldom in riper years. Almost all come from the lowest orders, a few from
                        the middle classes, and none from the highest ranks of society,—a fact which
                        in itself excludes all elements of freer and more refined education. These
                        sons of poor peasants, artisans, or tradesmen are already disposed to narrow
                        fanaticism, and generally take up study as a means of livelihood rather than
                        from genuine religious interest. The scholar appears before the president’s
                        secretary with his poor belongings tied up in a red handkerchief, and after
                        a brief interrogatory is entered on the list of one of the four orthodox
                        rites,— Sháfi'ite, Ḥanafite, Málikite, and Ḥanbalite. If he is lucky he gets
                        a sleeping-place within the mosque, a chest to hold his things, and a daily
                        ration of bread. The less fortunate make shift to live outside as best they
                        can, but are all day in the mosque, and are seldom deserted by Moslem
                        charity. Having kissed the hands of the sheikh and teachers of his school,
                        the pupil awaits the beginning of the lectures. For books a few compendiums
                        suffice him. Professors and students gather every morning for the daily
                        prayer; then the professors take their seats at the foot of the pillars of
                        the great court and the students crouch on mats at their feet. The beginner
                        takes first a course in the grammar of classical Arabic, for he has hitherto
                        learned only to read, write, and count. The rules of grammar are read out in
                        the memorial verses of the Ajrúmíya, and the teacher adds an exposition,
                        generally read from a printed commentary. The student’s chief task is to
                        know the rules by heart; this accomplished, he is dismissed at the end of
                        the year with a certificate <hi rend="italic">(ijáza),</hi> entered in his
                        text-book, which permits him to teach it to others. The second year is
                        devoted to dogmatic (<hi rend="italic">kalám</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >tawḥíd),</hi> taught in the same mechanical way. The dogmas of Islam are
                        not copious, and the attributes of God are the chief subject taken up. They
                        are demonstrated by scholastic dialectic, and at the end of his second year
                        the student, receiving his certificate, deems himself a pillar of the faith.
                        The study of law (<hi rend="italic">fiḳh),</hi> which rests on Koran and
                        tradition, is more difficult and complex, and begins, but is often not
                        completed, in the third year. The student had learned the Koran by heart at
                        school and has often repeated it since, but only now is the sense of its
                        words explained to him. Of the traditions of the Prophet he has learned
                        something incidentally in other lectures; he is now regularly introduced to
                        their vast and artificial system. From these two sources are derived all
                        religious and civil laws, for Islam is a political as well as a religious
                        institution. The five main points of religious law, “the pillars of Islam,”

                        had some influence, is treated under heads similar to those of Western
                        jurisprudence. It is here that the differences between the four schools
                        (vol. xvi. p. 594 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> come most into notice: the
                        Ḥanafite praxis is the least rigorous, then the Sháfi'ite; the Ḥanbalites,
                        whose system is the strictest, have practically disappeared in the
                        Málikites. The Ḥanafite rite is official in the Turkish empire, and is
                        followed in all Government offices whenever a decision still depends on the
                        sacred law, as well as by all Mohammedans of Turkish race. In Egypt and
                        North Africa Sháfi'ites are more numerous than Málikites, while the opposite
                        is the case in Arabia. In 1878 the Azhar had 7691 students,—3723 Sháfi'ites
                        with 106 sheikhs, 2855 Málikites with 75 sheikhs, 1090 Ḥanafites with 49
                        sheikhs, 23 Ḥanbalites with 1 sheikh. In this as in the previous studies a
                        compendium is learned by heart, and explanations are given from commentaries
                        and noted down by the students word for word. The professors are expressly
                        forbidden to add anything of their own. The recognized books of
                        jurisprudence, some of which run to over twenty folio volumes, are vastly
                        learned, and occasionally show sound sense, but excel mainly in useless
                        hair-splitting and feats of scholastic gymnastics, for which the Arabian
                        race has a natural gift.</p>
                    <p>Besides the three main disciplines the student takes up according to his
                        tastes other subjects, such as rhetoric <hi rend="italic">(ma'ání
                        wabayán),</hi> logic <hi rend="italic">(mantik),</hi> prosody <hi
                        rend="italic">('arúḍ),</hi> and the doctrine of the correct pronunciation of
                        the Koran <hi rend="italic">(ḳirá'a watajwíd).</hi> After three or four
                        years, fortified with the certificates of his various professors, he seeks a
                        place in a law-court or as a teacher, preacher, cadi, or mufti of a village
                        or minor town, or else one of the innumerable posts of confidence for which
                        the complicated ceremonial of Mohammedanism demands a theologian, and which
                        are generally paid out of pious foundations. A place is not hard to find,
                        for the powerful corporation of the ulema seeks to put its own members into
                        all posts, and, though the remuneration is at first small, the young ‘álim
                        gradually accumulates the revenues of several offices. Gifts, too, fall in,
                        and with his native avarice and economy he rises in wealth, position, and
                        reputation for piety. The commonalty revere him and kiss his hand; the rich
                        show him at least outward respect; and even the Government treats him as a
                        person to whom consideration is due for his influence with the masses.</p>
                    <p>This sketch of his education is enough to explain the narrow-mindedness of
                        the 'álim. He deems all non-theological science to be vain or hurtful, has
                        no notion of progress, and regards true science— <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> theology—as having reached finality, so that a new
                        supercommentary or a new students’ manual is the only thing that is perhaps
                        still worth writing. How the mental faculties are blunted by scholasticism
                        and mere memory work must be seen to be believed; such an education is
                        enough to spoil the best head. All originality is crushed out and a blind
                        and ludicrous dependence on written tradition—even in things profane— takes
                        its place. Acuteness degenerates into hair-splitting and clever plays on
                        words after the manner of the rabbins. The Azhar students not seldom enter
                        Government offices and even hold important administrative posts, but they
                        never lose the stamp of their education—the narrow un-teachable spirit,
                        incapable of progress, always lost in external details, and never able to

                        Neither Koran nor Sunna distinguishes between temporal and spiritual powers,
                        and no such distinction was known as long as the caliphs acted in all things
                        as successors of the prophets and heads of the community of the faithful.
                        But, as the power of the 'Abbásids declined (see vol. xvi. p. 585 <hi
                        rend="italic">sq.)</hi> and external authority fell in the provinces into
                        the hands of the governors and in the capital into those of the <hi

                        palpable, especially when the Búyids (Buwaihids), who were disposed to
                        Shi'ite views, proclaimed themselves sultans, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                        possessors of all real authority. The theologians tried to uphold the
                        orthodox theory by declaring the sultanate to be subordinate to the imámate
                        or sovereignty of the caliphs, and dependent on the latter especially in all
                        religious matters; but their artificial theories have never modified facts.
                        The various dynasties of sultans (Búyids, Ghaznevids, Seljùḳs, and finally
                        the Mongols) never paid heed to the caliphs and at length abolished them;
                        but the fall of the theocracy only increased the influence of the clergy,
                        the expounders and practical administrators of that legislation of Koran and
                        Sunna which had become part of the life of the Mohammedan world. The
                        Mamelukes in Egypt tried to make their own government appear more legitimate
                        by nominally recognizing a continuation of the spiritual dignity of the
                        caliphate in a surviving branch of the 'Abbásid line which they protected,
                        and in 923 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (1517) the Ottoman Selim, who
                        destroyed the Mameluke power, constrained the 'Abbásid Mutawakkil III., who
                        lived in Cairo, to make over to him his nominal caliphate. The Ottoman
                        sultans still bear the title of “successors of the Prophet,” and still find
                        it useful in foreign relations, since there is or may be some advantage in

                        something perhaps to his spiritual title. But among his own subjects he is
                        compelled to defer to the ulema and has no considerable influence on the

                        is self-propagating, and palace intrigues, though not without influence, can
                        never break through its iron bonds. The deposition of ‘Abd al-Αζίζ is an

                        himself. For example, a dispute between master and slave may be found by the
                        cadi to turn on the general question, “Has Zaid, the master of 'Amr,<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Zaid and 'Amr are the
                        Caius and Sempronius of Arabian law.</p></note> the absolute right to
                        dispose of his slave’s earnings?” When this is put to the mufti, the answer
                        will be simply “Yes,” and from this decision there is no appeal, so that the
                        mufti is supreme judge in his own district. The grand mufti of
                        Constantinople is, as we have seen, nominated by the sultan, but his hold on
                        the people makes him quite an independent power in the state; in Cairo he is
                        not even nominated by the Government, but each school of law chooses its own
                        sheikh, who is also mufti, and the Ḥanafite is head mufti because his school
                        is official in the Turkish empire.</p>
                    <p>All this gives the judges great private and political influence. But the
                        former is tainted by venality, the plague-spot of the East, which,
                        aggravated by the scantiness of judicial salaries or in some cases by the
                        judge having no salary at all, is almost universal among the administrators
                        of justice. Their political influence, again, which arises from the fusion
                        of private and political law in Koran and Sunna, is highly inconvenient to
                        the state, and often becomes intolerable now that relations with Western
                        states are multiplied. And even in such distant parts as Central Asia the
                        law founded on the conditions of the Prophet’s lifetime proves so unsuited
                        to modern life that cases are often referred to civil authorities rather
                        than to canonical jurists. Thus a customary law (' <hi rend="italic"
                        >orf)</hi> has there sprung up side by side with the official sacred law
                        (<hi rend="italic">sharí'a</hi>), much to the displeasure of the mollahs. In
                        Turkey, and lately above all in Egypt, it has been found necessary greatly
                        to limit the sphere and influence of the canonical jurists and introduce
                        institutions nearer to Western legal usage. We do not here speak of the
                        paper constitutions (<hi rend="italic">khutt-i-sheríf)</hi> and the like,
                        created to dupe Western diplomatists and amuse their authors, but of such
                        things as consular and commercial courts, criminal codes, and so forth. The
                        present sultan seems also to aim at diminishing the power of the ulema by
                        such measures as frequent changes of the sheikhu 'l-islám, though this
                        policy is perhaps less likely to confirm his power than to rob it of its
                        last supports.</p>
                    <p>The official hierarchy, strong as it is, divides its power with the
                        dervishes. A religion which subdues to itself a race with strongly marked
                        individuality is always influenced in cultus and dogma by the previous views
                        and tendencies of that race, to which it must in some measure accommodate
                        itself. Mohammed himself made a concession to heathen traditions when he
                        recognized the Kaaba and the black stone; and the worship of saints, which
                        is now spread throughout Islam and supported by obviously forged traditions,
                        is an example of the same thing. So too are the religious orders now found
                        everywhere except in some parts of Arabia. Mystical tendencies in
                        Mohammedanism arose mainly on Persian soil (see vol. xvi. p. 594), and Von
                        Kremer has shown that these Eastern tendencies fell in with a disposition to
                        asceticism and flight from the world which had arisen among the Arabs before
                        Islam under Christian influence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Op. cit.,</hi> p. 52 <hi rend="italic"
                        >sq.</hi></p></note> Intercourse with India had given Persian mysticism the
                        form of Buddhistic monkery, while the Arabs imitated the Christian
                        anchorites; thus the two movements had an inner kinship and an outer form so
                        nearly identical that they naturally coalesced, and that even the earliest
                        organizations of orders of dervishes, whether in the East or the West,
                        appeared to Mohammedan judgment to be of one type. Thus, though the name of
                        <hi rend="italic">Sufi</hi> (see vol. xvi. p. 594) is first applied to Abú
                        Háshim, who died in Syria in 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (767), we
                        find it transferred without question to the mystical brotherhood which
                        appears in Khorásán under Abú Sa'íd about 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi>
                        (815/6). Yet these two schools of Ṣúfís were never quite similar; on Sunnite
                        soil Ṣúfism could not openly impugn orthodox views, while in Persia it was
                        saturated with Shi'ite heresy and the pantheism of the extreme devotees of
                        'All (see vol. xvi. p. 593). Thus there have always been two kinds of Ṣúfís,
                        and, though the course of history and the wandering habits which various
                        orders borrowed from Buddhism have tended to bring them closer to one
                        another, we still find that of the thirty-six chief orders three claim an
                        origin from the caliph Abú-bekr, whom the Sunnites honour, and the rest from
                        'Alí, the idol of the Shi'ites.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>These claims to early origin are mere fables, like the

                        God, with an increasing tendency to Pantheism and ascetic practices, are the
                        main scope of all Ṣúfism, which is not necessarily confined to members of
                        orders; indeed the secret practice of contemplation of the love of God and
                        contempt of the world is sometimes viewed as specially meritorious. And so
                        ultimately the word <hi rend="italic">ṣúfi</hi> has come to denote all who
                        have this religious direction, while those who follow the special rules of
                        an order are known as dervishes (“beggars,” in Arabic <hi rend="italic"
                        >fuḳará, sing fakir—</hi> names originally designating only the mendicant
                        orders). In Persia at the present day a Ṣúfí is much the same as a
                        freethinker. Several of the chief dervish orders arose in the evil times
                        before and after the invasion of the Mongols: thus 'Abd al-Ḳádir al-Jílání
                        (d. 561 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.;</hi> 1165/66) founded the Ḳádíríya order,
                        Ahmad al-Rifá’í (d. 578 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi>; 1182/3) the
                        Rifá’íya, Jalálu Ί-din Rúmí (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rúmí)</hi> the

                        1258) the Shádhilíya, Ahmad al-Badawí (d. 675 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.h.;</hi> 1276) the Aḥmadíya or Badawíya, an order still very widely
                        spread in Egypt. While civil distress drove men to flee from the world, the

                    <p>The modern dervishes have sunk as low as the modern ulema. The idea of
                        absorbed contemplation of the divine being, freed from all earthly
                        conceptions, and of mortification of the flesh in order to become one with
                        God is grossly caricatured in the insane howlings <hi rend="italic">hu

                        Mawlawiya. Very pestilent too is their traditional reputation for holiness
                        with the common people, while ecstatic piety easily passes into deceit where
                        it is still generally believed that a saint (<hi rend="italic">walí</hi>)
                        can work miracles. The wandering dervishes especially, who move constantly
                        from place to place, are noted for all sorts of juggling impostures, by the
                        aid of which, like the Yogis of India, they live at the cost of the
                        people.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These
                        mendicants belong in part to orders like the Bektashíya and Rifá’íya, whose
                        other members live in convents (Khangah, Takíya); in part they are
                        Kalanderíya (Calanders), <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> bound by the rule of
                        Kalander, a disciple of Bektash, which enjoins constant
                        wandering.</p></note> But they are no longer trusted or held in much esteem
                        even by the populace, whereas the conventual orders are usually regarded as
                        pious and inspired men. Sheikh Ahmad, the founder of the Badawíya, is the
                        national saint of Egypt, and his tomb at Tanta is a great place of
                        pilgrimage. The ulema dislike these rivals, but can do little against their
                        influence.</p>
                    <p>The bright side in the modern world of Islam is found among the lower
                        classes. The ruling classes of Turkey are utterly corrupt, and for centuries
                        their one art of administration has been to suck the provinces dry. Taxes
                        are exorbitant and bad laws check the production of wealth, while what
                        remains of the useful institutions and public works of old time daily
                        decays. . To this is added the recklessness born of a more or less clear
                        consciousness that things cannot last as they are. The effendi of
                        Constantinople has lost faith in his religion and the future of his race; as
                        for a sense of honour, as we understand it, that does not exist in the East.
                        In Egypt things have not been quite so bad since Mohammed 'Alí destroyed the
                        Mamelukes and founded a state with some pretensions to order and solidity;
                        selfish as he was, he saw that to maintain the revenue it was necessary to
                        stimulate production, and to this end, amid many mistakes, he took not a few
                        useful steps. His successors were less wise and skilful, yet prosperity
                        increased, and for the first time for centuries national feeling began to
                        assert itself. But this movement fell into the hands of the ignorant and
                        fanatical 'Orábí Pasha (1882) and led to the English occupation and the
                        entire disorganization of the country, so that Cairo is now little better
                        than Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>Yet with all this the poorer classes have not lost their vigour, and among
                        them Islam has still a deep-rooted strength. The common Turk of Roumelia or
                        Asia Minor is still a solid sober honest fellow and a brave soldier, always
                        ready to make every sacrifice for his religion. In Egypt the morality of the
                        people has suffered from the great foreign immigration, which has introduced
                        many evil elements as well as some good; yet even here the great mass of
                        both townsmen and peasants are loyal to the old faith and to the traditional
                        sobriety and parsimony which the nature of the country itself prescribes.
                        These qualities taken with the undoubted intelligence of the Arabian
                        population give hope of a revival of prosperity on the Nile under more
                        favourable political conditions. The people have a persuasion of the
                        superiority of their religion, which, while it often makes necessary reforms
                        difficult, prevents them from losing national individuality and
                        self-reliance, and the belief in predestination gives a certain dignity and
                        self-possession under calamities, without excluding foresight and activity
                        in daily duty. But whether all this is enough to secure the political
                        revival of the Sunnite commonwealths is doubtful in face of the
                        preponderating influence on all the coasts of the Levant of Western
                        civilization, w’hich as yet is almost entirely a disintegrating force and
                        seems certain to prevent a redintegration of Islam in Turkey, and probably
                        also in Egypt. The khanates, again, are sunk in incredible moral corruption
                        cloaked by blind fanaticism, while most of the Bedouin tribes of Arabia have
                        known little about Koran and religion for the last eight centuries.<note

                        lay no stress on the existence of various sects opposed to the current
                        Sunnite orthodoxy, such as the puritanical Wahhabites of Arabia and India,

                    <p>It was through the moderate Shi'ites that the caliph Ma’mún thought to
                        reconcile his dynasty with the house of 'Alí (vol. xvi. p. 584), and it was
                        this party that became dominant in Persia in the 10th Christian century
                        under the Búyids. When they conquered Baglidád the Búyids abstained from
                        interfering with the Sunnite orthodoxy of the populations of the capital and
                        Arabian 'Irak, but the Shi'ite faith was openly professed in their courts at
                        Rai, Shiráz, and Kirmán. But in the next century the power of the Shi'ite
                        dynasty crumbled and fell before the Ghaznevids and Seljúḳs, who as Turks
                        were Sunnites, and repressed the opposing views. In the 13th century the

                        Tímúr (1387), who veiled his religious indifference by proclaiming himself
                        an admirer of 'All. Thus the mass of the Persian population remained
                        Shi'ites, and the Tímúrides accommodated themselves to the religious
                        feelings of their subjects. Tímúr’s son, Shúh Rokh, even built and furnished
                        forth the tomb of the imám Riẓá in Meshhed (Meshed). The troublous times

                        Samarra and would return at the end of days. Meantime the sovereignty
                        belongs to the other descendants of 'Ali, the Sayyids (lords). In fact the
                        Safawis claimed descent from the seventh imám, and neither the Afghan Nadir
                        Sháh, who overthrew their power, nor the Kajars, who now reign, are regarded

                        'Ali at Nejef, of Hosain at Kerbelá, of Riẓá at Meshhed, or of the
                        “unstained Fátima” at Kum (Fâtima-i-ma’aṣúm, daughter of Músá, the 7th
                        imám). The Shi'ites are much the most zealous of Moslems in the worship of
                        saints (real or supposed descendants of 'Alí) and in pilgrimages to their
                        graves, and they have a characteristic eagerness to be buried in those holy
                        places. The Persians have an hereditary love for pomps and festivities, and
                        so the Shi'ites have devised many religious feasts. Of these the great
                        sacrificial feast <hi rend="italic">('íid-i-Ḳurbán</hi>; Turkish <hi
                        rend="italic">Ḳurbán Bairám)</hi> is also Sunnite; the first ten days of the
                        month Moḥarram are dedicated to the mourning for the death of Hosain at
                        Kerbelá (vol. xvi. p. 568), which is celebrated by passion-plays <hi
                        rend="italic">(ta'zíya;</hi> see vol. xviii. p. 660), while the universal
                        joy of the Nauroz, or the New Year of the Old Persian calendar, receives a
                        Mohammedan sanction by the tradition that on this day the Prophet conferred
                        the caliphate on 'Alí.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    <p>While they naturally reject the four Sunnite schools of jurisprudence, the
                        Shi'ites also derive all law from the Koran, and their trained clergy
                        (mollahs) are the only class that can give legitimate legal responses. The
                        training of the mollah resembles that of the Sunnite 'álim. The course at
                        the madrasa embraces grammar, with some rhetoric and prosody, logic,
                        dogmatic, Koran exegesis, tradition, and jurisprudence, and finally some
                        arithmetic and algebra. The best madrasa is at Kerbelâ.<note anchored="true"

                        the beginning of the 19th century there were but five mujtehids in Persia;
                        now (1887) they seem to be more numerous. In Persia the cadi <hi

                        l'-Islám in special cases, and a mufti is a solicitor acting under the judge

                    <p>Under the Safawis, when the clergy had great influence, they had at their

                        foundations and was the highest judicial authority. But so great a power was
                        found dangerous; 'Abbás the Great (1586-1628) abstained from filling up a
                        vacancy which occurred in it, and, though Sháh Sefí (1628-1641) restored the
                        office, he placed it in commission. Nádir Sháh abolished it in his attempt
                        to get rid of the Shi'ite hierarchy (1736), and since then it has not been
                        restored. Yet the imám-jum'a of Ispáhán, the old Safawi capital, is tacitly
                        regarded as representative of the invisible imám of the house of 'Ali, who
                        is the true head of the church. Various vain attempts have been made in the
                        19th century to subordinate the authority of the clergy to the Government.
                        These attempts had the sympathy of the better classes,<pb break="no"

                        mollahs and their disposition to the most vulgar fraud are proverbial. But,
                        on the other hand, the clerical power and the right of asylum at Meshhed,
                        Ḳum, and some other sanctuaries are the only protection of the masses
                        against the arbitrary tyranny of the court and the officials. There is now a
                        sort of truce between the Government and the clergy, though the former is
                        always suspicious of the latter. Only the venality of the spiritual courts
                        has led, as in Turkestan, to a limitation of their jurisdiction, and
                        judicial decisions are given also by civil magistrates according to ' <hi
                        rend="italic">orf</hi> or customary law and, although their decisions are
                        often arbitrary, they are commonly resorted to in cases affecting property,
                        in which the spiritual judge would think it his duty to “eat up” the sum in
                        dispute. The main prop of the mollahs against the Government are the scum of
                        the population, the <hi rend="italic">lúṭís</hi> or foul rowdies. In 1862,
                        according to Vámbéry, the imám-jum'a of Ispáhán had at his orders a thousand
                        of these scoundrels.</p>
                    <p>The rivals of the clergy in popular influence are the dervishes, whose show
                        of holiness cloaks an immorality and propensity to crime far exceeding what
                        is found among their brethren in Egypt and Turkey. So it has been for
                        centuries, as appears in Olearius’s account of the Calanders of his time
                        (1637). Supported by popular superstition, the Persian dervishes are much
                        more pretentious than those of the West. At the great feasts especially they
                        quarter themselves impudently in wealthy houses and deafen the indwellers
                        with their unceasing cry of <hi rend="italic">Yá ḥaḳḳ</hi> (“O Truth !” the
                        mystical equivalent of “O God! ”). The wise and modest dervish who in
                        Sa'di’s poems tells the greatest sultan the truth as to the hollowness of
                        his royal state has degenerated into the half-mad and insolent hanger-on who
                        thrusts himself into audience-chambers and claims the seat of honour beside
                        the grandees. The multitude of these motley vagabonds, some harmless, others
                        dangerous, is explained by the love for idleness, buffoonery, and
                        story-telling, which is even more marked in Persia than in other parts of
                        the East.</p>
                    <p>The great practical difference between the Sunnite and Shi'ite communities is
                        that among the former it is only with the upper classes, who are few in
                        number, and with the worse sort of dervishes that obedience to the precepts
                        of religion is a mere formal profession. Most of the ulema and the middle
                        and lower classes are sincere Moslems. In Persia it is the other way; the
                        praise of religion is always on men’s lips, but the inner conviction is that
                        it is all a mockery. The clergy laugh inwardly at their own functions; the
                        educated classes either believe nothing at all or hold secretly to a Ṣúfí
                        pantheism. Sa'di and Háfiz are much more to them than the Koran; and, while
                        the Sunnite takes his <hi rend="italic">sortes biblicae</hi> from the Koran,
                        the Shi'ite uses a copy of the songs of Ḥâfiz. With the common people it is
                        not the proper precepts of Islam, but the Shi'ite tenets directed against
                        Sunnites and Jews, that find hearty adherence. The death-feast of Hasan and
                        Hosain excites them far more than the great sacrificial feast; and 'Alí, the
                        national saint, is much more popular than Mohammed. Islam, as it was forced
                        on Persia by Omar, was the faith of foreign conquerors and oppressors; and
                        the people have revenged themselves by travestying it and veiling their old
                        convictions under its outward forms. And so Islam has never had any
                        considerable influence on conduct save that it has confirmed the natural
                        turn of the Persians for lying and hypocrisy. As it was long necessary to
                        profess orthodoxy for fear of the Arabs, it came to be an established
                        Shi'ite doctrine that it is lawful to deny one’s faith in case of danger.
                        This “caution” (<hi rend="italic">taḳíya)</hi> or “concealment” <hi
                        rend="italic">(ketman}</hi> has become a second nature with the Persians.
                        And with this it goes that no one shrinks from secret sins, though outwardly
                        professing the utmost devotion. The preparation of wine and spirits, for
                        example, is confined to Jews and Armenian Christians, but private
                        drunkenness is most common. Very conscientious or pious people, however— <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the dervishes—use rather opium or <hi rend="italic"
                        >hashish</hi> and confound the narcotic intoxication with mystic ecstasy.
                        Another mischievous thing is the permission of temporary
                        marriages,—marriages for a few hours on a money payment. This legitimized
                        harlotry <hi rend="italic">(mot'a)</hi> is forbidden by the Sunna, but the
                        Shi'ites allow it, and the mollahs adjust the contract and share the women’s
                        profits.</p>
                    <p>With all this, modern observers are agreed that the middle and lower classes
                        of Persia are not hopeless, and that their natural intelligence, though
                        combined with lack of perseverance, would make it much easier for them than
                        for the Turks to take a new start if they were freed from the wretched civil
                        and ecclesiastical administration. There is still mental life and vigour
                        among them, as appears— though in an unfavourable aspect—among the sects,
                        which, allowance being made for “takiya,” play no inconsiderable part. The
                        Akhbárís (traditionalists), who adopt a semi-philosophical way of explaining
                        away the plainest doctrines (such as the resurrection of the flesh) on the
                        authority of false traditions of 'Alí, are not so much a sect as a school of
                        theology within the same pale as the orthodox Shí'a or <hi rend="italic"

                        (comp. vol. xviii. p. 651). As early as 1837 a young enthusiast, 'Ali (son

                        zealous propaganda. Consistently enough with ultra-Shí'ite principles, he

                        the twelfth imám, issued from his obscurity to lead the world to salvation.
                        He took the title of Báb al-dín (“portal of the faith”), and his followers
                        are known as Bábís. Báb was a man of profound sincerity and averse to
                        violent measures; he avoided all open polemic against the Government, which
                        in turn at first tolerated him in its jealousy of the clergy. In 1844 the
                        too great zeal of his follower Mollah Hosain occasioned Báb’s imprisonment;
                        but Hosain and his emissaries continued the propaganda and made many

                        open rebellion in Mazenderán. Terrible conflicts ensued, made only more
                        bitter by the execution of Báb (18th July 1849). Apparently suppressed, the
                        movement proved that it was not extinct in an attempt to assassinate the
                        sháh in 1852. A new proscription followed; but there is no doubt that Bábism
                        still lives in secrecy, and the universal sympathy<pb break="no"

                    <p>Despite their mutual feuds, Sunnites aud Shi’ites are at one in their hatred
                        and contempt for the professors of other religions. Holding that faith and
                        unbelief are matter of predestination, Islam is not given to forcible
                        proselytizing, and on certain conditions Christians and Jews (and later on
                        Zoroastrians also) have always been tolerated in the Mohammedan empire,
                        except that 'Omar, mainly on political grounds, expelled all non-Moslems
                        from Arabia. But none the less the adherents of other faiths are hated and
                        despised as children of hell and enemies of true religion. To reconcile the
                        present decay of Islam and prosperity of the unbeliever with their feelings
                        and convictions, Sunnites and Shi'ites alike take refuge in the doctrine of
                        a restoration of Islam before the end of the world through the “divinely
                        guided” Mahdi. In view of the interest in the subject excited by recent
                        events, some addition may here be made to the brief statement in the article

                        Originally, as has been shown in that article, the idea of a god-sent
                        deliverer from the illegitimate caliphs was attached by the Shi'ites to
                        actual pretenders of the house of 'Alí; but later on, and especially since
                        the days of the Mongols, the figure of the Mahdi was projected into the far
                        future, and ultimately his arrival was made a sign of the end of the world.
                        Among the Sunnites, on the other hand, who could not accept the Shi'ite
                        pretenders, some of those who felt that the Omayyad sovereignty was not
                        truly spiritual and worthy of Islam borrowed the Christian hope of the
                        second coming of Christ, whom Islam acknowledges as a prophet and precursor
                        of Mohammed, and whose return at the end of the world seemed to accord with
                        some vague passages of the Koran; others looked, like the Shi'ites, for a
                        deliverer from earthly tyranny, but did not tie themselves to the belief
                        that he must spring from the house of 'Alí. When the theologians of 'Abbasid
                        times began to systematize the religious traditions they found some that
                        spoke of a return of Jesus and others referring to a Mahdi. These they
                        combined together, so that Sunnites now believe that, when unrighteousness
                        is at its height upon earth and the victory of the enemies of Islam seems
                        sure, the Mahdi will appear to destroy the unbelievers and establish God’s
                        kingdom on earth. Then the Antichrist <hi rend="italic">(dajjál)</hi> will
                        work new mischief, but be destroyed by Jesus, who appears as precursor of
                        the last judgment. Sunnite theologians have not all been at one in expecting
                        a Mahdi as well as Jesus, but this is the view generally current in recent
                        times; and Sunnites and Shi'ites are agreed that the Mahdi will destroy the
                        external foes of Islam, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>., all non-Mohammedan
                        powers. Theologians have tried by artificial interpretation of Koran and
                        Sunna to fix when and how the Mahdi is to appear, and have concluded that he
                        must be looked for at the close of a century. Of this widespread belief
                        Mohammed Ahmed, the Sudanese Mahdi, availed himself in coming forward in the
                        year 1300 of the Flight (1882-83). Theological opinion is so unsettled as to
                        all the details of the Mahdi’s work that, according to trustworthy
                        information, his death has not seriously impaired the impression produced by
                        his victories. In Mecca, for example, in 1885 it was commonly held to be
                        conceivable that the Sudanese fighting in his name might destroy England and
                        the Western powers; and it is possible that the belief in this latest Mahdi
                        has still an important part to play in the Eastern question. (A. MÜ.)</p>
