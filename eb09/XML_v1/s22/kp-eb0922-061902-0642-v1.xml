                    (1804-1859), generally known as <hi rend="smallcaps">Eugène Sue,</hi> French
                    novelist, ranked by some as the chief practitioner of the melodramatic style in
                    fiction, was born at Paris on 10th December 1804. Unlike most voluminous writers
                    of light literature, Sue was a man of fortune. He was the son of a surgeon in
                    Napoleon’s army, and is said to have had the empress Josephine for godmother.
                    But in later life he became something very different from a Bonapartist, and his
                    residence in Savoy for the last years of his life was due to his having been
                    banished from France after the <hi rend="italic">coup d’état.</hi> Until his
                    father’s death in 1828 Sue pursued the same profession and was present as a
                    surgeon both in the campaign undertaken by France in 1823 for the
                    re-establishment of royal power in Spain and at the battle of Navarino (1828).
                    His naval experiences supplied much of the materials of his first novels, <hi
                    rend="italic">Kemock le Pirate, Attar-Gull, La Salamandre, La Coucaratcha,</hi>
                    and others, which were composed at the height of the romantic movement of 1830,
                    and displayed its Byronic enthusiasm, its fancy for outlandish subjects and
                    names, and (in a very full measure) its extravagance. Then he took to more
                    serious work, writing a naval history of France of no merit. His next venture
                    was the historical or quasi-historical novel, in which style he composed <hi
                    rend="italic">Jean Cavalier</hi> (1840), besides other stories of adventure.
                    About this time he was strongly affected by the socialist ideas of the day, and
                    his attempt to display these in fiction produced (with others) his most famous
                    and perhaps best works,— <hi rend="italic">Les Mystères de Paris</hi> (1842) and
                    <hi rend="italic">Le Juif Errant</hi> (1844-45). These were among the most
                    popular specimens of the <hi rend="italic">roman-feuilleton,</hi> then at the
                    height of its popularity. The political and philosophical or
                    pseudo-philosophical “purpose” continuing to gain more and more ground on the
                    novelist’s art, he followed these up with divers singular and not very edifying
                    books, such as <hi rend="italic">Les Sept Peches Capitaux, Les Mystères du
                    Peuple,</hi> and several others, all on a very large scale, though the number of
                    volumes— ten, twelve, and sometimes even sixteen—gives rather an exaggerated
                    idea of their length. Some of his books, especially the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wandering Jew</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mysteries of Pams,</hi> were
                    dramatized by himself, usually in collaboration with others. His popularity was
                    immense, and, despite gross faults both of art and of morality (the latter
                    somewhat exaggerated in general estimation, at least when the work of his
                    successors is compared), he deserved that popularity in part. By an accident,
                    which is noteworthy in the case of other pairs of novelists (notably in those of
                    Thackeray and Dickens, and earlier of Fielding and Richardson), his period of
                    greatest success and popularity coincided with that of another writer, and he
                    has been even recently, and by not despicable authorities, compared with and
                    exalted above Alexandre Dumas. This is entirely unjust, for Sue has neither
                    Dumas’s wide range of subject, nor his genial humanity of tone, nor his interest
                    of character, nor, above all, his faculty of conducting the story by means of
                    lively dialogue; he has, however, a command of terror which Dumas seldom or
                    never attained, and which, melodramatic as he is, sometimes comes within
                    measurable distance of the sublime, while his “purpose” gives him a certain
                    energy not easily to be found elsewhere in novel-writing. From the purely
                    literary point of view his style is undistinguished, not to say bad, and his
                    construction loose and prolix. After the revolution of 1848 he sat for Paris
                    (the Seine) in the assembly from April 1850 until his exile as above-mentioned.
                    This exile rather stimulated than checked his literary production. The works of
                    his last days, however (the chief of which is perhaps <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Diable Médecin),</hi> are on the whole much inferior to those of his middle
                    period. Sue died at Annecy (Savoy) on 3d August 1859.</p>
