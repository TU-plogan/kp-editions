                <p><label type="entry">SPHINX</label>, a hybrid creature of Egyptian and Greek art
                    and mythology. In Egypt the sphinxes are colossal images of granite or porphyry,
                    with a human head and breast and the body of a lion (wingless) lying down. The
                    largest and most famous is that of Gizeh, described in vol. vii. p. 772. The
                    head of the sphinx is usually that of a man, but female heads are said to occur
                    occasionally. From Egypt the figure of the sphinx passed to Assyria, where it
                    appears with a bearded male head on cylinders; the female sphinx, lying down and
                    furnished with wings, is first found in the palace of Esarhaddon (7th century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> Sphinxes have been found in Phoenicia, one at
                    least being winged and another bearded. In Asia Minor an ancient female sphinx,
                    but wingless, stands on the sacred road near Miletus. Sphinxes of the usual
                    Greek type (female heads with bodies of winged lions) are represented seated on
                    each side of two doorways in an ancient frieze found by Sir Charles Fellowes at
                    Xanthus in Lycia, and now in the British Museum. The same type appears on the
                    early sculptures of the temple at Assus. In the early art of Cyprus—that
                    half-way house between Asia and Greece— sphinxes of this type are not uncommon.
                    On the other hand, on a gem of Phoenician style found at Curium in Cyprus there
                    appear two male (bearded) sphinxes, with the tree of life between them. With
                    regard to Greece proper, in the third tomb on the acropolis of Mycenae were
                    found six small golden sphinxes; they are beardless, but the sex is doubtful. In
                    the ancient tomb discovered in 1877 at Spata near Athens (which represents a
                    kindred but somewhat later art than the tombs at Mycenae) were found female
                    winged sphinxes carved in ivory or bone. Sphinxes on glass plates have been
                    found in graves at Camirus in Rhodes and on gold plates in Crimean graves.
                    Sphinxes were represented on the throne of Apollo at Amyclae; in the best period
                    of Greek art a sphinx was sculptured on the helmet of the statue of Athene in
                    the Parthenon at Athens; and sphinxes carrying off children were sculptured on
                    the front feet of the throne of Zeus at Olympia.</p>
                <p>In Greek mythology the most famous sphinx was that of Thebes in Bceotia. She is
                    first mentioned by Hesiod <hi rend="italic">(Theog.,</hi> 326), who calls her
                    the daughter of Orthus and Chimaera. According to Apollonius (iii. 5, 8), she
                    was the daughter of Typhon and Echidna, and had the face of a woman, the feet
                    and tail of a lion, and the wings of a bird. She dwelt on a bald rocky mountain
                    at the southeast corner of the Copaic lake; the name of the mountain was Phicium
                    (now Fagas), which was derived from Phix, the Aeolic form of sphinx. The Muses
                    taught her a riddle and the Thebans had to guess it. Whenever they failed she
                    carried one of them off and devoured him. The riddle was this: What is that
                    which is four-footed, three-footed, and two-footed? At last Oedipus guessed
                    correctly that it was man; for the child crawls on hands and feet, the adult
                    walks upright, and the old man supports his steps with a stick. Then the sphinx
                    threw herself down from the mountain.</p>
                <p>The story of the sphinx’s riddle first occurs in the Greek tragedians. Milchhöfer
                    believes that the story was a mere invention of Greek fancy, an attempt to
                    interpret the mysterious figure which Greek art had borrowed from the East. On
                    the other hand, he holds that the destroying nature of the sphinx was much
                    older, and he refers to instances in both Egyptian and Greek art where a sphinx
                    is seen seizing and standing upon a mail. And, whereas the Theban legend is but
                    sparingly illustrated in Greek art, the figure of the sphinx appears more
                    commonly on tombs, sculptured either in the round or in relief. From this
                    Milchhofer seems to infer that the sphinx was a symbol of death. The word
                    “sphinx” is Greek, being derived from <hi rend="italic">σφίγγειv,</hi> "to draw
                    tight.”</p>
