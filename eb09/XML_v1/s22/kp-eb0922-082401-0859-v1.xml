                <p>T <hi rend="subscript"> he</hi> literature of Syria, as known to us at the
                    present day, is, with the exception of translations from the Greek and some
                    other languages, a Christian literature. The writings of the Syrian heathens,
                    such as the so-called Sābians (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sabians)</hi> of Harrān,
                    which were extant, at least in part, even in the 13th century,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bar-Hebraeus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Chron. Syr.,</hi> ed. Bruns and Kirsch, p. 176; Chwolsohn, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ssabier und Ssabismus,</hi> i. 177.</p></note> seem to have now
                    wholly disappeared. The beginnings of this literature are lost in the darkness
                    of the earliest ages of Christianity. It was at its best from the 4th to the 8th
                    century, and then gradually died away, though it kept up a flickering existence
                    till the 14th century or even later. We must own —and it is well to make the
                    confession at the outset— that the literature of Syria is, on the whole, not an
                    attractive one. As Renan said long ago,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De Philosophia Peripatetica apud
                    Syros,</hi> 1852, p. 3.</p></note> the characteristic of the Syrians is a
                    certain mediocrity. They shone neither in war, nor in the arts, nor in science.
                    They altogether lacked the poetic fire of the older—we purposely emphasize the
                    word—the older Hebrews and of the Arabs. But they were apt enough as pupils of
                    the Greeks; they assimilated and reproduced, adding little or nothing of their
                    own. There was no Al-Fārābī, no Ibn Sīnā, no Ibn Rushd, in the cloisters of
                    Edessa, Ken-neshrē, or Nisibis. Yet to the Syrians belongs the merit of having
                    passed on the lore of ancient Greece to the Arabs, and therefore, as a matter of
                    history, their literature must always possess a certain amount of interest in
                    the eyes of the modern student. The Syrian Church never produced men who rose to
                    the level of a Eusebius, a Gregory Nazianzen, a Basil, and a Chrysostom; but we
                    may still be thankful to the plodding diligence which has preserved for us in
                    fairly good translations many valuable works of Greek fathers which would
                    otherwise have been lost. And even Syria’s humble chroniclers, such as John of
                    Ephesus, Dionysius of Tell-Mahrē, and Bar-Hebraeus, deserve their meed of
                    praise, seeing that, without their guidance, we should have known far less than
                    we now know about the history of two important branches of the Eastern Church,
                    besides losing much interesting information as to the political events of the
                    periods with which their annals are occupied.</p>
                <p>As Syriac literature commences with the Bible, we first briefly enumerate the
                    different versions of Holy Scripture.</p>
                <p>The most important of these is the so-called Pĕshīttā <hi rend="italic">(mappaktā

                    Old Testament, neither the exact time nor place of its translation is known;
                    indeed, from certain differences of style and manner in its several parts, we
                    may rather suppose it to be the work of different hands, extending over a
                    considerable period of time. It would seem, however, as a whole, to have been a
                    product of the 2d century, and not improbably a monument of the learning and
                    zeal of the Christians of Edessa. Possibly Jewish converts, or even Jews, took a
                    part in it, for some books (such as the Pentateuch and Job) are very literally
                    rendered, whereas the coincidences with the LXX. (which are particularly
                    numerous in the prophetical books) show the hand of Christian translators or
                    revisers. That Jews should have had at any rate a consultative share in this
                    work need not surprise us, when we remember that Syrian fathers, such as
                    Aphraates, in the middle of the 4th century, and Jacob of Edessa, in the latter
                    half of the 7th, had frequent recourse, like Jerome, to the scholars of the
                    synagogue. To what extent subsequent revision may have been carried it is not
                    easy to say; but it seems tolerably certain that alterations were made from time
                    to time with a view to harmonizing the Syriac text with that of the LXX. Such an
                    opportunity may, for instance, have been afforded on a considerable scale by the
                    adoption of Lucian’s text of the LXX. at Antioch in the beginning of the 4th
                    century (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Septuagint,</hi> vol. xxi. p. 669). On all
                    these points, however, we know nothing for certain, and may well repeat the
                    words of Theodore of Mopsuestia in his commentary on Zephaniah i. 6<note

                    in the opinion of these scholars, the solitary survival in our days. The
                    evidence for this view does not, however, appear to be conclusive. It seems that
                    a Syriac version of the four Gospels, as well as of the other parts of the New
                    Testament, must have existed in tho 2d century, perhaps even before the version
                    of the Old Testament. From this Tatian may have compiled his <hi rend="italic"

                    however, made use of the Separate Gospels. The former seems to have employed a
                    text which Baethgen calls a slightly revised form of Sc <hi rend="italic">(op.
                    cit.,</hi> p. 95); we would rather speak of it as a revised form of the old
                    Syriac Gospels of the 2d century. The latter made use of a more thorough
                    Edessene revision, closely approaching in form to, if not identical with, P
                    (Baethgen, p. 95; Zalin, p. 63). Our oldest MSS. of P are, however, more than a
                    hundred years later than Ephraim’s time. We cannot, therefore, expect very
                    important textual results from the collation of even such MSS. as Add. 14470,
                    14453, 14459, ff. 1-66, and 17117, in the British Museum, all of which may be
                    safely ascribed to the latter part of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th
                    century. Early in the 5th century Rabbūlā, bishop of Edessa, the friend and
                    correspondent of Cyril of Alexandria, occupied himself with “translating the New

                    as it was.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Overbeck,

                    as has been suggested by Nestle, that undertook a revision of the Syriac text
                    according to a Greek MS. or MSS. in his possession, that is to say, still
                    further assimilated P of that day to a Greek (possibly, from his connexion with
                    Cyril, Alexandrian) text. We do not as yet know, however, whether this revision
                    was merely a private effort, or what influence, if any, it exercised on the
                    history of P; more likely it was a first step in the direction of the
                    Philoxenian version (see below). The result of these successive revisions as
                    regards Sc has been that it survives in but one mutilated codex, and that
                    written at comparatively so late a date as 450-470,<note anchored="true"

                    Scriptures and their commentators. Such were the great “Persian school” of
                    Edessa, which was destroyed, on account of its Nestorian tendencies, in 489; the
                    school of Nisibis; of Mahōze near Seleucia; of the monastery of Dōr-Kōni or

                    The bare enumeration of the various psalters, lectionaries, missals, &amp;c.,
                    would far exceed our present limits. The oldest Syriac psalter in our European
                    collections is not earlier than 600 (Brit. Mus. Add. 17110), and the series of
                    lectionaries commences with the 9th century. Of anaphorae or liturgies it would
                    be easy to specify some sixty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Besides the versions of Holy Writ and other works enumerated above, the
                    literature of Syria comprises a vast amount of matter, interesting not merely to
                    the Orientalist but also to the classical scholar, the theologian, and the
                    historian. Some portions of this literature we must now endeavour to pass under

                    he spent at the court of Edessa; then he betook himself as a missionary to the
                    rude mountaineers of Armenia, and finally settled down in the fortress of Anium,

                    with another writer of the same period, 'Abhsamyā, a priest of Edessa, Ephraim’s
                    sister’s son and a pupil of Zenobius; but his reasons do not seem to us
                    sufficient. The <hi rend="italic">Chron. Edess. (Β.O.,</hi> i. 401) states that
                    'Abhsamyā composed his hymns and discourses on the invasion of the Huns in 404;
                    and Dionysius of Tell-Maḥrē <hi rend="italic">(B.O.,</hi> i. 169) speaks of him
                    in the year 397. Bar-Hebraeus is less precise as to the date: after mentioning
                    the death of Chrysostom (in 407), he adds that about this time Theodore of
                    Mopsuestia died (429) and 'Abhsamyā flourished, who “composed many discourses in
                    the (heptasyllabic) metre of Mär Ephraim” on the invasion of the Huns.<note

                    taken the name of Cyrillōnā at his ordination is of course possible, but it
                    seems strange that none of these three writers should have mentioned it, if such
                    were the case. On BarHebraeus’s statement regarding the metre which he used in
                    his discourses we do not insist; he might easily make a mistake in such a
                    matter.</p>
                <p>During the latter part of the 4th century, too, there lived in the island of
                    Cyprus the abbot Gregory, who appears to have been sent thither from some

                    monk named Theodore. To these are addressed several of his discourses and
                    letters; others are general exhortations to the monks under his charge.<note

                    letters he addresses Epiphanius as an older man speaking with authority to a

                    Nestorius. The doctrines of these writers were warmly espoused by many of the
                    Syrian theologians; and the warfare raged for many years in and around Edessa,
                    till it ended in the total destruction of the great Persian school by the order
                    of the emperor Zeno (488-489).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Ḳen-neshrīn, and Acacius, bishop of Aleppo. He voluntarily gave up all his
                    property, forsook his wife, and became a monk in the convent of Abraham near his
                    native city. On the death of Diogenes, bishop of Edcssa, he was appointed his
                    successor (411-412). His admiring biographer depicts him as a model bishop, and
                    he certainly appears to have been active and energetic in teaching and preaching

                    the theological disputes of the day he seems at first to have sided, if not with
                    Nestorius, at least with those who were averse to extreme measures, such as
                    John, patriarch of Antioch, and his partisans; but afterwards he joined the
                    opposite party, and became a warm champion of the doctrines of Cyril, which he
                    supported at the council of Edessa (431). From this time onward he was a staunch
                    opponent of Nestorianism, and even resorted to such an extreme measure as
                    burning the writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia. Hence Ibas in his letter to Mārī
                    speaks of him as “the tyrant of Edessa,” and Andrew of Samosata, writing to
                    Alexander of Hierapolis in 432, complains bitterly of his persecution of the

                    identical with Isaac, the disciple of Ephraim (as some have sup posed), seems

                    very doubtful, considering the date of his own death. Even Jacob of Edessa
                    appears to have got into some confusion on this subject (see Wright, <hi

                    Antioch, where he lived as priest and abbot of one of the many convents in its
                    immediate neighbourhood. In his younger days he would seem to have travelled
                    farther than most of his countrymen, as it is stated that he visited Rome and

                    Western capital. Isaac died in or about 460, soon after the destruction of

                <p>The Persian school at Edessa was, as we have already hinted, the chief seat of
                    the study of Greek during the early days of the Syrian literature. Of the most
                    ancient translators we know nothing; but the oldest MSS. are Edessene, viz., the
                    famous MS. in the British Museum, Add. 12150, dated towards the end of 411, and
                    the equally well known codex at St Petersburg, written in 462. The former
                    contains the <hi rend="italic">Recognitiones</hi> of Clement, the discourses of
                    Titus of Bostra against the Manichees, the <hi rend="italic">Theophania</hi> of
                    Eusebius, and his history of the confessors in Palestine; the latter, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi> of Eusebius. Now, as the text
                    presented by these MSS. has evidently passed through the hands of several
                    successive scribes, it seems to follow that these books were translated into
                    Syriac in the lifetime of the authors themselves, or very soon after, for
                    Eusebius died in 340 and Titus in 371. Very likely the one or the other may have
                    had a friend at the chief seat of Syriac learning who was willing to perform for
                    him the same kind office that Rabbūlā undertook for Cyril.<note anchored="true"

                    on with desperate fury alike at Constantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria. In
                    Syria the persecution of the Monophysites was violent during the years 518-521,
                    under the emperor Justin, and again in 535 and the following years, under

                    probably in the district of Sĕrūgh, in 451. His father was a priest, and, as his
                    parents had been childless for many years, his birth was regarded as a reward
                    for their alms, prayers, and vows. Whether he was educated at Edessa or not, he
                    soon acquired a great reputation for learning and eloquence. He appears to have
                    led a life of quiet work and study, and to have devoted himself in particular to
                    literary composition. He became periodeutes of Ḥaurā in Sĕrūgh, whence we find
                    him writing to the Christians of Najrān, and to the city of Edessa when
                    threatened by the Persians.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Antiochians, when I was in the convent of the blessed Mār Bassus, and again in
                    Antioch itself; and when I went up on two occasions to the capital, like things

                    defence of their faith, and, being favourably received by the empress Theodora,
                    they remained there fifteen years. Meantime the persecutions of the
                    Monophysites, more especially that of 536-537 by Ephraim of Antioch, seemed to
                    have crushed their party, despite all the efforts of the devoted John of Telia
                    and John of Hephaestus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> p. 176.</p></note> This state of matters
                    excited the religious zeal of al-Ḥārith ibn Jabalah, the Arab king of Ghassān,
                    who came to Constantinople in 542-543, and urged Theodora to send two or three
                    bishops to Syria. Accordingly two were consecrated by Theodosius, the exiled
                    patriarch of Alexandria, namely, Theodore as bishop of Bostra, with jurisdiction
                    over the provinces of Palestine and Arabia, and Jacob as bishop of Edessa, with
                    jurisdiction over all Syria and Asia. From this time forward Jacob’s life was
                    one of ceaseless toil and hardship. He visited in person and on foot almost
                    every part of his vast diocese, consecrating deacons and priests, strengthening
                    the weak, and bringing back those who had erred from the true faith. But to
                    restore the Monophysite Church bishops were necessary, and the consecration of a
                    bishop required the presence of at least three others. Selecting a priest named
                    Conon from Cilicia and another named Eugenius from Isauria, he travelled with
                    them to Constantinople and thence to Alexandria with letters of recommendation
                    from the patriarch Theodosius. At Alexandria Conon was ordained bishop of Tarsus
                    in Cilicia and Eugenius bishop of Seleucia in Isauria, whilst Antoninus and
                    Antonius were consecrated for dioceses in Syria. On his return to Syria other
                    bishops were appointed to sees there and in Asia, among the latter the historian
                    John of Ephesus; and so the work progressed, till at last Jacob’s efforts were
                    crowned by the enthroning of his old friend Sergius as patriarch of Antioch (in
                    544). Sergius died in 547, and the see remained vacant for three years, after
                    which, by the advice of Theodosius, Jacob and his bishops chose Paul, an abbot
                    of Alexandria, to be their patriarch. Of the subsequent internal strifes among
                    the Monophysites themselves we cannot here speak. The aged Jacob set out once
                    more in the year 578 to visit Damian, patriarch of Alexandria, but died on the
                    Egyptian frontier in the convent of Mär Romanus or of Casion. Here his remains
                    rested in peace till 622, when they were stolen by the emissaries of Zacchseus,
                    bishop of Tellā, and buried with much pomp in the monastery of Pĕsīltā.<note

                <p>Conspicuous among the scholars of this age for his knowledge of Greek, and more

                    protection of the empress Theodora. This alarmed Ephraim, who seems to have
                    found a willing tool in Sergius. At any rate he sent him to Rome with letters to
                    Agapetus, who travelled with him to Constantinople in the spring of 536, and
                    procured the deposition and banishment of the Monophysites. Sergius died at
                    Constantinople almost immediately afterwards, and Agapetus followed him in a few
                    days, wherein John of Ephesus and Zacharias Rhetor clearly see the judgment of

                    the emperor Basiliscus (Brit. Mus. Add. 475-477), who was a favourer of the
                    Monophysites; the Syriac translation is ascribed to a Monophysite monk of

                    of Taghrīth, where he ordained many priests and founded-two monasteries. Among
                    his numerous converts from heathenism was a youthful member of the royal family
                    of Persia, whom he baptized by the name of George. This excited the anger of
                    Khosrau I. Anōsharwān, who ordered the bishop to be beheaded (2d August 575). As

                    Orientals usually call him, Jovinian, under Julian and during his own reign. The
                    whole purports to be written by one Aplōris or Aplōlārīs (Apollinarius ?), an

                    but a very small quantity of historical facts or dates, and deal in the grossest
                    exaggerations and inventions. Yet the Syriac style is pure, and we gain from the

                    “that most of these histories were written at the very time when the persecution
                    was going on, and under the difficulties caused by its pressure; and it was even
                    necessary that friends should remove the leaves on which these chapters were
                    inscribed, and every other particle of writing, and conceal them in various
                    places, where they sometimes remained for two or three years. When therefore
                    matters occurred which the writer wished to record, it was possible that he
                    might have partly spoken of them before, but he had no papers or notes by which
                    to read and know whether they had been described or not. If therefore he did not
                    remember that he had recorded them, at some subsequent time he probably again
                    proceeded to their detail; and therefore occasionally the same subject is
                    recorded in more chapters than one; nor afterwards did he ever find a fitting
                    time for plainly and clearly arranging them in an orderly narrative.” Some of
                    the chapters are actually dated at various times from A.Gr. 886 (575 A.D.) to
                    896 (585). The time and place of his death are unknown, but he cannot have lived

                    by the facts of his citing Jacob of Sērūgh and corresponding with Simeon
                    Stylites the younger or Thaurnastorites, who died in 593. According to the
                    Arabic biography, printed in <hi rend="italic">B.O.,</hi> i. 444, he was a monk
                    of the convent of Mār Matthew at Mosul, and afterwards became bishop of that
                    city, but soon resigned his office and retired to the desert of Skētē in Egypt,
                    where he composed his ascetic works. According to 'Abhd-ishō' (<hi rend="italic"
                    >B.O.,</hi> iii. 1, 104), Isaac “wrote seven volumes on the guidance of the
                    Spirit, and on the Divine mysteries and judgements and dispensation.” Many of

                <p>Under Mār-abhā flourished Abraham of Kashkar (al-ΛVasit), distinguished for his
                    acquaintance with philosophy and for his ascetic virtues. He introduced certain
                    reforms into the Persian monasteries. After living for some time in a cave at

                    thence to Egypt. Returning to his old haunt, he led the life of a hermit for
                    thirty years, travelling into the far north as a missionary. He died at Hazzah,
                    but his body was secretly removed to his native place Kashkar. He wrote a
                    treatise on the monastic life, which was translated into Persian by his disciple
                    Job the monk.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The successor of Mār-abhā in the see of Seleucia was Joseph, in 552. He studied
                    medicine in the West and practised in Nisībis, where he lived in one of the
                    convents. Having been introduced by a Persian noble to the notice of Khosrau I.,
                    he cured that monarch of an illness, and ingratiated himself with him so much
                    that he favoured his appointment to the office of catholicus. Of his strange

                <p>During the second quarter of this century, from 633 to 636, the Muhammadan
                    conquest of Syria took place. The petty Arab kingdoms of the Lakhmites
                    (al-Ḥīrah), the ThaTabites and Kindites, and the Ghassānites, as well as the
                    wandering tribes of Mesopotamia, were absorbed; and the Persians were beaten
                    back into their own country, quickly to be overrun in its turn. The year 638
                    witnessed the last effort of the Greek empire to wrest Syria from the invaders;
                    the Muslim yoke was no longer to be shaken off. The effects of this conquest
                    soon begin to make themselves manifest in the literature of the country. The
                    more the Arabic language comes into use, the more the Syriac wanes and wastes
                    away; the more Muhammadan literature flourishes, the more purely Christian
                    literature pines and dwindles; so that from this time on it becomes necessary to
                    compile grammars and dictionaries of the old Syriac tongue, and to note and
                    record the correct reading and pronunciation of words in the Scriptures and
                    other books, in order that the understanding of them may not be lost.</p>
                <p>Among the small band of Monophysite scholars who made themselves conspicuous
                    during the latter half of the 7th century the most famous name is that of Jacob

                    Athanasius II., 684-687, which seems more probable, as they were intimate
                    friends. If he was appointed in 684, the three or four years for which he held
                    this office would terminate in 687-688, in which latter year Julian llōmāyā (or

                    strict in the enforcement of canonical rales, and thereby offended a portion of
                    his clergy. He would seem to have appealed to the patriarch and his
                    fellow-bishops, who were in favour of temporizing; whereupon Jacob burnt a copy
                    of the rales before the gate of Julian’s convent, at the same time crying aloud,
                    “I burn with fire as superfluous and useless the canons which ye trample under
                    foot and heed not.” He then betook himself to the convent at Kaisūm, a town near
                    Samosāta, and Habbibh was appointed to Edessa in his stead. After a while the’
                    monks of Eusēbhōnā invited Jacob to their convent, and there he taught for
                    eleven years the Psalms and the reading of the Scriptures in Greek, the study of
                    which language had fallen into desuetude. Owing to disputes with some of the
                    brethren “who hated the Greeks,” he left this house and went to the great
                    convent at Tell- 'Addā, where he worked for nine years more at his revised
                    version of the Old Testament.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the literature of his country Jacob holds much the same place as Jerome among
                    the Latin fathers. He was, for his time, a man of great culture and wide
                    reading, being familiar with Greek and with older Syriac writers. Of Hebrew he
                    probably understood veιy little, but he was always ready, like Aphraates, to
                    avail himself of the aid of Jewish scholars, whose opinion he often cites. He
                    appears before us as at once theologian, historian, philosopher, and grammarian,
                    as a translator of various Greek works, and as the indefatigable correspondent
                    of many students who sought his advice and assistance from far and near. As a
                    theologian, Jacob wrote commentaries on the Old and New Testaments, which are
                    cited by later authors, such as Dionysius bar Salibi<note anchored="true"

                    that Jacob translated the works of Gregory Nazianzen seems to be erroneous. He

                    In the MSS. these poems are said to be by Jacob of Sērùgh, which seems
                    altogether unlikely.</p></note> As a grammarian Jacob occupies an important
                    place in Syriac literature. Nestorian scholars, such as Narsai and his pupils,
                    more especially Joseph Hūzāyā (see above, p. 836), had no doubt elaborated a
                    system of accentuation and interpunction, which vies in minuteness with that of
                    the Jews, and had probably begun to store up the results of their studies in
                    Massoretic MSS. of the Bible, like those of which we have already spoken (above,
                    p. 826). But Jacob was the first to give a decided impulse to these pursuits
                    among the Western Syrians, and to induce the monks of Eusēbhōnā and Tell-'Addā
                    to compile Massoretic MSS. like those of their brethren in the East, and to pay
                    attention to minute accuracy in the matter of the diacritical points and the
                    signs of interpunction. Hence we usually find appended to such MSS. of the
                    Jacobite schools the epistle of Jacob to George, bishop of Sērugh, on Syrian
                    orthography,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    tract by him on the pointing of verbal and nominal forms and on the signs of

                    the same signs, with a list of their names, by Thomas the deacon.<note

                    Appendix, p. 90.</p></note> Further, Jacob’s acquaintance with the Greek
                    language and Greek MSS. suggested to him a striking simplification of the system
                    of vowel-points which was now probably beginning to be introduced among the
                    Easterns.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the year
                    899 we find the fully developed Nestorian system of vowel-points in use (Brit.
                    Mus. Add. 12138, see the facsimile in Wright’s <hi rend="italic">Catal.,</hi>
                    pi. xiii.). We may therefore fairly place its beginnings as early as Jacob’s
                    time.</p></note> He saw that all the vowel-sounds of the Syriac language, as
                    spoken by the Edessenes, could be represented by means of the Greek vowel
                    letters, a style of pointing which would be far clearer to the reader than a
                    series of minute dots. Accordingly he, or his school, put A for <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> 0 for <hi rend="italic">ō</hi> (d), E for <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> H for <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> o∕ for <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi>; and this system has been adhered to by the Western Syrians or Jacobites
                    since his time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    credit of inventing this vowel-system is usually given to Theophilus of Edessa,
                    who died in 785-786 <hi rend="italic">(B.O.,</hi> i. 64, 521), though Wiseman
                    brought forward to our mind convincing arguments in his <hi rend="italic">Horae
                    Syriacae,</hi> pp. 181-188, in favour of the claims of Jacob. We have now,
                    however, a MS. of Jacob’s own time in which these Greek vowels are distinctly
                    appended to Syriac words. See Brit. Mus. Add. 17134, f. 83b, in Wright’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Catal.,</hi> p. 337, col. 2, and pi. vi. In this plate, the
                    handwriting of which cannot well be placed later than about 700, we find in 1. 1
                    the vowel (ypsilon) in the word, and in 1.</p><p>23 the vowel in, both in black
                    ink, besides others in red ink in lines 6,17,18, 21,22, and 31. No one can
                    doubt, we think, that these vowels were added <hi rend="italic">apr. manu,</hi>
                    especially if he compares their forms, particularly the <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> with those of the Greek letters on the margin of pi. v.</p></note>
                    Jacob wished, however, to go a step farther, and sought to introduce a reform
                    for which his countrymen were not prepared. The constant perusal of Greek MSS.
                    had accustomed him to see the vowels placed on an equality with the consonants
                    as an integral part of the alphabet; and, considering how much this contributed
                    to clearness of sense and facility of reading, he desired to see the like done
                    in Syriac. For this purpose he himself designed a set of vowel-signs, to be
                    written on a line with and between the consonants<note anchored="true"

                <p>In this century too we may place the two following historical writers, whose
                    names and works are unfortunately known to us only through the mention made of
                    them by a later annalist. (1) An anonymous author, the abbot of the great
                    convent (of Abraham on Mount Izlā), cited by Elias bar Shīnāyā in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> under the years 740-741.<note anchored="true"

                    identified by Baethgen (<hi rend="italic">Fragmente,</hi> p. 2, No. 6) with the
                    catholicus of that name. This is, however, impossible, because the catholicus
                    died in 740, whereas the <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History of
                    Pethion</hi> is cited by Elias bar Shīnāyā under the years 765 and 768.</p>
                <p>We conclude our enumeration of the Nestorian writers of this century with the
                    name of another historian. In the <hi rend="italic">Bibl. Orient.,</hi> iii. 1,
                    195, the text of 'Abhd-īshō', as edited by Assemani, speaks of a writer named
                    Ishō'-denah, bishop of Kasrā. Other MSS., however, read Basra (al-Basrah), which
                    is confirmed by Elias bar Shīnāyā in Baethgen’s <hi rend="italic"

                    the MSS. differ. Besides the usual homilies of sorts and some metrical
                    discourses, he wrote an introduction to logic, a work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Book of Chastity,</hi> in which he collected lives and anecdotes of holy

                    818. The patriarch Cyriacus (see above, p. 842) had got entangled in a
                    controversy with the monks of Cyrrhus and Gubbā Barrāyā about the words <hi

                    Abraham, a monk of the convent of Kartamīn. After the death of Cyriacus in 817,
                    a synod was held in June 818 at Callinicus (ar-Raḳḳah), in which, after
                    considerable discussion, Theodore, bishop of Kaisūm, proposed the election of
                    Dionysius, which was approved by most of those present, including Basil I.,

                    Callinicus. Abraham and his partisans, seeing their hopes disappointed,
                    maintained their hostile attitude, which led afterwards to the usual scandalous

                    Nisībis, Dārā and Kēphar-tūtiiā, and so back to Callinicus, where he enjoyed the

                    The latter years of Dionysius were embittered by the oppressions and afflictions
                    which the Christians had to endure at the hands of the Muhammadans. He died on
                    22d August 845, and was buried in the convent of Ken-neshrē.<note

                    The Eusebian extracts have been translated and compared with the Greek original

                    to Justin II. Here Dionysius acknowledges himself chiefly indebted to his
                    countryman John of Asia (see above, p. 835), but has also incorporated the short
                    <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of Joshua the Stylite (see above, p. 832) and
                    the epistle of Simeon of Both Arshām on the Himyarite Christians (see above, p.

                    >a.d.,</hi> is his own compilation, partly from such written documents as he
                    could find, partly from the oral statements of aged men, and partly from his own
                    obserVation. Assemani has given an account of the whole work, with an

                <p>Under Dionysius flourished his brother Theodosius, bishop of Edessa, also a
                    student of Greek at Ken-neshrē. Bar-Hebraeus makes mention of him as
                    accompanying Dionysius to Egypt in 825-826 to complain to 'Abdallah ibn Tahir of

                <p>Nonnus was an archdeacon of the Jacobite Church at Nisībis during the first half
                    of this century, the Nestorian bishop Cyprian having allowed the Monophysites to
                    resume possession of the church of St Domitius in 767 (see above, p. 844). He is
                    mentioned by BarHebraeus as bringing charges against the bishop Philoxenus, who
                    had sided with the anti-patriarch Abraham, and was therefore deposed by a synod

                    of Greek science, whether medicine, mathematics, or philosophy. As a rule, they
                    translated the Greek first into Syriac and afterwards into Arabic; but their
                    Syriac versions have unfortunately, as it would appear, perished, without

                <p>In the 10th century the tale of Jacobite authors dwindles away , to almost
                    nothing. Most of the dignitaries of the church composed their synodical epistles

                    learning in both sacred and profane literature, who had studied under Mār Mēkīm

                    and was succeeded as abbot by his disciple Elias, who beautified the church.
                    Meantime its fame increased as a seat of learning under the direction of John of
                    Mārōn, and many scribes found employment there. The patriarch John VII., <hi

                    Elias, on his retirement, nominated John of Mārōn as his successor, who, aided
                    by the munificence of Emmanuel, a monk of Harrān and a disciple of the maphriān

                    finer scale, whilst a constant supply of fresh water was provided at the cost of
                    a Taghritan merchant named Mārūthā. This was in 1001. About this time Elias bar
                    Gāghai, a monk of Taghrith, founded a monastery near Melitēne, but died before
                    it was finished. His work was taken up by one Eutychus or Kulaib, who persuaded
                    John of Mārōn to join him. Here again his teaching attracted numbers of pupils.
                    At last, after the lapse of twelve years, when there were 120 priests in the
                    convent, he suddenly withdrew by night from the scene of his labours and retired
                    to the monastery of Mār Aaron near Edessa, where he died at the end of four
                    years, about 1017. His commentary on the book of Wisdom is cited by Bar-Hebraeus

                    p. 252 (transi., p. 258), but the discourses would seem rather to have dealt

                <p>Here we may pause in our enumeration to cast an eye upon some anonymous
                    translations, which we are inclined to ascribe to the 10th and 11th centuries,
                    and which are interesting as showing what the popular literature of the Syrians
                    was, compared with that of their theologians and men of science.</p>

                    corrupt, showing that it had passed through the hands of several generations of

                <p>To about the same period, judging by the similarity of style and language, we
                    would assign the Syriac version of the book of <hi rend="italic">Sindibādh.</hi>
                    This work was translated, probably in the latter half of the 8th century, from
                    Pahlavi into Arabic by Mōsā, a Muhammadan Persian. It is, as Nōldeke has

                    and cix. (Mai, <hi rend="italic">Scriptt. Vett.Nova Coll.,iv.</hi> 219-223),

                    ascribed to 'Amr ibn Mattā of Tīrliān. The first volume, transcribed in 1401, is
                    theological and dogmatical; it comprises the first four sections. The second
                    volume is theological and historical. The series of patriarchs ended with
                    “71,”</p><p>’ Abħd-isho'bar Mukl of Mosul (1138-47), but is continued down to
                    Yabh-alāhā bar Kāyōma of Mosul (1190), “qui nunc sedem tenet,” i.e., in 1214,
                    when this volume was written. His epitomizer 'Amr ibn Mattā of TIrhān lived in
                    the first half of the 14th century (B.O., iii. 1, 580, 586). To him is ascribed
                    Cod. Vat. cx., which “autographus esse videtur” (Mai, <hi rend="italic">Scriptt.
                    Vett. Nova Coll.,</hi> iv. 224-227). It consists of five parts, of which the
                    first is wanting in this MS., which has therefore no title. The series of
                    catholics in pt. v., fundam. 2, is continued down to Yabh-alahā (1281-1317).
                    In_pt. v., fundam. 3, sect. 6, we find the confession of faith of Michael,
                    bishop of Āmid and Maiyāfārikin (B.O., iii. 1, 557), translated into Arabic by
                    the priest Salibā ibn Yohanna,'whom G. E. Khayyath, archbishop of 'Amādia,
                    asserts to be the real author of the whole work (see his <hi rend="italic">Syri

                    perplexity, Sachau describes his Cod. 12 (Arab.) as “Theil einer grossen

                    the post-apostolic period, when it becomes a history of the patriarchs of the
                    church of Antioch, and finally, after the age of Severus, of the patriarchs of
                    the Monophysite branch of that church down to the year 1285. The meagre
                    continuation by a later hand reaches to 1495. Part iii. offers us the history of
                    the Eastern division of the Syrian Church from St Thomas the apostle onwards.
                    From the time of Mārūthā (629) it becomes the history of the Monophysite
                    maphriāns of Taghrith, though a record is always carefully kept of the catholic
                    patriarchs of the Nestorians. It closes with the year 1286, but there is a
                    continuation by Bar-Hebraeus’s brother Bar-saumā to 1288, and thence by another
                    writer to 1496.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Parts
