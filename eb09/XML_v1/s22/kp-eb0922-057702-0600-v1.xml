                    inhabitant of the country. It is a summer-visitant to most parts of the European
                    continent,—the chief exceptions being France (where the native race has been
                    destroyed), Italy, and Russia,—breeding from southern Sweden to Spain and
                    Greece, and being especially common in Poland.<note anchored="true"

                    greatly diminished since about 1858, when a disastrous spring-storm overtook the
                    homeward-bound birds. The like is to be said of Holland since about
                    1860.</p></note> It reappears again in Asia Minor, the Caucasus, Persia, and
                    Turkestan, but further to the eastward it is replaced by an allied species, <hi

                    rend="italic">Ooijevααr,</hi> which can be traced through many forms (Koolmann,
                    <hi rend="italic">Wörterb. d. Ostfries. Sprache,</hi> i. p. 8 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sub voce</hi> “Adebar”) to the old word <hi rend="italic">Οdeboro</hi> (“the
                    bringer of good ”). In countries where the Stork is abundant it enters largely
                    into popular tales, songs, and proverbs, and from the days of Aesop has been a
                    favourite in fable.</p></note> Its food, consisting mainly of frogs and insects,
                    is gathered in the neighbouring pastures, across which it may be seen stalking
                    with an air of quiet dignity; but in the season of love it indulges in gestures
                    which can only be called grotesque,—leaping from the ground with extended wings
                    in a kind of dance, and, absolutely voiceless as it is, making a loud noise by
                    the clattering of its mandibles. At other times it may be seen gravely resting
                    on one leg on an elevated place, thence to sweep aloft and circle with a slow
                    and majestic flight. Apart from its considerable size,—and a Stork stands more
                    than three feet in height,— its contrasted plumage of pure white and deep black,
                    with its bright red bill and legs, makes it a conspicuous and beautiful object,
                    especially when seen against the fresh green grass of a luxuriant meadow. In
                    winter the Storks of Europe retire to Africa,—some of them, it would seem,
                    reaching the Cape Colony,—while those of Asia visit India. A second species,
                    with much the same range, but with none of its relative’s domestic disposition,
                    is the Black Stork, <hi rend="italic">C. nigra,</hi> of which the upper parts
                    are black, brilliantly glossed with purple, copper, and green, while it is white
                    beneath,—the bill and legs, with a patch of bare skin round the eyes, being red.
                    This bird breeds in lofty trees, generally those growing in a large forest. Two
                    other dark-coloured, but somewhat abnormal, species are the purely African <hi
                    rend="italic">C. abdimii,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">C. episcopus,</hi>
                    which has a wider range, being found not only in Africa but in India, Java, and
                    Sumatra. The New World has only one true Stork, <hi rend="italic">C.

                    and black tail. Both these species are very like <hi rend="italic">C. alba,</hi>
                    but are larger, and have a bare patch of red skin round the eyes.</p>
                <p>The Storks form the <hi rend="italic">Pelargi</hi> of Nitzsch, as separated by
                    him from the Herons and the Ibises, but all three are united by Prof. Huxley in
                    his group <hi rend="italic">Pelargomorphae.</hi> The relations of the Storks to
                    the Herons may be doubtful; but there is no doubt that the former include the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Jabiru</hi> (vol. xiii. p. 529) and its allies, as well as
                    the curious genus <hi rend="italic">Anastomus</hi> (with its lower mandible
                    hollowed out so as only to meet the maxilla at the base and the tip), of which
                    there are an African and an Asiatic species. Two other remarkable forms probably
                    belong to the <hi rend="italic">Pelargi.</hi> These are <hi rend="italic"

                    former, first brought to Europe by Mr M. Parkyns from the White Nile, was
                    regarded by Gould, who described it in the Zoological <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proceedings</hi> (1851, pp. 1, 2, pl. xxxv.), as an abnormal Pelican. This view
                    was disputed by Reinhardt (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> 1860, p. 377), and

                    placing it with the Storks, the last assigning it to the Herons. In singularity
                    of aspect few birds surpass <hi rend="italic">Balaeniceps,</hi> with its gaunt
                    grey figure, some five feet in height, its large head surmounted by a little
                    curled tuft, the scowling expression of its eyes, and its huge bill in form not
                    unlike a whale’s head—this last suggesting its generic name—but tipped with a
                    formidable hook. The shape of the bill has also prompted the Arabs to call it,
                    according to their idiom, the “Father of a Shoe,” and it has been designated
                    “Shoe-bill” in English.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Under one or other of these names it is mentioned by many African
                    travellers; but the best account of it is that given by Von Heuglin (<hi

                    In 1860 two living birds were brought to England by Mr Petherick and exhibited
                    in the Zoological Gardens.</p></note> The other form that remains to be noticed
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Scopus umbretta</hi> of ornithologists, called the
                    “Umbre” by Pennant. This was discovered by Adanson the French traveller in
                    Senegal about the middle of the last century, and was described by Brisson in
                    1760. It has since been found to inhabit nearly the whole of Africa and
                    Madagascar, and is the “Hammerkop” (Hammerhead) of the Cape colonists. Though
                    not larger than a Raven, it builds an enormous nest, some six feet in diameter,
                    with a flat-topped roof and a small hole for entrance and exit, and placed
                    either on a tree or a rocky ledge.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Two figures of the nest are given by Holub and Von Pelzeln
                    (<hi rend="italic">Beitr. Orn. Südafrikas,</hi> p. 279).</p></note> The bird, of
                    an almost uniform brown colour, slightly glossed with purple, and its tail
                    barred with black, has a long occipital crest, generally borne horizontally, so
                    as to give rise to its common name. It is somewhat sluggish by day, but displays
                    much activity at dusk, when it will go through a series of strange performances.
                    In all the Storks, so far as is known, the eggs are white, and in most forms
                    distinguishable by the grain of their shell, which, without being rough, is
                    closely pitted with pore-like depressions. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
