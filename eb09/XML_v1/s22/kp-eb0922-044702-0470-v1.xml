                    designates a spasmodic affection of the organs of speech in which the
                    articulation of words is suddenly checked and a pause ensues, often followed by
                    a repetition in rapid sequence of the particular sound at which the stoppage
                    occurred. Of this painful affection there are many grades, from a slight
                    inability to pronounce with ease certain letters or syllables, or a tendency to
                    hesitate and to interject unmeaning sounds in a spoken sentence, to the more
                    severe condition in which there is a paroxysm of spasms of the muscles, not only
                    of the tongue and throat and face, but even of those of respiration and of the
                    body generally. To understand in some degree the explanation of stammering it is
                    necessary to consider shortly the physiological mechanism of articulate speech.
                    Speech is the result of various muscular movements affecting the current of air
                    as it passes in expiration from the larynx through the mouth. If the vocal cords
                    are called into action, and the sounds thus produced are modified by the
                    muscular movements of the tongue, cheeks, and lips, we have vocal speech; but if
                    the glottis is widely open and the vocal cords relaxed the current of air may
                    still be moulded by the muscular apparatus so as to produce speech without
                    voice, or whispering (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Voice).</hi> In both cases,
                    however, the mechanism is very complicated, requiring a series of nervous and
                    muscular actions, all of which must be executed with precision and in
                    accordance. In vocal speech, for example, it is necessary that the respiratory
                    movements, more especially those of expiration, occur regularly and with nice
                    adjustment to the kind of articulate expression required; that the vocal cords
                    be approximated and tightened by the muscles of the larynx acting with delicate
                    precision, so as to produce the sound of the pitch desired; that the <hi
                    rend="italic">rima glottidis</hi> (or aperture of the larynx) be opened so as to
                    produce prolonged sounds, or suddenly closed so as to cut off the current of
                    air; that the movements of the muscles of the tongue, of the soft palate, of the
                    jaws, of the cheeks, and of the lips occur precisely at the right time and to
                    the requisite extent; and finally that all of these muscular adjustments take
                    place with rapidity and smoothness, gliding into each other without effort and
                    without loss of time. Exquisite co-ordination of muscular movement is therefore
                    necessary, involving also complicated nervous actions. Hence is it that speech
                    is acquired by long and laborious effort. A child possesses voice from the
                    beginning; it is born with the capacity for speech; but articulate expression is
                    the result of education. In infancy, not only is knowledge acquired of external
                    objects, and signs attached in the form of words to the ideas thus awakened, but
                    the nervous and muscular mechanisms by which these signs or words receive vocal
                    expression are trained by long practice to work harmoniously.</p>
                <p>It is not surprising, therefore, that in certain cases, owing to some obscure
                    congenital defect, the co-ordination is not effected with sufficient precision,
                    and that stammering is the result. Even in severe cases no appreciable lesion
                    can be detected either in the nervous or muscular mechanisms, and the condition
                    is similar to what may affect all varieties of finely co-ordinated movements.
                    The mechanism does not work smoothly, but the pathologist is unable to show any
                    organic defect. Thus the co-ordinated movements necessary in writing are
                    disturbed in scrivener’s palsy, and the skilful performer on the piano or on any
                    instrument requiring minute manipulation may find that he is losing the power of
                    delicate adjustment. Stammering is occasionally hereditary. It rarely shows
                    itself before the age of four or five years, and as a rule it is developed
                    between this age and puberty. Men stammer in a much larger proportion than
                    women. It may occur during the course of nervous affections, such as hysteria,
                    epilepsy, or tabes dorsalis; sometimes it follows febrile disorders; often it
                    develops in a child in a feeble state of health, without any special disease. In
                    some cases a child may imitate a stammerer and thus acquire the habit. Any
                    general enfeeblement of the health, and especially nervous excitement,
                    aggravates the condition of a confirmed stammerer.</p>
                <p>Stammerers, as a rule, find the explosive consonants <hi rend="italic">b</hi>,
                    <hi rend="italic">p, d, t, k,</hi> and hard <hi rend="italic">g</hi> the most
                    difficult to articulate, but many also are unable easily to deal with the more
                    continuous consonants, such as <hi rend="italic">v, f th, s, z, sh, m, n,
                    y,</hi> and in severe cases even the vowels may cause a certain amount of spasm.
                    Usually the defect is not observed in whispering or singing; but there are
                    exceptions to this statement. In pronouncing the explosive sounds the part of
                    the oral apparatus that ought suddenly to open or close remains spasmodically
                    closed, and the stammerer remains for a moment voiceless or strives pitifully to
                    overcome the obstruction, uttering a few successive puffs or sounds like the
                    beginning of the sound he wishes to utter. The lips thus remain closed at the
                    attempted utterance of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p;</hi>
                    the tip of the tongue is pressed against the hard palate or the back of the
                    upper front teeth in <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t</hi>; and
                    the back of the tongue presses against the posterior part of the palate in
                    pronouncing <hi rend="italic">g</hi> hard and <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> In
                    attempting the continuous consonants, in which naturally the passage is not
                    completely obstructed, the stammerer does not close the passage spasmodically,
                    but the parts become fixed in the half-opened condition, or there are
                    intermittent attempts to open or close them, causing either a drawling sound or
                    coming to a full stop. In severe cases, where even vowels cannot be freely
                    uttered, the spasm appears to be at the <hi rend="italic">rima glottidis</hi>
                    (opening of the larynx). Again, in some cases, the spasm may affect the
                    respiratory muscles, giving rise to a curious barking articulation, in
                    consequence of spasm of the expiratory muscles, and in such cases the patient
                    utters the first part of the sentence slowly, gradually accelerates the speed,
                    and makes a rush towards the close. In the great majority of cases the spasm
                    affects the muscles of articulation proper, that is, those of the pharynx,
                    tongue, cheeks, and lips. In the most aggravated cases the condition of the
                    patient is pitiable. It has thus been well described by Dr Bristow in an article
                    full of interesting details :—</p>
                <p>“The most distressing cases are those in which the spasm extends to parts
                    unconnected with speech,—it may be to nearly the whole muscular organism. In
                    such a case the spasm commences, let us assume, at the base of the tongue; the
                    mouth opens widely and remains in that position; the muscles of expiration work
                    convulsively; the glottis contracts; respiration becomes arrested; the face
                    becomes congested and the veins dilated; violent spasmodic movements involve the
                    trunk and limbs; and only alter some time, either when the patient becomes
                    exhausted, or when he resolutely restrains his attempts to articulate, does his
                    paroxysm come to an end.”— <hi rend="italic">Quαin's Dictionary of
                    Medicine,</hi> p. 1513.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n471/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0471-0448"/> Such a case is not common; it is more paroxysmal
                    than habitual; and in ordinary conversation, when the patient is free from
                    nervous excitement, the defect may be scarcely observed. A condition named <hi
                    rend="italic">aphthongia</hi> is even more distressing. It totally prevents
                    speech, and may, at intervals, come on when the person attempts to speak; but
                    fortunately it is only of temporary duration, and is usually caused by
                    exceptional nervous excitement. It is characterized by spasm of the muscles
                    supplied by the hypoglossal nerve, including the sterno-hyoid, sternothyroid,
                    and thyro-hyoid muscles. In almost all cases of stuttering it is noticed that
                    the defect is most apparent when the person is obliged to make a sudden
                    transition from one class of sounds to another, and the patient soon discovers
                    this for himself and chooses his words so as to avoid dangerous muscular
                    combinations. When one considers the delicate nature of the adjustments
                    necessary in articulate speech, this is what may be expected. It is well known
                    that a quickly diffusible stimulant, such as alcohol, temporarily removes the
                    difficulty in speech.</p>
                <p>Stuttering may be successfully overcome in some cases by a careful process of
                    education under a competent tutor. Not a few able public speakers were at first
                    stutterers, but a prolonged course of vocal gymnastics has remedied the defect.
                    The patient should be encouraged to read and speak slowly and deliberately,
                    carefully pronouncing each syllable, and when he feels the tendency to stammer,
                    he should be advised to pause for a short time, and then by a strong voluntary
                    effort to attempt to pronounce the word. He should also be taught how to
                    regulate respiration during speech, so that he may not fail from want of breath.
                    In some cases aid may be obtained by raising the voice towards the close of the
                    sentence. Sounds or combinations of sounds that present special difficulties
                    should be made the subject of careful study, and the defect may be largely
                    overcome by a series of graduated exercises in reading. The practice of intoning
                    is useful in many cases. In ordinary conversation it is often important to have
                    some one present who may by a look put the stammerer on his guard when he is
                    observed to be talking too quickly or indistinctly. Thus by patience and
                    determination many stammerers have so far overcome the defect that it can
                    scarcely be noticed in conversation; but even in such cases mental excitement or
                    slovenly inattention to the rules of speech suitable for the condition may cause
                    a relapse. In very severe cases, where the spasmodic seizures affect other
                    muscles than those of articulation, special medical treatment is necessary, as
                    such are on the borderland of serious nervous disturbance. All measures tending
                    to improve the general health, the removal of any affection of the mouth or gums
                    that may aggravate habitual stammering, the avoidance of great emotional
                    excitement, a steady determination to overcome the defect by voluntary control,
                    and a system of education such as has been sketched will do much in the great
                    majority of cases to remedy stammering. (<hi rend="smallcaps">j. g. m.)</hi></p>
