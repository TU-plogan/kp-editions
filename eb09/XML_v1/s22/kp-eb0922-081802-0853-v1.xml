                    miles and a drainage area of about 320,000 square miles. Incertitude as to its
                    source prevailed until the recent occupation of Turkestan by the Russians. It
                    has now been traced to the Naryn, which has its sources in the heart of the
                    Tian-Shan complex, some 30 miles south of Lake Issik-kul, in the elevated
                    valleys or <hi rend="italic">syrts</hi> (12,000 feet) on the southern slope of
                    the Terskei Ala-tau. Here under the name of Jaak-tash the river takes its rise
                    amid mountain scenery of the wildest description, partly from the marshy
                    mountain plateaus by which the “Warm Lake” is also fed, and partly from the
                    immense glaciers of the dark and barren Ak-shiriyak Mountains (Petroff and
                    Sir-tash glaciers). After its union with another mountain stream, the Barskaun,
                    it is called the Taragai, and flows west-south-west at from 11,000 to 10,000
                    feet above the sea, in a barren longitudinal valley between the Terskei Ala-tau
                    and the foothills of the lofty Kokshal-tau. On entering a wild narrow gorge
                    driven from west to east through the south-west continuation of the Terskei
                    Mountains (Samatyn-tau) it receives the name of Naryn. Through this gorge it
                    descends by a series of rapids from the heights of the mountain <hi

                    miles below the junction of the Great and the Little Naryn, is only 6800 feet
                    above the sea. Here the river enters a broad valley—formerly the bottom of an
                    alpine lake—and flows past the ruins of Fort Kurtka, for 90 miles westward, as a
                    stream some 50 yards wide and from 3 to 11 feet deep. Its waters are utilized
                    for irrigating Kirghiz cornfields, which contrast strangely with the barren
                    aspect of the lofty treeless mountains. The Atpasha—a large mountain
                    stream—joins the Naryn at the head of this valley and the Alabuga at its lower
                    end, both from the left. Before reaching the lowlands, the Naryn crosses three
                    ridges separating the valley of Kurtka from that of Ferghana, by a series of
                    wild gorges and broad valleys (170 miles), representing the bottoms of old
                    lakes; the Togus-torgau, 2000 feet lower than Kurtka, and the Ketmen-tube are
                    both covered with Kirghiz corn-fields. Taking a wide sweep towards the north,
                    the river enters Ferghana—also the bottom of an immense lake—where, after
                    joining the Kara-Daria (Black river) near Namangan, it receives the name of
                    Syr-Daria.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    the west again, the natives consider it the chief branch of the Syr-Daria, but
                    its volume is much smaller. At the confluence the Syr is 1440 feet above

                <p>The waters of the Syr-Daria and its tributaries are in this part of its course
                    largely absorbed by numberless canals for irrigation. It is to the Syr that
                    Ferghana is indebted for its high, if somewhat exaggerated, repute in Central
                    Asia as a rich garden and granary; cities like Khokand, Marghilan, and Namangan,
                    and more than 800,000 inhabitants of the former khanate of Khokand, live by its
                    waters. Notwithstanding this drain upon it, the Syr could be easily navigated,
                    were it not for the Bigovat rapids at Irdjar, at the lower end of the valley,
                    where the river finds its way to the Aral-Caspian deserts by piercing a
                    depression of the Mogol-tau.</p>
                <p>On issuing from this gorge the Syr enters the Aral depression, and flows for 850
                    miles in a north-westerly and northerly direction before reaching the Sea of
                    Aral. On this section it is navigated by steamers. Between the Irdjar rapids and
                    Baildyr-turgai (where it bends north) the Syr flows along the base of the
                    mountain ridges which girdle the Tchotkal Mountains (see below) on the
                    north-west, and receives from the longitudinal valleys of these alpine tracts a
                    series of tributaries (the Angren, the Tchirtchik, the Keles), which in their
                    lower courses fertilize the wide plains of loess extending from the right bank
                    of the Syr. These plains and their rich supply of water have been the<pb

                    developing between the barren sands of the Aral depression and the mountain
                    tracts of the Tian-Shan. The Angren rises beneath the highest parts of the
                    Tchotkat range, and its valley is the granary of the region. The Tchirtchik has
                    its origin in the Borotday Mountains at the junction of the Tchotkat and the
                    Pskem rivers, and at the point where it issues from the mountains it sends off
                    the famous canal Zakh-aryk; it flows past Tashkend along a valley 20 miles wide,
                    and joins the Syr a few miles below its confluence with the Angren. The Keles
                    comes from the Jity-su Mountains and also brings a large volume of water for
                    irrigation. But owing to wars and continual insecurity cities formerly important
                    have now been abandoned; and near Tchinaz, at the mouth of the Tchirtchik, are
                    the ruins of a large town formerly fortified with high walls, and of <hi
                    rend="italic">aryks</hi> with manifold ramifications.</p>
                <p>Some 50 miles below Tchinaz (770 feet above sea-level) the Syr bends northwards,
                    but resumes its north-westerly course 150 miles farther down, following with
                    remarkable persistency the borders of the loess which fringes the mountains. Its
                    low banks, covered with rushes and rendered uninhabitable in summer by clouds of
                    mosquitoes, are inundated for 20 miles on both sides when the snows begin to
                    melt. These inundations prevent the moving sands of the Kizil-kum desert from
                    approaching the Syr; below Perovsk, however, the steppe gains the upper hand.
                    Down to Perovsk the river rolls its muddy yellow waters, at the rate of 3 to 5
                    miles an hour, in a channel 300 to 600 yards wide and 3 to 5 fathoms deep; at
                    Perovsk its vertical section is 8220 square feet, and 312,500 cubic feet of
                    water are discharged per second. The Arys and the Buguñ are the only tributaries
                    worthy of notice on this part of its course; the other streams which descend
                    from the Kara-tau fail to reach the river. The Kungrad Kirghiz rear numerous
                    herds of cattle and sheep in the valley of the Arys, while lower down, as far as
                    Julek, the Igintchis carry on agriculture. All this applies, of course, only to
                    the right bank; on the left the moistness is absorbed by the hot winds which
                    cross the Kizil-kum sands towards the river. The dryness of the atmosphere makes
                    its influence markedly felt on the Syr when it enters, below Julek, a region
                    where the Kara-kum sands extend on its right. Ten miles below Perovsk the river
                    traverses a marshy depression—the bottom of a lake not yet fully dried up—where
                    it divides into two branches,—the Jaman-daria and the Kara-uzyak. The latter
                    spreads out in marshes and ponds, from which it again issues to join the former
                    at Karmaktchi, after a course of 80 miles. The main branch also, owing to its
                    shallowness and sinuosity, is very difficult to navigate, and this is increased
                    by the rapidity of the current and the want of fuel. Between Kazalinsk and the
                    Sea of Aral (158 feet) the navigation becomes somewhat easier, except for the
                    last 10 miles, where the river divides into three shallow branches before
                    entering the “Blue Sea.” All three have at their mouths sandy bars with only 3
                    feet of water, which are often forded by the Kirghiz.</p>
                <p>Two former right-hand tributaries of the Syr—the Tchu and the Sary-su—which now
                    disappear in the sands some 60 miles before reaching it, must be mentioned. The
                    Tchu, which is 600 miles in length, rises in the Tian-Shan to the soutli-west of
                    Lake Issik-kul, and is made up of many streams, of which the Kyz-art, the
                    Juvan-aryk, and the Koshkar are the more important. On their union these form
                    the Koshkar, which flows towards Lake Issik-kul, but a few miles before reaching
                    that lake turns suddenly to the north-west, enters under the name of Tchu the
                    narrow gorge of Buam, and, piercing the snow-clad Kunghei Ala-tau, emerges on
                    its northern slope, having descended from 5500 feet to less than 2000 in a
                    course of not more than 50 miles. In this part of its course it receives from
                    the right the Kebin, whose high valley equals in size that of the upper Rhone.
                    It then flows north-west wards through the valley of Pishpek, and, avoiding the
                    Muyun-kum sands, describes a wide curve to the north before finally taking a
                    western direction. Numberless streams flow towards it from the snow-clad
                    Alexandrovsk Mountains, but they are for the most part lost in the sands before
                    reaching it. The Tatas, 170 miles long, formerly an affluent of the Tchu, which
                    rises in the highest parts of that range, pierces the Tcha-archa Mountains, and,
                    flowing past Aulie-ata on the south border of the Muyun-kum, enters the salt
                    lake Kara-kul 60 miles from the Tchu. The Tchu reaches the Saumal-kul group of
                    lakes, 60 miles from the Syr, in the form of marshes with undefined channels.
                    Another elongated group of lakes—-the Uzun-kul —near the above and 50 miles from
                    Perovsk, receives the Sary-su, which has a length of nearly 570 miles, and flows
                    rapidly in a narrow channel along the west borders of the northern Famine Steppe
                    (Bekpak-dala).</p>
                <p>The delta of the Syr at present begins at Perovsk, whence it sends a branch to
                    the south-west, the Yany-daria (Jany-daria or New river), which formerly reached
                    the south-eastern corner of the Sea of Aral, very near the mouth of the
                    Amu-daria. The Kirghiz affirm that a canal dug for irrigation by the Karakalpaks
                    gave origin to this river. It had, however, but a temporary existence. A dam
                    erected by the Khokandese at Ak-metchet (Perovsk) caused its disappearance, and
                    the Russians found but a dry bed in 1820. When the dam was removed the
                    Yany-daria again reappeared, but it failed to reach the Sea of Aral; in 1853 it
                    lost itself in Lake Kutchka-denghiz, after a course of 250 miles; all traces of
                    its bed were then lost in the sand. The Kirghiz legend can only be accepted,
                    however, with very great caution; the present writer is inclined to think that
                    the canal of the Karakalpaks was merely intended to redirect the waters of the
                    Syr into a channel w’hich existed of old, but had been dried up.<note

                    Russ. Geogr. Soc.,</hi> Phys. Geogr., ix. (1881).</p></note> Certain it is that
                    five centuries ago, in the time of Timur, the Yany-daria brought the waters of
                    the Syr to the Dau-kara Lakes, close by the present mouth of the Amu. The series
                    of old beds in the Kizil-kum, w’hich are still seen above Perovsk, shows that
                    the Syr had a constant tendency to seek a channel to the south-west and that its
                    present delta is but a vestige of what it was in past times. At a still more
                    remote period this delta probably comprised all the space between the Kara-tau
                    and the Nura-tau; and in the series of elongated lakes at the base of the
                    Nura-tau—the Tuz-kane and Bogdan-ata Lakes—we see an old branch of the delta of
                    the Syr which probably joined the Zerafshan before reaching the Amu. The causes
                    of this immense change are to be sought for simply in the rapid desiccation of
                    the whole northern and central parts of Asia, due to the fact that we are now
                    living in the later phase of the Lacustrine period, w’hich has followed the
                    Glacial period. The extremely rapid desiccation of the Sea of Aral is proved
                    even by surveys a few decades old, and this process is but a trifle in
                    comparison with the changes which have taken place during the last five
                    centuries: the extension of the Caspian Sea as far as the Sarakamysh lakes
                    during the Post-Pliocene period and the extension of the Sea of Aral at least
                    100 miles to the east of its present banks are both proved by the presence of
                    Post-Pliocene marine deposits. (P. A. K.)</p>
