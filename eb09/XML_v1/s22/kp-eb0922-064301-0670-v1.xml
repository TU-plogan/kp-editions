                    (1811-1874), American statesman, was born at Boston, Mass., on 6th January 1811.
                    He graduated at Harvard in 1830, and studied law with Judge Story. His natural
                    powers of mind were great, his habits of study intense, and his success
                    immediate and conspicuous. Everything seems to have been expected of him, and he
                    disappointed nobody. In 1834 he had been admitted to the bar, was editor of the
                    <hi rend="italic">American Jurist,</hi> and was reporting the decisions of Judge
                    Story. For the next three years he was a lecturer in the Harvard law school. He
                    then spent three years in Europe, always, however, studying with an intensity
                    that never relaxed. Returning, he began the practice of law, but gradually
                    drifted into politics during the anti-slavery struggle. In 1851 the few
                    “free-soilers” in the Massachusetts legislature offered to vote for Democrats
                    for other officers in return for Democratic votes for Sumner as United States
                    senator. Sumner was thus sent to the Senate, to which he was regularly
                    re-elected for the rest of his life. He at once became a man of mark, though not
                    of popularity, in the Senate. His fine personal presence, his somewhat florid
                    rhetoric, his wealth of citation from learned and foreign tongues, his wide
                    foreign acquaintance, high culture, and social standing, seem to have staggered
                    his Southern colleagues. They could not look down upon him, and they hardly knew
                    what else to do. A long series of speeches brought about an assault upon him,
                    22d May 1856, by Preston S. Brooks, a representative from South Carolina, in
                    retaliation for Sumner’s criticism of Brooks’s uncle, a senator from his State.
                    Brooks found Sumner writing in the Senate chamber, and beat him so cruelly that
                    he narrowly escaped death. He was absent from his place until 1859, and never
                    fully recovered from the effects of the assault. When his party took control of
                    the Senate in 1861 Sumner became one of its foremost members. Like Stevens (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Stevens),</hi> he propounded a theory of the relations of
                    the seceding States to the Union which never was endorsed, but had its influence
                    on the outcome of reconstruction. In the American Union States are autonomous,
                    but Territories are theoretically under the absolute government of Congress,
                    though in practice Congress gives them as much self-government as is possible or
                    prudent. A Territory becomes a State by admission through an Act of Congress.
                    Sumner held that the national boundaries of the Union were so fixed that no
                    State could escape from them by secession, that a State’s secession was merely
                    an abandonment of its Statehood, so that it fell back into the condition of a
                    Territory and came under the absolute government of Congress. This
                    “State-suicide” theory was in due time condemned by the Supreme Court, which
                    held that a State could not lose its Statehood; but Congress had really acted
                    upon it already in several points of reconstruction. Sumner’s peculiar field was
                    in the Senate committee on foreign relations, of which he was chairman from 1861
                    until 1871. It was during this period, in 1869, that he urged the “indirect”
                    items of the Alabama claims, sacrificing without hesitation the English
                    popularity which had always been dear to him. Within a year or two he felt
                    compelled to oppose the new administration of President Grant in several
                    particulars. In the expectation of gratifying the president, the Republican
                    senators removed Sumner from his chairmanship; and, like Seward, he passed his
                    later years in general opposition to the party which he had helped to organize.
                    In December 1872 he introduced a resolution that the names of victories over
                    fellow-citizens should be removed from the regimental flags of the army. For
                    this his State legislature censured him, but the censure was rescinded just
                    before his death. He had been from the beginning of the Civil War the advocate
                    of emancipation and of the grant of full status to the Negroes; and for the last
                    few years of his life his energies were devoted to forwarding his Civil Rights
                    Bill, intended to give the freedmen the same legal rights as the whites. He died
                    at Washington on 11th March 1874.</p>
