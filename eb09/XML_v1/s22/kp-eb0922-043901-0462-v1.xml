                    Delaunay, Baronne de</hi></label> (1684-1750)—often called in history and
                    literature Madame de Staal-Delaunay, to distinguish her more completely from
                    Madame de Stael-Holstein—was born at Paris on May 30, 1684. Her father was a
                    painter named Cordier. He seems to have deserted her mother, whose name was
                    Delaunay, and who made her daughter take that surname instead of Cordier. She
                    was well-educated, and entered the household of the Duchesse du Maine at Sceaux,
                    at first in no higher capacity than that of <hi rend="italic">femme de
                    chambre.</hi> She was, however, promoted before long to the office of amanuensis
                    and (practically) companion to her mistress. Her literary talent soon manifested
                    itself in the literary court of the duchess, who is said, but chiefly on the
                    waiting lady’s own authority, to have been not a little jealous of her
                    attendant. Enough, however, is known of the duchess’s imperious and capricious
                    temper to make it improbable that her service was agreeable. Madame Delaunay,
                    however, was a sufficiently devoted <hi rend="italic">suivante,</hi> and in the
                    affair of the Cellamare conspiracy had to endure a visit to the Bastille, where
                    she remained for two years. Even here, however, she represents herself as having
                    made conquests, though she was far from beautiful. She returned on her
                    liberation to the service of the duchess, refused, it is said, Dacier, the
                    widower of a wife more famous than himself, and in 1735, being then more than
                    fifty, married the Baron de Staal. She continued, however, to form part of the
                    duchess’s household. She died on June 16, 1750. Her <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi> appeared about five years later, and have often been reprinted,
                    both separately and in collections of the memoirs of the 17th and 18th
                    centuries, to both of which the author belonged both in style and character. She
                    has much of the frankness and seductive verve of Madame de Sévigné and her
                    contemporaries, but a little alloyed with the <hi rend="italic">sensibilité</hi>
                    of a later time. It may be doubted whether she does not somewhat exaggerate the
                    discomforts of her position and her sense of them. But her book is an extremely
                    amusing one to read, as well as not a little instructive. The humours of the
                    “court of Sceaux” are depicted as hardly any other society of the kind has ever
                    been. Besides her <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> Madame de Staal left two
                    comedies and some letters, the answers to which are in some cases extant, and
