                    (1554-1586), although killed at the early age of thirty-two, was one of the most
                    conspicuous figures at the court of Elizabeth, was known to the leading
                    statesmen of Europe as a soldier and statesman of the highest promise, took a
                    permanent place in history and legend as a romantic hero, and in literature is
                    distinguished as the author of the first important body of English sonnets and a
                    writer whose works mark a distinct advance in English prose. He was born at
                    Penshurst in Kent on 29th November 1554. His father was Sir Henry Sidney, famous
                    in his time as an administrator of Ireland, his mother a Dudley, sister of
                    Elizabeth’s favourite, the earl of Leicester, and daughter of the earl of
                    Northumberland executed for high treason in the reign of Mary. Thus Sidney was
                    of notable kindred on both sides—</p>
                <p>“Others, because of both sides I do take My blood from them who did excel in
                    this,</p>
                <p>Think Nature me a man-at-arms did make.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    41.</p></note></p>
                <p>He received his scholastic education at Shrewsbury school and at Christ Church,
                    Oxford. He was entered at Shrewsbury on the same day with his lifelong friend
                    and biographer Fulke Greville, afterwards Lord Brooke. In 1572 he set out with
                    three years’ leave of absence to complete his education by Continental travel;
                    he was in Paris at the house of the English ambassador on the night of the
                    massacre of St Bartholomew, and went thence to Frankfort, Vienna, and the chief
                    cities of Italy. During these travels he associated with scholars and statesmen,
                    making an earnest study of European politics, winning golden opinions for his
                    youthful gravity and sagacity. From that time Hubert Languet, the Reformer, whom
                    he met at Frankfort, maintained a constant correspondence with him. On his
                    return he was introduced at court, won the favour of Elizabeth, who considered
                    him “one of the jewels of her crown,” and, in proof of the versatility which
                    made him one of the wonders of his age, wrote a masque, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Lady of the May,</hi> for Leicester’s great reception of the queen at
                    Kenilworth, and distinguished himself in the tournament upon the same occasion.
                    In 1577, at the age of twenty-two, being sent as ambassador in great state to
                    congratulate and sound Rudolph II., the new emperor of Germany, he met William
                    the Silent, who pronounced him one of the ripest statesmen in Europe. He
                    returned in the following year, and from that time till the expedition to the
                    Netherlands, in which he lost his life, he had no public employment, but lived
                    partly at court, partly at his country seat at</p>
                <p>Penshurst in Kent. In 1583 he married the daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham, who
                    after his death became countess of Essex. His most memorable interference in
                    state affairs was a bold letter of remonstrance to Elizabeth against her
                    suspected policy of marrying the duke of Anjou. The queen’s anger at his
                    boldness drove him for a time into retirement. He was a strong advocate of
                    intervention on the Protestant side, and in 1585 accompanied Leicester in his
                    expedition to the Netherlands, and was appointed governor of Flushing, one of
                    the towns held by the queen as security. The historical truth of the famous
                    incident at the battle of Zutphen (22d September 1586), when the wounded hero
                    passed a cup of water to a dying soldier, has been questioned; but it is matter
                    of fact that he owed his death to an impulse of romantic generosity. The lord
                    marshal happening to enter the field of Zutphen without greaves, Sidney cast off
                    his also, to put his life in the same peril, and thus exposed himself to the
                    fatal shot. His death took place fifteen days later, on 7th October 1586, at
                    Arnheim.</p>
                <p>No poet’s death was ever so lamented by poets as Sidney’s. Pastoral elegy was in
                    fashion, and all the numerous poets and rhymesters of the time from Spenser to
                    Davison hastened to lay their tribute of verse on the bier of this the darling
                    of all the shepherds—</p>
                <p>“With whom all joy and jolly merriment Is also deaded and in dolour drent.’’</p>
                <p>That there was much more than the worship of his rank and his bright eager
                    personality in this is shown by the lasting reputation of what he wrote during
                    the two years of retirement, 1580-81, which he seems to have given mainly to
                    literature. The truth is that Sidney transferred his own strong, radiant,
                    graceful, and lovable character to his writings with a freshness and fidelity
                    such as few finished artists have achieved, so that he really and literally
                    lives in them to charm for ever. None of his writings were published during his
                    lifetime, and the dates of composition are uncertain. But it would seem that
                    Sidney’s first attempt at verse was a metrical version of the Psalms, written in
                    conjunction with his sister, the countess of Pembroke,—“Sidney’s sister,
                    Pembroke’s mother.’ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The worth of these
                    paraphrases, which have all Sidney’s qualities of sincerity, directness, and
                    sweetness of rhythm, has recently been recognized by Mr Ruskin, who has edited
                    them under the title of <hi rend="italic">Rock Honeycomb</hi> in the second
                    volume of his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Pastorum</hi> (1877). Sidney’s
                    famous prose romance, <hi rend="italic">The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia,</hi>
                    the “vain amatorious poem” with which Charles I. solaced his imprisonment, was
                    also begun in 1580. It was published in 1590, and kept its popularity as long as
                    that kind of high-flown sentiment and intricate adventure found readers. The
                    buoyancy and freshness of Sidney’s style give a certain air of reality even to
                    the artificial scenes of the <hi rend="italic">Arcadia,</hi> and many pretty
                    songs are interspersed through the work. Sidney’s greatest poetic achievement,
                    however, was the series of sonnets entitled <hi rend="italic">Astrophel and
                    Stella,</hi> the first important body of sonnets in the English language. The
                    sonnets, 110 in number, are a chronicle of the poet’s love for Penelope
                    Devereux, sister of the earl of Essex, afterwards Lady Rich. He first met the
                    lady when she was a child of twelve at one of the stages in Elizabeth’s progress
                    to Kenilworth in 1575. A match was apparently arranged between them by their
                    families, but upon Leicester’s disgrace it was broken off and Penelope was given
                    to Lord Rich. Sidney seems then to have discovered that he was in love with her.
                    Whether the passion was real or feigned for artistic purposes is of little
                    consequence, although the reality of it has been hotly maintained; he writes as
                    if it were real, and the verisimilitude of the story recorded in the sonnets,
                    which express his varying moods towards her throughout the incidents of
                    subsequent intercourse and the distractions of his public life, adds greatly to
                    their interest. Very few of the sonnets will bear separation from the context,
                    though there is hardly one that does not contain some sweet ingenuity of fancy
                    or casual felicity of phrase. Some of them were special favourites with Charles
                    Lamb. Sidney’s other work during this busy literary passage in his short life,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Apologie for Poetrie,</hi> has also established itself as
                    a classic.</p>
                <p>The best of the sonnets are selected by Mrs Ward in Ward’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >English Poets;</hi> Mr Main also makes a good selection in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Treasury of English Sonnets.</hi> The sonnets were probably
                    written in 1581; they were not published till 1591, when they formed the first
                    in a brilliant series of volumes of sonnet literature (see “Elizabethan
                    Sonneteers,” in Minto’s <hi rend="italic">Characteristics of English Poets</hi>)
                    <hi rend="italic">.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Apologie</hi> is included in
                    Arber's reprints.</p>
