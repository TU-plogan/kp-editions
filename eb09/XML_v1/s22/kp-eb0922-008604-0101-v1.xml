                    (1710-1761), mathematician, was born at Market Bosworth in Leicestershire on the
                    20th of August 1710. His father was a stuff weaver, and, intending to bring his
                    son up to his own business, took little care of the boy’s education. Young
                    Simpson, however, was eager for knowledge, and so ardent was he in pursuit of it
                    that he neglected his weaving, and in consequence of a quarrel was forced to
                    leave his father’s house. He settled<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n102/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0102-0087"/> for a short time at Nuneaton, where he met a
                    pedlar who practised fortune-telling. By the encouragement and assistance of
                    this man Simpson was induced to make a profession of casting nativities himself,
                    and he soon became the oracle of the neighbourhood. But he was not long in
                    discovering the imposture of astrology, and his conscience, as well as an
                    accident which happened to him in the practice of his art, compelled him to
                    abandon this profession. After a residence of two or three years at Derby, where
                    he worked as a weaver during the day and taught pupils in the evenings, he went
                    up to London and pursued the same course, but with more success. The number of
                    his pupils increased; his abilities became more widely known; and he was enabled
                    to publish by subscription his <hi rend="italic">Treatise of Fluxions</hi> in
                    1737. His treatise, as was afterwards acknowledged, abounded with errors of the
                    press, and contained several obscurities and defects incidental to the author’s
                    want of experience and the disadvantages under which he laboured. His next
                    publications were <hi rend="italic">A Treatise on the Nature and Laws of
                    Chance,</hi> 1740; <hi rend="italic">Essays on Several Curious and Useful
                    Subjects in Speculative and Mixed Mathematicks,</hi> 1740; <hi rend="italic">The
                    Doctrine of Annuities and Reversions deduced from General and Evident
                    Principles,</hi> 1742; and <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Dissertations on a
                    Variety of Physical and Analytical Subjects,</hi> 1743. Soon after the
                    publication of his <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> he was chosen a member of the
                    Royal Academy at Stockholm; in 1743 he was appointed professor of mathematics in
                    the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich; and in 1745 he was admitted a fellow of
                    the Royal Society of London. In 1745 he published <hi rend="italic">A Treatise
                    of Algebra,</hi> with an appendix containing the construction of geometrical
                    problems, and in 1747 the <hi rend="italic">Elements of Plane Geometry.</hi> The
                    latter book, unlike many others with the same title, is not an edition of
                    Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> but an independent treatise. Though it
                    can hardly be said that as an introduction to geometry it is preferable to
                    Euclid, yet the solutions of problems contained in it (and in the appendix to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Algebra</hi> as well) are in general exceedingly
                    ingenious. In his <hi rend="italic">Trigonometry, Plane and Spherical, with the
                    Construction and Application of Logarithms,</hi> which appeared in 1748, there
                    is a tolerably uniform use of contractions for the words sine, tangent, &amp;c.,
                    prefixed to the symbol of the angle. <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine and
                    Application of Fluxions,</hi> which he issued in 1750, was more full and
                    comprehensive than his earlier work on the same subject, and altogether was so
                    different that he wished it to be considered as a new book and not as a second
                    edition of the former. In 1752 appeared <hi rend="italic">Select Exercises for
                    Young Proficients in the Mathematicks,</hi> and in 1757 his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Miscellaneous Tracts on Some Curious and Very Interesting Subjects in
                    Mechanics, Physical Astronomy, and Speculative Mathematics,</hi> the last and
                    perhaps the greatest of all his works. From the year 1735 he had sometimes under
                    his own name, sometimes under fictitious names, been a frequent contributor to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ladies' Diary,</hi> an annual publication partly devoted
                    to the solution of mathematical problems, and from 1754 till 1760 inclusive he
                    was the editor of it. From first to last Simpson seems to have had his own share
                    of the cares and anxieties of this world, and it is astonishing how under such
                    circumstances he contrived to accomplish what he did. His unremitting
                    application and the want of proper regimen gradually undermined his health, and
                    he died on the 14th of May 1761 at his native village. His name will probably be
                    considered the most illustrious in the long roll of the non-academical
                    mathematicians of Britain.</p>
