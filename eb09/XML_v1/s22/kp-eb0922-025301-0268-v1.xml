                    to a large extent moulded the subsequent political life of Athens, belongs to
                    the early part of the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><note

                    on an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the government of the aristocratic
                    families of Attica, one of which, however, that of the Alcmaeonids, was driven
                    into exile; and it preceded by a short interval the famous usurpation of
                    Pisistratus. Solon had won the confidence of his fellow-citizens by having
                    recovered for them the island of Salamis, close to the shores of Attica, an old
                    and valued possession, which their neighbours of Megara had taken from them.
                    Solon, himself a native of Salamis, encouraged them to fight once again for the
                    “lovely island,” as he called it, in a short poem which he publicly recited,
                    feigning, it is said, the excitement of a madman. Through Spartan intervention
                    in the war between Athens and Megara Salamis was restored to the Athenians, and
                    Solon had the credit of the result. In<pb break="no"

                    summoned under the constitutional title of “archon” to undertake the work of
                    sweeping political reforms, which, in consequence of bitter party strifes and
                    the poverty and indebtedness of the small farmers or proprietors of Attica, were
                    sorely needed. The Athenian like the Roman debtor had often sunk, under the
                    legalized oppression of his creditor, into an actual slave, and had from time to
                    time been sold and exported. Many poor creatures had fled away from home, and
                    were supporting themselves by the labour of their hands in foreign countries.
                    Many men who still clung to their little properties could, with all their
                    pinching, barely keep their heads above water. The governing classes themselves
                    felt that a crisis was at hand, and they appealed to Solon and made him
                    practically dictator. Had he chosen to work on the popular discontent, he might
                    have easily crushed the aristocracy and become a despot, or, as the Greeks
                    called it, a tyrant, as many had done in other states of Greece by coming
                    forward as champions of the people against the great ruling families. Solon
                    obeyed a nobler impulse and aimed at saving his country without too violent a
                    revolution. His first step was to give immediate relief to the poor debtor, to
                    the wretchedly impoverished small farmer or proprietor, and to interpose between
                    him and his creditor and landlord. On very many of the little properties of
                    Attica were to be seen stone pillars with the name of the mortgagee and the
                    amount of the mortgage inscribed on them. By a relief law, “a shaking-off of
                    burdens” (σεισαχθεία), he annulled all mortgages, justifying no doubt so extreme
                    a measure by the harshness of the contracts imposed by mortgagees on needy
                    tenants and proprietors and by the urgent necessity of prompt release for the
                    multitude of such small debtors. Thus the “mortgage pillars” were swept away and
                    the land was once more free. Such a setting aside of the rights of property,
                    expedient as it may have been under circumstances of acute public distress, must
                    have inflicted a heavy loss on the wealthier class, and the landlord and the
                    mortgagee would also have a fair claim for relief. This, it appears, Solon
                    accomplished by a device which has been variously explained, a depreciation of
                    the currency which relieved to a considerable extent—27 per cent., according to
                    Grote’s<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>History of
                    Greece, <hi rend="italic">ch. xi.</hi> according to a graduated scale of
                    property, the first class being alone eligible to the archonship or highest
                    office and to military and naval commands. The actual administration of public
                    affairs was thus restricted to the wealthy few. The second class were the
                    knights or horsemen—the men who could keep a war-horse for the service of the
                    state; these were assessed at three-fifths of the amount of the first class. The
                    third class answered to our yeomen, and had to serve as heavy-armed infantry.
                    These three classes were subject to direct taxation in the form of a graduated
                    income tax, which was, however, simply an extraordinary tax, levied only in
                    special emergencies at varying amounts per cent. on a citizen’s rateable
                    property, as set down in a public schedule. The fourth and lowest and most
                    numerous class, which supplied light troops and sailors for the fleet, was
                    exempt from all direct taxation, but paid indirect taxes; it would be made up of
                    small farmers, tradesmen, and artisans, and consist in fact of quite the poorest
                    and humblest class of citizens. Its members could not hold any office; but they
                    had a large amount of political power through their votes in the popular
                    assembly which elected the magistrates and called them to account, and through
                    the very great judicial powers with which they were intrusted, and in virtue of
                    which the Athenian juror practically decided questions both of fact and of law.
                    Solon’s constitution thus gave the people ample means of protecting themselves
                    from misgovernment and oppression, every magistrate being directly responsible
                    to them. Not that Solon himself contemplated anything like pure democracy; there
                    is every reason to believe he shrank from it; but pure democracy was pretty-sure
                    to follow as soon as the people distinctly realized their power. Solon’s council
                    of 400, taken exclusively from the first three classes, must have been meant to
                    furnish the popular assembly with political guidance, and this it did by
                    preparing and introducing measures for discussion and superintending its
                    meetings and exercising some direction over its proceedings. It is impossible
                    for us to define its peculiar functions precisely. It was, however, ultimately
                    under the control of the popular assembly, by which probably it was annually
                    elected, and to which it had annually to render an account. We are not to
                    suppose that either the council or the popular assembly-originated with Solon.
                    What he really did was to put them on a new footing, and to the latter, which
                    previously in all probability had hardly any weight or influence, he gave
                    greatly enlarged powers. The archons and magistrates and the council itself were
                    elected by the popular assembly, and were responsible to it for good behaviour
                    during their term of office. In this assembly met the citizens of all four
                    classes, and consequently the great majority of its members would be poor men
                    and almost peasants. The voting was by show of hands; every voter was allowed to
                    speak; and in the voting there was no distinction of classes, all being on a
                    perfectly equal footing. Although theoretically they could not originate any
                    measure, but had to accept for discussion what had been prepared for them by the
                    council, they had an absolute power of veto; and, as the election of the council
                    was in their hands, it must have been easy for them to get that body to bring
                    forward any proposal which they might wish to discuss. Thus it may be truly said
                    that Solon laid the foundation of the future democracy. And through the Heliaea,
                    as it was called,—a body of 6000 citizens annually elected by lot to act as
                    jurors for the trial specially of political offences,—the people acquired a
                    complete control over public affairs. There was but one proviso: the Athenian
                    juror must be upwards of thirty years of age. In the Athenian courts which were
                    formed out of these 6000 citizens the functions of judge and jury</p></note>
                    calculation— the wealthier debtors of the landlord and mortgagee class. Grote
                    here remarks that, had Solon cancelled all debts and contracts, there would have
                    been no need to interfere with the currency and lower the standard of money. His
                    relief law could not have been so sweeping and revolutionary as it has sometimes
                    been represented. There was no redistribution or confiscation of the land, no
                    universal remission of debts. For the great majority of the people indeed there
                    was substantial relief. The land was free from incumbrance, and the small
                    cultivator had a fresh start in life; there was no imprisonment or slavery for
                    the debtor; and it would seem that debtors who had sought refuge abroad were
                    purchased back and restored to their homes. Such on the whole appears to have
                    been the character of Solon’s first great reform, though some of the details
                    remain obscure. The reconstruction of the political system on the principle that
                    every citizen was to have a share in the government was Solon’s next work. A few
                    noble families, Eupatrids, as they were called, had hitherto had all the power
                    in their own hands. Solon made property the measure of political power, and
                    confined the higher offices of state to the wealthiest citizens; but election to
                    these offices was to be made by the whole body of the people, the tenure of
                    office was limited as to time, and an account had to be rendered publicly as to
                    its exercise. The citizens were distributed into four classes<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n270/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0270-0255"/> were united in one and the same person, and
                    political questions were continually decided when, as often happened, a citizen
                    was put on his trial for some alleged illegal or unconstitutional proposal. By
                    such means popular rights and privileges were effectually protected, and the
                    democratic character of the constitution enlarged and confirmed, as we see in
                    the subsequent history of Athens. Solon, indeed, retained (he did not create)
                    the famous senate of the Areopagus, and aimed at making it respected and capable
                    of exercising a general superintendence over the morals and social life of the
                    citizens. It was to be an aristocratic body, consisting only of archons who had
                    acquitted themselves well and honourably during their year of office. It seems
                    that he did not attempt to prescribe to it any special or particular duties, but
                    that he rather trusted to its making its influence felt from the fact that it
                    was, as every one knew, composed of men of acknowledged merit and ability.
                    Consequently, as Thirlwall observes (<hi rend="italic">Hist. of Gr.,</hi> ch.
                    xi.), “it could only exercise its powers with advantage as long as it retained
                    the confidence of its fellow-citizens; when that was lost it became time that
                    its legal authority should cease.” Solon evidently felt that, for a time at
                    least, there must be checks on popular government. Had it been hinted to him
                    that under his constitution power must finally drift down to the lowest social
                    stratum, he would perhaps have replied that he had endeavoured to supply the
                    entire people with a political training which should by degrees qualify them for
                    absolute self-government.</p>
                <p>Solon encouraged commerce and manufacturing industry, and drew a number of
                    settlers from foreign parts to Athens, on condition of their paying an annual
                    tax and putting themselves under the protection of a citizen who was to be their
                    legal representative—their “patronus,” according to Roman phrase. These settlers
                    (<hi rend="italic">μετoίκoι</hi>, “metics”) had none of the political privileges
                    of the Athenian citizen, and they could not acquire landed property. Many of
                    them, however, flourished and grew rich, and had every reason to be satisfied
                    with their position, which, in a kindly and tolerant community like that of
                    Athens, was continually improving. Solon, too, like all the legislators of
                    antiquity, endeavoured to regulate every department of life, compelling the
                    attendance of the youths from sixteen to eighteen at the public gymnastic
                    schools, and requiring them to serve the next two years on garrison duty.
                    Restraints were put upon women as to their appearance in public, and even as to
                    their mourning at funerals. Solon’s punishments were for the most part rather
                    lenient, and indicated a humane and generous temper. It is of course not to be
                    supposed that all the details of his legislation were maintained, but they
                    undoubtedly left their mark on the Athenian character.</p>
                <p>Having done his work, Solon left Athens and travelled for ten years in Egypt,
                    Cyprus, and Asia, gathering fresh stores of knowledge for himself and giving
                    counsel to others. One would like to believe the beautiful story Herodotus tells
                    of his interview with Croesus, king of Lydia, whom he warned with the memorable
                    saying that “we must not pronounce any man happy till we have seen his end.”
                    Unfortunately, Croesus did not begin to reign till several years after Solon’s
                    travels, and with Grote we must be content to take the story as merely an
                    “illustrative fiction.” On his return to Athens in his old age he found the old
                    feuds once more raging, and Pisistratus, his kinsman, and his friend in past
                    days, intriguing for power. The two men had, it seems, a sincere respect for one
                    another, but Solon protested against the complete surrender of the government to
                    Pisistratus, the danger of which he publicly pointed out, though without effect.
                    The crisis ended in the rule, in many respects an enlightened and beneficent
                    rule, of Pisistratus and his sons, of which Solon lived only to see the first
                    beginning. He died, soon after having made his honourable protest, at the age of
                    eighty, leaving behind him the good effects of a work which only a man of rare
                    intelligence and wide sympathies could have accomplished. He was something of a
                    poet, and several fragments of his poems, written generally with a practical
                    purpose, have come down to us, and throw light on his political aims and
                    sentiments.</p>
                <p>Grote and Thirlwall in their histories of Greece give a full account of Solon’s
                    legislation. Plutarch’s life of Solon, not a very critical performance, is our
                    chief original authority. (W. J. B.)</p>
