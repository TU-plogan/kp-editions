                <p><label type="entry">SIMONY</label> is an offence against the law of the church.
                    The name is taken from <hi rend="smallcaps">Simon Magus</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >q.v.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">.</hi> In the canon law the word bears a more
                    extended meaning than in English law. “Simony according to the canonists,” says
                    Ayliffe in his <hi rend="italic">Parergon,</hi> “is defined to be a deliberate
                    act or a premeditated will and desire of selling such things as are spiritual,
                    or of anything annexed unto spirituals, by giving something of a temporal nature
                    for the purchase thereof; or in other terms it is defined to be a commutation of
                    a thing spiritual or annexed unto spirituals by giving something that is
                    temporal.” An example of the offence occurs as early as the 3d century in the
                    purchase of the bishopric of Carthage by a wealthy matron for her servant, if
                    the note to Gibbon (vol. ii. p. 457) is to be believed. The offence was
                    prohibited by many councils, both in the East and in the West, from the 4th
                    century onwards. In the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris Canonici</hi> the
                    Decretum (pt. ii. cause i. quest. 3) and the Decretals (bk. V. tit. 3) deal with
                    the subject. The offender, whether <hi rend="italic">simoniacus</hi> (one who
                    had bought his orders) or <hi rend="italic">simoniace promotus</hi> (one who had
                    bought his promotion), was liable to deprivation of his benefice and deposition
                    from orders if a secular priest,—to confinement in a stricter monastery if a
                    regular. No distinction seems to have been drawn between the sale of an
                    immediate and of a reversionary interest. The innocent <hi rend="italic"
                    >simoniace promotus</hi> was, apart from dispensation, liable to the same
                    penalties as though he were guilty. Certain matters were simoniacal by the canon
                    law which would not be so regarded in English law, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    the sale of tithes, the taking of a fee for confession, absolution, marriage, or
                    burial, the concealment of one in mortal sin or the reconcilement of an
                    impenitent for the sake of gain, and the doing homage for spiritualities. So
                    grave was the crime of simony considered that even infamous persons could accuse
                    of it. English provincial and legatine constitutions continually assailed
                    simony. Thus one of the heads in Lyndewode (bk. v.) is, “Ne quis ecclesiam
                    nomine dotalitatis transferat vel pro praesentatione aliquid accipiat.” In spite
                    of all the provisions of the canon law it is well established that simony was
                    deeply rooted in the mediaeval church. Dante places persons guilty of simony in
                    the third bolgia of the eighth circle of the Inferno :—</p>
                <p>“O Simon mago, O miseri seguaci,</p>
                <p>Che le cose di Dio che di bontate Deono esser spose, voi rapaci</p>
                <p>Per oro e per argento adulterate.”— <hi rend="italic">Inf,</hi> xix. 1.<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0100-0085"/> The popes themselves were notorious offenders. In
                    the canto just cited Pope Nicholas III. is made by the poet the mouthpiece of
                    the simoniacs. He is supposed to mistake the poet for Boniface VIII., whose
                    simoniacal practices, as well as those of Clement V., are again alluded to in
                    Par. <hi rend="smallcaps">xxx</hi>. 147. At a later period there was an open and
                    continuous sale of spiritual offices by the Roman curia which contemporary
                    writers attacked in the spirit of Dante. A pasquinade against Alexander VI.
                    begins with the lines—</p>
                <p>“Vendit Alexander claves, altaria, Christum.</p>
                <p>Emerat ille prius; vendere jure potest.”</p>
                <p>Machiavelli calls luxury, simony, and cruelty the three dear friends and
                    handmaids of the same pope.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    simoniacal in its origin. In England this revenue was annexed to the crown by
                    Henry VIII. and restored to the church by Queen Anne (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Queen Anne’s Bounty).</hi></p>
                <p>For the purposes of English law simony is defined by Blackstone as the corrupt
                    presentation of any person to an ecclesiastical benefice for money, gift, or
                    reward. The offence is one of purely ecclesiastical cognizance, and not
                    punishable by the criminal law. The penalty is forfeiture by the offender of any
                    advantage from the simoniacal transaction, of his patronage by the patron, of
                    his benefice by the presentee. An innocent clerk is under no disability, as he
                    might be by the canon law. Simony may be committed in three ways,—in promotion
                    to orders, in presentation to a benefice, and in resignation of a benefice. The
                    common law (with which the canon law is incorporated, as far as it is not
                    contrary to the common or statute law or the prerogative of the crown) has been
                    considerably modified by statute. Where no statute applies to the case, the
                    doctrines of the canon law may still be of authority. Both Edward VI. and
                    Elizabeth promulgated advertisements against simony. The Act of 31 Eliz. c. 6
                    was intended to reach the corrupt patron as well as the corrupt clerk, the
                    ecclesiastical censures apart from the statute not extending to the case of a
                    patron. The first part of the Act deals with the penalties for election or
                    resignation of officers of churches, colleges, schools, hospitals, halls, and
                    societies for reward. The second part of the Act provides that if any person or
                    persons, bodies politic and corporate, for any sum of money, reward, gift,
                    profit, or benefit, directly or indirectly, or for or by reason of any promise,
                    agreement, grant, bond, covenant, or other assurances, of or for any sum of
                    money, &amp;c., directly or indirectly present or collate any person to any
                    benefice with cure of souls, dignity, prebend, or living ecclesiastical, or give
                    or bestow the same for or in respect of any such corrupt cause or consideration,
                    every such presentation, collation, gift, and bestowing, and every admission,
                    institution, investiture, and induction shall be void, frustrate, and of none
                    effect in law; and it shall be lawful for the queen to present, collate unto, or
                    give and bestow every such benefice, dignity, prebend, and living ecclesiastical
                    for that one time or turn only; and all and every person or persons, bodies
                    politic and corporate, that shall give or take any such sum of money, &amp;c.,
                    directly or indirectly, or that shall take or make any such promise, &amp;c.,
                    shall forfeit and lose the double value of one year’s profit of every such
                    benefice, &amp;c., and the person so corruptly taking, procuring, seeking, or
                    accepting any such benefice, &amp;c., shall be adjudged a disabled person in law
                    to have or enjoy the same benefice, &amp;c. Admission, institution,
                    installation, or induction of any person to a benefice, &amp;c., for any sum of
                    money, &amp;c., renders the offender liable to the penalty already mentioned.
                    But in this case the presentation reverts to the patron and not to the crown.
                    The penalty for corrupt resigning or exchanging of a benefice with cure of souls
                    is that the giver as well as the taker shall lose double the value of the sum so
                    given or taken, half the sum to go to the crown and half to a common informer.
                    The penalty for taking money, &amp;c., to procure ordination or to give orders
                    or licence to preach is a fine of £40; the party so corruptly ordained forfeits
                    £10; acceptance of any benefice within seven years after such corrupt entering
                    into the ministry makes such benefice merely void, and the patron may present as
                    on a vacancy; the penalties are divided as in the last case. The Act is
                    cumulative only, and does not take away or restrain any punishment prescribed by
                    ecclesiastical law. The Act of 1 Will. and M. sess. 1, c. 16, guards the rights
                    of an innocent successor in certain cases. It enacts that after the death of a
                    person simoniacally presented the offence or contract of simony shall not be
                    alleged or pleaded to the prejudice of any other patron innocent of simony, or
                    of his clerk by him presented, unless the person simoniac or simoniacally
                    presented was convicted of such offence at common law or in some ecclesiastical
                    court in the lifetime of the person simoniac or simoniacally presented. The Act
                    also declares the validity of leases made by a simoniac or
                    simoniacally-presented person, if <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> and for
                    valuable consideration to a lessee ignorant of the simony. By 13 Anne c. 11, if
                    any person shall for money, reward, gift, profit, or advantage, or for any
                    promise, agreement, grant, bond, covenant, or other assurance for any money,
                    &amp;c., take, procure, or accept the next avoidance of or presentation to any
                    benefice, dignity, prebend, or living ecclesiastical, and shall be presented or
                    collated thereupon, such presentation or collation and every admission,
                    institution, investiture, and induction upon the same shall be utterly void; and
                    such agreement shall be deemed a simoniacal contract, and the queen may present
                    for that one turn only; and the person so corruptly taking, &amp;c., shall be
                    adjudged disabled to have and enjoy the same benefice, &amp;c., and shall be
                    subject to any punishment limited by ecclesiastical law. 3 and 4 Vict. c. 113, §
                    42, provides that no spiritual person may sell or assign any patronage or
                    presentation belonging to him by virtue of any dignity or spiritual office held
                    by him; such sale or assignment is null and void. This section has been
                    construed to take away the old archbishop’s “option,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the right to present to a benefice in a newly appointed bishop’s
                    patronage at the option of the archbishop. By canon 40 of the canons of 1603 an
                    oath against simony was to be administered to every person admitted to any
                    spiritual or ecclesiastical function, dignity, or benefice. By 28 and 29 Vict.
                    c. 122 a declaration was substituted for the oath, and a new canon incorporating
                    the alteration was ratified by the crown in 1866. By the canon law all
                    resignation bonds were simoniacal, and in 1826 the House of Lords held that all
                    resignation bonds, general or special, were illegal. Special bonds have since,
                    however, been to a limited extent sanctioned by law. 9 Geo. IV. c. 94 makes a
                    written promise to resign valid if made in favour of some particular nominee or
                    one of two nominees, subject to the conditions that, where there are two
                    nominees, each of them must be either by blood or marriage an uncle, son,
                    grandson, brother, nephew, or grand-nephew of the patron, that the writing be
                    deposited with the registrar of the diocese open to public inspection, and that
                    the resignation be followed by presentation within six months of the person for
                    whose benefit the bond is made. Cases of simony have come before the courts in
                    which clergy of the highest rank have been implicated. In 1695, in the case of
                    Lucy <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> The Bishop of St David’s, the bishop was deprived
                    for simony. The Queen’s Bench refused a prohibition (1 Lord Raymond’s Rep. 447).
                    As lately as 1841 the dean of York was deprived by the archbishop for simony,
                    but in this case the Queen’s Bench granted a prohibition on the ground of
                    informality in the proceedings (In the Matter of the Dean of York, 2 <hi
                    rend="italic">Queen’s Bench Rep.,</hi> 1). The general result of the law
                    gathered from the statutes and decisions may be exhibited as follows :—(1) it is
                    not simony for a layman or spiritual person not purchasing for himself to
                    purchase while the church is full an advowson or next presentation, however
                    immediate the prospect of a vacancy; (2) it is not simony for a spiritual person
                    to purchase for himself a life or any greater estate in an advowson, and to
                    present himself thereto; (3) it is not simony to exchange benefices under an
                    agreement that no payment is to be made for dilapidations on either side; (4) it
                    is not simony to make certain assignments of patronage under the Church Building
                    and New Parishes Acts (9 and 10 Vict. c. 88, 32 and 33 Vict. c. 94), (5) it is
                    simony for any person to purchase the next presentation while the church is
                    vacant; (6) it is simony for a spiritual person to purchase for himself the next
                    presentation, though the church be full; (7) it is simony for any person to
                    purchase the next presentation, or in the case of purchase of an advowson the
                    next presentation by the purchaser will bo simoniacal if there is any
                    arrangement for causing a vacancy to be made; (8) it is simony for the purchaser
                    of an advowson while the church is vacant to present on the next presentation;
                    (9) it is simony to exchange otherwise than <hi rend="italic">simpliciter</hi>;
                    no compensation in money may be made to the person receiving the less valuable
                    benefice. The law on the subject of simony has been for some time regarded as
                    unsatisfactory by the authorities of the church. The archbishop of Canterbury
                    has undertaken to introduce into the House of Lords a bill for the amendment of
                    the law, the heads of which have recently (February 1886) been under the
                    consideration of convocation. The bill proposes <hi rend="italic">inter
                    alia</hi> to prohibit the sale of next presentations and of advowsons unless
                    under certain limitations, to abolish resignation bonds, and to substitute for
                    the present declaration against simony declarations that the presentee has not
                    committed certain specific acts.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0101-0086"/> In Scotland simony is an offence both by civil
                    and ecclesiastical law. The rules are generally those of the canon law. There
                    are few decisions of Scottish courts on the subject. By the Act of 1584, c. 5,
                    ministers, readers, and others guilty of simony provided to benefices were to be
                    deprived. An Act of Assembly of 1753 declares pactions simoniacal whereby a
                    minister or probationer before presentation and as a means of obtaining it
                    bargains not to raise a process of augmentation of stipend or demand reparation
                    or enlargement of his manse or glebe after induction. (J. W†. )</p>
