                <p><label type="entry">SOCRATES</label>, church historian. In the course of the last
                    twenty-five years (425-450) of the reign of Theodosius II. (the first thoroughly
                    Byzantine emperor) at least six church histories were written in Greek within
                    the limits of the Eastern empire,—those, namely, of Philostorgius the Arian, of
                    Philippus Sidetes, of Socrates, of Sozomen, of Theodoret, and of Hesychius. Of
                    these the first, no longer extant except in fragments, seems to have been the
                    most important. Those of Philip and of Hesychius (the former an untrustworthy
                    and dreary performance) have also perished. The remaining three are now our main
                    sources for church history from Constantine to Theodosius II. None of them has
                    ventured upon a fresh treatment of the period dealt with by Eusebius; all three
                    begin their narratives about the point where his closes. In the West the <hi
                    rend="italic">Church History</hi> of that author had already been continued by
                    Rufinus and his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> by Jerome, and the work of
                    Rufinus was certainly known to the Byzantines. Nor did these write independently
                    of each other, for <hi rend="smallcaps">Sozomen</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >q.v.)</hi> certainly had before him the work of Socrates, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Theodoret (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> knew one or both
                    of them. The three histories together became known in the West from the 6th
                    century through the selection which Cassiodorus caused to be made from them, and
                    it is to this selection (if we leave Rufinus and Jerome out of account) that the
                    Middle Ages were mainly indebted for all they knew of the Arian controversies,
                    and of the period generally between the councils of Nice and Ephesus.</p>

                    439, was written about, or at all events not later than, 440. He was born and
                    brought up at Constantinople; the date of his birth is uncertain, but it can
                    hardly have been before 385. Of the facts of his life we know practically
                    nothing, except that he was not a cleric but a “scholasticus” or advocate. Of

                    prologues to his first, second, fifth, and sixth books. It is dedicated to one
                    Theodoras, who had urged him to write such a history. He had no thorough
                    preparation for the task, and for the period down to the death of Constantius
                    (361) was practically dependent on Rufinus. His work finished, he became a
                    student of Athanasius and came to see how untrustworthy his guide had been. He
                    accordingly rewrote his first two books, and it is only this revision that has
                    reached us. The chief sources from which he drew were—(1) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Church History,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Life of Constantine,</hi> and the
                    theological works of Eusebius; (2) the <hi rend="italic">Church History</hi> of
                    Rufinus; (3) the works of Athanasius; (4) the no longer extant Συναγωγή των
                    Συνοδικων of the Macedonian and semi-Arian Sabinus,—a collection with
                    commentaries of acts of councils, brought down to the reign of Theodosius I.
                    (this was a main source); (5) collections of letters by members of the Arian and
                    orthodox parties; <hi rend="italic">(6)</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ancoratus
                    of</hi> Epiphanius; (7) works of Archelaus, Gregory of Laodicea, Evagrius,
                    Palladius, orations of Nestorius, &amp;c. Theological literature proper—as, for
                    example, the writings of the Cappadocians—he quite neglected. On the other hand,
                    he appears to have known some of Origen’s work, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apologia pro Origene</hi> of Pamphilus. It is to Origen and Origen’s immediate
                    disciples that he refers when he speaks of “the old church writers,” or of “the
                    Christian philosophers the last designation, however, also includes the monks.
                    Jeep alleges, but does not adduce any adequate proof, that Socrates made use of
                    Philostorgius. As regards profane history his materials were exceedingly
                    defective. Thus, for example, he confesses his reason for not relating the
                    political history of Constantine to be that he has been unable to ascertain
                    anything about it. Jeep has instituted an examination into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fasti,</hi> containing historical notes, made use of by our author with the
                    following results. His chronological data with the facts he appends to them are
                    of the highest value, especially in those cases where, as sometimes happens,
                    data are preserved which are less precisely given in other fasti and chronicles.
                    Somewhere about the year 395-400 his use of these precisely dated records of
                    profane history comes to an end. From this point his information is purely
                    ecclesiastical (dates of ordination and death of bishops and the like); that is
                    to say, he makes use of church fasti. The secular fasti of Socrates come down
                    precisely to the same point as those which lay in the first rank before
                    Idatius.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    wrong, the error arising not from any systematic source but merely from
                    carelessness. It is not altogether impossible, however, after all that Socrates
                    may have taken the historical data of his fasti at second hand from the profane
                    historians. He certainly made use of Eutropius; but that he had any recourse to
                    Eunapius and Olympiodorus is more doubtful, and indeed would be quite improbable
                    if it could be proved that he had Philostorgius before him. There is no evidence
                    of his having known the works of Dexippus and Zosimus. But he is greatly
                    indebted to oral tradition and to the testimony of eyewitnesses, especially of
                    members of the Novatian community in Constantinople; something also he has set
                    down from personal knowledge. The contents of the closing books are for the most
                    part derived from oral tradition, from the narratives of friends and countrymen,
                    from what was still generally known and current in the capital about past
                    events, and from the ephemeral literature of the day.</p>
                <p>The theological position of Socrates, so far as he can he said to have had one,
                    is at once disclosed in his unlimited admiration for Origen. All the enemies of
                    the great Alexandrian he regards merely as empty and vain obscurantists; for the
                    orthodoxy of his hero he appeals to Athanasius. Closely connected with his high
                    regard for Origen are his appreciation of science generally and the moderation
                    of his judgment on all dogmatic questions. According to him, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ἑλληvικὴ παιδeία</hi> is quite indispensable within the church; many Greek
                    philosophers were not far from the knowledge of God, as is proved by their
                    triumphant arguments against atheists and gainsayers of divine providence. The
                    apostles did not set themselves against the study of Greek literature and
                    science; Paul had even made a thorough study of them himself. The Scriptures, it
                    is true, contain all that appertains to faith and life, but give no clue to the
                    art of confuting gainsayers. Greek science, therefore, must not be banished from
                    the church, and the tendency within the church so to deal with it is wrong. This
                    point of view was the common one of the majority of educated Christians at that
                    period, and is not to he regarded as exceptionally liberal. The same holds true
                    of the position of Socrates in regard to dogmatic questions. On the one hand,
                    indeed, orthodoxy and heresy are symbolized to his mind by the wheat and the
                    tares respectively; he clings to the naive opinion of Catholicism, that
                    contemporary orthodoxy has prevailed within the church from the first; he
                    recognizes the true faith only in the mystery of the Trinity; he judges heretics
                    who have been already condemned as interlopers, as impudent innovators, actuated
                    by bad and self-seeking motives; he apologizes for having so much as treated of
                    Arianism at all in his history of the church; he believes in the inspiration of
                    the ecclesiastical councils as much as in that of the Scriptures themselves.
                    But, on the other hand, he takes absolutely no interest in dogmatical subtleties
                    and clerical disputes; he regards them as the source of great evils, and
                    expresses his craving for peace: “one ought to adore the ineffable mystery in
                    silence.” This attitude, which was that of most educated Byzantine laymen, has
                    in particular cases made it possible for him to arrive at very free judgments.
                    Even granting that some feeble remains of antique reserve may have contributed
                    to this, and even although some of it is certainly to be set down to his
                    disposition and temperament, still it was his religious passivity that here
                    determined the character of Socrates and made him a typical example of the later
                    Byzantine Christianity. If Socrates had lived about the year 325, he certainly
                    would not have ranked himself on the side of Athanasius, but would have joined
                    the party of mediation. But—the ὁ <hi rend="italic">μooύσιoς</hi> has been laid
                    down, and must be recognized as correctly expressing the mystery; only one ought
                    to rest satisfied with that word and with the repudiation of Arianism. Anything
                    more, every new distinction, is mischievous. The controversy in its details is a
                    <hi rend="italic">vυκτoμaχίa</hi> to him, full of misunderstandings. Sometimes
                    he gives prominence, and correctly, to the fact that the disputants partially
                    failed to understand one another, because they had separate interests at
                    heart,—those on the one side desiring above everything to guard against
                    polytheism, those on the other being most afraid of Sabellianism. He did not
                    fail, however, to recognize also that the controversies frequently had their
                    root in mere emulation, slander, and sophistry. Not unfrequently he passes very
                    sharp judgments on whole groups of bishops. In the preface to his fifth book he
                    excuses his trenching on the region of political history on the ground of his
                    desire to spare his readers the disgust which perusal of the endless disputes of
                    the bishops could not fail to excite, and in that to his sixth book he prides
                    himself on never having flattered even the orthodox bishops. This attitude of
                    his has given him a certain measure of impartiality. Constantius, and even
                    Julian—not Valens, it is true—are estimated very fairly. The Arian Goths who
                    died for their religion are recognized as genuine martyrs. His characterizations
                    of Cyril and Nestorius, and his narrative and criticism of the beginnings of the
                    Christological controversy, are models of candour and historical
                    conscientiousness. In frequent instances, moreover, he acknowledges his own
                    incompetency to give an opinion and hands the question over to the clergy. For
                    the clergy as a whole, in spite of his criticism of individuals, he has the very
                    highest respect, as also for the monks, without himself making any inordinate
                    religious professions. In a special excursus of considerable length he has paid
                    a tribute of the highest order to monachism, and in his characterization of
                    Theodosius II. also (where he has made use of the brightest colours) he does not
                    fail to point out that in piety the emperor could almost compete with the monks.
                    But, apart from these two chapters (iv. 23, vii. 22), it is but seldom that one
                    could learn from the pages of Socrates that there was such a thing as
                    monasticism in those days. To his mind the convent is not far removed from the
                    church, and as a layman he is not at all inclined to accept the principles of
                    monachism as applying to himself or to square his views of history in accordance
                    with them. He has even gone so far as formally to express his sympathy with
                    Paphnutius, the champion of the right of bishops to marry.</p>
                <p>As a source for the period within which he wrote, the work of Socrates is of the
                    greatest value, but as “history” it disappoints even the most modest
                    expectations. Eusebius, after all, had some conception of what is meant by
                    “church history,” but Socrates has none. “As long as there is peace there is no
                    material for a history of the church”; but, on the other hand, neither do
                    heresies by rights<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n255/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0255-0240"/> come into the story. What, then, is left for it?
                    A collection of anecdotes and a series of episodes. In point of fact this is the
                    view actually taken by Socrates. His utter want of care and consistency appears
                    most clearly in his vacillation as to the relations between ecclesiastical and
                    political history. At one time he brings in politics, at another he excuses
                    himself from doing so. He has not failed to observe that church and state act
                    and react upon each other; but he has no notion how the relation ought to be
                    conceived. Nevertheless his whole narrative follows the thread of political—that
                    is to say, of imperial—history. This indeed is characteristic of his Byzantine
                    Christian point of view; church history becomes metamorphosed into a history of
                    the emperors and of the state, because a special church history is at bottom
                    impossible. But even so one hardly hears anything about state or court except
                    great enterprises and anecdotes. Political insight is wholly wanting to
                    Socrates; all the orthodox emperors blaze forth in a uniform light of dazzling
                    splendour; even the miserable Arcadius is praised, and Theodosius II. figures as
                    a saint whose exemplary piety turned the capital into a church. If in addition
                    to all this we bear in mind that in his later books the historian’s horizon is
                    confined to the city and patriarchate of Constantinople, that he was exceedingly
                    ill informed on all that related to Rome and the West, that in order to fill out
                    his pages he has introduced narratives of the most unimportant description, that
                    in not a few instances he has evinced his credulity (although when compared with
                    the majority of his contemporaries he is still entitled to be called critical),
                    it becomes sufficiently clear that his <hi rend="italic">History,</hi> viewed as
                    a whole and as a literary production, can at best take only a secondary place.
                    One great excellence, however, cannot be denied him, his honest and sincere
                    desire to be impartial. He tried also, as far as he could, to distinguish
                    between the certain, the probable, the doubtful, and the untrue. He made no
                    pretence to be a searcher of hearts and frequently declines to analyse motives.
                    He has made frank confession of his nescience, and in certain passages his
                    critical judgment and sober sense and circumspection are quite striking. He
                    writes a plain and unadorned style and shuns superfluous words. Occasionally
                    even there are touches of good humour and of trenchant satire,—always the sign
                    of an honest writer. In short, the rule to be applied in the criticism of
                    Socrates is that his learning and knowledge can be trusted only a little but his
                    goodwill and straightforwardness a great deal. Considering the circumstances
                    under which he wrote and the miseries of the time, it can only be matter for
                    congratulation that such a man should have become our informant and that his
                    work has been preserved to us.</p>
                <p>Finally, it is to be noted that Socrates was either himself originally a
                    Novatianist who had afterwards joined the Catholic Church, or that whether
                    through his ancestors or by education he had stood in most intimate relations
                    with the Novatianist Church. In his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> he betrays
                    great sympathy with that body, has gone with exactness into its history in
                    Constantinople and Phrygia, and is indebted for much of the material of his work
                    to Novatianist tradition and to his intercourse with prominent members of the
                    sect. Both directly and indirectly he has declared that Novatianists and
                    Catholics are brothers, that as such they ought to seek the closest relations
                    with one another, and that the former ought to enjoy all the privileges of the
                    latter. His efforts, however, had only this result, that he himself afterwards
                    fell under suspicion of Novatianism. For bibliography, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
