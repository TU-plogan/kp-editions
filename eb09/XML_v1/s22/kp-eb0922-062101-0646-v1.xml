                <p><label type="entry">SUFFOLK</label>, the most easterly county in England, is
                    bounded E. by the North Sea, N. by Norfolk, W. by Cambridge, and S. by Essex,
                    the boundaries being chiefly the sea and rivers; it has somewhat the shape of a
                    half moon. Its greatest length north to south from Yarmouth to Landguard Point
                    is about 50 miles, and its average length about 30; its greatest breadth from
                    east to west is about 55 miles. The total area of the county is 944,060 acres,
                    or 1475 square miles.</p>
                <p>The principal geological formations are the Chalk and the Tertiaries, but they
                    are frequently overlaid by drift. The surface is for the most part flat or
                    slightly undulating. In the extreme north-west round Mildenhall it joins the fen
                    country. The fen land is bordered by a low range of chalk hills extending from
                    Haverhill by Newmarket and Bury St Edmunds to Thetford. The Chalk extends
                    eastwards, but towards the south passes under the London clay and crag, which
                    adjoins the mouths of the principal rivers and extends from Sudbury by Ipswich
                    to Aldeburgh. The easterly slopes of the Chalk are also overlaid by beds of
                    clay, as well as by post-Glacial gravels, in which flint implements and other
                    indications of the presence of prehistoric man have been found. The most
                    interesting deposits are, however, those of the crag of the late Miocene and
                    Pliocene periods, resting on the London clay, or, where it overlaps, on the
                    Chalk. At the base of the crag resting on the London clay is the famous Suffolk
                    bone bed. The coast-line has a length of about 52 miles, and is comparatively
                    regular, with only slight convexities towards the sea, the bays being generally
                    shallow and the headlands rounded and only slightly prominent. The estuaries of
                    the Deben, Orwell, and Stour are, however, of some length. The shore is
                    generally low and marshy, with occasional clay and sand cliffs. The rivers
                    flowing northwards are the Lark in the north-west corner, which passes in a
                    north-westerly direction to the Great Ouse in Norfolk; the Little Ouse or
                    Brandon, also a tributary of the Great Ouse, flowing by Thetford and Brandon and
                    forming part of the northern boundary of the county; and the Waveney, which
                    rises in Norfolk and forms the boundary between that county and Suffolk, from
                    Palgrave till it falls into the mouth of the Yare at Yarmouth. The Waveney is
                    navigable from Bungay, and by means of Lake Lothing also communicates with
                    Lowestoft. The rivers flowing in a south-easterly direction to the North Sea are
                    the Blyth; the Alde or Ore, which has a course for a long distance parallel to
                    the seashore, and has its port at Orford; the Deben, from Debenham, flowing past
                    Woodbridge, up to which it is navigable; the Orwell or Gipping, which is
                    navigable to Stowmarket, whence it flows past Needham Market and Ipswich; and
                    the Stour, which forms nearly the whole southern boundary of the county,
                    receiving the Brett, which flows past Lavenham and Hadleigh; it is navigable
                    from Sudbury and has an important port at Harwich. The county has no valuable
                    minerals. Cement is dug for Roman cement; and lime and whiting are obtained in
                    various districts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Suffolk is one of the most fertile counties
                    in England. In the 18th century it was famed for its dairy products. The high
                    prices of corn during the wars of the French Revolution led to the extensive
                    breaking up of its pastures, and it is now one of the principal corn-growing
                    counties in England. There is considerable variety of soils, and consequently in
                    modes of farming, in different parts of the county. Along the sea-coast a sandy
                    loam or thin sandy soil prevails, covered in some places with heath, on which
                    large quantities of sheep are fed, and interspersed with tracts, more or less
                    marshy, on which cattle are grazed. The best land adjoins the rivers, and
                    consists of a rich sandy loam, with patches of lighter and easier soil. In the
                    south-west and the centre is much fine corn land, having mostly a clay subsoil,
                    but not so tenacious as the clay in Essex. In climate Suffolk is one of the
                    driest of the English counties, the rainfall being only half that of the
                    counties in the west. Towards the north-west the soil is generally poor,
                    consisting partly of sand on chalk and partly of peat and open heath.</p>
                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1886, 780,448 acres or nearly
                    five-sixths of the total area were under cultivation, 363,641 being under corn
                    crops, 120,256 under green crops, 94,893 clover and rotation grasses, 174,970
                    permanent pasture, 19 flax, 57 hops, and 26,612 fallow. Wheat and barley are the
                    most important of the corn crops, having an area of 118,873 and 151,630
                    respectively. Of green crops only 2452 were under potatoes, while 55,434 were
                    under turnips and swedes, 36,211 under mangold, 852 under carrots, 4100 under
                    cabbage, and 21,207 under vetches,—figures which indicate that much attention is
                    paid to the winter feeding of cattle. Horses in 1886 numbered 42,617, of which
                    32,262 were used solely for purposes of agriculture. The breed known as Suffolk
                    punches is one of the most valued for agricultural purposes in England (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Agriculture,</hi> vol. i. p. 385). Cattle numbered 70,695, of
                    which 23,652 were cows and heifers in milk or in calf, and 17,322 other cattle
                    two years old and above. The breed native to the county is a polled variety, on
                    the improvement of which great pains have been bestowed in recent years. The old
                    Suffolk cows, famous for their great milking qualities, were of various colours,
                    yellow predominating. The improved are all red. Much milk is now sent to London,
                    Yarmouth, &amp;c. Many cattle, mostly imported from Ireland, are grazed in the
                    winter. The sheep are nearly all of the black-faced improved Suffolk breed, a
                    cross between the old Norfolk horned sheep and Southdowns. Sheep numbered
                    433,986, of which 230,954 were one year old and above. Suffolk is famous<pb

                    compact, and black in colour. Pigs numbered 121,866 in 1886.</p>

                <p>Thus in 1875 there were in all 9714 holdings with 767,085 acres, and in 1885 9357
                    with 782,019 acres. According to the latest landowners <hi rend="italic"
                    >Return</hi> (1873) Suffolk was divided among 19,276 proprietors, holding
                    920,268 acres, at a valued rental of £1,784,827, or an average all over of about
                    £1, 18s. 9½d. per acre. Of the owners 12,511 or nearly three-fourths possessed
                    less than one acre each. The following possessed over 10,000 acres each :—Lord
                    Rendlesham, 19,869; George Tomline, 18,473; marquis of Bristol, 16,954; the
                    maharajah Dhuleep H. H. Singh, 14,615; Lord Hunt-ingfield, 11,713; earl of
                    Stradbroke, 11,697; Sir Richard Wallace, 11,223; Lord Henniker, 10,910.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The river navigation affords means of
                    communication with different ports, and supplies facilities for a considerable
                    amount of traffic. The county is intersected in all directions by branches of
                    the Great Eastern Railway, which touch at almost every town of importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Trade. —</hi> The county is essentially
                    agricultural, and the most important manufactures relate to this branch of
                    industry. They include that of agricultural implements, especially at Ipswich,
                    Bury St Edmunds, and Stowmarket, and that of artificial manures at Ipswich and
                    Stowmarket, for which coprolites are dug. Malting is extensively carried on
                    throughout the county. There is a gun-cotton manufactory at Stowmarket, and gun
                    flints are still made at Brandon. At different towns a variety of small
                    miscellaneous manufactures are carried on, including silk, cotton, linen,
                    woollen, and horsehair and cocoa-nut matting. The principal ports are Yarmouth
                    (situated chiefly in Norfolk), Lowestoft, Southwold, Aldeburgh, Woodbridge, and
                    Ipswich. Yarmouth is one of the most important fishing stations on the east
                    coast of England; within the county Lowestoft is the chief fishing town.
                    Herrings and mackerel are the fish most abundant on the coasts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Popidation. —</hi> Suffolk comprises 21
                    hundreds; the boroughs of Beccles (pop. 5721), which has several large mattings;
                    Bury St Edmunds (16,111), the chief town in West Suffolk; Eye (2296), an ancient
                    market town; Ipswich (50,546), the largest town and principal port of the
                    county; Aldeburgh (2106), the birthplace of Crabbe; Southwold (2107), a fishing
                    town and bathing resort; the largest part (5855) of Sudbury (6584), a market and
                    manufacturing town; and small portions of the boroughs of Thetford and Great
                    Yarmouth, which are situated chiefly in Norfolk. The other principal towns are
                    Hadleigh (3237), with a considerable trade in corn and malt; Haverhill (3685)
                    (partly in Essex), of great antiquity, and possessing important silk
                    manufactures; Lowestoft (16,755), a port and fishing station; Stowmarket (4052);
                    and Woodbridge (4544), with some coasting trade. Suffolk is divided into
                    geldable portions, in which the sovereign has the chief rights, and liberties.
                    The liberties are those of St Etheldreda, St Edmund, and the dukedom of Norfolk.
                    The court of quarter sessions is at Ipswich for the eastern division and by
                    adjournment at Bury St Edmunds for the western. There are nineteen petty and
                    sessional divisions. The hundreds of Hartismere and Stow and the borough of Eye
                    are for petty sessional purposes included in the eastern division, and for other
                    purposes in the western. The boroughs of Bury St Edmunds, Ipswich, Great
                    Yarmouth, and Sudbury have commissions of the peace and separate courts of
                    quarter sessions; and Eye and Southwold have commissions of the peace. For
                    parliamentary purposes the county was until 1885 divided into East and West
                    Suffolk, but it now constitutes five divisions, each returning one member, viz.,
                    North or Lowestoft division, North-east or Eye, North-west or Stowmarket, South
                    or Sudbury, and South-east or Woodbridge. Bury St Edmunds returns one member and
                    Ipswich two; Eye, which formerly returned one member, was merged in the
                    North-east division of the county in 1885. The county contains 517 civil
                    parishes with parts of 7 others. It is mostly in the diocese of Norwich. From
                    214,404 in 1801 the population had increased by 1821 to 271,541, by 1841 to
                    315,073, by 1861 to 337,070, and by 1881 to 356,893, of whom 174,606 were males
                    and 182,287 females. The number of persons to an acre was 0·38 and of acres to a
                    person 2·65.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> The district which now includes
                    Norfolk, Suffolk, and a portion of Cambridge, and afterwards formed East Anglia,
                    had in early times, on account of the marshes to the west, practically the
                    character of a peninsula. It was inhabited by the Iceni, who had their capital
                    at Icklingham, in the north-west of Suffolk. Of the numerous barrows and tumuli
                    belonging to this period mention may be made of those at Fornham St Geneveve and
                    those between Aldeburgh and Snape. Many of the mediaeval castles were built on
                    ancient mounds. The district submitted to the Romans during the campaign of
                    Aulus Plautius, and, although the Iceni joined the Trinobantes under Boadicea,
                    the resistance made was ultimately fruitless. A Roman road from London crossed
                    the centre of Suffolk northwards by Stratford St Mary, Needham Market, and
                    Billingford (Norfolk) to Norwich, another passing in a more westerly direction
                    to Thetford. Walton, where important Roman relics have been found, Dunwich
                    (possibly <hi rend="italic">Sitomagus),</hi> and Burgh Castle (probably <hi
                    rend="italic">Combretonium),</hi> one of the most perfect specimens of a Roman
                    fort in England, enclosing an area of five acres, are supposed to have been
                    Roman fortified stations erected for the defence of the Saxon shore. Other Roman
                    stations were at Stratford St Mary, Thetford, and Icklingham. The capital of the
                    kingdom of East Anglia was at Dunwich in Suffolk. Afterwards East Anglia was
                    divided into Norfolk and Suffolk. Sigebert established an ecclesiastical diocese
                    at Dunwich in 630, and erected a palace and a church partly out of the Roman
                    remains. The earldom of Norfolk and Suffolk was bestowed by the Conqueror on
                    Ralph le Guader. Though Suffolk suffered from incursions of the Danes, they did
                    not effect a complete subjugation of it. The prevailing terminations of the
                    place names are Anglian. The remains of old castles are comparatively
                    unimportant, the principal being the entrenchments and part of the walls of
                    Bungay, the ancient stronghold of the Bigods; the picturesque ruins of
                    Mettingham, built by John de Norwich in the reign of Edward III.; Wingfield,
                    surrounded by a deep moat, with the turret walls and the drawbridge still
                    existing; the splendid ruin of Framlingham, with high and massive walls,
                    originally founded in the 6th century, but restored in the 12th; the outlines of
                    the extensive fortress of Clare Castle, anciently the baronial residence of the
                    earls of Clare; and the fine Norman keep of Orford Castle, on an eminence
                    overlooking the sea. Among the many fine residences within the county there are
                    several interesting examples of domestic architecture of the reigns of Henry
                    VIII. and Elizabeth. Throughout its whole history the annals of Suffolk have
                    been comparatively uneventful. It adhered with Norfolk to the cause of the
                    Parliament. James duke of York twice defeated the Dutch off the coast,—viz., Van
                    Tromp off Lowestoft on 3d June 1665 and De Ruyter in Southwold Bay on 28th May
                    1672. Of monastic remains the most important are those of the great Benedictine
                    abbey of Bury St Edmunds, noticed under that town; the college of Clare,
                    originally a cell to the abbey of Bec in Normandy and afterwards to St Peter’s,
                    Westminster, converted into a college of secular canons in the reign of Henry
                    VI., and still retaining much of its ancient architecture, and now used as a
                    boarding-school; the decorated gateway of the Augustinian priory of Butley; and
                    the remains of the Grey Friars monastery at Dunwich. A peculiarity of the church
                    architecture is the use of flint for purposes of ornamentation, often of a very
                    elaborate kind, especially on the porches and parapets of the towers. Another
                    characteristic is the round towers, which are confined to East Anglia, but are
                    considerably more numerous in Norfolk than in Suffolk, the principal being those
                    of Little Saxham and Herringfleet, both good examples of Norman. It is
                    questionable whether there are any remains of Saxon architecture in the county.
                    The Decorated is well represented, but by far the greater proportion of the
                    churches are Perpendicular, special features being the open roofs and woodwork
                    and the fine fonts.</p>
