                    Lady Dorothy Sidney, eldest daughter of Robert, second earl of Leicester. He was
                    born in 1640 and succeeded his father (who was killed at Newbury) in the title
                    on 20th September 1643. During the years 1671-73 he acted as ambassador at
                    Madrid, Paris, and Cologne consecutively, and in 1678 went to Paris as
                    ambassador<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n685/mode/1up"

                    life that he acquired that suppleness of feeling and love of finesse which may
                    be traced throughout his subsequent career. From February 1679 to January 1681,
                    a period when the country was rent in twain by real or fancied dangers to the
                    Protestant faith, he held the post of secretary of state for the northern
                    department; but his conduct in office was not marked by discretion. He voted for
                    the exclusion of the duke of York from the succession to the throne, and the
                    ill-feeling which this action created in the mind of Charles II. was augmented
                    by the overtures which Sunderland made to the prince of Orange, whilst
                    differences of opinion on the subject of the Exclusion Bill brought about a
                    fierce quarrel between Sunderland and Halifax, the head of the “trimmers.” Early
                    in 1683, having been reconciled to the duke of York and having secured a warm
                    friend in the duchess of Portsmouth, Sunderland regained his place as secretary
                    for the northern department. When James II. succeeded to the throne, Sunderland
                    became secretary for the southern department, from March 1685 to 27th October
                    1688, for most of which period he held the additional post of president of the
                    council, and was a member of the high commission for ecclesiastical causes. He
                    afterwards claimed that he had used his influence to mitigate the proceedings of
                    this obnoxious body, but he went sufficiently far with his royal master to sign
                    the warrant for the committal of the bishops and to appear as a witness against
                    them. Though Lord Sunderland was in sympathy, if not in actual communion, with
                    Roman Catholicism, he hesitated to commit himself entirely to the acts of the
                    fierce devotees who surrounded James II., and through their opposition he was
                    dismissed in disgrace and sought security in Holland. He had been too much
                    engaged in the acts of James II. to find a place among the advisers of William
                    and Mary.</p>
                <p>The visit which William paid to Althorp in Northamptonshire, the country seat of
                    Sunderland, in 1695 was the prelude of a reconciliation between the king and his
                    ambitious subject and of Sunderland’s recall into public affairs. From April to
                    December 1697 he discharged the duties of lord chamberlain of the household and
                    for the greater part of that time he was also lord justice of England; but he
                    finally retired from active life in the close of 1697 through disgust at the
                    check which William received in the retention of a standing army. The rest of
                    his life was passed in strict seclusion at Althorp, and there he died on 28th
                    September 1702.</p>
                <p>Lord Sunderland possessed a keen intellect and was consumed by intense
                    restlessness; but his character was wanting in steadfastness, and he yielded too
                    easily to opposition. His adroitness in intrigue and his fascinating manners
                    were exceptional even in an age when such qualities formed part of every
                    statesman’s education; but the characteristics which ensured him success in the
                    House of Lords and in the royal closet led to failure in his attempts to
                    understand the feelings of the mass of his countrymen. Consistency of conduct
                    was not among the objects which he aimed at, nor did he shrink from thwarting in
                    secret a policy which he supported in public. A large share of the discredit
                    attaching to the measures of James II. must be assigned to the earl of
                    Sunderland.</p>
