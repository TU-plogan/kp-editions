                <p><label type="entry">SKELETON</label>. T <hi rend="smallcaps">he</hi> word
                    “skeleton,” meaning in Greek a mummy, is popularly taken to denote that
                    assemblage of bones and cartilages which forms the internal support of the body
                    of man and of the animals more or less nearly resembling him. A slight
                    acquaintance with the structure of these animals, however, seems to make it
                    evident that a wider signification must be given to the term, since parts which
                    in man and many of his animal allies are bony or cartilaginous may be only
                    membranous in other such animals; and, conversely, parts sometimes quite
                    external, which are merely membranous in man and many animals, may in others
                    assume the structure of horn or bone or may contain bones or cartilages. The
                    word skeleton may indeed be taken to denote both a more or less firm and
                    complete <hi rend="italic">external</hi> protection to a living body, and also a
                    more or less firm and complete <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> support to such
                    body.</p>
                <p>In this very wide sense even many vegetal structures may be said to possess a
                    skeleton. For all plants which can sustain themselves in an upgrowth from the
                    ground obviously both require and possess solid structures—various groups and
                    varieties of woody fibres—to support such an upgrowth. Organs also, such as
                    leaves, which need to be maintained in the form of a thin flat expanse, require
                    and possess bundles of fibres (vulgarly called veins) which are even popularly
                    said to constitute the skeleton of the leaf. Many plants form such skeletal
                    structures largely of silex, as do the grasses and the horsetails <hi
                    rend="italic">(Equisetum),</hi> and others invest themselves to a greater or
                    less degree with carbonate of lime, as do some <hi rend="italic">Algae,</hi>
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Corallina</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Melobesia,</hi>
                    while the <hi rend="italic">Desmidiae</hi> clothe themselves with a horny coat.
                    Ordinarily, however, the word skeleton is only used to denote certain animal
                    structures, and mainly such structures as form the skeleton of man and of
                    creatures so nearly allied to him as to constitute, together with him, that
                    primary division of animals known as backboned animals or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>It is to a concise description of the skeleton as it exists in Vertebrates
                    generally that this article is devoted. For the details of the human skeleton
                    the reader is referred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy.</hi> In
                    order, however, that its condition in Vertebrate animals may be better
                    understood, it will be well briefly to point out some of the more important
                    varieties of condition presented by the protecting or supporting parts of the
                    body of the lower, or Invertebrate, animals.<pb break="no"

                <p>A great and fundamental distinction exists, however, between those lowly
                    organisms known as <hi rend="italic">Protozoa</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hypozoa—</hi> which are generally reckoned as animals—on the one hand and all
                    the higher forms, both Vertebrate and Invertebrate, on the other. It is a
                    distinction which renders it difficult to regard any skeletal structures of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Hypozoa</hi> as answering to, in the sense of being the
                    homologues<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Homologous
                    parts,” or “homologues,” are parts of an organism which correspond in relative
                    position, that is, in their relation to surrounding structures, whether or not
                    they serve the same ends. They thus differ from “analogous parts,” which are
                    parts performing similar functions whether or not they agree as to their
                    relations of position to surrounding structures. Thus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the nail of a man’s middle toe and the hind hoof of a horse are
                    “homologous parts,” but the hoot, as the support of. the body and agent in
                    locomotion, is analogous to the whole foot of a man.</p></note> of, any of the
                    skeletal structures of higher animals. This great fundamental distinction
                    consists in the fact that the bodies of all the higher animals are made up of
                    distinct “tissues,” which are derived from three different layers of cells, of
                    which the embryos of all<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Certain Coelenterate animals consist but of two layers.</p></note> of them
                    are for a time composed, whereas the bodies of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hypozoa</hi> either consist of but a single cell or else of a smaller or larger
                    number of cells more or less loosely aggregated and not forming any distinct
                    tissue. It follows of course that their reproduction does not take place by
                    means of embryos formed of cellular layers.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless the <hi rend="italic">Hypozoa</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protozoa</hi> may exhibit very distinct protective structures. Thus the
                    outermost layer of the substance of an <hi rend="italic">Amoeba,</hi> called its
                    ectosarc, is of a firmer consistency than its interior, and it may in allied
                    forms take on a chitinous character or become quite hard through the deposition
                    within it of calcareous salts (as in the sometimes singularly complex shells of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera)</hi> or form symmetrical cases of
                    silica.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Radiolaria,</hi> the skeleton of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protozoa</hi> attains its maximum of beauty and complexity. It consists of
                    spicules which are generally siliceous, but may consist of a peculiar firm
                    organic substance termed “acanthin.” The spicules arrange themselves in an
                    extraordinarily symmetrical manner, generally radiating from the central portion
                    of the organism and being connected with one or more series of encircling
                    spicules which may constitute a series of concentric spheres.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="italic">Infusoria</hi> we also find examples of a hardening
                    of the external cuticle, as in <hi rend="italic">Tintinus lagcnula</hi> and in
                    some other forms.</p>
                <p>When we pass to that vast group of animals—the <hi rend="italic">Metazoa—</hi>
                    which includes all but the <hi rend="italic">Protozoa</hi> (and all those
                    therefore the bodies of which are formed of tissues derived from the three
                    primitive layers), a distinction again requires to be drawn between the Sponges
                    <hi rend="italic">(Porifera),</hi> which constitute its lowest group, and all
                    higher forms. The three primitive or germinal layers of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metazoa</hi> are termed respectively—(1) the epiblast, (2) the mesoblast, and
                    (3) the hypoblast. Of these three layers the epiblast and the hypoblast are to
                    be regarded as primary.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See F. Balfour’s <hi rend="italic">Comparative Embryology,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    103.</p></note> The epiblast is essentially the primitive integument, and its
                    cells give rise to the epidermis and cuticle and to the organs of sense. The
                    hypoblast is essentially the digestive layer, and gives rise to the epithelium
                    lining the alimentary canal. The mesoblast seems to originate from one or both
                    of the two preceding layers, and gives rise to the general substance of the
                    body—including that part of the skin which is beneath the epidermis, the
                    muscles, and the blood-vessels. It may divide into two layers, whereof the more
                    external is distinguished as “somatic,” while the more internal is called
                    “splanchnic.” Such is the general condition of the three germinal layers in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Metazoa.</hi> In the Sponges, however, it seems probable<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Op.
                    cit.,</hi> vol. i. p. 122, and vol. ii. p. 285.</p></note> that the germinal
                    layers have a different nature—the epiblast and mesoblast being respectively the
                    digestive and sensory layers.</p>
                <p>The skeletal structures of the Sponges have the form of spicules, which may vary
                    greatly in different genera as to their form, while they may be siliceous,
                    calcareous, or horny. Sometimes they constitute structures of singular beauty.
                    They appear to be formed in or on the cells of the mesoblast, and it does not
                    seem that any skeletal structures arise in the epiblast or hypoblast of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Porifera.</hi> Should such, however, be hereafter found, then it
                    must be borne in mind that their homologies with analogous skeletal structures
                    of other organisms must depend on the final decision of the question of the
                    exact relations which may exist between such germinal layers in Sponges and the
                    epiblast and hypoblast of higher <hi rend="italic">Metazoa.</hi></p>
                <p>In the great group of the <hi rend="italic">Coelentera,</hi> the skeleton may be
                    either epiblastic or mesoblastic in nature. Thus in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrozoa—</hi> where it mostly has the form of a horny investment, but may be
                    (as in the Millepores) calcareous—it is epiblastic. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinozoa—</hi> which includes the true coral animals—it is generally
                    mesoblastic, although it is formed from the epiblast in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gorgoniae, Isidinae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pennatulidae.</hi></p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Isis</hi> the skeleton curiously consists of a series of
                    segments which are alternately horny and calcareous.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Echinodermata</hi> we generally have, notably in the
                    Sea-Urchin <hi rend="italic">(Echinus),</hi> a wonderfully complex skeleton,
                    which is so near the outer surface that at the first glance it seems necessarily
                    a most external form of skeleton. Nevertheless the plates which compose it are
                    mesoblastic in nature and are independent of the epidermis.</p>
                <p>The two valves forming the shell of the Lamp-shells <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Branchionopoda),</hi> and the very different two valves which constitute the
                    shells of creatures of the Oyster class <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Larnellibranchiata),</hi> as well as the single shells of the Snail and Whelk
                    class <hi rend="italic">(Gasteropoda),</hi> are all epiblastic in nature, and
                    are calcifications of the outer part of the epidermis. The same is the origin of
                    the apparently internal shell of the Slug, which is at first external in the
                    embryo and subsequently becomes enclosed.</p>
                <p>Similar is the nature of both the internal and external shells of the Squids,
                    Cuttle-fishes, and Nautili, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of the class <hi
                    rend="italic">Cephalopoda.</hi> In the last-named class, as in some Gasteropods,
                    there is a cartilaginous structure inside the head, which structure supports and
                    partly protects the brain. It is unlike any skeletal part yet mentioned save in
                    its mode of origin, which, like the skeleton of some of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Actinozoa,</hi> is mesoblastic.</p>
                <p>Lastly may be mentioned the hard protecting external coat of insects and animals
                    of the Crab and Lobster class—in short, the external skeleton of that primary
                    division of animals which is called <hi rend="italic">Arthropoda.</hi> This is
                    again epiblastic, and a hardening of a cuticle on the outer surface of the
                    epidermis—a hardening effected generally by chitinization (the deposition in it
                    of a substance termed “chitin”), or, as in many <hi rend="italic">Crustacea</hi>
                    and some <hi rend="italic">Myriapoda,</hi> by calcification.</p>
                <p>GENERAL SKELETAL CONDITIONS.</p>
                <p>Having thus briefly glanced at the leading skeletal structures of a number of
                    groups of lower organisms, we may make the following generalization, which will
                    be of use to us in helping us to understand how the skeletal parts of backboned
                    animals stand related to the skeletal parts of animals lower in the scale :—</p>
                <p>(1) Skeletal structures may conceivably arise in parts which are epiblastic, or
                    mesoblastic, or hypoblastic.</p>
                <p>(2) Skeletal structures belonging to any one of those three categories may be
                    further divisible into two subordinate categories according as they belong to a
                    superficial or a deep part of the layer to which they appertain.</p>
                <p>(3) Skeletal structures may be siliceous, chitinous, cal careous, cartilaginous,
                    or horny.</p>
                <p>(4) In certain animals the mesoblast subdivides into two layers, one <hi
                    rend="italic">somatic</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic">splanchnic.</hi>
                    Obviously, then, there may be skeletal parts corresponding to either of these
                    last-named layers, and conceivably to a deeper or more superficial portion of
                    either of them.</p>
                <p>THE SKELETON OF VERTEBRATA.</p>
                <p>The skeleton of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata—</hi> that is, of the five
                    classes of animals named <hi rend="italic">Pisces, Amphibia, Reptilia,
                    Aves,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mammalia—</hi> may in the first place be most
                    conveniently considered as consisting of two parts—a dermal skeleton, or <hi
                    rend="italic">exoskeleton,</hi> and an internal framework, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >endoskeleton.</hi> The latter, which is generally much the more considerable,
                    is mesoblastic, and the muscles are external to it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">External Skeleton of Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>This division of the skeleton is itself again made up of two parts. The more
                    external of these is the epidermis and is of epiblastic origin, and dense
                    epidermal structures may arise towards its inner or its outer surface. The more
                    internal constituent of the exoskeleton is the dermis and dense structures
                    formed in it, and these are from the outer portion of the mesoblast.</p>
                <p>Epidermal hard structures formed towards either surface of the epidermis may
                    become intimately united with subjacent dermal hard structures, and then again,
                    as we shall see, with parts of the true endoskeleton.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n122/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0122-0107"/> Any hard structures formed in the walls of the
                    alimentary canal—the lining of which is continuous at either end with the
                    external skin—are to be reckoned as fundamentally exoskeletal. In the process of
                    development the epiblast becomes inflected more or less into either extremity of
                    the alimentary tube, but the intermediate portion, together of course with any
                    hard structures developed in it, is of hypoblastic origin.</p>
                <p>In the great majority of Vertebrate animals the two layers of the skin, the
                    epidermis and the dermis, are, as in man, soft, though locally provided with
                    certain denser appendages, such as epidermal and dermal scales, hairs, nails,
                    scutes, and teeth.</p>
                <p>The soft, general exoskeleton or skin invests the body of Man pretty closely,
                    though slightly projecting folds of it extend between the roots of the fingers
                    and toes. In some abnormal cases these folds extend so far and bind the digits
                    together so much that the thus malformed person is said to be “web-fingered” or
                    “web-toed.” Such a condition is found normally in many animals, as notably in
                    Ducks and Geese, and such parts form a large portion of the “wing” of the
                    Bat.</p>
                <p>Other extensions of the skin of the body are noteworthy. Thus in the “Flying”
                    Squirrels and Opossums, and the curious Rodent named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anomalurus,</hi> the skin of the sides, between the arms and the legs, is much
                    expanded, serving for a parachute. There may be a skin parachute supported by
                    long free movable ribs, such as we shall see exist in the little Lizards called
                    “Flying Dragons.” There may be a very remarkable extensive skin round the neck,
                    as in the Frilled Lizard, and folds of skin may hang freely, as in the “dewlap”
                    of Cattle, or may be formed here and there as in the Rhinoceros, the skin of
                    which animal is so thick as to necessitate the existence of such folds to allow
                    free movements to the body and limbs. Long filamentary processes may be formed
                    along the back, as in the Iguana and various other Lizards.</p>
                <p>In the Seals a fold of skin connects together the hind legs and the tail, and
                    also in our common Bats, which have in addition their very elongated webbed
                    fingers connected with the sides of the body and legs by another great fold of
                    skin which, with those between the fingers, forms the entire bat’s “wing.”</p>
                <p>The integument may be very distensible, as in those Fishes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g., Diodon)</hi> which distend themselves with air and then float belly
                    upwards.</p>
                <p>The epidermis of many Vertebrates, and of Man, is shed in minute fragments,
                    constantly removed by friction and ablution, and constantly replaced; only under
                    abnormal conditions and after certain diseases does it come away in large and
                    continuous patches. In some other Vertebrates, as notably in Snakes, the entire
                    epidermal investment of the body, even that of the eyes, is cast off entire as
                    one whole.</p>
                <p>The epidermis never has its superficial layer connected with bone, but it often
                    becomes thickened and horny, as we see in the sole of the foot, or the
                    labourer’s hand, and in those abnormal thickenings called “corns.” Certain local
                    thickenings which are not abnormal may exist in animals; such are the
                    callosities on the inner side of the legs of the Horse, on the breast of the
                    Camel, and on the nates of the lower Old-World Apes.</p>
                <p>Of the appendages of the epidermis the most simple are scales, such as we find on
                    the legs of Birds and the bodies of Serpents and Reptiles generally.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">scale—</hi> a true scale, such as those of Snakes and
                    Lizards— consists of papillae of the dermis invested by the epidermis, the whole
                    being covered by a cornification of the external part of the epidermis. Scales
                    may be very diverse in shape, prominence, and relative size, and may form very
                    large plates. The so-called scales of Fishes are of deeper origin and are a form
                    of scutes.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">hair</hi> differs from a scale in that, instead of being an
                    epidermic investment of a dermal projection outwards, it originates by an
                    epidermal projection inwards into the subjacent dermis. A small papilla of the
                    dermis, however, soon projects upwards, in turn, into the descending epidermal
                    process, and then cornification sets in (at first in the immediate vicinity of
                    the dermal papilla) in the cells around the axis of the epidermal descending
                    projection, and this hardened portion soon projects beyond the surface of the
                    body, while the part of the epidermis about its deepest part becomes modified
                    into its so-called “root.”</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">nail</hi> or <hi rend="italic">claw</hi> arises as a
                    cornification of the epidermis (but not of its deepest layer) lying upon
                    numerous very vascular ridges (or transversely elongated papillae) of the
                    dermis, forming the primitive bed of the nail, and enclosed in a deep fold of
                    the integument. One end of the structure becomes free and projecting
                    superficially, while the opposite region grows by epidermal additions from
                    beneath and at its attached extremity.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">feather</hi> is more nearly related to a scale than it is to
                    a hair. It consists at first of an upwardly-projecting dermal papilla invested
                    with epidermis, and it is only at a later stage that its base sinks into a sack
                    or “feather follicle.” The outermost layer of epidermis becomes converted into a
                    horny sheath, which is thrown off when the feather is completed. The <hi
                    rend="italic">quill</hi> is formed by cornification of the deepest and more
                    superficial layer of epidermis investing the base of the dermal and vascular
                    papilla, and is open at both ends. The vascular papilla it encloses shrinks up
                    when the feather is fully formed. The <hi rend="italic">vane</hi> of the feather
                    is formed from the more apical portion of the papilla, and its central part, or
                    <hi rend="italic">shaft,</hi> is continuous with the quill, while ridge-like
                    thickenings of epidermis diverging from either side of this central part
                    constitute the barbs of the vane, from each of which yet smaller processes or
                    barbules proceed.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">scute</hi> is a hardening of the outermost portion of the
                    dermis, with an investment from the deepest layer of the epidermis. Such are the
                    so-called scales of ordinary Fishes, which may be represented by the bony plates
                    and processes called placoid scales—so common in the groups of Sharks and Rays.
                    In these latter structures dermal papillae appear and calcify, forming a dense
                    structure without corpuscles, called dentine, beneath which may be a
                    corpusculated structure of true bone. The calcifying papillae receive an
                    investment of still denser calcareous tissue, called enamel, from the deepest
                    layer of the epidermis. These placoid structures often come to project outwards
                    on the surface of the body as long spines or as shorter tooth-like processes, or
                    they may protect the surface of the body as flat plates. Often the dentine more
                    or less entirely atrophies, so that the structure comes to be formed almost
                    entirely of true bone or of that peculiar calcified tissue of which the scales
                    of ordinary Fishes (such, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as the Perch and Carp)
                    are composed.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">tooth</hi> is a structure closely related to a scute. It
                    differs from the latter just as a hair differs from a scale—namely, by owing its
                    origin to an ingrowth of the epidermis instead of merely to a primitive
                    outgrowth of the dermis.</p>
                <p>The so-called teeth of the Lamprey are not true teeth, but are merely horny
                    epidermal structures essentially similar to scales.</p>
                <p>In the origin of a true tooth a process of the epiblastic layer of the mouth—the
                    buccal epithelium—grows into the subjacent dermis, and, assuming a cup-like form
                    (with the concavity of the cup turned away from the epithelial surface of the
                    mouth), a dermal papilla rises into the cup. The apex of this papilla then
                    superficially calcifies into dentine, and becomes invested with a layer of
                    enamel formed from the immediately adjacent surface of the epidermic cup or
                    “enamel organ.” An investment of connective tissue called the dental capsule
                    becomes formed round the whole. The dentine then increases, a remnant of the
                    papilla remaining as the “pulp.” The young tooth gradually approaches the buccal
                    surface, and the base of the papilla becomes formed into the root or fang of the
                    tooth. The enamel organ does not descend so far, but only invests the crown of
                    the tooth. The inner layer of the capsule, however, investing the fang gives
                    rise to a third dental tissue known as the cement. A bud may or may not be given
                    off from the developing tooth to serve as its future successor.</p>
                <p>Thus teeth are normally both epiblastic and mesoblastic structures, but in
                    certain Fishes they line parts of the throat (the branchial arches), the
                    superficial membrane of which is derived from the hypoblast, and such may of
                    course be considered as hypoblastic skeletal elements, and, thus considered,
                    must be reckoned as constituting a separate category of teeth.</p>
                <p>Such being the various kinds of dense structures which enter into the composition
                    of the Vertebrate exoskeleton, each kind may be developed to a greater or less
                    extent in different groups of Vertebrate animals.</p>

                    investment in such a way that it and they are cast off as one whole each time
                    the animal effects that process known as changing its skin. In the Rattlesnakes
                    curiously modified thickenings of epidermis surrounding the end of the tail are
                    not cast off but continue partially adherent; as growth proceeds and successive
                    castings of the skin take place, these ring-like thickenings become numerous,
                    and so knock one against the other, when the end of the tail is vibrated, as to
                    produce a singular sound—the so-called rattling of the system of rings or
                    “rattle.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hairs</hi> form the characteristic clothing of the class <hi
                    rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi> though certain Mammals, such as Whales and
                    Porpoises in their adult condition, are naked. Man is quite exceptional in
                    having the ventral surface of the body more hairy than its dorsum. Long hair on
                    the head, and whiskers and beard, are variable human characters, also possessed
                    by some Apes; and many animals—as the Lion, the Horse, the Aardvark,
                    &amp;c.—have long hair in one or other region of the body. Some hairs may be
                    especially thickened and serve as feelers, as in the “vibrissae” or “whiskers”
                    of the Cat tribe. But the maximum of development is shown in such creatures as
                    the Hedgehog and the Porcupine, where hairs become dense and solid spines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nails</hi> do not exist in the class of Fishes and rarely in
                    that of Batrachians. They first make their appearance in the most simple
                    form—that is, in the form of slight thickenings of the epidermis— at the ends of
                    the digits in certain Toads and of one kind of Eft. A nail is at its maximum of
                    development when it quite surrounds and encloses the last or end bone of the
                    digit which bears it. Such nails exist in Horses, Oxen, &amp;c., and are called
                    hoofs. A nail when produced into a sharp point is called a claw,—as in the
                    familiar case of the Cat, and also in Birds. Nails may, however, be much reduced
                    in size and not nearly extend to the end of the digits which support them, as in
                    the Sea Bears. They may be altogether wanting, even in Mammals, as in the
                    Porpoise, or attain a prodigious relative size, so that the body can be
                    suspended by them in progression, as in the Sloth.</p>
                <p>Nail-like structures may be developed from the side of the hand, as in certain
                    Birds (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>. <hi rend="italic">g</hi>., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palamedea),</hi> which are said to be “spur-winged,” and in a Mammal (<hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus)</hi> a hollow horny spur grows upon each
                    ankle.</p>
                <p>In the Rhinoceros we meet with a horn, or two horns, which grow up from the
                    dorsum of the muzzle like a great blunt nail, long dermal papillae extending
                    into it and answering to the dermal ridges beneath a true nail. In Owen’s
                    Chameleon no less than three long horns are developed—one from the nose and a
                    symmetrical pair from the front of the head.</p>
                <p>Other horns which do possess bony cores are developed from the head in pairs on
                    the so-called hollow-horned Ruminants, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Oxen,
                    Antelopes, Goats, and Sheep; and only in one anomalous form, the Prongbok (<hi
                    rend="italic">Antilocapra),</hi> are these horny structures shed at intervals;
                    in the rest they persist throughout life. Normally there is never more than one
                    pair amidst existing Ruminants, with the exception of the Four-horned Antelope,
                    which has two pairs. Such horns may be straight or curved or spirally twisted,
                    but they are never branched, with the single exception of the Prongbok.</p>
                <p>Sharp-edged, overlapping, horny plates (each of which is comparable with a nail)
                    may be developed beneath the proximal part of the tail, as in the curious Rodent
                    <hi rend="italic">Anomalurus.</hi> Such plates may clothe the entire body, head,
                    limbs, and tail, as in the scaly Manis or Pangolin.</p>
                <p>The epidermis and epithelium which respectively line the outside and inside of
                    the jaws may both be converted into horn, forming a small beak which may be
                    composed of a number of close-set processes and may be temporary, as in the
                    Tadpole, or permanent, as in the Siren. Larger and denser structures of a
                    similar kind form the beak of Birds and of the Turtle and of that most
                    exceptional Mammal, the Ornithorhynchus.</p>
                <p>The epithelium within the mouth may be locally cornified, forming horny teeth
                    which have, as before mentioned, rather the nature of scales—as in the suctorial
                    mouth of the Lamprey.</p>
                <p>In certain Beasts, as the Cow and the Sheep, the front edentulous part of the
                    upper jaw is invested by a horny epithelial pad against which the teeth of the
                    front of the lower jaw bite. A much more developed structure is met with in the
                    Dugong. The front of both jaws is furnished with a dense horny plate formed like
                    the horn of the Rhinoceros, though of course widely different in shape. But the
                    maximum development of this kind of structure is found in the Whalebone Whales.
                    The upper jaw in these is furnished with very numerous horny plates, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">baleen,</hi> which hang down from the palate along each side of
                    the mouth. They thus form two longitudinal series, each plate of which is placed
                    transversely to the long axis of the body, and all are very close together. The
                    outer edge of each plate is entire, but its inner edge gives forth numerous
                    hair-like processes. These are some of the constituent fibres of the horny
                    plates which thus, as it were, fray out and line the sides of the buccal cavity
                    with a network of countless fibres formed by the inner edges of the two series
                    of plates. This network acts as a sort of sieve, allowing water to escape
                    between the plates but retaining in the mouth the small creatures on which the
                    whale feeds.</p>
                <p>Cornifications of the tongue may exist. Thus in some Birds, as in Woodpeckers,
                    the structure of its apical portion becomes so dense that it serves as a dart or
                    spear. Its surface may be more or less cornified in Beasts. Thus it may be
                    furnished all round with backwardly-pointing spines, as in the Lesser Anteater
                    (<hi rend="italic">Tamandua</hi>) <hi rend="italic">.</hi> There may be a large
                    horny papilla on each side of it, as in the Manatee or Ornithorhynchus, or there
                    may be horny plates on the tongue, as in the Java Porcupine.</p>
                <p>Horny structures also exist which cannot be considered as either epiblastic or
                    mesoblastic, but must be hypoblastic in origin. Such are the horny linings of
                    the stomachs or gizzards of Birds, and the similar lining of the stomach of the
                    Great Anteater, <hi rend="italic">Myrmecophaga jubata.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Feathers</hi> are the universal and peculiar cutaneous appendages of Birds, and
                    generally differ much in size in different parts of the body, long and strong
                    feathers constituting the most conspicuous part of the wings and so-called
                    “tails” of Birds. Feathers are implanted on the body neither in an irregular nor
                    in a uniform manner, but are aggregated together in different modes in different
                    groups of Birds—each definite patch of implanted feathers being called a feather
                    tract. The arrangement of these tracts in a bird is called its “pterylosis,” and
                    serves amongst other characters to distinguish different groups of Birds one
                    from another.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Exemplifications of Dermal Skeletal Parts.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Scutes.—</hi> True dermal ossifications are met with in some kinds
                    of Mammals. Thus the Armadillos possess a very complete external <hi
                    rend="italic">dermal</hi> skeleton formed of small many-sided bony scutes, the
                    margins of which are adjusted together, and which are differently
                    aggregated—into transverse bands or into larger inflexible masses —in different
                    species. In the extinct <hi rend="italic">Glyptodon,</hi> the body was invested,
                    from the neck to the root of the tail, with one such solid case.</p>
                <p>In the Armadillos a horny <hi rend="italic">epidermal</hi> skeleton is so
                    adjusted to the bony case that the former is divisible into small scales
                    corresponding with the several scutes. Amongst Reptiles, we find in the
                    Tortoises and Turtles (<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Emys,
                    Testudo)</hi> a solid exoskeleton, the dorsal part of which is called the
                    “carapace,” while the ventral portion is named the “plastron.” The former
                    consists of a median series of scutes, to each side of which is annexed a series
                    of lateral scutes which are more elongated transversely to the long axis of the
                    animal’s body, and these three series are intimately united with subjacent
                    portions of the internal skeleton. The carapace is completed by a series of
                    smaller scutes, which surround it and are therefore called “marginal” scutes.
                    The plastron consists of eight pairs of scutes and one azygous scute. In the
                    Box-Tortoises the ends of this plastron are movable, and (the head and limbs of
                    the animal being drawn in within the shell) can be applied to tlιe, ends of the
                    carapace, so that all the soft parts can be completely enclosed within the dense
                    exoskeleton. As in the Armadillos, the bony scutes are covered by epidermal
                    scales, some of which have been already referred to as constituting “tortoise
                    shell.” Unlike the Armadillos, however, the segments of the epidermal and dermal
                    skeletons do not correspond. The dorsal scales are much larger and less numerous
                    than are the scutes, but, while the scutes of the ]dastron are but nine in
                    number, it has twelve horny plates or large scales.</p>

                    ventral surfaces of the body. The Sharks and Rays may have their scutes thickly
                    distributed over the surface of the body, but quite small. A skin so furnished
                    is called “shagreen.” They may also be larger and fewer, and placed far apart,
                    with elegant patterns on their exposed surfaces; or they may take the form of
                    strong defensive spines. In the Sturgeon the scutes are arranged in rows along
                    the body, separated from each other by softer portions of integument.</p>

                <p>Fishes have two other very important exoskeletal structures, which may be bony or
                    cartilaginous. One set of these structures consists of filamentary processes,
                    which may be either horny or calcareous, and which support the skin of the fins,
                    whether those of the back, belly, and tail, or those of the limbs; such
                    structures are termed “fin-rays.” The other set consists of bony or
                    cartilaginous hard parts, which serve to support the fin-rays, which therefore
                    lie more deeply, or at least are less projecting, and are commonly termed
                    “interspinous bones or cartilages,” but which may be conveniently distinguished
                    as <hi rend="italic">radiais</hi>; they are very important elements of the fins
                    of Elasmobranchs.</p>
                <p>Certain Siluroid fishes exhibit in the adjustment of portions of their dermal
                    exoskeleton an altogether peculiar mode of articulation, called a shackle joint.
                    This is in the form of a dermal scute articulated with a superposed spine. The
                    scute has an osseous ring on its dorsal surface, and through this passes another
                    osseous ring which forms part of the base of the superimposed spine.</p>
                <p>In connexion with dermal scutes and spines may be mentioned those familiar yet
                    exceptional structures, the bony horns of Ungulates. In the Oxen, Goats, and
                    their allies horns exist on the head as bony cores, persisting throughout life,
                    and supporting those “hollow horns” before noticed amongst the epidermal or
                    epiblastic parts of the exoskeleton. As is the case with the scutes of
                    Chelonians, these bony parts are intimately united with subjacent parts of the
                    true endoskeleton. In the Giraffe there are three such bony prominences, which
                    arise as distinct ossifications, and only later anchylose with the skull. These
                    are the Giraffe’s pair of short horns, together with the median prominence in
                    front of them. In the Deer we find bony antlers, which are shed annually and are
                    destitute of any horny covering. Antlers may exist in both sexes, as in the
                    Reindeer, but generally they are present in the males only. They arise as soft
                    highly vascular prominences, and when fully grown become hardened by calcareous
                    deposit. In some months the investing skin dries up and is got rid of; and the
                    horn itself falls off after the breeding season, leaving a stump whence a new
                    antler shoots forth again in the following year. Antlers, as a rule, are
                    branched—more so as the individual becomes older, till maturity is attained.
                    Some Deer have enormous antlers, weighing as much as 70 lb, and formed at the
                    rate of 1 lb a day.</p>

                    Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>The most essential part of the Vertebrate internal skeleton is the spinal column,
                    the foundation of which is laid by a temporary or permanent structure called the
                    notochord or <hi rend="italic">chorda dorsalis.</hi> At the anterior end of the
                    spinal column there is almost always a solid structure known as the cranium or
                    skull, to which mandibular, hyoidean, and branchial arches may or may not be
                    attached. The spinal column may be divisible into cervical, thoracic, lumbar,
                    sacral, and caudal portions, and may have processes projecting from it upwards,
                    downwards, or laterally, with arches of varying extent, as neural arches,
                    chevron bones, and ribs, together with a median ventral portion— the sternum.
                    The whole of these parts taken together constitute the axial skeleton. This may
                    exist alone if the body is limbless, but otherwise additional hard structures
                    are found which together constitute the appendicular skeleton.</p>
                <p>Vertebrate animals never have more than two pairs of limbs, and each pair is
                    attached to the body by the help of certain skeleton elements termed a
                    limb-girdle, diverging from which are the hard parts which constitute the
                    skeleton of either “appendage” or “limb.” In addition to these we find in Fishes
                    certain azygous structures—the unpaired fins,—the osseous or cartilaginous
                    supports of which must be reckoned as a part of the appendicular skeleton. With
                    the occasional (or possibly constant) exception of the notochord, the whole
                    Vertebrate internal skeleton is a mesoblastic structure. In the great majority
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> the skeleton is more or less bony, but
                    it always in part consists of cartilaginous and fibrous structures.</p>
                <p>The number and nature of the solid parts vary with age in the same species. When,
                    in the earlier stages of existence, the process of ossification has once begun,
                    it goes on more or less rapidly till maturity is attained, and is continued, to
                    a certain extent, throughout the whole of life.</p>
                <p>The points at which bone formation begins and whence it radiates are termed
                    “centres of ossification,” and there may be one, two, or several of these in
                    what is ultimately to become a single bone. Sometimes these “centres” have an
                    important morphological significance, and in other instances they would seem to
                    be determined by the size of the future structure.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Balfour’s <hi rend="italic">Comparative
                    Embryology,</hi> vol. ii. p. 448.</p></note> Bones are classed as “cartilage
                    bones” or “membrane bones” according as they are formed either through the
                    previous formation of a cartilage which subsequently ossifies or directly from
                    membrane without the intervention of cartilage. These two classes can generally
                    be easily distinguished, but there are instances in which it would seem that
                    what is really the same corresponding bone differs as to its mode of origin in
                    different animals. Moreover, a compound bone, formed of a membrane bone and a
                    cartilage bone intimately united, may come to lose either its cartilaginous or
                    its membranous elements, and thus further difficulties of interpretation may
                    arise. There are also cases (as in the carapace of Chelonians) in which
                    exoskeletal dermal bones coalesce with subjacent bones of the endoskeleton. Such
                    bones may become deeper in position as development advances, and there is reason
                    to think that not a few bones ordinarily reckoned as parts of the endoskeleton
                    are of dermal origin, and first appeared in ancestral forms as placoid scutes or
                    dermal spines.</p>
                <p>As the development of the skeleton proceeds, ossification tends to fuse together
                    more and more bones which at their first appearance were separate and distinct.
                    This is notably the case in warm-blooded animals, and is most noteworthy in the
                    warmest-blooded class—that of Birds.</p>
                <p>Besides the coalescence of distinct bones, another fusion of bony structures
                    occurs. This is due to the fact that the ends, or projecting portions, of what
                    are essentially and ultimately one bone may for a time persist as distinct bony
                    parts, termed “epiphyses.” Thus, in the case of Man, the ends of the long bones
                    of the limbs are at first separate from the main part (or shaft) of each long
                    bone, and do not become continuous with the latter till the human frame has
                    nearly attained maturity.</p>
                <p>The hard parts of the internal skeleton, being those which as a framework support
                    the body, form points of attachment for the muscles which move the body,—such
                    hard parts being used as either levers or fulcra, as the case may be. The great
                    majority of the bones are thus intended to move one upon another. The contiguous
                    surfaces of bones form “joints,” which may be immovable, mixed, or movable. The
                    bones of the skull are united by immovable joints, called “sutures.” Joints are
                    said to be mixed when the motion allowed is exceedingly slight, as when two
                    bones are allowed to be slightly separated from each other by the intervention
                    of a softer substance which is attached to both. We have examples of movable
                    joints in the human neck, the two uppermost bones of which are articulated on
                    the principle of a pivot; in the elbow, which forms a hinge; and in the
                    shoulder, where the upper arm joins the shoulder-blade in a ball and socket
                    joint.</p>
                <p>If one convex articulating surface be globular, it is termed a head; if it be
                    elongated, it is called a condyle. If either of these is borne upon a narrow
                    portion of bone, this latter is called a neck; if a pulley-like surface is
                    formed by such a juxtaposition of two condyles as to leave a depression between
                    them, such an articular surface is named a trochlea.</p>

                <p>The whole axial skeleton—including both the cranium and the spinal skeleton—apart
                    from the notochord, is formed from the mesoblastic tissue bordering the
                    medullary groove of the embryo. As the essential part of the axial skeleton is
                    the spinal column, so the essential foundation of this column itself is what is
                    known as the “notochord.” This is an elongated cylindrical rod of soft tissue
                    running along the antero-posterior axis of the body immediately subjacent to the
                    central portion of the nervous system. Its mode of origin from the germ-layers
                    of the embryo has yet to be finally determined. It is said by Balfour<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Comparative
                    Embryology,</hi> vol. ii. p. 449.</p></note> to be developed, in most if not all
                    cases, as an axial differentiation of the hypoblast. The cells of the notochord
                    form a tissue resembling cartilage, and it becomes surrounded by a more or less
                    dense fibrous sheath. Such an organ is found to exist, temporarily or
                    permanently, in certain lower creatures—Ascidians—which in most other respects
                    widely differ from Vertebrate animals. Some few of these animals are furnished
                    with a tail throughout the whole of life, while others are furnished with such
                    an organ only in their larval or immature condition. It is alone in such
                    permanent or temporary tail, and not in the body of Ascidians, that a structure
                    of this kind is met with.</p>
                <p>In every Vertebrate animal the notochord is the first part of the skeleton to
                    appear, and it extends throughout the whole length of the body, as well as of
                    the tail. In every such animal, except the Lancelet <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Amphioxus),</hi> it becomes arrested anteriorly in the midst of that
                    secondarily formed skeletal region which becomes the skull. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus,</hi> however, in which no skull is ever formed, the notochord
                    extends to quite the anterior end of the body. It is enclosed in a strong
                    sheath, within which its substance is segmented so as to resemble a longitudinal
                    series of coins<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Owen’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Vertebrates,</hi> vol. i. p. 31.</p><p>In the
                    Lamprey the notochord persists, but a longitudinal series of small, similarly
                    shaped cartilages strengthen the sides of the more anterior part of the
                    membranous dorsal canal which encloses the spinal marrow. In the Chimaera these
                    are more developed, while numerous circular calcifications appear in the
                    notochordal sheath. In the most anterior part of the trunk the cartilaginous
                    elements unite to form a continuous investment of the notochord. Amongst the
                    Ganoid Fishes, the notochord persists unconstricted and cylindrical in the
                    Sturgeon and the Lepidosiren, but cartilaginous or bony parts appear about it
                    and form a longitudinal series of arches above and below it for the protection
                    respectively of the spinal marrow and sub-vertebral blood-vessels. In different
                    kinds of Sharks further complications arise, and the notochord becomes
                    encroached upon, in different modes, by chondrification and calcification, till
                    it becomes segmented by the intervention of a series of thus formed hard parts
                    called “bodies” or “centra,” between which relics of the notochord still remain.
                    By this process of segmentation there come to be formed what are called
                    vertebrae, the presence of which in the overwhelming majority of Fishes, as well
                    as in all the higher classes of animals, has led to the whole group being called
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi></p><p>In the vertebrae of most Vertebrates we
                    have a solid body or centrum, from the dorsum of which there arises on each of
                    its two sides a neural plate, which then bends inwards to meet its fellow of the
                    opposite side, thus forming an arch (the neural arch) for the protection of the
                    spinal cord, or marrow, which passes through it. From the dorsal side of such
                    neural arch a process called the neural spine very commonly ascends. From the
                    sides of the centrum or neural arch, or of both, a single process, or two
                    superimposed processes, may jut outwards, which are known as the transverse
                    process or processes, to which the ribs are generally articulated when ribs are
                    present. Inferiorly directed processes, single or double, may descend from
                    beneath the centrum, or may be developed in the intervals between adjacent
                    centra, and are generally related to the protection of large blood-vessels,
                    though they may only serve for muscular attachment.</p><p>Adjacent vertebrae are
                    commonly connected together by special modifications of the neural arches or the
                    centra, or of both. Mostly the opposed margins of the neural arches develop
                    special processes for attachment called articular processes or zygapophyses, and
                    there may be additional interarticulations. There may be as few as ten or as
                    many as four hundred vertebrae.</p><p>Vertebrae may be divisible, as in the
                    highest animals, into five categories:—(1) cervical, or those of the neck; (2)
                    dorsal, or those of the back; (3) lumbar, or those of the loins; (4) sacral, or
                    those with which the pelvic limbs are connected; and (5) caudal, or those which
                    are posterior to the sacral vertebrae, or which support the tail when such an
                    organ is present. There may be only two categories (dorsal and caudal), as in
                    Fishes.</p><p>In most Fishes and some exceptional Reptiles the body or centrum
                    of each vertebra is so imperfectly ossified as to remain biconcave or
                    amphicoelous,—that is to say, it presents a deeply concave cup-like form both in
                    front and behind. The space thus enclosed by the adjoining cups of each pair of
                    successive vertebrae is filled up by a soft, spheroidal remnant of the
                    notochord, which thus serves as an intermediate connecting substance. The cups
                    may become filled up by ossification, as in Man and Beasts, the flattened
                    surfaces being connected by what are called intervertebral disks. Each such disk
                    is made of fibrous lamellae which surround a soft elastic central portion which
                    is a last remnant of the notochord. Often the vertebrae may</p></note> or
                    counters. The only other representatives of the internal skeleton in this animal
                    are—(1) longitudinal ligaments (strengthening the sheath of the notochord above
                    and below); (2) fibrous septa which pass out laterally from it between the
                    muscles of the body, to the fibres of which they give attachment; (3) a
                    longitudinal membranous sheath of the central part of the nervous system,
                    forming an elongated antero-posteriorly directed cylinder above the notochord;
                    (4) two vertical septa,— one dorsal, ascending medianly from such neural sheath,
                    and one ventral, descending medianly from the sheath of the notochord in the
                    region of the tail; (5) two jointed cartilaginous filaments which lie one on
                    each side of the longitudinal slit which serves the lancelet for a mouth; and
                    (6) certain cartilaginous filaments which strengthen the sides of the branchial
                    cavity between the intervening vertical fissures of the walls of that
                    cavity.</p>
                <p>In all other Vertebrate animals the axial skeleton is divisible into that of the
                    head, or the cranial skeleton, and that of the axial skeleton behind the head,
                    or the spinal skeleton.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spinal Skeleton.</hi></p>
                <p>In all Vertebrate animals except the Lancelet, the axial skeleton is complicated
                    by a longitudinal series of additional hard parts—cartilaginous or osseous—which
                    serve to protect the spinal cord, or marrow, above it, or the great
                    blood-vessels beneath it, and which hard parts support, encroach upon, or
                    replace the notochord itself. Nevertheless, the notochord persists throughout
                    the whole of life in certain Fishes both of the lowest and highest types of
                    piscine organization, but it does not persist in its entirety in any adult
                    Vertebrate which is not a Fish.<pb break="no"

                    Ruminants; sometimes a vertebra may be biconvex (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>,
                    have a ball at each end of its centrum), as in the first caudal vertebra of the
                    Crocodile; or, very rarely, there may be two prominences, or the cups may exist
                    side by side on one surface of a centrum, as in some cervical vertebrae of
                    Chelonians. Instead of intervertebral disks, with spheroidal remnants of the
                    notochord, adjacent vertebrae are often (as in Snakes) united by what are called
                    synovial sacs, or membranous closed bags containing an albuminous fluid called
                    "synovia” and commonly known as “joint-oil.”</p>
                <p>The various parts of a vertebra may be all united to form one single bone, as is
                    generally the case in the higher animals, but such is by no means universally
                    the case. In the Ichthyosaurus we find the neural arch permanently distinct from
                    the centrum; and in the Carp the transverse processes are separate. The neural
                    arch itself may be made up of two separate pieces on each side, as in some
                    Elasmobranch Fishes, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Raia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spinax.</hi></p>
                <p>Sometimes the neural arch, instead of reposing upon its own centrum only,
                    appears, as it were, shifted so as to be connected with two adjacent centra, as
                    is the case, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> with the dorsal vertebrae of
                    Tortoises.</p>
                <p>Generally the nerves which pass outwards from the spinal marrow which lies in the
                    neural canal pass out in the intervals between adjacent neural arches. Instead
                    of this, however, they sometimes perforate the neural arch.</p>
                <p>Neural spines, though generally single, may be double or altogether absent, and
                    sometimes, as in Tortoises, they may intimately coalesce with superimposed
                    dermal plates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cervical Vertebrae.—</hi> As has been already indicated, no
                    vertebrae can be distinguished as cervical in the class of Fishes. Nevertheless
                    the first three or four vertebrae next the head may, in some of these animals,
                    present a marked difference from the succeeding vertebrae, being much elongated
                    and united to each other by suture, as in <hi rend="italic">Fistularia</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Bagrus,</hi> and they may, as in the latter Fish, develop a
                    continuous inferior vascular canal. The second and third vertebrae may form a
                    hollow bladder-like case of bone, as in <hi rend="italic">Cobitis,</hi> or send
                    outwards or downwards special processes, as in the Carp.</p>
                <p>In Amphibians only a single vertebra can be called cervical, but in Sauropsidans
                    the number may be very large. Thus in the Swan it amounts to twenty-five, while
                    in some of the Plesiosaurians it exceeded forty. Birds, being animals which have
                    to perform with the beak functions which in most animals are performed by limbs,
                    require to have a very movable neck; and consequently a considerable number of
                    joints (and therefore of vertebrae) are required in the neck, which is the only
                    part of the spinal column that is very flexible. In Serpents, which have the
                    whole spinal column very flexible, no really satisfactory line can be drawn
                    between cervical and dorsal vertebrae. In Lizards there are usually from seven
                    to nine, but in the whole class of Mammals (whether the neck be very long, as in
                    the Giraffe, or, like that of the Porpoise, extremely short) there are
                    constantly but seven cervical vertebrae, except in the Sloths, which may have
                    from nine to six, the Manatee, which has but six, and the Manis, which may have
                    eight. All the cervical vertebrae may become anchylosed together into a single
                    mass, as usually in the true Whales. Ordinarily in Mammals the transverse
                    process is said to be perforated, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, there are two
                    such on each side, which are short and connected at their distal ends by a bony
                    bridge which represents what, in the thorax, is known as a rib, as is shown by
                    their condition in other classes of Vertebrates. Indeed in the lowest Mammals
                    <hi rend="italic">(Echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus)</hi>
                    these osseous bridges have the form of distinct, more or less Y-shaped bones, as
                    also in the Crocodile, where they are much prolonged. In many Lizards and Birds
                    the posterior cervical vertebrae bear long ribs, and are only counted as
                    cervical because such ribs do not reach the breast bone, while more posteriorly
                    placed ribs do attain it. The two superimposed transverse processes, with the
                    rib joining them attached to succeeding vertebrae, form on each side of the neck
                    a sort of bony canal in which runs the vertebral artery. Sometimes, however, as
                    in the Camels and Llamas, this canal is replaced by one excavated in the neural
                    arches. In some Cetaceans the external bar (or rudimentary rib) is wanting, so
                    that there come to be two elongated transverse processes on each side.</p>
                <p>Successive cervical vertebrae may differ strikingly one from another. Thus in the
                    common European Terrapin we find the fourth cervical vertebra with its centrum
                    convex in front and concave behind. The centrum of the fifth is biconvex. That
                    of the sixth is concave in front with a double convexity behind. The seventh is
                    doubly convex both in front and behind. The eighth is doubly concave at each
                    end. The ninth is doubly convex in front and singly so behind.</p>
                <p>The first cervical vertebra is known as the atlas, and joins the skull, which in
                    Man it supports. It may be fused in one solid mass with the skull, as in the
                    Sturgeon, or with a certain number of vertebrae, as in the Rays. It may be
                    united by suture, as in <hi rend="italic">Bagrus.</hi> The vertebral part of the
                    atlas may be unossified, as in the Wombat, or remain a distinct bone, as in the
                    Thylacine. The neural spine may be detached from the neural arch, as in the
                    Crocodile and Tunny. Its ventral part may send out a pointed process towards the
                    head, as in <hi rend="italic">Amphiuma.</hi> It may develop two concave surfaces
                    to articulate with the skull, as in Amphibians and Mammals, or only a single
                    cup, as in Sauropsidans generally.</p>
                <p>The second cervical vertebra is known as the axis, and is distinguishable in all
                    Vertebrates above the <hi rend="italic">Ichthyopsida.</hi> Its centrum develops
                    anteriorly a special peg-like or tooth-like prominence known as the odontoid
                    process, round which the head and atlas vertebra turn as on a pivot. This
                    process may (as in many Reptiles and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithorhynchus</hi> amongst Mammals) remain a distinct bone, and is regarded
                    as the true centrum of the atlas, which thus generally coalesces into the axis
                    vertebra instead of with the other portions of its own vertebra. The odontoid
                    process may be absent in certain Mammals, as amongst Cetaceans.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dorso-Lumbar Vertebrae.—</hi> The vertebrae which come between
                    the cervical vertebrae and those (sacral) which support the pelvic limbs, or,
                    when these latter are absent, the vertebrae between the cervical and the caudal
                    vertebrae, form the vertebrae of the trunk. These are subdivisible into dorsal
                    and lumbar when some of them (always the more anterior) bear ribs and others do
                    not but have transverse processes only.</p>
                <p>The number of trunk (or dorso-lumbar) vertebrae varies greatly, being very few in
                    Frogs and Tortoises and very numerous in Serpents. In Mammals it ranges from
                    about seventeen, in some Primates, to twenty-seven, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hyrax.</hi> A definite number of trunk vertebrae is characteristic of certain
                    groups of Mammals, though this number may be made up by different numbers of
                    dorsal and lumbar vertebrae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dorsal Vertebrae. —</hi> Rib-bearing vertebrae are structures
                    constantly found in all Vertebrate animals save certain Fishes and Amphibians.
                    Dorsal vertebrae must be considered as including the whole number of trunk
                    vertebrae in Serpents, since in those animals the whole series of the latter
                    support ribs.</p>
                <p>An ordinary Mammalian dorsal vertebra consists of a body and neural arch with
                    articular processes or zygapophyses and with a more or less elongated neural
                    spine, and a transverse process which juts out and bears an articular surface at
                    its end. This process answers to the more dorsal of each pair of transverse
                    processes on each side of a cervical vertebra. Another articular surface placed
                    at about the junction of the neural arch and centrum answers to the more ventral
                    of each pair of transverse processes on each side of a cervical vertebra.</p>
                <p>The rib which on each side of the vertebra articulates with these two surfaces
                    has generally itself such a surface at its proximal end (or head) and another on
                    a more or less marked prominence called the tubercle of the rib. These are
                    respectively designated the capitulum and tuberculum, and therefore the
                    processes or articular surfaces of the vertebra to which the capitulum and
                    tuberculum are respectively attached are called the capitular and tubercular
                    processes or surfaces, as the case may be.</p>
                <p>Sometimes each vertebra carries but one such articular surface (that for the
                    capitulum of the ribs), as in the Dolphin. The two articular surfaces may
                    co-exist at different levels on one single process, as in the dorsal vertebrae
                    of the Crocodile, or they may be in close apposition, and, as it were, fused
                    together, as in Serpents. They may, however, be supported by two quite distinct
                    processes —one dorsal, the other ventral,—as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichthyosaurus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus.</hi></p>
                <p>Man has twelve dorsal vertebrae. This is a little below the average of his class,
                    where there may be twenty-four, as in the Two-toed Sloth. There are more than
                    twelve in most Reptiles, while in Birds there are mostly but seven to nine, or,
                    very rarely, eleven, while there may, as in <hi rend="italic">Ciconia alba,</hi>
                    be but three reckoned as dorsal on account of' the great extent of ossification
                    in the sacrum or part connected with the legs.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable modification of dorsal vertebrae is that in Tortoises and
                    Turtles, where the neural spines expand at their<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n127/mode/1up"

                    suture with each other and with similarly expanded ribs, to form the
                    carapace.</p>
                <p>In Serpents and Iguanas we have a special mode of vertebral interarticulation,
                    over and above that formed by the zygapophyses. The neural arch develops a
                    median anterior prominence with two articular surfaces called the zygosphene,
                    and this fits into a corresponding median posterior recess called the
                    zygantrum.</p>
                <p>The maximum of complication as regards the interarticulation of dorsal vertebrae
                    is found in the last dorsal of the Great Anteater. There each posterior
                    zygapophysis develops two additional articular surfaces, one on each side of a
                    notch which receives a process from the anterior side of the neural arch of the
                    succeeding vertebra, which process is furnished with two corresponding surfaces.
                    More or less distinct traces of certain additional processes, called
                    metapophyses and anapophyses, are sometimes present, but these it will be better
                    to notice when describing the lumbar vertebrae, wherein they are more
                    developed.</p>
                <p>We find in some Serpents peculiar processes which project downwards and forwards
                    from the base of the inner side of the transverse processes. We may also find
                    present a long median inferior process extending vertically from the ventral
                    surface of the centrum and as long as, or longer than, the neural spine of the
                    same vertebra. Such processes are present in many Serpents—especially the
                    poisonous ones—and in such Birds as the Penguin and Cormorant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lumbar Vertebrae.—</hi> These are vertebrae interposed between
                    the dorsal vertebrae and the sacrum; they are generally the largest vertebrae of
                    each vertebral column, but sometimes (as in Bats and Pterodactyles) the cervical
                    vertebrae are yet larger. Lumbar vertebrae are generally to be distinguished in
                    Mammals, in Crocodiles, and in certain Lizards, but not in any
                    Ichthyopsidan.</p>
                <p>In Birds lumbar vertebrae are present, but are disguised and hidden by the extent
                    to which the sacral ossification extends forwards.</p>
                <p>There are five lumbar vertebrae in Man, but the number in him is below the
                    average of his class, though some Apes have but four. The Slow Lemur may have
                    nine, the Two-toed Sloth has but three, and the Monotremes but two. These
                    vertebrae are very numerous in the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> but the
                    hinder limit of the lumbar region is more or less difficult to determine in
                    these animals. The transverse processes are generally much longer than those of
                    the dorsal vertebrae, and do not bear either capitular or tubercular articular
                    surfaces.</p>
                <p>The processes already spoken of as metapophyses and anapophyses are generally
                    much more developed in the lumbar than in the dorsal vertebrae. The former
                    project forwards from the vicinity of the anterior zygapophyses, and the latter
                    project backwards at a lower level. Both processes are to be detected in the
                    last dorsal and first lumbar vertebrae of Man, but are at their maximum in the
                    Armadillos. In addition, also, to the complexity of articulation before
                    described as existing on the last dorsal vertebra of the Great Anteater, we find
                    in that animal’s lumbar region an additional articular surface on each side of
                    each transverse process.</p>
                <p>The lumbar vertebrae may be anchylosed together and to other parts of the
                    skeleton, as is the case in Birds.</p>

                    not only by their connexion with the skeleton of the pelvic limbs, but also by
                    their coalescence and a certain degradation in their structure as compared with
                    the trunk and cervical vertebrae. In Man five vertebrae thus coalesce to form
                    the more or less triangular single bone known as the sacrum, but which always
                    shows plain traces of its composite nature. Such coalescence and degradation
                    generally exist in Vertebrates above the <hi rend="italic">Ichthyopsida,</hi>
                    which possess fully developed limbs. The coalescence of vertebrae is generally
                    less extensive than in Man, though sometimes—as in Birds, some Edentates, and
                    some Reptiles—it is much greater. The sacrum may be composed of as many as ten
                    vertebrae (as in some Armadillos) or of twenty (as in the Ostrich), and the
                    lumbar or caudal vertebrae or both contribute to its formation.</p>
                <p>In most if not all Mammals the sacral vertebrae—or the more anterior of them—have
                    what are at first distinctly ossified elements in their transverse processes,
                    which elements (like parts before noticed in the cervical vertebrae) are costal
                    in their nature, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., represent rudimentary ribs, and in
                    Crocodiles and Tailed Amphibians the sacral vertebrae have a distinct
                    rudimentary rib attached to each transverse process. In Birds, however, the
                    vertebrae of the sacrum, which have expanded transverse processes, do not
                    develop these from distinct ossifications.</p>
                <p>As regards the extent of connexion between the sacrum and the hip bones, union is
                    more extensive in Man than in most Beasts, or in animals below Birds. Often in
                    Mammals and almost always in Tailed Batrachians it may be confined to a single
                    vertebra; but ten vertebrae may be involved in this union in Mammals and twenty
                    in Birds.</p>
                <p>That the development of the sacrum is not always in proportion to that of the
                    pelvic limbs is proved by the little Lizard <hi rend="italic">Seps,</hi> in
                    which, in spite of the rudimentary condition of the limbs, there are true sacral
                    vertebrae.</p>
                <p>No Fishes have a true sacrum, though, very rarely, as in the Turbot, we meet with
                    a kind of false sacrum, formed by the anchylosis of the bodies and ventral
                    spines of the first two caudal vertebrae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Caudal Vertebrae.—</hi> The vertebrae of the tail may be as
                    many as 270, as in some Sharks. Amongst Mammals 48 <hi rend="italic">(Microgale
                    longi∙ caudata}</hi> is the highest number. Man has usually rudimentary caudal
                    vertebrae, completely or partially united so as to form a small conical bone
                    called the coccyx. Its proximal end articulates with the sacrum by its centrum
                    and two small zygapophyses. It has besides two rudimentary transverse processes
                    and two processes representing piers of the absent neural arch. The other
                    vertebrae are destitute of processes and consist but of smaller and smaller
                    vertebral centra. Thus the last vertebra is the very opposite of the first (or
                    atlas), being all centrum, while the atlas has no centrum at all. The coccyx
                    usually becomes anchylosed to the sacrum about or after the middle of life. The
                    caudal region is still more reduced in some Bats, where there may be but two
                    such vertebrae.</p>
                <p>In animals provided with numerous coccygeal vertebrae, such vertebrae may be
                    provided with processes and articulations as complex as those of other spinal
                    regions. Transverse processes may be largely developed at the tail root, but
                    almost always thence backwards diminish in extent; sometimes, however, as in the
                    Armadillo <hi rend="italic">(Chlamydophorus},</hi> they may increase in size
                    backwards from the tail root. Rarely (as, <hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Menobranchus}</hi> caudal vertebrae may be furnished with two ribs
                    supported by both tubercular and capitular processes. Inferior arches may exist
                    in the form of detached “chevron bows” placed beneath the intervals of
                    successive caudal vertebrae, especially towards the tail root. They may be
                    represented by processes or by continuously ossified inferior arches, which may,
                    as in the Flat Fishes, be very prolonged, extending downwards from each centrum
                    as much as the neural arch and spine extend upwards from it.</p>
                <p>Birds have generally six or eight, but may have ten, caudal vertebrae, at the end
                    of which is a so-called "ploughshare-bone,” consisting of two or more vertebrae
                    anchylosed together.</p>
                <p>The caudal region of the Frog is formed in a very peculiar way. It never consists
                    of distinct vertebrae at any time of life, but is formed by the ossification of
                    the membrane which surrounds the notochord, to which two small neural arches
                    become attached. This structure is called the urostyle.</p>
                <p>In Fishes (as in the Perch and Stickleback) there may be a urostyle continuous
                    with the centrum of the last vertebra. Such a urostyle, unlike that of the Frog,
                    is very sharply bent upwards. It is very small and inconspicuous. In other
                    Fishes the hinder part of the notochord may (as in the Salmon) remain unossified
                    and only protected by lateral bony plates, but it is still sharply bent upwards.
                    In a few Fishes (as, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Polypterus</hi>) the hinder end of
                    the spinal column is not bent upwards. In other Fishes again (as in the Sturgeon
                    and many Sharks) the hinder end of the vertebral column gradually tapers and
                    gradually (not suddenly as in the Perch and Salmon) inclines upwards. In the
                    forms in which the hinder end of the vertebral column bends upwards—whether
                    gradually or suddenly—the arches and processes beneath its hinder end exceed in
                    size those on the dorsal side of it, as also do the fin-rays attached to them.
                    Thus it happens that the part of the caudal fin which is on the ventral side of
                    the gradually or suddenly bent-up part of the spinal column more or less greatly
                    exceeds in size the part on the dorsal side. In those Sea Fishes <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the Sturgeon and many Sharks) in which the upward
                    flexion is gradual and manifest, the ventral part of the caudal fin is evidently
                    the larger, and such a tail is called <hi rend="italic">heterocercal.</hi> In
                    Fishes in which the hinder end of the spinal column is suddenly bent up and of
                    minute size, so that its real condition is disguised, the caudal fin appears
                    symmetrical and as if the parts dorsal and ventral to the end of the spinal
                    column were equal. Such a condition has been named <hi rend="italic"
                    >homocercal.</hi> Those Fishes in which the spinal column ends without turning
                    upwards, and in which the parts of the caudal fin dorsal and ventral to it are
                    really and not only apparently symmetrical, are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >diphycercal.</hi><hi rend="italic">Sternum.—</hi> The breastbone or sternum
                    extends more or less along the middle line of the ventral region of the anterior
                    part of the trunk in all Vertebrates above Fishes, except Serpents and a few
                    other Reptiles.</p>
                <p>Almost always it is connected with the more anterior ribs. Its anterior end is
                    distinguished as the manubrium or presternum, and its hinder is called the
                    xiphoid process or xiphisternum—the middle part being the “body” or mesosternum.
                    A sternum may exist without ribs, or without forming any cartilaginous or
                    osseous connexion with ribs, as in the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi> The
                    plastron of Chelonians might well be supposed to be a great sternum, more
                    especially as the plate-like ribs are connected with it. It appears, however,
                    that this great complex plate does not really include a sternum.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n128/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0128-0113"/> The before-mentioned threefold division of the
                    sternum is normal in Mammals, and also exists, though more obscurely, in Birds
                    and Reptiles. Even in Mammals it is not universal; the manubrium only may be
                    present, as in the Greenland Whale, or the manubrium and xiphisternum without
                    any mesosternum, as in the Dugong.</p>
                <p>In Tailed Amphibians and the Slow-Worm <hi rend="italic">(Anguis)</hi> we have a
                    single sternum, which may be mesosternum only, while in many Frogs and Toads we
                    have only the latter and the xiphisternum. The manubrium may develop a median
                    keel, as in Bats, the Mole, and Armadillos; or the mesosternum, as in the
                    Tamandua; or the mesosternum and xiphisternum, as in most Birds.</p>
                <p>The xiphisternum may assume various forms, but attains its maximum development in
                    Birds, where it forms the part of the sternum posterior to the attachment of the
                    ribs, and may consist of a median and four lateral processes, as in the Fowl. It
                    bears the greater part of the keel.</p>
                <p>In the Monotremes there is a median ossicle in front of the manubrium, which is
                    often called the episternum. It is really a part of the appendicular
                    skeleton.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ribs.—</hi> Mammals possess a greater or less number of ribs,
                    which are mostly long, slender, curved bones, extending downwards from the
                    transverse processes or bodies of the vertebrae, the more anterior of them
                    forming a junction with the sternum. The part of the skeleton formed by the
                    rib-bearing vertebrae, the ribs, and the sternum is called the thorax. In Man
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy)</hi> there are twelve ribs (on each side of
                    the body), whereof the first seven join the sternum by the intervention of
                    cartilages, and are called “true ribs.” The other five, which do not join the
                    sternum, are called “false ribs.” Each rib (except the last two on each side)
                    has a double attachment to the spinal column. At its proximal end it has a
                    rounded “head” or “capitulum,” which articulates with the capitular surface of a
                    dorsal vertebra. At a little distance from the capitulum is another rounded
                    articular prominence called the “tubercle” or “tuberculum,” which joins a
                    vertebral tubercular surface. The part of the rib between the head and the
                    tubercle is called the “neck.” At its distal end each rib has attached to it an
                    elongated cartilage called “costal.” Those costal cartilages which do not join
                    the sternum either end freely or blend with the costal cartilage next in
                    advance.</p>
                <p>Frogs and Toads have no ribs, nor can they be said to exist in some Fishes <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the Chimaera, the Seahorse, the Lamprey and its
                    allies); but in the immense majority of Vertebrates there are cartilaginous or
                    osseous ribs, attached by their proximal ends to the vertebral column, and
                    tending to surround the trunk.</p>
                <p>All rib-bearing animals have both “true” and “false” ribs, save Serpents, Fishes,
                    and Chelonians, which can have no true ribs since they have no sternum, and
                    Tailed Amphibians, in which, though there is a sternum, no ribs join it. There
                    may, however, be but a single pair of true ribs—as in the Whalebone Whales. The
                    ribs are exceptionally broad in the Two-toed Anteater, where they overlap one
                    another. The number of ribs has already been indicated under the head of “dorsal
                    vertebrae,” though in Birds we may have short ribs attached to the cervical
                    vertebrae, and others coming from vertebrae which are generally counted as
                    “sacral.” There may be as few as five or six pairs, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphiuma;</hi> or the numbers may reach 320, as in some Pythons. In many
                    Reptiles, as in the Crocodiles, there may be cervical ribs; and there may even
                    be caudal ribs, as in <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus.</hi></p>
                <p>The function of aiding respiration is one which the ribs possess in the higher
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> but quite other purposes may be subserved by
                    them in addition to, or instead of, respiratory action—namely, locomotion,
                    change of form, or bodily protection as armour. Thus the ribs may form a solid
                    case for the safe keeping of the parts within, co-operating in this office with
                    other skeletal structures so as to form the “carapace” of Tortoises already
                    noticed. Ribs may be the main agents in locomotion, as in Snakes, which glide
                    along by the successive application to the ground of the edges of their ventral
                    scales, which is brought about by the motions of the ribs, the ends of which are
                    connected with the inner surface of such scales. In the little flying Lizard <hi
                    rend="italic">Draco</hi> certain much elongated ribs serve to support a
                    parachute-like flying membrane, and in the Cobra it is certain ribs which
                    sustain its “hood” when distended.</p>
                <p>The presence of a distinct “head” and “tubercle” is a general but not constant
                    character, and the head of the ribs may be connected with two vertebrae or only
                    with one vertebra. The ribs may bifurcate proximally into two equal diverging
                    branches, one representing the “head” and the other the “tubercle.” A small
                    backwardly-projecting structure termed an “uncinate process” may be given off
                    from the ribs and may ossify as a distinct bone, as in most Birds and in the
                    Crocodile.</p>
                <p>Sometimes (as in Monotremes and many Lizards) a third segment may be intercalated
                    between a rib and its sternal cartilage, and sternal cartilages may be
                    represented by bones, as in Birds and Armadillos. In some Lizards the sternal
                    cartilages of opposite ribs are continuous in the mid ventral line. There may be
                    no representative of a sternal rib, as in Fishes and Batrachians.</p>
                <p>Rarely, as in the Crocodile, there may be ventral rib-like structures in the wall
                    of the abdomen, which meet and are attached ventrally, but are “free” at their
                    dorsal ends. These cannot, however, be counted as true ribs. Fishes have often
                    two series of ribs on each side of the body, and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polypterus</hi> some vertebrae may have four ribs on either side. In Fishes the
                    ribs may also be in part attached to the neural spines above or to the haemal
                    spines below the vertebrae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cranial Skeleton.</hi></p>
                <p>By the cranial skeleton we mean the skull, or that part of the axial skeleton
                    which serves to shelter the brain (or anterior expanded end of the central part
                    of the nervous system), together with solid structures continuous or more or
                    less directly connected therewith. Such a structure exists in every Vertebrate
                    animal, except the <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> which has no brain. Nothing
                    of the kind is known to exist in any Ascidian or in any Invertebrate animal,—
                    unless that cartilage of Cuttlefishes which serves as an investment of the nerve
                    centres and a support for the optic and auditory organs may be deemed a true
                    cranial skeleton, since its portions just enumerated make it, as we shall
                    shortly see, very analogous to a true skull.</p>
                <p>The cranial skeleton is, of course, at first composed entirely of soft
                    mesoblastic tissue, parts of which always become cartilaginous and generally
                    also osseous, while more or less of its structure may remain in the condition of
                    mere membrane. The bones which generally, as just said, enter into its framework
                    may arise directly in the membrane or may be preceded by cartilage which
                    ossifies, a circumstance which divides the cranial bones into two
                    categories—“membrane bones” and “cartilage bones.”</p>
                <p>The cranial skeleton of Vertebrates is made up of three sets of parts:—(1) parts
                    devoted to enclosing and protecting the brain; this is the cranium proper; (2)
                    parts sheltering the organs of sense situated in the head— namely the optic,
                    auditory, and olfactory capsules; these skeletal parts consist of the bones,
                    cartilages, and membranes of the orbit, the internal ear, and the nose
                    respectively, or the perioptic, periotic, and perirhinal bones and cartilages;
                    (3) parts continuous or more or less directly<pb break="no"

                    nutrition in the form of deglutition or respiration; such skeletal parts are the
                    jaws and arches (or parts of such) behind the jaws known as the hyoidean and
                    branchial arches.</p>

                    of two plates (parachordals) placed one on each side of the anterior part of the
                    notochord, and forming with the latter the floor of the hinder part of the
                    cranium, which part is known as the basilar plate. The cartilaginous auditory
                    capsules are closely united to the outer sides of the basilar plate. From the
                    anterior margin of that plate two bars, called the “trabeculae,” diverge
                    forwards from the anterior end of the notochord, and then approximate, so as to
                    enclose what is known as the pituitary space, and also the floor of the anterior
                    part of the cranium. Thence they advance (generally united) into the nasal or
                    ethmoidal region of the skull, forming a median nasal septum, having a
                    cartilaginous olfactory capsule on each side of it, and developing lateral
                    processes in front of and behind those capsules. Only in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyclostomata</hi> is there a single olfactory capsule instead of a pair. The
                    nature of the parachordals and trabeculae is disputed, but opinion inclines to
                    regard them as corresponding to the neural arches of the spinal skeleton,—
                    except the part around the notochord, which corresponds with centra in an
                    unsegmented condition.</p>
                <p>Upgrowths arise on the outer side of each parachordal, and these meet above and
                    thus form a complete dorsal arch in the hinder or occipital region of the skull.
                    The posterior aperture of this arch is called the occipital foramen, and through
                    it the spinal cord enters the cranium, there to expand and become the brain.
                    Lateral plates arise on each side farther forwards, in the anterior or
                    sphenoidal region of the cranium. But these do not generally ascend enough to
                    unite together dorsally, at least they almost always form but an imperfect roof
                    to the cranial cavity. This cranial aperture may be related to a median,
                    dorsally placed, eye, which probably once existed in all Vertebrates, and still
                    exists in a rudimentary condition in many Lizards.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> of May 13,
                    1886, p. 33.</p></note> The lateral plates grow together medianly in front, and
                    more or less completely separate the cranial cavity from the ethmoidal region in
                    front of it. Openings are left here and there in the cartilages of the cranial
                    walls for the passage outwards of nerves from the central part of the nervous
                    system; but these openings or foramina will be noticed in describing the osseous
                    cranial skeleton. On each side of the sphenoidal region are the optic
                    cartilaginous capsules, which, however, never become united (as do the others)
                    with the cranium, and therefore are not generally reckoned as parts of the
                    skull. A special median cartilaginous vertical upgrowth from the trabeculae
                    between these capsules may (as in Teleostean Fishes, Lizards, and Birds) form an
                    interorbital plate beneath the most anterior part of the cranial cavity.</p>
                <p>The third category of cranial skeletal parts is generally represented by a series
                    of descending cartilaginous bars (or visceral arcs) on each side of the
                    alimentary canal, running forwards beneath the cranium to terminate at the
                    mouth.</p>
                <p>As this lateral region of the head corresponds with the body wall behind it, and
                    shows transitory indications of division (like the body wall behind it) into an
                    inner part or splanchnopleure and an outer part or somatopleure, it is obvious
                    that skeletal structures formed in its inner or outer part may be taken as
                    belonging to different categories. In the <hi rend="italic">Cyclostomata,</hi>
                    as in the Lamprey, we find cartilaginous bars placed in the somatic division
                    exclu sively,—bars which support and externally protect the series of
                    gill-pouches on each side; and parts probably homologous with these somatic bars
                    of the Lamprey are found also in some Sharks.</p>
                <p>The Cyclostomes also possess complex labial cartilages which support the lips of
                    their suctorial mouths. Representatives of these cartilages are also to be found
                    about the mouths of many Fishes, as well as in the temporary suctorial mouth of
                    the Tadpole; and they still persist in connexion with the olfactory capsules,
                    though in a reduced form, in higher animals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Balfour, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.,</hi> p.
                    490.</p></note> The most important members of the third category of cranial
                    skeletal parts are—(1) the series of cartilaginous arches lying in the
                    splanchnic or inner region of the lateral wall of the head, which arches support
                    the gill-pouches on their inner sides and are known as the branchial arches, and
                    (2) the arches seemingly in series with them, which are more anteriorly placed,
                    and which are known as the hyoidean arches and the jaws.</p>
                <p>One or other, or both, of these two sets of arches are well developed in all
                    craniate Vertebrates, except the Cyclostomes, in which there are no true
                    branchial arches, but only a hyoidean and a rudimentary jaw arch. There may be
                    as many as seven branchial arches <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Notidanus),</hi> but five are usually present in water-breathing
                    Vertebrates. The hyoidean arch becomes segmented into two noteworthy portions,
                    the upper of which is known as the hyomandibular portion.</p>
                <p>The most anterior, or mandibular arch, also becomes segmented into an upper or
                    metapterygoid portion, an inferior or Meckelian portion, and a median or
                    pterygo-quadrate portion, which grows forwards in front of the metapterygoid
                    portion, and forms the foundation of the upper jaw against which the lower jaw
                    (formed from the Meckelian portion) bites.</p>
                <p>The thus formed upper and lower jaws may come to be suspended from the cranium in
                    one of three ways. (1) They may depend from the cranium directly, that is,
                    without the intervention of the hyoidean arch; this arrangement is known as
                    autostylic,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These terms
                    were proposed by Professor Huxley.</p></note> and exists in all Vertebrates
                    above Fishes, as well as in certain of the latter <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Chimaera</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Dipnoi).</hi> (2) They may be
                    suspended by the co-operation of the hyomandibular portion of the hyoidean arch
                    with their own metapterygoid portion; this arrangement is known as amphistylic,
                    and is found in <hi rend="italic">Notidanus, Hexanchus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ostracion.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Balfour, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.,</hi> p.
                    475.</p></note> (3) They may be suspended exclusively by the hyomandibular
                    portion of the hyoidean arch (to the exclusion of their more proximal portion),
                    as in most Fishes and the Skates—an arrangement known as hyostylic.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Osseous Cranium.—</hi> The bony skull is formed partly
                    by ossifications of the cartilage of the cartilaginous skull and partly by
                    ossifications of the membranes investing or completing it. The cartilaginous
                    cranium may, as in Elasmobranchs, be covered by a thin calcified layer without
                    becoming ossified. It may, as in the Selachian Ganoids, remain itself quite
                    unossified, and yet become enveloped by membrane bones. In most cases, however,
                    the investment of the cartilaginous cranium by membrane bones is accompanied by
                    a more or less complete ossification of the cartilage itself. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> the cartilaginous cranium is to a not inconsiderable
                    extent ossified, but the membrane bones which invest it are nevertheless easily
                    separable from it. The most constant ossifications of the cartilaginous cranium
                    are in the occipital region. In the Lepidosiren these are the only ones, a bone
                    being thus formed on each side of the occipital foramen, which bones are known
                    as the exoccipitals.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n130/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0130-0115"/> Many disputes have taken place as to what cranial
                    bones (both cartilage and membrane bones) of one group of animals correspond
                    with those of other groups. Such disputes, still exist in certain cases, and it
                    would be unwise to positively assert more than the existence of a general
                    correspondence between the cranial bones of widely different Vertebrates—such,
                    for example, as between Teleostean Fishes and Reptiles or Mammals.</p>
                <p>Beneath the occipital foramen the basioccipital bone arises, and it may, as in
                    Birds and Reptiles, develop a posterior prominence which joins with contiguous
                    prominences of the exoccipitals to form a single “condyle” for articulation with
                    the spine. On the other hand, there may be, as in Mammals and Amphibians, two
                    lateral exoccipital condyles unaccompanied by any median basioccipital
                    prominence. In most Fishes we find only a concave articular surface behind the
                    basioccipital, which thus resembles in form the vertebral centra, the anterior
                    posterior surfaces of which are concave. A fourth bone, the supraoccipital,
                    generally bounds the occipital foramen above.</p>
                <p>In front of this occipital segment the auditory capsule, on each side, generally
                    ossifies from three centres of ossification, which form the prootic, opisthotic,
                    and epiotic bones respectively. Of these the first is the most constant, and is
                    the only one which ossifies in the Frog. When all three are present, the prootic
                    is anterior in position, the opisthotic inferior and posterior, and the epiotic
                    posterior and superior. Sometimes, as in Fishes, two other supero-external bones
                    may be formed in the auditory capsule, the more anterior of which is the
                    sphenotic and the more posterior the pterotic.</p>
                <p>The base of the cranium, in front of the basioccipital, generally ossifies as the
                    basisphenoid, and a depression on its upper surface is known as the sella
                    turcica or pituitary fossa. In front of the basisphenoid there may be, as in
                    Mammals, another azygous bone, the presphenoid. The skull’s lateral walls (in
                    front of the auditory capsule) ossify as the alisphenoid and orbitosphenoid on
                    each side, the latter forming the antero-lateral wall of the cranium. The optic
                    capsule or sclerotic may be merely membranous, as in Mammals, or may ossify, as
                    in Birds, but it never forms any solid connexion with the cranial walls.</p>
                <p>The olfactory region very often ossifies as a median vertical bone (the
                    mesethmoid) and two lateral ones (the lateral ethmoids or prefrontals). These
                    ethmoidal ossifications may close the cranial cavity anteriorly, or may be
                    altogether anterior to it. The olfactory and presphenoidal region may ossify
                    very exceptionally as one bone. Such a condition we find in the Frog and its
                    allies. These bones vary greatly in different classes of Vertebrates as to the
                    degrees in which they anchylose together or remain distinct, and also as to the
                    order in which those unite which ultimately coalesce. Similar differences occur
                    with respect to the remaining skull bones. Speaking generally, we find the
                    greatest amount of distinctness in the Osseous Fishes, and the greatest amount
                    of coalescence in the class of Birds.</p>
                <p>The membrane bones of the cranium are most conspicuous and constant on its roof.
                    In Fishes we find every grade of transition between simple dermal scutes and
                    true subdermal bones of the internal skeleton. Well-developed dermal cranial
                    scutes are to be found in the Sturgeon and some Siluroids. Where the membrane
                    bones still retain the character of dermal plates, those on the dorsal surface
                    of the cranium are usually arranged in a series of longitudinal rows, continuing
                    in the region of the head the rows of dermal scutes of the trunk. The dorsal
                    cranial dermal bones differ in different Fishes as regards arrangement and
                    number as well as size. Owing, how ever, to their linear arrangements, they
                    usually receive corresponding names, though it is very doubtful whether they can
                    be considered as truly homologous.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Balfour, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.,</hi> p.
                    486.</p></note> In most Bony Fishes, as in higher animals, we may generally
                    distinguish in the cranial roof one or two parietals, with an interparietal or
                    upper (or upper part of a) supraoccipital behind the parietals, and a frontal or
                    pair of frontals in front of them. A bone called the squamosal may also form
                    part of the cranial roof, as in Mammals, and may send forwards and outwards a
                    process which unites with another form, a preorbital bone, to form a zygomatic
                    arch. In front, above, behind, and beneath the orbit (in which lies the
                    sclerotic) bones may arise termed malars and lachrymals, supraorbitals, and
                    post-frontals respectively, and the zygomatic process of the squamosal may unite
                    with a corresponding process from the malar or the post-frontal. The malar bone,
                    or (as it is often called) the jugal, rather belongs, however, to the third
                    category of cranial skeletal parts. The olfactory or ethmoidal region becomes
                    roofed over in part by the frontals, in part by the lateral bones (belonging to
                    the third category of cranial parts to be presently noticed) called the
                    maxilla?, but it is mainly roofed over by two bones (sometimes one bone) called
                    nasals, which bound the posterior surface of the external nasal opening on each
                    side of the skull. In Bony Fishes, Amphibians, and Serpents almost the whole
                    cranium is invested below by a large membrane bone called the parasphenoid.</p>
                <p>The nervous centres within the cranial cavity send forth nerves through certain
                    definite small apertures or foramina, which show much constancy of position. As
                    a rule, and in the highest class of Vertebrates, the olfactory nerves pass out
                    medianly in front to the ethmoids, between the orbitosphenoids or the membranous
                    parts which may represent them. The optic nerves perforate the orbitosphenoids,
                    but may pass out behind them. In Lizards <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Hatteria,
                    Anguis,</hi> and many others) an aperture is left in the roof of the skull which
                    is called the “parietal foramen.” It serves for the reception of a third and
                    rudimentary eye, the existence of which in Lizards was before referred to in
                    noticing the cartilaginous cranium. It is a structure of great morphological
                    interest. The nerves of the muscles of the eye, as well as the first of the
                    three divisions of the fifth nerve, pass out in the interval between the orbito
                    and ali-sphenoids. The two other divisions of the fifth, as a rule, perforate
                    the alisphenoid, the third the more constantly, the aperture for it being known
                    as the foramen ovale, the less constant aperture for the second branch being
                    called the foramen rotundum. The auditory nerve enters the auditory capsule
                    (whether ossified or not) on its inner side, and does not pass out from it, but
                    the facial nerve both perforates and traverses it. The glossopharyngeal,
                    pneumogastric, and spinal accessory nerves pass out between the auditory capsule
                    and the exoccipital, which latter bone is perforated and traversed by the
                    hypoglossal nerve.</p>
                <p>Thus the osseous cranium (apart from the sense-capsules) consists of three arched
                    segments: of these the hindmost is formed by the basi-, ex-, and
                    supra-occipitals, the median by the basisphenoid, alisphenoids, and parietals,
                    and the anterior by the presphenoid, the orbitosphenoid, and the frontals. These
                    have been called “cranial vertebrae,” and certainly if the essence of vertebrae
                    consists in their being a series of solid rings, fitted together and enclosing a
                    tract of the nervous centres, then it must be admitted that the cranium—of the
                    highest class of animals at least—is made up of three such vertebrae. Their
                    development, however, is altogether different from that of true vertebrae, and
                    no such resemblance to vertebrae<pb break="no"

                    cartilaginous cranium. Nevertheless it is undeniable that there is a singular
                    secondary and induced resemblance to vertebrae in these ossified skeletal
                    parts.</p>
                <p>The osseous condition of the third category of cranial skeletal parts varies
                    extremely in different classes of Vertebrates. The limits of this article are
                    altogether insufficient for more than a brief indication of the main varieties
                    of the cranial structures of any of the three categories, and the reader must
                    refer for details to the descriptions given in the various articles of this work
                    which are devoted to different groups of animals.</p>
                <p>The most anterior lateral descending bar or visceral arc is known as the
                    mandibular arch. That part of it which extends forwards and forms the upper jaw
                    presents us with the following ossifications arranged in two rows— one external,
                    the other internal. The external row, proceeding from before backwards, consists
                    of premaxilla, maxilla, jugal (or malar), and very often of a quadrato-jugal,
                    which latter, when present, is generally in the form of a bar of bone (with an
                    interval between it and the skull), forming, or helping to form, an inferior
                    lateral external arch analogous to the superior lateral arch already noticed as
                    the “zygoma.” There may be a pair of premaxillae, or they may be represented by
                    an azygous bone. The premaxilla, maxilla, and jugal often unite with the
                    anterior outer margins of the nasal, frontal, and lachrymal to form a continuous
                    bony external wall to the anterior part of the skull. The internal row of bones,
                    proceeding again from before backwards, consists of the vomer, palatine, and
                    pterygoid, which, with their fellows of the opposite side (and sometimes with
                    the aid of the parasphenoid), form the bony roof to the mouth, which roof may
                    (as in Mammals and Crocodiles) be a continuous bony partition, or may be but a
                    sort of open bony framework. Besides the pterygoid proper, other ossifications,
                    adjoining it, have been distinguished as the entopterygoid and
                    ectopterygoid.</p>
                <p>The lower part of the most anterior lateral visceral arc forms all or part of the
                    lower jaw. In the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> it forms the whole of that
                    jaw, and is invested by but a single bone—the dentary. In other Vertebrates it
                    forms but the distal, though greater, part of that jaw, and may be invested, not
                    only by a dentary, but also by bones called angular, subangular, coronoid, and
                    splenial. The jaw is further continued, proximally, by two bones—the articular
                    and the quadrate—which are ossifications of the cartilaginous arc itself. This
                    may, as in Birds and Reptiles, be directly articulated to the cranial wall, or
                    it may be (as in Fishes) suspended therefrom by bones, the highest of which is
                    termed the hyomandibular, which articulates with the ossified auditory capsule.
                    The hyomandibular joins below two other bones, the anterior of which is called
                    the metapterygoid and the posterior the symplectic, to both of which the
                    quadrate is attached. Thus these four bones act as a “suspensorium” for the
                    lower jaw, the joint between which jaw and the suspensorium is placed at the
                    junction of the quadrate and the articular. In Mammals, parts answering to the
                    suspensorium, the quadrate, and the articular form no part of the jaw but are of
                    relatively minute size and are known as certain parts (the auditory ossicles,
                    &amp;c.) of the internal ear,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The exact and precise homologies of these parts seem still
                    to be <hi rend="italic">sub judice.</hi> of the internal ear,—except the very
                    summit of the arch, which forms the tympanohyal, and is anchylosed to the
                    ossified auditory capsule of the internal ear. In Bony Fishes the hyoidean arch
                    begins to free itself from the suspensorium, as a bone called the stylohyal,
                    which is attached to the preceding or mandibular arch, between the hyomandibular
                    and the symplectic. The arc then continues downwards as the epihyal and
                    ceratohyal, ending below in the basihyal, from which a glossohyal may project
                    forwards and a urohyal backwards. In Fishes certain styliform ossicles termed
                    branchiostegal rays may project backwards from the hyoidean arch; and above them
                    certain membrane bones called opercular bones—the operculum, preoperculum,
                    suboperculum, and interoperculum —are attached above to the hyomandibular, and
                    lie outside the mandibular and hyoidean arches.</p><p>In the air-breathing
                    Vertebrates the hyoidean arch may be well developed or very imperfectly so, and
                    concurs with parts belonging to the more posteriorly situated lateral arches to
                    form a complex bone—the os hyoïdes—as will be further described.</p><p>These
                    more posterior lateral arches—the branchial arches—attain their most complex
                    osseous condition in Bony Fishes, which have commonly five of them, not solidly
                    united to the skull above, but connected one with another inferiorly and with
                    the inferior part of the hyoid arch. From below upwards these arches consist
                    generally of a basibranchial, a hypobranchial, a ceratobranchial, an
                    epibranchial, and a pharyngobranchial, but the hindmost arch is less fully and
                    complexly formed.</p><p>In air-breathing Vertebrates the already-mentioned os
                    hyoïdes consists of a central part or “body,” to which are attached two pairs of
                    single or jointed processes termed cornua. The anterior pair of cornua (known in
                    human anatomy as the lesser cornua) represent the hyoidean arch, and may contain
                    all its bones, including the “tympanohyal.” The posterior pair of cornua (the
                    greater cornua of human anatomy and the thyrohyals of Mammals generally) answer
                    to or represent part of the branchial arches, and may be longer or shorter than
                    the anterior pair of cornua. That they really have this homology is proved by
                    the process of metamorphosis of the Tadpole, which in its early stage has
                    distinct cartilaginous branchial arches that become the posterior cornua of the
                    os hyoides of the adult Frog.</p><p>The osseous skull may, its bones remaining
                    distinct, form a very solid whole, and the brain-case may be complete, as in
                    Mammals, or it may be very loosely constructed and largely membranous, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g</hi>., in most Lizards. Teeth may be connected with various
                    bones,—most constantly with the dentary, maxilke, and premaxillae,—but the
                    palatines, pterygoids, parasphenoid (in <hi rend="italic">Plethodon),</hi>
                    pharyngo-branchials, and even the basioccipital (Carp and Tench), may be
                    dentigerous.</p><p>The structure of the skull is so exceedingly complex and
                    varied that it is impossible within the limits of the present article to do more
                    than give the above general indications. For further particulars the reader is
                    referred to the anatomical details which will be found in the several articles
                    of this work which are devoted to the description of different single groups of
                    Vertebrate animals, and especially to the description of the skull of Man in the

                    may have its upper part ossified, in union with the preceding arch, as in the
                    bony suspensorium of Fishes just described. On the other hand its upper part
                    may, as in Mammals, be represented only by minute parts<pb break="no"

                    appendicular skeleton may, however, be wanting, as in the Lamprey and in most
                    Serpents.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Skeleton of the Paired Limbs.</hi> —The paired-limb
                    skeleton normally consists of that of an anterior, pectoral, or thoracic pair of
                    limbs and that of a posterior or pelvic pair. In certain species there may be
                    but a single pair of limbs, which may either be the pectoral pair, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the Amphibian genus <hi rend="italic">Siren,</hi> or
                    the pelvic pair, as in the Reptilian genera <hi rend="italic">Bipes,
                    Lialis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ophiodes.</hi></p>
                <p>Normally each pair consists of diverging appendages— the limb skeleton
                    proper—attached to a solid structure embracing parts of the trunk, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a limb-root or limb-girdle. A thoracic limb-girdle may
                    exist in a Well-developed condition without any limbs attached to it—as in the
                    Slow-Worm <hi rend="italic">(Anguis),</hi> but there is never a Well-developed
                    pelvic girdle without a rudiment of a pelvic limb.</p>
                <p>In all Vertebrates above Fishes the limbs are divisible into a main part of the
                    limb—arm or leg,—with a distal part or extremity—“manus” (hand) or “pes” (foot).
                    We sometimes find (as in <hi rend="italic">Lialis, Python,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Balaena)</hi> a rudimentary development of the skeleton of the leg
                    without any rudiment of a pes; but we never find any rudimentary development of
                    an arm without any rudiments of a manus. In the paired limb, as we have seen, a
                    limb-girdle may be present without any part of a limb, but no part of the limb
                    skeleton is ever developed without any limb-girdle. Normally the two
                    limb-girdles are attached in a solid manner to the axial skeleton, in different
                    modes.</p>
                <p>Normally the pectoral girdle is only thus connected with the axial skeleton by
                    its ventral part, or with the ventral part of that skeleton, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> with the sternum, while it ends freely above, being dorsally
                    connected with the axial skeleton only by soft structures. In Fishes, however,
                    it may abut by its dorsal extremities on each side against the neural region of
                    the spinal column, as in <hi rend="italic">Paia clavata,</hi> or be connected
                    with the head by skeletal structures, as in Bony Fishes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> Perch, Cod, &amp;c.,—having all the time no connexion with the spine
                    by its ventral part.</p>
                <p>The pelvic girdle, on the contrary, is normally connected by its dorsal part
                    solidly with the axial skeleton, though, as in Fishes, it may not be at all so
                    connected. It never, however, abuts ventrally against the axial skeleton as does
                    the thoracic girdle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Appendicular Skeleton of Vertebrates above Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>The paired limbs of all animals above Fishes are formed on one type, and differ
                    greatly from those of the last-mentioned class. It will be convenient to
                    describe first the general condition of the limbs in Mammals, Birds, Reptiles,
                    and Amphibians.</p>
                <p>Both the thoracic and pelvic limbs of these animals are divided, as before said,
                    into main parts (arm and leg) and extremity (manns and pes). Each main part is
                    further subdivided into a proximal segment (upper arm and thigh) and a distal
                    segment (fore-arm and lower part of the leg). Each extremity is subdivided into
                    a root portion (“carpus” and “tarsus ”), a middle portion (“metacarpus” and
                    “metatarsus ”), and a terminal portion known as the digits. Thus the skeleton,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of the hand of Man is composed of—(1) the root part
                    of the hand or the “carpus” (made up of eight small bones); (2) the middle part
                    of the hand or “metacarpus” (made up of five long bones enclosed in the flesh of
                    the palm): and (3) that of the digits, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of the thumb
                    (or “pollex”) and of the four fingers, while the great toe (or “hallux”) and the
                    four other toes are the “digits” of the pes.</p>
                <p>The joints between the proximal and distal segments of the main part of each limb
                    are the elbow and the knee, and these are turned mostly (as in ourselves) in
                    opposite directions. Primitively, however, in all animals and permanently in
                    some (<hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>., Tortoises), both these joints are so
                    conditioned as to open inwards—the elbow and knee being both directed
                    outwards—while the palm of the manus and the sole of the pes are also both
                    inwards in the embryo, and in the adult are applied to the ground, the digits of
                    each extremity being directed outwards. This is the position in which the corre
                    spondence in structure between the thoracic and pelvic limbs is most obvious,
                    and in it the whole surface of the limbs, which (on account of the muscles there
                    placed) is known as the “extensor” surface, is turned outwards, whereas that
                    known as the “flexor” surface is turned inwards, while the pollex of the manus
                    and the hallux of the pes are both in front of their respective extremities,
                    This primitive condition is altered during the process of development of Man and
                    most air-breathing Vertebrates, the knee becoming bent forwards and the elbow
                    backwards, while the fore-arm is twisted by a movement called “pronation,” so as
                    to enable the flexor or palmar surface of the manus to be applied in a direction
                    parallel to that of the flexor or plantar surface of the pes.</p>
                <p>In Bats the thigh is turned backwards, so that the knee bends backwards like an
                    elbow. Were it necessary in these animals to apply the sole of the pes to the
                    ground with the digits forwards (as in most animals), then a pronation of the
                    lower leg would be needed in them, similar to the pronation of the fore-arm,
                    which, as above said, takes place in the majority of animals here referred
                    to—air-breathing Vertebrates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Thoracic or Pectoral Limb-Girdle.—</hi> The shoulder-girdle
                    normally consists of the following bones or cartilages :—(1) a superior portion,
                    generally a more or less broad plate of bone, called the scapula,: the upper
                    part of which may remain cartilaginous and more or less distinguishable as a
                    suprascapula; (2) a posterior inferior portion, named the coracoid, which may or
                    may not be continuous with the scapula, and may have additional parts or
                    subdivisions distinguished as the coracoid proper, precoracoid, and epicoracoid;
                    at the junction of the scapula and coracoid there is a concave articular
                    surface—the glenoid cavity, into which the pectoral limb is articulated; (3) an
                    anterior inferior portion, called the clavicle, which may abut against an
                    azygous median structure known as an interclavicle, the two being distinguished
                    from the other elements of the girdle by being more or less entirely membrane
                    bones.</p>
                <p>These structures are found well developed in many Lizards and quite exceptionally
                    in Monotremes amongst Mammals. In them and in Birds, the coracoids are largely
                    developed, while they remain mere processes of the scapula in non-Monotrematous
                    Mammals, and sometimes are quite rudimentary. In such Mammals the pectoral arch
                    is only completed inferiorly by the clavicles which abut against the sternum,
                    but sometimes (as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in Ungulates) are altogether
                    absent. The “merrythought” of Birds is a clavicular structure. In Amphibians the
                    two halves of the shoulder-girdle are each formed of a continuous plate. Some
                    anatomists reckon part of this as representing a clavicle, but this
                    determination is very doubtful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Pelvic Girdle.—</hi> This girdle, like the former one,
                    normally consists of three parts—one dorsal, the ilium, and two ventral, whereof
                    the more anterior is the pubis and the posterior the ischium, and all these are
                    cartilage bones. The pubis generally meets ventrally its fellow of the opposite
                    side, but not always so. The ischia meet ventrally more rarely. In Birds and
                    certain extinct Reptiles a third element, the post-pubis, intervenes between the
                    ischium (more or less parallel to the latter) and a pubis which may be fully or
                    only rudimentarily developed. At the junction of the ilium and the ventral
                    pelvic elements there is a concave articular surface for the pelvic limb, the
                    acetabulum. An interval between the pubis and ischium of each side is known as
                    the obturator foramen. We find amongst Amphibians there is a peculiar cartilage
                    in the ventral median line in front of the pubis, which has been called the
                    prepubic cartilage.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    bones supporting them in Vertebrates above Fishes having already been indicated,
                    it remains but to fill in a few details as to their normal structure and its
                    principal varieties.</p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Pectoral.—</hi> The bone of the upper arm is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">humerus,</hi> and is more or less cylindrical in shape, with an
                    expansion at each end. It may, however, be almost as broad as long, as in the
                    Mole and some Cetacea. The lower arm is generally furnished with two bones, the
                    radius and the ulna, placed side by side. The ulna may be more or less abortive,
                    as in Ruminants and Bats, but it may be the larger of the two fore-arm bones, as
                    is the case amongst Birds.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi> may have its parts more or less permanently
                    cartilaginous, as in some Urodeles and Cetaceans.</p>
                <p>Taking the carpus of Man as a type of the ossified carpus (for further details,
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy),</hi> it consists of the eight following short
                    bones arranged in two transverse rows. The proximal row (that next the arm)
                    includes the scaphoides, lunare, cuneiforme, and pisiforme, while the distal row
                    (that next the fingers) comprises the trapezium, trapezoides, magnum, and
                    unciforme—starting, in each enumeration, from the thumb side of the manus. The
                    pisiforme stands out from the rest, and is reckoned as a sesamoid bone<pb

                    carpal ossicle. There may be an analogous sesamoid ossicle on the other side of
                    the wrist (on the side of the scaphoid) even in Apes, and this obtains its
                    maximum in the Mole, where it strengthens and broadens the manus for digging.
                    The true carpal bones may be more numerous or less numerous than in Man. Thus
                    there may be an ossicle— called intermedium or centrale—placed in the mid line
                    between the two rows of carpals, and this may be double, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cryptobranchus</hi> and some Siberian Urodeles. The unciforme may also be
                    represented by two bones, as amongst Chelonians; the pisiforme is often absent,
                    and also the trapezium. The bones of the distal row are the less constant in
                    number and development, and they may coalesce with the metacarpals, as in the
                    Chameleon. Their development is related to that of the digits with which they
                    articulate. All the true proximal carpal ossicles may unite into one bone, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Pteropus,</hi> and the whole carpus may be reduced to two
                    distinct bones, as amongst Birds.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mctacarpus,</hi> when fully developed, consists of five
                    rather long metacarpal bones, as in Man. There may, however, be but two, and
                    these united into what is called a “canon bone” (as in Sheep, Deer, &amp;c.); or
                    there may be but a single one, as in the Horse,— answering to Man’s third
                    metacarpal. They vary in relative size and proportion in different animals, but
                    are most remarkable for their length and slenderness in the Bats, while they are
                    much elongated in the Horse and most Ruminants.</p>
                <p>As to the <hi rend="italic">digits,</hi> there may be but a single one, as in the
                    Horse, or two, as in Ruminants and the Marsupial known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Choeropus.</hi> There may be three, as in the Rhinoceros, the Proteus, and in
                    <hi rend="italic">Seps;</hi> or there may be four. The digits are never
                    certainly more than five (except by monstrosity), although in the Ichthyosaurus
                    extra marginal bones along the manus give at least the appearance of more.</p>
                <p>When a digit is wanting it is generally the pollex (thumb), as in Spider Monkeys,
                    but it may be the fifth, as in Pterodactyles, or both fourth and fifth may be
                    wanting, as in Birds. The pollex may be more or less opposable to the others, as
                    in Lemurs, most Monkeys, and in Man, or two digits may be opposed to the other
                    three, as in the Chameleon.</p>
                <p>The second digit may be greatly reduced, as in the Potto, or the third may be
                    disptoportionally slender, as in the Aye-Aye, or thick, as in the Great
                    Armadillo. The digits may be enormously elongated, as in the Bats, or short, as
                    in the Mole and the Land Tortoises. They may be very imperfectly developed, as
                    in Birds. They may be so united by dense tissue as to be quite incapable of
                    separate motion, as in the Cetaceans. The bones of the fingers are called
                    phalanges, and there are always three of them to each digit except the pollex,
                    which has but two in all Mammals with the exception of certain Cetaceans, which
                    have more. There may be as many as fourteen phalanges in one digit in <hi
                    rend="italic">Globiocephalus.</hi> The proximal row of these bones may become
                    anchylosed to the metacarpals, as in the Three-toed Sloth. In Reptiles the
                    numbers of the phalanges often increase from two in the pollex to five in the
                    fourth digit, as in the Monitor. The abortive manus of Birds has at its best but
                    three digits, with two phalanges to the pollex, three to the index, and one or
                    two to the third digit. The phalanges are very numerous in the Ichthyosaurus and
                    Plesiosaurus.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Pelvic. —</hi> The bone of the thigh is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">femur,</hi> and is a long bone which varies less in its form and
                    proportion in different animals than does the humerus. It is, however,
                    relatively very short in the Seals, and still shorter in the Ichthyosaurus.</p>
                <p>In front of the knee-joint there is generally present a large sesamoid bone known
                    as the knee-pan or patella. This, however, may even in Mammals be very small, as
                    in Bats and Seals, or wanting altogether, as in the Wombat.</p>
                <p>The leg below the knee is supported by two long bones, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tibia</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">fibula,</hi> placed side by side, whereof
                    the former is the more internally situated, the larger generally, and the more
                    constant. The two bones may anchylose together at each end, as in the
                    Armadillos, or they may do so only below or only above; the two bones may be
                    completely fused together, as in the Frog. The tibia may be the only long bone,
                    through the small development of the fibula, as in Ruminants and the Horse. The
                    fibula may be quite styliform, as in Birds, or it may be developed inferiorly
                    but be atrophied at its upper end, as in Bats. It may be represented only by a
                    small ossification outside the lower end of the tibia, as in the Ox, and with
                    this there may exist a styliform rudiment of its upper part, as in the Elk.</p>
                <p>The joint by which the foot moves on the leg is situated between the lower end of
                    the leg bones and the tarsus in Mammals and Amphibians. In Birds and Reptiles,
                    however, this joint is placed in the tarsus, the proximal part of which is
                    firmly connected with the leg, while its distal part is firmly connected with
                    the metatarsus.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tarsus</hi> of Man consists of seven irregularly shaped,
                    more or less short bones. Of these the astragalus joins the tibia and has the os
                    calcis beneath it and the naviculare in front of it, while the metatarsals are
                    supported (from the great toe outwards) by the internal, middle, and external
                    cuneiform bones and by the cuboides, which is connected with the fourth and
                    fifth metatarsals.</p>
                <p>The tarsus may have its parts more or less permanently cartilaginous, as in some
                    Urodeles. The number of its bones, or cartilages, may be as many as nine, as in
                    the Salamander, or be reduced to three, as in <hi rend="italic">Proteus,</hi> or
                    perhaps to two, as in <hi rend="italic">Ophiodes.</hi> Two tarsal bones (the os
                    calcis and naviculare) may take the form of long bones, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Galago</hi> and especially in <hi rend="italic">Tarsius.</hi> These two bones
                    and the astragalus may be represented by a single bone, as in many Lizards, or
                    may early unite with the tibia, as in almost all Birds. The astragalus may be
                    represented by two bones, as in Urodeles. It may have an extra ossicle annexed
                    to it, as in the male <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Echidna.</hi> Two extra ossicles may be attached to the tibial
                    side of the foot, as in the true Porcupine <hi rend="italic">(Cercolabes).</hi>
                    The naviculare may anchylose with one of the distal tarsal bones, as in the Ox
                    and Deer, where it unites with the cuboid. The distal bones are less constant
                    than the others, and they may anchylose with the metatarsals, as in Birds, the
                    Chameleon, and the Three-toed Sloth. The cuboid may be represented by two bones,
                    as in certain Urodeles. The internal cuneiforme may be wanting, as in the Ox, or
                    coalesce with the middle one, as in the Horse.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">metatarsus</hi> when fully developed consists of five
                    rather long metatarsal bones, as in Man, and never of more. There may be but a
                    single developed metatarsal, as in the Horse (the third) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Choeropus</hi> (the fourth), or two fused together, as in the Sheep, Deer,
                    &amp;c., or three fused together, as in the Jerboa, or four so fused, as in many
                    Birds. There may be but two metatarsals well developed, as in the Hog, or three,
                    as in the Rhinoceros, or four, as in the Dog. They are never enormously
                    elongated like the metacarpals of Bats, but they may all be extremely short, as
                    in Land Tortoises and the Ichthyosaurus.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">digits</hi> vary in number, as has just been indicated with
                    respect to the metatarsal bones sustaining them.</p>
                <p>When one digit is wanting it may be the fifth, as in Birds, or the hallux (first
                    or great toe), as in the Hare. The third and fourth digits may be only
                    functional ones, as in the Ostrich; but the third may abort, leaving only the
                    fourth, as in <hi rend="italic">Choeropus,</hi> or the fourth, leaving only the
                    third, as in the Horse. The fourth and fifth may be the only functional ones, as
                    in the Kangaroo. The hallux may be opposable to the other digits, as in Monkeys,
                    Lemurs, Opossums, and Phalangers; or the first and fourth digits may be opposed
                    to the second and third, as in Parrots; or the first and second to the third,
                    fourth, and fifth, as in the Chameleon.</p>
                <p>The phalanges of the digits are in Man’s whole class always three to each digit
                    except the hallux, which (like the pollex) has but two —save in the Orang, where
                    it may have but one phalanx. They may be much more numerous than in Mammals, as
                    in the pes of the Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus. The numbers of the phalanges
                    as we proceed from the first to the fifth digit may be 2, 3, 4, 5,∙ 4, as in
                    Lizards generally, or 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, as in the Salamander, or 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, as
                    in the Frog. In Birds (where the fifth digit is more developed) the numbers of
                    the phalanges, proceeding from the hallux, are mostly 2, 3, 4, 5; but they may
                    be 2, 3, 3, 3, as in the Swifts, or 2, 3, 4, 3, as in the Goatsuckers.</p>

                    Paired Limbs.—</hi> Most Fishes possess two pairs of limbs, known as the
                    pectoral and ventral fins, which respectively correspond to the pectoral and
                    pelvic limbs of higher Vertebrates. These limbs are attached to corresponding
                    limb-girdles, whereof the pelvic girdle is always inferior in development and
                    never attains the large relative proportions and fixed position of the pelvic
                    girdle of non-Piscine Vertebrates.</p>
                <p>Very often, however, the ventral fins are entirely wanting, and the pectoral fins
                    are sometimes wanting also. In the latter case there is usually present more or
                    less of a pectoral limb-girdle, though it may be, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muraenophis,</hi> little more than a filament. In all non-Piscine Vertebrates

                <p>The situation of the paired limbs is, in Elasmobranchs, Ganoids, and a good many
                    Teleosteans, similar to that they hold in higher Vertebrates, but in some other
                    Teleosteans (such as the Fishes on that account called “thoracic”) the ventral
                    fins are placed far forwards so as to come immediately behind the pectoral fins,
                    while in yet other Teleosteans (known on that account as “jugular” Fishes) they
                    are placed even in front of the pectoral fins.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pectoral girdle</hi> may consist of a simple cartilaginous

                    bones meeting ventrally, each being commonly regarded as a clavicle which is
                    continued up dorsally to the skull by the intervention of a supraclavicle and a
                    post-temporal. Besides these there is a cartilaginous element on each side which
                    usually ossifies in two pieces, the upper one of which is reckoned as
                    representing a scapula and the lower one a coracoid. These parts are annexed to
                    the inner side of the clavicle, where also there is sometimes found a styliform

                    to the innominate bone of higher Vertebrates in that it sends up a process
                    simulating (and probably representing) the iliac element and possesses a sort of
                    obturator foramen. In Osseous Fishes the pelvic girdle is normally represented
                    by two innominate bones medianly joined, each of which may, by rare exception,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">Lophius,</hi> send up a tall ilium-like process. In no

                    (which has a slightly-developed pubic and iliac process) is separated from its

                    the propterygium, the mesopterygium, and the metapterygium. Of these the
                    propterygium is proximal or anterior in position. To the distal ends of these
                    are articulated a number of slender elongated more or less segmented radial
                    cartilages, and to the distal portions of these are annexed the horny fin-rays
                    which form the solid supports of the distal portion of the fin.</p>
                <p>Sometimes there may be but two and rarely only one basal cartilage, which one
                    must then be considered as representing the whole three condifferentiated. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Ceratodus</hi> there is a single basal cartilage followed by a
                    series of small cartilages—secondary radial cartilages diverging from both sides
                    of that series and having fin-rays annexed to them. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidosiren</hi> the limb skeleton is still more simplified, consisting only of
                    a single series of short slender cartilages with small fin-rays attached to one
                    side alone, without the intervention of any radial cartilages.</p>
                <p>In some Bony Fishes <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Polypterus)</hi> the basal
                    cartilages are more or less ossified, as are also most of the radiais next them,
                    while to these small cartilaginous radiais are annexed, which support ossified
                    fin-rays. In some other Ganoids certain of the radial cartilages articulate
                    directly with the pectoral arch. In the <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> a few,
                    not above five, more or less ossified cartilages lie side by side and articulate
                    with the pectoral arch, and one or more rows of small cartilages succeed to
                    them. These two elements represent the basal and radial cartilages of
                    Elasmobranchs, and to them are articulated the relatively large fin-rays which
                    make up the far greater part of the Teleostean pectoral limbs.</p>
                <p>The skeleton of the <hi rend="italic">ventral fin</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pelvic limb</hi> is almost always more simple than that of the pectoral one.
                    Only very rarely, as in <hi rend="italic">Ceratodus, Lepidosiren,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Callorhynehus antarcticus</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">Trans. Zook
                    Soc.,</hi> vol. X. p. 455, and plate lxxix. figs. 3 and 4), have they a close,
                    or pretty close, resemblance. Generally the Elasmobranch ventral limb is
                    supported by an elongated cartilage, the basipterygium, which articulates with
                    the pelvic cartilages and bears on its ventral border a series of cartilaginous
                    radialia with which the fin-rays are connected. In <hi rend="italic">Polyodon
                    folium</hi> there are only radiais which support fin-rays but are not themselves
                    supported by any basipterygium, nor is there any pelvic cartilage. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> the fin-rays are directly attached to the osseous
                    pelvic elements.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Unpaired Appendicular Elements.—</hi> Besides the two pairs
                    of limbs there are, as has been mentioned, certain azygous structures commonly
                    known as the unpaired or azygous fins or limbs. They are only found in Fishes,
                    and consist of the dorsal, caudal, and anal fins. These may all run one into the
                    other and form a continuous fin fringe to the body from the head round the tail
                    and forward again to the vent, as in Eels and many Gadoid and Blennioid Fishes.
                    In most cases, however, there are one or two distinct dorsal fins, and an anal
                    fin also distinct from the caudal one.</p>
                <p>The structure of the <hi rend="italic">dorsal fin</hi> in Elasmobranchs is
                    singularly like that of their paired fins, inasmuch as it is supported by an
                    elongated or segmented basal cartilage or cartilages, from the dorsal margin of
                    which radial cartilages (generally elongated, slender, and segmented) proceed,
                    having the fin-rays connected with them distally. The basal cartilages may or
                    may not be directly connected or become confluent with the subjacent spinal
                    skeleton. There may be (as in the second dorsal of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Callorhynchus antarcticus)</hi> but a single longi tudinal series of more or
                    less elongated cartilages side by side, like radial cartilages devoid of any
                    subjacent basal cartilages. In the <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> the fin-rays
                    may be osseous and in the form of more or less strong spines, or soft and of a
                    horn-like consistency, and segmented both vertically and horizontally; and
                    fin-rays generally consist of two (right and left) halves, which, although
                    closely applied together for the greater part of their length, diverge
                    proximally to embrace the skeletal element to which they are annexed. These
                    latter elements in the <hi rend="italic">Teleostei</hi> are small ossicles or
                    chondrifications, termed “interspinous bones or cartilages.” They extend upwards
                    between the neural spines of the axial skeleton and the dorsal surface of the
                    body. <hi rend="italic">Anal fins</hi> are essentially similar in composition to
                    dorsal fins.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">caudal fin</hi> is modified according to the condition of
                    the posterior termination of the axial skeleton, the different condition of
                    which in Fishes has already been noticed (p. 112). Much-modified axial elements
                    generally form the support of the fin-rays, but the numerous complex and varied
                    conditions which these parts may present in different forms is a matter of
                    ichthyology, which can hardly find a place in a general description of the
                    Vertebrate skeleton.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nature and Origin of Appendicular Skeletal Parts.—</hi> From
                    the researches of the late Prof. Balfour it appears that the paired limbs arise
                    as differentiations of continuous lateral folds or projections from the surface
                    of the body, and the azygous fins arise as differentiated projections from its
                    dorsal and ventral surfaces. Thus all these appendicular parts may be viewed as
                    different species of one fundamental set of parts (pterygia), for the sum total
                    of which the term “sympterygium” has been proposed (see <hi rend="italic">Trans.
                    Zool. Soc.,</hi> vol. X. pp. 481, 482). The paired limbs and azygous fins are of
                    similar origin and nature. Separate narrow solid supports, in longitudinal
                    series, and with their long axes directed more or less at right angles with the
                    long axis of the body, were developed in varying extent in all these four folds
                    or projections. These supports have, it would appear, very often united to form
                    basal cartilages, the original single and united condition persisting in such
                    forms as the ventral fin of <hi rend="italic">Polyodon</hi> and the second
                    dorsal of <hi rend="italic">Callorhynehus,</hi> both already noticed.</p>
                <p>The paired limbs are thus, in all probability, essentially peripheral structures
                    which have become more or less closely connected with the axial skeleton. Their
                    proximal parts uniting and growing inwards have often become directly connected
                    with parts of the axial skeleton. Thus the limb-girdles seem to have
                    arisen,—namely, as ingrowths from the basal cartilages of the limbs; and
                    therefore the whole appendicular skeleton belongs to a different skeletal
                    category from that of the head and spinal column or axial endoskeleton.</p>
