                    (1548-1617), Spanish theologian and philosopher, was born at Granada on the 5th
                    of January 1548. After completing his studies at the university of Salamanca, he
                    entered the Society of Jesus in 1564. The accounts of his early years represent
                    him as backward in his development, and it was not without difficulty that he
                    obtained admission to the order. Under the direction of Father Rodriguez,
                    however, he threw off his mental slough and discovered powers of mind of the
                    highest order. He is said to have habitually devoted seventeen hours a day to
                    study, and wonders are reported of his prodigious memory. He was soon appointed
                    to teach philosophy at Segovia, and he afterwards taught theology at Valladolid,
                    at Alcala, at Salamanca, and at Rome successively. After taking his doctorate at
                    Evora, he was named by Philip II. principal professor of theology in the
                    university of Coimbra. Suarez may be considered almost the last eminent
                    representative of scholasticism, and his works in twenty-three folio volumes
                    treat, after the scholastic method and with scholastic comprehensiveness, all
                    the main subjects of mediaeval philosophy and theology. In philosophical
                    doctrine he adhered to a moderate Thomism. On the question of universals he
                    endeavoured to steer a middle course between the panthe-istically inclined
                    realism of Duns Scotus and the extreme nominalism of William of Occam. The only
                    veritable and real unity in the world of existences is the individual; to assert
                    that the universal exists separately <hi rend="italic">ex pane rei</hi> would be
                    to reduce individuals to mere accidents of one indivisible form. Suarez
                    maintains that, though the humanity of Socrates does not differ from that of
                    Plato, yet they do not constitute <hi rend="italic">realiter</hi> one and the
                    same humanity; there are as many “formal unities” (in this case, humanities) as
                    there are individuals, and these individuals do not constitute a factual, but
                    only an essential or ideal unity (“ita ut plura individua, quae dicuntur esse
                    ejusdem naturae, non sint unum quid vera entitate quae sit in rebus, sed solum
                    fundamentaliter vel per intellectum ”). The formal unity, however, is not an
                    arbitrary creation of the mind, but exists “in natura rei ante omnem operationem
                    intellectus.” In theology, Suarez attached<pb break="no"

                    Jesuit professor of Evora. Molina tried to reconcile the doctrine of
                    predestination with the freedom of the human will by saying that the
                    predestination is consequent upon God’s foreknowledge of the free determination
                    of man’s will, which is therefore in no way affected by the fact of such
                    predestination. God gives to all men grace sufficient for their salvation, but
                    some co-operate freely with this grace, while others resist it. Suarez
                    endeavoured to reconcile this view with the more orthodox doctrines of the
                    efficacy of grace and special election, maintaining that, though all share in an
                    absolutely sufficient grace, there is granted to the elect a grace which is so
                    adapted to their peculiar dispositions and circumstances that they infallibly,
                    though at the same time quite freely, yield themselves to its influence. This
                    mediatizing system was known by the name of “congruism.” Suarez is probably more
                    important, however, as a philosophical jurist than as a theologian or
                    metaphysician. In his extensive work <hi rend="italic">Tractatus de Legibus ac
                    Deo Legislatore</hi> (reprinted, London, 1679) he is to some extent the
                    precursor of Grotius and Pufendorf. Though his method is throughout scholastic,
                    he covers the same ground, and Grotius speaks of him in terms of high respect.
                    The fundamental position of the work is that all legislative as well as all
                    paternal power is derived from God, and that the authority of every law resolves
                    itself into His. Suarez conclusively refutes the patriarchal theory of
                    government and the divine right of kings founded upon it,—doctrines popular at
                    that time in England and to some extent on the Continent. Adam, he remarks,
                    possessed only a domestic or patriarchal, not a political authority. Power by
                    its very nature belongs to no one man but to a multitude of men; and the reason
                    is obvious, since all men are born equal. It has been pointed out that this
                    accords well with the Jesuit policy of depreciating the royal while exalting the
                    papal prerogative. But Suarez is much more moderate on this point than a writer
                    like Mariana, approximating to the modern view of the rights of ruler and ruled.
                    In 1613, at the instigation of Pope Paul V., Suarez wrote a treatise dedicated
                    to the Christian princes of Europe, entitled <hi rend="italic">Defensio
                    Catholicae Fidei contra Anglicanae Sectae Errores.</hi> This was directed
                    against the oath of allegiance which James I. exacted from his subjects. James
                    caused it to be burned by the common hangman, and forbade its perusal under the
                    severest penalties, complaining bitterly at the same time to Philip III. that he
                    should harbour in his dominions a declared enemy of the throne and majesty of
                    kings. In France extracts from the treatise were condemned to the flames by the
                    parlement of Paris on similar grounds. Suarez died after a few days’ illness on
                    25th September 1617 at Lisbon, whither he had gone to be present at an
                    ecclesiastical conference.</p>
                <p>The collected works of Suarez have been printed at Mainz and Lyons (1630) and at

                    the Abbé Migne. His life has been written by Deschamps <hi rend="italic">(Vita
