                    division of the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, occupying an area of 4956
                    square miles, is situated between 25° 15' and 26° 37' N. lat. and 87° and 88°
                    33' E. long. On the N. it is bounded by the state of Nepal and the district of
                    Darjiling, on the E. by the Jalpaiguri, Dinajpur, and Maldah districts, on the
                    W. by Bhagalpur, and on the S. by the Ganges, which separates it from the
                    districts of Bhagalpur and the Santal Parganas. Purniah is a level depressed
                    tract of country, but for the most part of a rich loamy soil of alluvial
                    formation; it is traversed by several streams, which flow from the Himalayas
                    lying to the north and afford great advantages of irrigation and water carriage,
                    and is well cultivated; but in the west the soil is thickly covered with sand
                    deposited by the Kusi river, which rises in the Nepal mountains and flows
                    southwards to the Ganges. The country is destitute of anything that can be
                    called forest, but much scrub jungle is found in the <pb break="no"

                    other rivers of the district is the Mahananda, which rises in the mountains of
                    Sikkim and flows through the east of Purniah into Maldah. Wild animals are not
                    so numerous as in the neighbouring districts, but the tiger is found in all
                    parts of Purniah, particularly along the banks and among the sandy islands of
                    the Kusi, and also in the scrub jungle that runs along the north of the
                    district. The climate of Purniah is of an intermediate character; the average
                    rainfall is 67 inches, and the mean temperature is about 76 <hi

                <p>The staple product of Purniah is rice, but jute and tobacco are also cultivated
                    to a considerable extent. Its manufactures include indigo, cottons, woollens,
                    and silks, but the chief is that of indigo, which is mostly carried on in the
                    south of the district. In 1882-83 the gross revenue amounted to £179,750, nearly
                    two-thirds (£120,541) being derived from the land. By the census of 1881 the
                    population numbered 1,848,687 (937,080 males, 911,607 females). The majority of
                    the people are Hindus (1,076,539 in 1881); of Mohammedans in the same year there
                    were 771,130, and of Christians only 327. <hi rend="smallcaps">Purniah,</hi> the
                    capital, is the only town in the district with a population exceeding
                    10,000.</p>
                <p>This district was conquered by the Mohammedans in the 13th century, but it was
                    not until four centuries later that its value was realized. During the 17th
                    century the frontier was considerably extended; the country, however, remained
                    in a state of anarchy until 1770, when it was governed by an English official
                    with the title of “superintendent.” Of late years the district has made
                    considerable progress, and under all departments of local administration there
                    lias been steady improvement.</p>
