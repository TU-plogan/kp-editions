                <p><label type="entry">PYRRHUS</label>. The name of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, owes
                    its chief fame in history to the fact that with his invasion of Italy in the
                    early part of the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Greece and Rome for
                    the first time came definitely into contact. Born about the year 318, and
                    claiming descent from Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, connected also with the
                    royal family of Macedonia through Olympias, the mother of Alexander the Great,
                    he became when a mere stripling king of the wild mountain tribes of Epirus, and
                    learned how to fight battles in the school of Demetrius Poliorcetes (the
                    Besieger) and of his father Antigonus. He fought by their side in his
                    seventeenth year at the memorable battle of Ipsus in Phrygia, in which they were
                    decisively defeated by the combined armies of Seleucus and Lysimachus. Soon
                    afterwards he was sent to the court of Ptolemy of Egypt at Alexandria as a
                    pledge for the faithful carrying out of a treaty of alliance between Ptolemy and
                    Demetrius, as his sister Deidamia was the wife of the latter. Through Ptolemy,
                    whose step-daughter Antigone he married, he was enabled to establish himself
                    firmly on the throne of Epirus, and he became a formidable opponent to
                    Demetrius, who was now king of Macedonia and the leading man in the Greek world.
                    He won a victory over one of Demetrius’s generals in Aetolia, invaded Macedonia,
                    and forced Demetrius to conclude a truce with him. For a brief space of about
                    seven months he had possession of a large part of Macedonia, Demetrius finding
                    it convenient to make this surrender on condition that Pyrrhus did not meddle
                    with the affairs of the Peloponnesus. But in 286 he was defeated by Lysimachus
                    at Edessa, driven out of Macedonia, and compelled to fall back on his little
                    kingdom of Epirus. In 280 came the great opportunity of his life, the embassy
                    from the famous Greek city Tarentum in southern Italy with a request for aid
                    against Rome, whose hostility the Tarentines had recklessly provoked. Pyrrhus
                    had a trusted friend and adviser in Cineas of Thessaly, a persuasive speaker and
                    a clever diplomatist, and he at once sent him over with 3000 men to Tarentum
                    with a view to prepare matters. He himself soon followed, after a disastrous
                    passage across the Adriatic, with a miscellaneous force, furnished him partly by
                    the assistance of Ptolemy, of about 25,000 men, with some elephants, his best
                    troops being some Macedonian infantry and Thessalian cavalry. He had counted on
                    an army of Italian mercenaries, but the Tarentines and the Italian Greeks <pb

                <p>generally shrank from anything like serious effort and resented his calling upon
                    them for men and money. Rome meantime raised a special war contribution, called
                    on her subjects and allies for their full contingent of troops, and posted
                    strong garrisons in all towns of doubtful fidelity. She was now quite the
                    dominant power in Italy, but her position was critical, as in the north she had
                    had trouble with the Etruscans and Gauls, while in the south the Lucanians and
                    Bruttians were making common cause with Tarentum and the Greek cities. In fact
                    there was the possibility of a most formidable coalition of the Italian peoples
                    both in the north and in the south against Rome, and so Pyrrhus had a good deal
                    on which to build his hopes of success. For the first time in history Greeks and
                    Romans met in battle at Heraclea near the shores of the Gulf of Tarentum, and
                    the cavalry and elephants of Pyrrhus secured for him a complete victory, though
                    at so heavy a loss as to convince him of the great uncertainty of final success.
                    Although he now had the Samnites as well as the Lucanians and Bruttians and all
                    the Greek cities of southern Italy with him, he found every city closed against
                    him as he advanced on Rome through Latium, and his dexterous minister Cineas
                    utterly failed to negotiate a peace, the old blind Appius Claudius declaring in
                    the senate that Rome never negotiated with a foreign enemy on Italian ground. In
                    the second year of the war, 279, Pyrrhus again defeated a Roman army at Asculum
                    (Ascoli) in Apulia, but he was no nearer decisive success, as Rome still had
                    armies in the field and her Italian confederation was not broken up. For a while
                    he quitted Italy for Sicily with the view of making himself the head of the
                    Sicilian Greeks and driving the Carthaginians out of the island. In his military
                    operations he was on the whole successful, and Rome and Carthage in face of the
                    common danger concluded an offensive and defensive alliance against him. He
                    passed three years in Sicily, but through want of political tact he gave offence
                    to the Greek cities, which he treated rather too much in the fashion of a
                    despot, not paying any respect to their local constitutions or sufficiently
                    humouring their republican tastes and love of independence. He thus lost a good
                    opportunity of uniting both the Italian and Sicilian Greeks against Rome. On his
                    return to Italy in 276 he had neither men nor money adequately supplied him, as
                    Tarentum and the other Greek cities had no confidence in him. It is said that he
                    was thoroughly disheartened, and was haunted by mysterious dreams and
                    forebodings which followed on an act which he imagined had involved him in the
                    guilt of sacrilege. He made indeed one more effort, and engaged a Roman army at
                    Beneventum in the Samnite country, but his arrangements for the battle
                    miscarried, and he was defeated with the loss of his camp and the greater part
                    of his army. He had made a fair trial of the strength of Rome and had been
                    utterly baffled. Nothing remained but to go back to his allies at Tarentum. He
                    left a garrison in the city and returned the following year to his home in
                    Epirus after a six years’ absence. The brief remainder of his life was passed in
                    camps and battles, without, however, any glorious result. He won a victory over
                    Antigonus Gonatas, king of Macedonia, on Macedonian ground. In 273 he was
                    invited into the Peloponnesus to settle at the sword’s point a dispute about the
                    royal succession at Sparta. He besieged the city, but was repulsed with great
                    loss. Next he went to Argos at the invitation of a political faction, and here
                    in the confusion of a fight by night in the streets he met his death in his
                    forty-sixth year from the hand of a woman, who hurled a ponderous roof-tile upon
                    his head just at the moment, it is said, when he was striking a blow at her
                    son.</p>
                <p>Pyrrhus was no doubt a brilliant and dashing soldier, but he was aptly compared
                    “to a gambler who made many good throws with the dice, but could not make the
                    proper use of the game.” There was something chivalrous about him which seems to
                    have made him a general favourite. After his death Macedonia had for a time at
                    least nothing to fear, and the liberty of Greece was quite at the mercy of that
                    power.</p>
