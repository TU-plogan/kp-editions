                <p><label type="entry">PURPURA</label>, a disease characterized by the occurrence of
                    purple-coloured spots upon the surface of the body, due to extravasations of
                    blood in the skin, accompanied occasionally with haemorrhages from mucous
                    membranes. Difference of opinion has prevailed among physicians as to whether
                    these symptoms are to be regarded as constituting a disease <hi rend="italic"
                    >per se,</hi> since they are frequently seen in connexion with various morbid
                    conditions. Thus in persons suffering from such diseases as rheumatism,
                    phthisis, heart disease, cancer, Bright’s disease, jaundice, as well as from
                    certain of the infectious fevers, extravasations of the kind above-mentioned are
                    not unfrequently present. But the term “purpura” is, strictly speaking,
                    applicable only to those instances where the symptoms exist apart from any
                    antecedent disease. In such cases the complaint is usually ushered in by
                    lassitude and feverishness. This is soon followed by the appearance on the
                    surface of the body of the characteristic spots in the form of small red points
                    scattered over the skin of the limbs and trunk. They are not raised above the
                    surface, and they do not disappear on pressure. Their colour soon becomes deep
                    purple or nearly black; but after a few days they undergo the changes which are
                    observed in the case of an ordinary bruise, passing to a green and yellow hue
                    and finally disappearing. When of minute size they are termed “petechiae” or
                    “stigmata,” when somewhat larger “vibices,” and when in patches of considerable
                    size “ecchymoses.” They may come out in fresh crops over a lengthened
                    period.</p>
                <p>The form of the disease above described is that known as “purpura simplex.” A
                    more serious form of the malady is that to which the term “purpura
                    haemorrhagica” is applied.</p>
                <p>Here, in addition to the phenomena already mentioned as affecting the skin, there
                    is a tendency to the occurrence of haemorrhage from mucous surfaces, especially
                    from the nose, but also from the mouth, lungs, stomach, bowels, kidneys,
                    &amp;c., sometimes in large and dangerous amount. Great physical prostration is
                    apt to attend this form of the disease, and a fatal result sometimes follows the
                    successive haemorrhages, or is suddenly precipitated by the occurrence of an
                    extravasation of blood into the brain.</p>
                <p>The causes of purpura are not well understood. The condition of the blood has
                    been frequently investigated, but no alteration in its composition detected. The
                    view most commonly held is that the disease depends on an abnormal fragility of
                    the minute blood-vessels owing to their mal-nutrition. It would seem sometimes
                    to arise in persons enjoying perfect health; but in a large proportion of
                    instances it shows itself among those who have been exposed to privation or
                    insanitary conditions, or whose health has become lowered. Young persons suffer
                    more frequently than adults, and repeated attacks may occur. Purpura has some
                    points of resemblance to scurvy, but a clear distinction both as to causation
                    and symptoms can be established between the two diseases.</p>
                <p>The treatment will bear reference to any causes which may be discovered as
                    associated with the onset of the disease, such as unfavourable hygienic
                    conditions, and nutritive defects should be rectified by suitable diet. The
                    various preparations of iron seem to be the best medicinal remedies in this
                    ailment, while more direct astringents, such as gallic acid, ergot of rye,
                    turpentine, or acetate of lead, will in addition be called for in severe cases
                    and especially when haemorrhage occurs.</p>
