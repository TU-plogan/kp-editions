                    (1800-1882), originally Edward Bouverie, was born near Oxford in 1800. His
                    family, which was of Huguenot origin, became through a marriage connexion lords
                    of the manor of Pusey, a small Berkshire village near Oxford, and from it took
                    their name a few years after Edward Bouverie’s birth. In 1818 he became a
                    commoner of Christ Church, Oxford, and after gaining high university
                    distinctions was elected in 1824 to a fellowship at Oriel College. He thus
                    became a member of a society which already contained some of the ablest of his
                    contemporaries,—among them J. H. Newman and John Keble. But for several years
                    his intercourse with them seems to have been slight. He divided his time between
                    his country home and Germany, and occupied himself with the study of Oriental
                    languages and of German theology. His first work, published in 1828, was a
                    vindication of the latter from a strong attack which had been <pb break="no"

                    High-Church party, H. J. Rose. His work, which is entitled <hi rend="italic">An
                    Historical Enquiry into the probable Causes of the Rational Character lately
                    predominant in the Theology of Germany,</hi> is an impartial and clear summary
                    of the history of German theology since the Reformation. In the same year (1828)
                    the duke of Wellington appointed him to the regius professorship of Hebrew with
                    the attached canonry of Christ Church, which he held for the rest of his life.
                    Mr Rose’s somewhat intemperate reply to him led to the publication in 1830 of a
                    second part of his <hi rend="italic">Historical Enquiry,</hi> which is not less
                    liberal in its tone than the previous part. But in the years which immediately
                    followed the current of his thoughts began to set in another direction. The
                    revolt against individualism had begun, and he was attracted to its standard. By
                    the end of 1833 “he showed a disposition to make common cause” with those who
                    had already begun to issue the <hi rend="italic">Tracts for the Times.</hi> “He
                    was not, however, fully associated in the movement till 1835 and 1836, when he
                    published his tract on baptism and started’the Library of the Fathers” (Cardinal
                    Newman’s <hi rend="italic">Apologia,</hi> p. 136). The real work of his life
                    then began. He became a close student of the fathers and of that school of
                    Anglican divines who had continued, or revived, in the 17th century the main
                    traditions of pre-Reformation teaching. In ten years after his first adhesion to
                    the movement he had become, with his almost boundless capacity for accumulating
                    information, saturated with patristic and “Anglo-Catholic” divinity; and a
                    sermon which he preached before the university in 1843, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Holy Eucharist a Comfort to the Penitent,</hi> so startled the authorities by
                    the re-statement of doctrines which, though well known to ecclesiastical
                    antiquaries, had faded from the common view, that by the exercise of an
                    authority which, however legitimate, was almost obsolete he was suspended for
                    three years from the function of preaching. The immediate effect of his
                    suspension was the sale of 18,000 copies of the condemned sermon; its permanent
                    effect was to make Pusey for the next quarter of a century the most influential
                    person in the Church of England. The movement, in the origination of which he
                    had had no share, came to bear his name: it was popularly known as Puseyism and
                    its adherents as Puseyites. His activity, both public and private, as leader of
                    the movement was enormous. He was not only on the stage but also behind the
                    scenes of every important controversy, whether theological or academical. In the
                    Gorham controversy of 1850, in the question of Oxford reform in 1854, in the
                    prosecution of some of the writers of <hi rend="italic">Essays and Reviews,</hi>
                    especially of Professor Jowett, in 1863, in the question as to the reform of the
                    marriage laws from 1849 to the end of his life, in the revived controversy as to
                    the meaning of everlasting punishment in 1877, he was always busy with articles,
                    letters, treatises, and sermons. The occasions on which, in his turn, he
                    preached before his university were all memorable; and some of the sermons were
                    manifestoes which mark distinct stages in the history of the party of which he
                    was the leader. The practice of confession in the Church of England practically
                    dates from his two sermons on <hi rend="italic">The Entire Absolution of the
                    Penitent,</hi> in 1846, in which the revival of high sacramental doctrine is
                    complemented by the advocacy of a revival of the penitential system which
                    mediaeval theologians had appended to it. The sermon on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Rule of Faith as maintained by the Fathers and by the Church of England,</hi> in
                    1851, stemmed the current of secessions to Rome after the Gorham judgment, which
                    had seemed to show that on an important point of dogmatic theology the Church of
                    England had no definite doctrine. The sermon on <hi rend="italic">The Presence
                    of Christ in the Holy Eucharist,</hi> in 1853, first formulated the doctrine
                    round which almost all the subsequent theology of his followers has revolved,
                    and which has revolutionized the current practices of Anglican worship. And the
                    last university sermon which he composed, and which he was too ill to deliver
                    himself, <hi rend="italic">Unsdence, not Science, adverse to Faith,</hi> in
                    1878, rendered not only to his party but to religion in general the signal
                    service of abandoning the old quarrel between theology and science, as to the
                    manner in which the world was created, by admitting the possibility of
                    evolution. Of his larger works the most important are his two books on the
                    Eucharist— <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of the Recd Presence</hi> (consisting
                    of notes on his university sermon of 1853), published in 1855, and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Real Presence . . . the Doctrine of the English Church,</hi>
                    published in 1857; <hi rend="italic">Daniel the Prophet,</hi> in which he
                    endeavours with great skill to maintain the traditional date of that book; <hi
                    rend="italic">The Minor Prophets, with Commentary,</hi> which forms his chief
                    contribution to the study of which he was the professor; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eirenicon,</hi> in which he endeavoured to find, for those who
                    accepted his premises, a basis of union between the Church of England and the
                    Church of Rome. In 1836 he joined Newman, Keble, and Marriott in editing a
                    series of translations from the fathers entitled <hi rend="italic">A Library of
                    Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church anterior to the Division of East and
                    West,</hi> and contributed to it a revised translation of St Augustine’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Confessions</hi> and several valuable prefaces; the series was
                    accompanied by a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aurea</hi> of Thomas Aquinas, and was followed by an edition of
                    some of the texts which had been translated. He also edited, with suitable
                    omissions, several books of devotion by Roman Catholic writers, such as Avrillon
                    and Scupoli.</p>
                <p>In private life his habits were simple almost to austerity. He had few personal
                    friends, and rarely mingled in general society; though bitter to opponents, he
                    was gentle to those who knew him, and his munificent charities gave him a warm
                    place in the hearts of many to whom he was personally unknown. In his domestic
                    life he had some severe trials: his wife died, after eleven years of married
                    life, in 1839; his only son, who was a scholar like-minded with himself, who had
                    shared many of his literary labours, and who had edited an excellent edition of
                    St Cyril’s commentary on the minor prophets, died in 1880, after many years of
                    great bodily affliction. From that time Pusey was seen by only a few persons.
                    His own bodily infirmities increased, and on 16th September 1882, after a short
                    illness, he died a painless death. He was buried at Oxford in the cathedral of
                    which he had been for fifty-four years a canon. His friends devised for him
                    after his death a singular memorial: they purchased his library, and bought for
                    it a house in Oxford which they endowed with sufficient funds to maintain three
                    librarians, who were charged with the duty of endeavouring to perpetuate in the
                    university the memory of the principles which he taught.</p>
                <p>His name will be chiefly remembered as the representative of a great religious
                    movement which, whatever may be its ultimate issue, has carried with it no small
                    part of the religious life of England in the latter half of the 19th century.
                    His chief characteristic was an almost unbounded capacity for taking pains. His
                    chief influence was that of a preacher and a spiritual adviser. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Parish Sermons</hi> reproduce the substance of patristic homilies
                    in the massive style of the Caroline divines. His correspondence as a spiritual
                    adviser was enormous; his deserved reputation for piety and for solidity of
                    character made him the chosen confessor to whom large numbers of men and women
                    unburdened their doubts and their sins. But if he be estimated apart from his
                    position as the head of a great party, it must be considered that he was more a
                    theological antiquary than a theologian. He exhumed many forgotten theories and
                    supported them by a large number of quotations from ancient writers; but the
                    heterogeneous masses of information which he accumulated require a sifting which
                    often leaves but a scanty residuum, and, however valuable to advanced scholars,
                    cannot safely be commended <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n131/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0131-0118"/> to learners. Whatever he wrote was relative to
                    the controversies of his time, and as a controversialist he holds a place which
                    is unique among his contemporaries. He had an almost unrivalled power of massing
                    his evidence, of selecting from an author just so much as was pertinent to the
                    point under discussion, and of ignoring or depreciating statements which were at
                    variance with the views which he advocated. As a party leader he combined great
                    enthusiasm with indefatigable energy and tenacity of purpose; he chose his
                    positions beforehand with great skill, and never afterwards abandoned them. But
                    he does not seem to have had any great logical power: he builds elaborate
                    arguments upon words of shifting connotation, such as “faith” and “church/’ and
                    slides unconsciously from one meaning to another. Nor is there any evidence that
                    he ever faced the historical difficulties which the position of the Church of
                    England presents from the Catholic point of view, and which ultimately led to
                    Newman’s secession. He lived in Christian antiquity, and his arguments seldom
                    touched any but sympathetic natures. Unlike Newman, who appealed to the cultured
                    intellect of his time, he never caught the modern spirit. The result was that
                    after Newman’s departure the party of which Pusey was the head never made a
                    single convert of mark. The intellect of Oxford and of England drifted away from
                    it; and, in spite of the eloquence of some of its advocates, “Puseyism” does not
                    now number among its adherents any one who exercises an appreciable influence
                    upon the intellectual life of England.</p>
                <p>In fact Pusey survived the system which had borne his name. His followers went
                    beyond him, or away from him, in two directions. On the one hand, his revival of
                    the mediaeval doctrine of the Real Presence, coinciding as it did with the
                    revival of a taste for mediaeval art, naturally led to a revival of the
                    mediaeval ceremonial of worship. With this revival of ceremonial Pusey had
                    little sympathy: he at first protested against it (in a university sermon in
                    1859); and, though he came to defend those who were accused of breaking the law
                    in their practice of it, he did so on the express ground that their practice was
                    alien to his own. But this revival of ceremonial in its various degrees is now
                    the chief external characteristic of the movement of which he was the leader;
                    and “Ritualist” has thrust “Puseyite” aside as the designation of those who hold
                    the doctrines for which he mainly contended. On the other hand, the pivot of his
                    teaching was the appeal to primitive antiquity. It was an appeal which had
                    considerable force as against the vapid theology of the early part of the
                    century, and as a criterion of the claims of Catholicism. But it lost its force,
                    and his followers came to substitute for it an appeal to the principles of an
                    <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> philosophy, some of which were borrowed from
                    Thomism and some, though at second hand, from Hegelianism. Nor is it probable
                    that Puseyism will revive again. On the one hand, an appeal to primitive times
                    which is divorced, as was Pusey’s appeal, from the history of those times must
                    necessarily fail in an <hi rend="italic">age</hi> in which the spirit of
                    historical inquiry is abroad; on the other hand, however excellent the maxim may
                    be which Pusey put in the forefront of his arguments, <hi rend="italic">Quod
                    semper, quod</hi><hi rend="italic">ubique,</hi><hi rend="italic">quod</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">omnibus,</hi> yet, when limited, as Pusey
                    limited it, to the statements of particular writers and the current beliefs of
                    particular ages, it becomes a mere paradox and ceases to afford a logical basis
                    for any system of doctrine. (E. HA.)</p>
