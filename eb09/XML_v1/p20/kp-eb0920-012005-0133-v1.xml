                <p><label type="entry">PYM, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1584-1643), was
                    born at Brymore in Somerset in 1584. In 1599 he entered Broadgates Hall, now
                    Pembroke College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner. He is said by Clarendon to
                    have held at a later date an office in the exchequer, in which he no doubt
                    acquired that <pb break="no"

                    afterwards distinguished him. His wife, Anna Hooker, died in 1620, and in the
                    following year he entered parliament for the first time as member for Caine, the
                    statement that he sat in the Addled Parliament being now known to have been
                    erroneous. To the patronage of the earl of Bedford no doubt Pym owed the.
                    position which he thus acquired. The use which he made of it was all his own. He
                    had none of the fire of Eliot’s genius, but he early showed himself to be
                    possessed of the two qualities which in combination make a leader of men, a
                    thorough and honest sympathy with the ideas of the time and a moderation in
                    their application. There was more of measured force in him than there was in
                    Eliot. His powers as a party leader were as yet unsuspected.</p>
                <p>Pym’s name was first prominently brought forward by his speech of 8th November
                    1621, directed against the Catholics. He strove to distinguish between an
                    attempt “to punish them for believing and thinking” what they did and the
                    disabling of them from doing “that which they think and believe they ought to
                    do.” His remedy was an oath of association to be taken by all loyal Protestants.
                    Those who object to Pym’s counsel as divisive must nevertheless acknowledge that
                    there was a singular consistency in his advocacy of it. By organizing the
                    resistance of the majority of Englishmen, he wished to baffle parties which
                    might be dangerous by their organization or by the assistance which they might
                    receive from abroad.</p>
                <p>After the dissolution Pym was confined for three months in his house in London.
                    In the following parliament he pleaded for the execution of the penal laws
                    against recusants and for the restoration of the silenced Puritan clergy. In
                    1626 he was one of the managers of Buckingham’s impeachment. In 1628 he was
                    equally prominent in advocating the Petition of Right and in carrying on the
                    impeachment of Mainwaring. The political question and the religious question
                    were in Pym’s mind fused into one. His intellect was intensely conservative, not
                    easily admitting new ideas or projecting itself into the future to deal with
                    growing changes in society, but seeking to rest on the conservatism of existing
                    society rather than on the maintenance of artificial forces. He looked for
                    support to the nation itself, and he found it hard to believe that the national
                    judgment could much differ from his own. In 1629 he found himself differing from
                    those with whom he usually acted. Eliot carried the House with him in turning
                    the dispute with the king on the question of tonnage and poundage into one of
                    parliamentary privilege, whilst Pym thought that the main question of the king’s
                    right to levy the duties without a parliamentary grant should be first attacked.
                    He was beaten at the time, but his defeat was full of promise for the future. It
                    is much in a man’s favour that he is ready to look a difficulty fully in the
                    face. It is characteristic of Pym that nothing is heard of him either during the
                    riotous proceedings in which this parliament closed or during the eleven years
                    which passed without a parliament at all. He had neither the virtues nor the
                    failings which accompany excitability of temperament.</p>
                <p>With the Short Parliament Pym’s three and a half years of authority begin. His
                    speech of 17th April 1640 on grievances lasted for two hours, a length of time
                    without precedent in the parliaments of those days. It was not eloquent in the
                    sense in which Eliot’s speeches were eloquent, but it summed up in a telling
                    manner the grievances under which, in the opinion of the vast majority of
                    thinking Englishmen, the commonwealth laboured. Before the session closed he
                    showed his powers as a parliamentary tactician by proposing to bring forward the
                    Scottish grievances and to make a peace with the Scots the condition of the
                    grant of supplies. This proposal led to a hasty dissolution of parliament, but
                    it laid down the basis of a policy which afterwards stood Pym in good stead.
                    That policy was precisely what had been foreshadowed in his speech of 1621, the
                    association of the majority who thought alike in civic union against official
                    authority; but that which in 1621 was to be a union of Englishmen alone in 1640
                    included Scots as well.</p>
                <p>With the dissolution of the Short Parliament Pym once more sinks out of sight.
                    There is, however, good reason to suppose that the summer months of 1640 were
                    for him a time of unusual activity, and that he was a leading spirit in those
                    negotiations with the Scots the exact nature of which cannot now be traced. At
                    all events in the end of August he was in close communication with the leaders
                    of the opposition, and he then drew up, in co-operation with St John, the
                    petition in which twelve peers demanded the redress of grievances and the
                    summoning of parliament. The rout of Newburn gave emphasis to the language of
                    the peers, and on 3d November 1640 the Long Parliament met.</p>
                <p>Pym’s leadership of the Commons rested on his sympathy with the feelings of the
                    House combined with his skill in directing those feelings into a practical
                    course. He expressed the general sentiment in the impeachment of Strafford and
                    Laud, and in the passing of the Triennial Act, which was to make the long
                    intermission of parliaments impossible for the future. In the trial of Strafford
                    he showed himself resolute. Being determined to give to an act of state policy
                    the character of a vindication of the law, Pym had to contend against the
                    impatience of his followers and against the efforts of Charles, and still more
                    of Henrietta Maria, to save Strafford by force. Overwhelmed for a moment by the
                    impatience of the House, which converted the impeachment into a bill of
                    attainder, he yet carried his point that the change should be no more than
                    nominal, and that the legal arguments should proceed just as if the impeachment
                    had been continued.</p>
                <p>The struggle within the House itself was the least part of Pym’s labours. In
                    meeting the army plot and the other intrigues of the court he had to develop the
                    powers of a commissioner of police, to be as ready in collecting and sifting
                    information as he was prompt in counteracting the danger which he feared. In the
                    protestation which was adopted by the Commons on 3d May he fell back on his old
                    remedy, banding together the majority in resistance to an unscrupulous minority.
                    By the legislation which followed on the death of Strafford—the abolition of the
                    special courts which had been erected to defend the Tudor monarchy, and the
                    abandonment by the crown of its claim to levy customs without a parliamentary
                    grant—he brought the king under the obligation to govern according to law. Much,
                    however, remained to be done. Pym had to provide against the breach by force or
                    fraud of the compact made, and also to provide for the harmonious working of the
                    executive and legislative bodies. He proposed to attain these ends by demanding
                    that the king’s ministers should be responsible to parliament. To effect this it
                    was necessary that parliament should be united, and to obtain this end it was
                    necessary to solve the religious difficulty. In the autumn of 1641 it appeared
                    that a majority of the Peers and a large minority of the Commons wished to
                    maintain the worship of the Prayer Book very nearly intact, whilst a minority of
                    the Peers and a majority of the Commons wished to make very considerable
                    alterations in it. To bind these two parties together against the king needed
                    constructive statesmanship of the highest order, and this neither Pym nor any
                    one else in the House showed signs of possessing. In the Grand Remonstrance,
                    instead of indicating terms of compromise, he proposed to throw the regulation
                    of the church on an assembly of divines to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n135/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0135-0122"/> chosen by parliament,—that is to say, he combined
                    the terrors of a vague threat of impending change with the entire absence of any
                    security that those changes would be moderate. From that moment there were two
                    parties in the state neither of which would give way to the other. Charles’s
                    attempt to arrest Pym and four other members on 4th January 1642 embittered but
                    did not produce the conflict. For some months there was much fencing between the
                    two parties, and the Civil War was not begun till Charles raised his standard at
                    Nottingham.</p>
                <p>During the remaining months of Pym’s life he was the most prominent leader of the
                    war party in the. House of Commons. Peace may be made in two ways, by one side
                    capitulating to the other, or by the discovery of a compromise which may give
                    effect to the better aims of both sides. Pym was resolutely set against a
                    capitulation, and he did not rise to the height of a mediator. His adversaries
                    of the peace party, led by Hoiles and Maynard, had as little idea of a
                    compromise as he had, and they were foolish enough to suppose it possible to
                    obtain the assent of Charles and his supporters to the establishment of a
                    Puritan Church.</p>
                <p>Pym’s policy was at least coherent with itself. In 1621, on his first prominent
                    appearance in political life, he had advocated the formation of an association
                    against popery. The protestation of 1641 was an attempt to carry this plan into
                    practice and to make it at the same time available against Royalist intrigues.
                    The Parliamentary covenant promulgated after the discovery of Waller’s plot in
                    June 1643 was an enlargement of the same project, and the Solemn League and
                    Covenant in September 1643 embraced the three kingdoms. As long as he lived Pym
                    was the soul of the Parliamentary resistance to the king, but it is in the
                    covenants and associations which he brought into existence that his permanent
                    contribution to English political development is to be found. Eliot hoped to
                    rally parliament and the constituencies as a whole to the cause which he
                    maintained to be just. Strafford hoped to rouse the devotion of the nation as a
                    whole to the king whose crown was supported by his own masterful intellect. Pym
                    was the founder of party government in England. He recognized from the first
                    that there were differences of religious opinion amongst his fellow-countrymen,
                    and he hoped to rally round a common purpose those who on the whole felt as he
                    did himself, with such liberty of opinion as <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> was
                    possible under such conditions. If the enterprise failed it was partly because
                    he was assailed by intrigue as well as by fair opposition, and in his fierce
                    struggle against intrigue learned to cling to doctrines which were not
                    sufficiently expansive for the government of a nation, partly because the
                    limitations of government itself and the insufficiency of force to solve a
                    complicated religious and political problem were in his time very imperfectly
                    understood. At least Pym prepared the way for the immediate victory of his party
                    by summoning the Scots and by thè financial measures which made the campaigns of
                    1644 and 1645 possible.</p>
                <p>He did not, however, live to reap the harvest which was due to his efforts. Worn
                    out by the strain of constant and agitating work, his health broke down, and on
                    8th December 1643 he died. His body was followed by both Houses when it was
                    carried to be interred in Westminster Abbey. (s. <hi rend="smallcaps">r.
