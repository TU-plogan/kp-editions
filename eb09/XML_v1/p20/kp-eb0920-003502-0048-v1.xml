                <p><label type="entry">PSELLUS</label>, the name of several Byzantine writers, of
                    whom the following were the most important.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Michael Psellus</hi> the elder, a native of Andros and a
                    pupil of Photius. He flourished in the second half of the 9th century, and
                    strove to stem the rising tide of barbarism by his devotion to letters and
                    philosophy. His study of the Alexandrine theology, as well as of profane
                    literature, brought him under the suspicions of the orthodox, and a former pupil
                    of his, by name Constantine, accused him in an elegiac poem of having abandoned
                    Christianity. In order to perfect his knowledge of Christian doctrine, Psellus
                    had recourse to the instructions of Photius, and then replied to his adversary
                    in a long iambic poem, in which he maintained his orthodoxy. It has been
                    conjectured by Allatius, Cave, and others that some of the books commonly
                    attributed to the younger Psellus are the works of the elder, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue, on Operations of Demons,</hi> and
                    the short treatises <hi rend="italic">On the Virtues of Stones</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">On Demons.</hi> Their reasons, however, resting on the inferiority
                    of literary style and mode of treatment, are inconclusive.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Michael Constantine Psellus</hi> the younger was born at
                    Constantinople in 1020, of a consular and patrician family. He studied at
                    Athens, and by his talents and vast industry made himself master of all the
                    learning of the age, including theology, law, physics, mathematics, philosophy,
                    and history. At Constantinople he taught philosophy, rhetoric, and dialectic
                    with the greatest success, and was honoured with the title of “Prince of
                    Philosophers” by the emperors, who sometimes sought his advice and employed his
                    services. But in 1078, when his pupil, the emperor Michael Ducas, was deposed,
                    Psellus shared his downfall, being compelled by the new emperor, Nicephorus
                    Botanias, to retire to a monastery. On his accession to the empire in 1081
                    Alexius Comnenus deprived Psellus of his title of “Prince of Philosophers” and
                    transferred it to his less talented rival John the Italian. He appears to have
                    been still alive in 1105 and perhaps in 1110.</p>
