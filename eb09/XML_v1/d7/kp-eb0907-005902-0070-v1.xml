                    in various ways in the history of their country.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Demidoff, Nikita,</hi> the founder of the family,
                    originally a blacksmith serf, was born about 1665. His skill in the manufacture
                    of arms won him notoriety and fortune; and an iron foundry which he established
                    for the Government became another source of wealth to him. Peter the Great, with
                    whom he was a favourite, ennobled him in 1720.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Demidoff, Akinfij,</hi> son of the former, greatly
                    increased the wealth he had inherited by the discovery (along with his son) of
                    gold, silver, and copper mines, which they worked with permission of the
                    Government for their own profit. He died about 1740.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Demidoff, Paul Grigorjevich,</hi> nephew of the
                    preceding (bom in 1738, died in 1821), was a great traveller, and devoted
                    himself to scientific studies, the prosecution of which among his countrymen he
                    encouraged by the establishment of professorships, lyceums, and museums. He
                    founded the annual prize of 5000 roubles, adjudged by the Academy of Sciences to
                    the author of the most valuable contribution to Russian literature.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Demidoff, Nikolay Nikititch,</hi> nephew of the
                    preceding, was born in 1774, and died at Florence in 1828. During the invasion
                    of Napoleon he commanded a regiment equipped at his own expense. He also greatly
                    increased his resources as a capitalist by successful mining operations, and
                    like his uncle used his wealth to multiply facilities for the scientific culture
                    of the inhabitants of Moscow. The erection of four bridges at St Petersburg was
                    mainly due to his liberality.^ In 1830 a collection of his pamphlets, <hi

                    >Politique</hi><hi rend="italic">et Privée,</hi> was published at Paris.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Demidoff, Anatoli,</hi> son of Paul, was born at Florence
                    in 1812, and died at Paris in 1870. Educated in France, his life was chiefly
                    spent in that country and in Italy. After his marriage with the daughter of
                    Jerome Bonaparte, he lost for a time the favour of the Emperor Nicholas on
                    account of provision having been made in the contract for the education of his
                    children as Roman Catholics. During the Crimean war he was a member of the
                    Russian diplomatic staff at Vienna. Like other members of his house, he expended
                    large sums to promote education and to ameliorate the physical condition of his
                    fellows. His munificence as a patron of art gave him European celebrity. The
                    superb work, <hi rend="italic">Voyage dans la</hi><hi rend="italic">Russie
                    méridionale et la Crimée, par la Hongrie, la Valachie, et la Moldavie,</hi> was
                    conjointly written and illustrated by him and the French scholars and artists
                    who accompanied him. It has been translated into several European languages; the
                    English version -was published in 1853.</p>
