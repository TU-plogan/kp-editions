                <p><label type="entry">DISLOCATION</label>. This term is applied in surgery to the
                    displacement from each other of the cartilaginous or articular surfaces of the
                    bones entering into the formation of a joint. In a normal joint these surfaces
                    are in contact and held together by ligaments and muscles; in a dislocated joint
                    they are separated more or less completely—in the great majority of cases by
                    external violence; in some instances, however, by powerful muscular exertion.
                    The ease with which a joint is dislocated varies with the form and structure of
                    the joint and with the position in which the joint is when the force is applied.
                    The relative frequency of fracture and dislocation depends on the strength of
                    the bones above and below the joint relatively to the strength of the joint.
                    These points may be illustrated by examples from the joints of the arm and leg,
                    because, with perhaps the exception of the joint between the lower jaw and the
                    skull, it is in these situations that dislocation is most frequently observed.
                    The strength of the different joints in the body is dependent on either
                    ligament, muscle, or the shape of the bones. In the hip, for instance, all three
                    sources of strength are present; therefore, considering the great leverage of
                    the long thigh bone, the hip is rarely dislocated. The shoulder, in order to
                    allow of extensive movement, has no osseous or ligamentous strength; its
                    strength is muscular, therefore it is frequently dislocated, because the
                    muscular strength varies in power, the muscles may be relaxed, the person is
                    unprepared, and dislocation occurs; if, on the other hand, the muscles are
                    tense, and the patient is prepared for the strain, then the result will be
                    either a sprain of the joint or a fracture of one of the adjoining bones. The
                    wrist and ankle are rarely dislocated; in the wrist the radius gives way, in the
                    ankle the fibula, these bones being relatively weaker than the respective
                    joints. The wrist owes its strength to ligament, the ankle to the shape of the
                    bones. The elbow is osseously strong, but this strength necessarily varies with
                    the position of the arm. The symptoms of a dislocation are distortion and
                    limited movement, with absence of the grating sensation felt in fracture when
                    the extremities of a broken bone are rubbed together. The treatment consists in
                    reducing the dislocation. The sooner this is done the better —the longer the
                    delay the more difficult it becomes to remedy the displacement. After a variable
                    period, depending on the nature of the joint and the age of . the person, it may
                    be impossible to replace the bones. The result will be a more or less useless
                    joint. The administration of chloroform, by relaxing the muscles, greatly
                    assists the operation of reduction. The length of time that a joint has to be
                    kept quiet after it has been restored to its normal shape depends on its form;
                    if osseously strong, then early movement is allowable, as in the elbow joint; if

                    again slip out of its place.</p>
