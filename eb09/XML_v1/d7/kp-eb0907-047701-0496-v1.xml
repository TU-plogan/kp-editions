                <p><label type="entry">DRUIDISM</label>, the name usually given to the religious
                    system of the ancient Gauls and Britons. The word Druid, one form or other of
                    which is used in early Celtic records to designate a class of priests
                    corresponding to the Magi or wise men of the ancient Persians, is of uncertain
                    etymology. The derivation from the Greek δpυs, an oak, though as old as the days
                    of the elder Pliny, is probably fanciful.</p>
                <p>We find in Caesar the first and at the same time the most circumstantial account
                    of the Druids to be met with in the classical writers. In the digression on the
                    manners and customs of Gaul and Germany which occupies a portion of the sixth
                    book of his Gallic war, he tells us that all men of any rauk and dignity in Gaul
                    were included among either the Druids or the nobles. The former were the
                    religious guides of the people as well as the chief expounders and guardians of
                    the law. On those who refused to submit to their decisions they had the power of
                    inflicting severe penalties, of which excommunication from society was the most
                    dreaded. As they were not a hereditary caste, and enjoyed exemption from service
                    in the field as well as from payment of taxes, admission to the order was
                    eagerly sought after by the youth of Gaul. The course of training to which a
                    novice had to submit was protracted, extending sometimes over twenty years. All
                    instruction was communicated orally, but for certain purposes they had a written
                    language in which they used the Greek characters. The president of the order,
                    whose office was elective and who enjoyed the dignity for life, had supreme
                    authority among them. They taught that the soul was. immortal. Astrology,
                    geography, physical science, and natural theology were their favourite studies.
                    Britain was the head-quarters of Druidism, but once every year a general
                    assembly of the order was held within the territories of the Carnutes in Gaul,
                    probably in the neighbourhood of the modern Dreux. The Gauls in extreme cases
                    offered human sacrifices, usually criminals. Their chief deity was identified by
                    Caesar with the Mercury of the Romans. Writing a few years later, Cicero, in his
                    treatise on divination, introduces his brother Quintus as remarking on the
                    existence among the Gauls of augurs or soothsayers, known by the name of Druids.
                    With one of these, Divitiacus, an Aeduan, Quintus says he was well acquainted.
                    Cicero’s contemporary, Diodorus Siculus, informs us that there were among the
                    ancient Gauls bards, certain philosophers and theologians named Druids, and
                    soothsayers. He also hints at some connection between their philosophy and that
                    of Pythagoras. The geographers, Strabo and Pomponius Mela, add little to our
                    knowledge of the Druids. Lucan, in his <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia,</hi>
                    mentions, among the Gallic and other tribes that relapsed into their former ways
                    upon Caesar’s crossing the Rubicon, “the worshippers with bloody rites of
                    Teutates, Hesus, and Taranis,” and refers immediately afterwards to the bards
                    and Druids. Something more noteworthy is told by the elder Pliny. According to
                    him the Gallic Druids held the mistletoe in the highest veneration. Groves of
                    oak were their chosen retreats. Whatever grew on that tree was thought to be a
                    gift from heaven, more especially the mistletoe. When thus found the latter was
                    cut with a golden knife by a priest clad in a white robe, two white bulls being
                    sacrificed on the spot. The name given it by the Druids signified in their
                    language All-Heal; and its virtues were believed to be very great. Two other
                    herbs, called selago and samolus, were likewise greatly valued by them for their
                    medicinal efficacy. But the most remarkable of all the Druidical charms was the
                    anguineum, or snake’s egg. It was said to be produced from the saliva and frothy
                    sweat of a number of serpents writhing in an entangled mass, and to be tossed up
                    into the air as soon as formed. The fortunate Druid who managed, as it fell, to
                    catch it in his sagum, or cloak, rode off at full speed on a horse that had been
                    in waiting for him, pursued by the serpents till they were stopped by the
                    intervention of a running stream. A genuine specimen of this egg when thrown
                    into the water would float against the current, even if encased in gold. Pliny
                    declares that he had seen one. “It is,” he says, “about the size of a moderately
                    large round apple, and has a cartilaginous rind studded with cavities like those
                    on the arms of a polypus.” Tacitus, in describing the attack made on the island
                    of Mona ( Anglesea) by the Romans under Suetonius Paulinus, represents the
                    legionaries as being awe-struck on landing by the appearance of a band of Druids
                    who, with hands uplifted towards heaven, poured forth terrible imprecations on
                    the heads of the invaders. The courage of the Romans, however, soon overcame
                    such fears; the Britons were put to flight; and the groves of Mona, the scene of
                    many a sacrifice and bloody rite, were cut down. The annalists Lampridius and
                    Vopiscus, two of the <hi rend="italic">Scriptores Historias Augustee,</hi>
                    introduce us, if the “Dryas” of these writers be connected, as is probable, with
                    the “Druides” of Caesar and others, to a new branch of the order—Druidesses,
                    who, however, are simply prophetic women. For example, Vopiscus tells us, on the
                    authority of his grandfather, who <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n497/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0497-0478"/> had the story from the future emperor himself,
                    that it had been foretold to Diocletian by one of these women that he would wear
                    the purple after he had slain a wild boar. Many years afterwards, when
                    Diocletian found himself, on the death of Numerian, unexpectedly declared
                    emperor by the troops, he at once cut down with his sword Arrius A per,
                    regarding whom dark suspicions were afloat, exclaiming, “At length I have slain
                    the fated wild boar,” and thus fulfilled the prophecy delivered to him in Gaul
                    by the weird woman. Ausonius of Bordeaux, tutor of Gratian, son of the Emperor
                    Valentinian, in his <hi rend="italic">Professores,</hi> or notices of the
                    professors of his native city, apostrophizes the rhetorician Attius Patera as
                    sprung from a race of Druidi and from the priesthood of Balenus, and as deriving
                    his name of Patera from being connected through the latter with the mysteries of
                    Apollo. He also addresses another as keeper of the temple of Balenus, and as the
                    offspring of the Druids. ’ Lastly, Ammianus Marcellinus, after noticing the
                    foundation of Marseilles by a colony of Phocaeans, goes on to state that when
                    the people in those parts had been gradually civilized, learned studies, which
                    had been begun by the bards, the Euhages (probably a corruption of the Oυατ∈ις,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Vates,</hi> of Strabo), and the
                    Druids, throve vigorously. Of these, he says the Druids were intellectually
                    superior to the others, and were formed into unions in accordance with the
                    precepts of Pythagoras.</p>
                <p>The early Christian fathers seldom mention the Druids. Origen, Clement of
                    Alexandria, and others speak of them as philosophers or priests among the Gauls,
                    but in a manner that shows they knew almost nothing about them. In early Irish
                    poems and tales, however, a class of persons called by this name is frequently
                    referred to, who also appear as Magi in certain well-known lives of Irish saints
                    written in Latin. These Irish Druids were a kind of sorcerers. They were said to
                    be in league with the demons of paganism, and to be able by this agency to do
                    good to their friends and mischief to their enemies. The followers of the first
                    missionaries of Christianity in Ireland and Scotland seem to have thought it
                    necessary, in order to prove the superiority of the new faith, to spread the
                    belief that its apostles also were gifted with supernatural powers, which they
                    could use more especially for the purpose of counteracting the malice of these
                    Druids. Thus Adamnan, in his life of Columba, represents that saint as
                    miraculously baffling the machinations of Broichan, the Druid of the Pictish
                    king Brude, when they met at the court of the latter near the mouth of the
                    Ness.</p>
                <p>To John Toland probably belongs the credit of being the first to plan, for he did
                    little more, a connected history of the Druids, in which the scanty notices of
                    ancient writers were to be expanded and largely supplemented by details drawn
                    from other sources. This he did in three letters addressed to Viscount
                    Molesworth, and first published from the author’s papers in 1726, some years
                    after his death. A little later, Pelloutier, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des Celtes,</hi> carried out a portion of
                    Toland’s design by giving a lengthened account of the origin, position, and
                    influence of Druidism among the early Celtic tribes. On the foundations thus
                    laid others were not slow to build. It is from Caesar and Pliny, of course, that
                    the materials have been chiefly derived. But fragments of very doubtful value
                    were eagerly appropriated from every quarter; and in this way an imposing
                    structure was reared, the solidity of which till very recently few ever thought
                    of doubting. If we may trust these writers, the ancient priesthood of Britain
                    and Gaul, in pomp of ritual no less than in learning and influence, rivalled the
                    hierarchies of later days. Clad in white and wearing ornaments of gold, they
                    celebrated their mystic rites in the depths of the forest. The Hesus mentioned
                    by Lucan was said, on the authority of a remark by Lactantius, to be their chief
                    deity. But they had other gods, especially Apollo, whom they worshipped under
                    the name of Belinus, supposed to be the Phoenician BaaL They believed in
                    metempsychosis, or the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. That their
                    philosophy was identical with that of Pythagoras was held as certain, though
                    whether Pythagoras was the instructor of the Druids or the Druids of Pythagoras,
                    or whether indeed both did not derive their tenets from a common source, were
                    moot questions. Pythagoras’s friend Abaris, the mysterious Hyperborean
                    philosopher who rode on an arrow, the gift of Apollo, must have been a British
                    Druid. Botany, astronomy, medicine, and letters were all subjects studied by the
                    Druids; though, in spite of their boasted civilization, many of their rites were
                    barbarous in the extreme. In mechanics they had attained to no mean skill, since
                    the ponderous megalithic remains of Britain and France could have been set up
                    only by them. Stone circles like Stennis and Callernish were ancient temples,
                    once surrounding groves sacred to Druidism. According to Stukeley, Stonehenge
                    was the cathedral of the archdruid of all Britain, and Avebury with its avenues
                    had been originally constructed in the form of a circle with a serpent attached
                    to it,—the circle being regarded as the symbol of the Supreme Being, and the
                    serpent of the divine Son. Dolmens or cromlechs were transformed into altars,
                    and even the menhir or stone pillar, and the rocking-stone, were pressed into
                    the service of the druidical priesthood. In the neighbourhood of the circles, as
                    well as on the tops of mountains, may be seen cairns surmounted each by a flat
                    stone, on which Druid fires were lighted. Over their countrymen the authority of
                    the Druids was almost unbounded, continuing to assert itself long after the
                    order had passed away. With Druidism every unexplained custom and almost every
                    relic of Celtic antiquity were held to be connected, and the superstitions that
                    still linger in the ancient homes of the Celtic race were set down as derived
                    from the same source. Its decadence is attributed by these writers to the
                    hostility of the Romans. Ardent lovers of their country as well as of liberty,
                    the Druids, it is asserted, were the uncompromising foes of Roman rule in the
                    west. Hence sprang the orders issued for their suppression by Claudius, to which
                    reference is made both by Pliny and Suetonius. In the end, Rome proved too
                    strong for Druidism, and the political power of its priesthood was soon broken,
                    especially in Gaul and South Britain. Some, among whom Herbert is prominent,
                    maintain that, after the destruction of pagan Druidism as a system, the order
                    was revived as a corrupt form of Christianity, in which the truths of the latter
                    were largely mixed up with the rites of Mithras, the sun god of the Persians.
                    This hypothesis, to which its supporters have given the name of neo-Druidism,
                    has already been noticed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Celtic
                    Literature</hi> (vol. v. p. 318).</p>
                <p>These views were for a long time generally received in this country as well as on
                    the Continent. In France, Druidism has proved an attractive subject to some
                    writers of a high order of ability, who have discussed it, if not from a more
                    critical, at least from a more philosophical, stand-point. Amédée Thierry, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des Gaulois,</hi> while
                    adopting in the main the opinions of Toland, Pelloutier, and their followers,
                    finds in the accounts that have come down to us traces of two distinct systems
                    of religion in ancient Gaul. One of these was a worship of natural phenomena and
                    objects, akin to the polytheism of the Greeks; the other a kind of metaphysical
                    pantheism, strikingly resembling the religions of some Eastern nations. The
                    latter, according to him, was the foundation of Druidism, and had been brought
                    into the country when the Cymric branch of the Gauls entered it under a leader
                    named Hu, or Hesuβ, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n498/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0498-0479"/> deified after his death. The more ancient
                    inhabitants, also a Gallic race, were the polytheists, whose religious belief,
                    however, the Cymri did not altogether destroy but rather amalgamated with their
                    own. Thierry further thinks that Druidism was on the decline in Gaul before the
                    days of Caesar. After a time the Gallic nobles on the one hand, and the people
                    on the other, became alike jealous of a priestly authority that controlled both
                    and had succeeded in greatly reducing their political influence. For a while the
                    Druids retained their power as a religious and learned order, and preserved many
                    of their privileges; but even at the date of Caesar’s invasion these had so
                    diminished that Britain, and not Gaul, was recognized as their chief seat. But
                    the most distinguished among the expounders of Druidism is undoubtedly Jean
                    Reynaud, one of the chiefs of a small school of thinkers whose metaphysical
                    speculations have exercised in France a real, if an indirect and quiet,
                    influence. Reynaud, who was of a mystical cast of mind, began in 1836, along
                    with Pierre Leroux, the publication of <hi rend="italic">L'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie Nouvelle,</hi> which, however, was never finished.
                    For this the former wrote the article “Druidisme,” which he afterwards enlarged
                    aud gave to the world separately under the titlo of <hi rend="italic">H Esprit
                    de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Gaule,</hi> dedicated to his friend, the historian
                    Henri Martin. It is an elaborate and in some respects able essay. Reynaud
                    maintains that the ancient Druidswere the first to teach clearly the doctrine of
                    the soul’s immortality, and that they had originally as high conceptions of the
                    true nature of God as the Jews themselves. If they afterwards encouraged the
                    worship of subordinate deities, it was for the purpose of reconciling to
                    Druidism that class of uneducated minds for which the cultus of demi-gods and
                    angels has more attraction than the worship of the Unseen One. Hesus, radically
                    the same word as the Aura of the Greeks, was the type of an absolute supreme
                    Being whose symbol on earth was the oak, and was quite distinct from Hu, the
                    leader of the Cymric Gauls. The mistletoe, when found growing on the latter,
                    represented man, a creature entirely dependent on God for support, and yet with
                    an individual existence of his own. Human sacrifices were a natural consequence
                    of the idea, dominant now as in the days of the Druids, that the higher the
                    victim the more complete the atonement offered to the Deity for the sins of man.
                    Druidism declined and at last disappeared, because, according to Reynaud, one
                    element was wanting in its system both of morals and of religion, necessary to
                    the true development of man or society—charity or love. The Druids aimed indeed
                    at the improvement of both, but failed to prescribe the true means of promoting
                    it. Christianity supplied what was needed, and Druidism disappeared—not,
                    however, till it had accomplished what was its special mission, the preservation
                    in Western Europe of the idea of the unity of God. How far all this is mere
                    theory founded on insufficient data, or an attempt, more or less successful, to
                    prove the existence among the Gallic tribes of certain ideas regarding the true
                    nature of God and his relation to man, which afterwards degenerated into the
                    grossest superstition, it would be out of place to discuss here. Reynaud’s views
                    have been to a great extent accepted by Henri Martin, one of the foremost of
                    French historical writers; and both countenance the neo-Druidical fancies of
                    Davies and Herbert. In Germany the latest authority on Druidism seems to be
                    Barth— <hi rend="italic">Ueber die</hi><hi rend="italic">Druiden der
