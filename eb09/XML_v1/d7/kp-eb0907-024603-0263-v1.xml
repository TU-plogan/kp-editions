                <p><label type="entry">DION</label>, of Syracuse (408-353 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> was the son of Hipparinus, and brother-in-law of Dionysius the
                    Elder. In his youth he was an ardent admirer and diligent pupil of Plato, whom
                    Dionysius had invited to Syracuse; and he used every effort to promote the
                    carrying out of his master’s maxims in the administration of the kingdom. His
                    near relationship to the despot gave him great influence at court, and also
                    enabled him to amass considerable wealth. Accordingly, on the accession of the
                    younger Dionysius, the stern morality of the philosopher stood in marked
                    contrast to the dissolute character of the prince. An antagonism thus silently
                    sprung up between the two; and the proposal of Dion to invite Plato again to
                    Syracuse was made the occasion of an open rupture. To counteract the influence
                    of that distinguished philosopher, the enemies of Dion obtained the recall of
                    the historian Philistus, vho had already signalized himself as a faithful
                    supporter of despotic power. This artful courtier quickly regained his
                    ascendency over the mind of Dionysius, and was at length successful in procuring
                    the banishment of Dion. The exiled philosopher retired to Athens, where he was
                    at first permitted to enjoy his revenues in peace; but the intercessions of
                    Plato served to exasperate the tyrant, and at length provoked him to confiscate
                    the property of Dion, and give his wife to another. This last outrage roused
                    Dion to seek the liberation of his country by force of arms. Assembling a small
                    force at Zacynthus, he sailed to Sicily, and, in the absence of Dionysius, was
                    received with demonstrations of joy. He succeeded in defeating the forces of the
                    tyrant, but was himself soon after supplanted by the intrigues of Heraclides.
                    Again he was banished; but the incompetency of the new leader soon led to his
                    recall. He had, however, scarcely made himself master of Sicily when the people
                    began to express their discontent with his tyrannical conduct, and he was
                    assassinated by Caliphus, an Athenian who had accompanied him in his
                    expedition.</p>
