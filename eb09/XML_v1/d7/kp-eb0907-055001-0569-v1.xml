                    Samuel</hi></label> (1739- 1817), a French political economist and statesman,
                    was born at Paris on the 14th December 1739. He studied for the medical
                    profession, but did not enter upon practice, his attention having been early
                    directed to economic questions through his friendship with Quesnay, Turgot, and
                    other leaders of the school known as the Economists. To this school he rendered
                    valuable service by several pamphlets on financial questions, and numerous
                    articles representing and advocating its views in a popular style in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal de ΓAgriculture, du Commerce, et des Finances,</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides</hi><hi rend="italic">du Citoyen,</hi> of
                    which he was successively editor. In 1772 he accepted the office of secretary of
                    the Council of Publip Instruction from Stanislas Poniatowski, king of Poland.
                    Two years later he was recalled to his native country by the advent of his
                    friend Turgot to power. After assisting the minister in his wisely-conceived but
                    unavailing schemes of reform during the brief period of his tenure of office,
                    Dupont shared his dismissal and retired to Gâtinais, in the neighbourhood of
                    Nemours, where he employed himself in agricultural improvements. During his
                    leisure he wrote a translation of Ariosto (1781), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">sur la vie de Turgot</hi> (1782). He was drawn
                    from his retirement by Vergennes, who employed him in preparing, along -with the
                    English commissioner Dr James Hutton, the treaty for the recognition of the
                    independence of the United States (1782), and a treaty of commerce with Great
                    Britain (1786). Under Calonne he was admitted to the Council of State, and
                    appointed commissary-general of commerce. During the Revolution period he
                    advocated reform and constitutional monarchy as against the views of the extreme
                    republicans, and was therefore destined for vengeance when the republicans
                    triumphed. After the 1 Oth August 1792 he was concealed for some weeks in the
                    observatory of the Mazarin College, from which he contrived to escape to the
                    country. During the time that elapsed before he was discovered and arrested he
                    wrote his <hi rend="italic">Philosophie de l’univers.</hi> Imprisoned in La
                    Force, he was one of those who had the good fortune toescape the guillotine till
                    the death of Robespierre set them free. As a member of the Council of Five
                    Hundred, Dupont carried out his policy of resistance to the Jacobins, and made
                    himself prominent as a member of the reactionary party. After the republican
                    triumph on the 18 th Fructidor (4th September) 1797 his house was sacked by the
                    mob, and he himself only escaped transportation to Cayenne through the influence
                    of M. J. Chénier. In 1799 he found it advisable for his comfort, if not for his
                    safety, to emigrate with his family to the United States. On his return to
                    France in 1802 he declined to accept any office under Napoleon, and devoted
                    himself almost exclusively to literary pursuits. The consideration accorded to
                    him in the United States was shown by his being employed to arrange the treaty
                    of 1803, by which Louisiana was sold to the Union, and by his being requested by
                    Jefferson to prepare a scheme of national education, which was published in 1812
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">Sur Veducation</hi><hi rend="italic">nationale
                    dans les États</hi><hi rend="italic">Unis d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Amérique.</hi> Though the scheme was not
                    carried out in the United States, several of its features have been adopted in
                    the existing French code. On the downfall of Napoleon in 1814 Dupont became
                    secretary to the Provisional Government, and on the restoration he was made a
                    councillor of state. The return of the emperor in 1815 determined him to quit
                    France, and he spent the close of his life with his two sons, who had
                    established a powder manufactory in the state of Delaware. He died near
                    Wilmington, Delaware, on the 6th August 1817.</p>
