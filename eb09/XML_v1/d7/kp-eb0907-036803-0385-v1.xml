                <p><label type="entry">DORLEANS</label>, Louis, (1542-1629), a minor French poet and
                    political pamphleteer, and a prominent partisan of the Catholic League, was born
                    in 1542, probably at Paris, though one of his biographers states that Orleans
                    was his birthplace. He studied under Jean Daurat, and after taking his degree in
                    law began to practise at the bar with but slight success. He added little to his
                    reputation by writing indifferent verses, and it was not until the League had
                    taken the daring step of arresting the royalist members of parliament, that he
                    was brought into prominence by being appointed its advocate-general. He
                    maintained the position and claims of the League in language that was always
                    strong and often insolent, going so far as to express regret that the king of
                    Navarre and the prince of Condé had not been assassinated. He was, however,
                    courageous enough to intercede with the duke of Mayenne for the inhabitants of
                    Paris, but without effect. After this failure he continued the publication of
                    violently-worded pamphlets intended to render the accession of Henry impossible.
                    One of these, <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Banquet</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Après-dînêe du Comte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Arete,</hi> in which he accused Henry
                    of insincerity in his return to the Roman Catholic faith, was so scurrilous as
                    to be disapproved of by many members of the League. When Henry at length entered
                    Paris, Dorléans was among the number of the proscribed. He took refuge in
                    Antwerp, where he remained for nine years. At the expiration of that period he
                    received a pardon, and returned to Paris, where he had not been long before he
                    was imprisoned for sedition. The king, however, ordered him to be set free after
                    he had been three months in the Conciergerie, and this generous conduct had the
                    effect of attaching him ever afterwards to the cause of Henry. His last years
                    were passed in obscurity, and he died in 1629 at the age of eightyseven.
                    Dorléans’s political pamphlets are now exceedingly scarce. His chief poem, <hi
                    rend="italic">Renaud</hi> (Paris, 1572), is a poor imitation or translation of
                    part of the <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso.</hi></p>
