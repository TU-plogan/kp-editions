                <p><label type="entry">DUBLIN</label>, a maritime county of Ireland, situated in the
                    province of Leinster, and containing the Irish metropolis. It is bounded on the
                    N. by the county Meath, E. by the Irish Sea, S. by Wicklow, and W. by Kildare
                    and Meath. With the exception of Louth and Carlow, Dublin is the smallest county
                    in Ireland. Its greatest length is 32 miles, its greatest breadth 18; and the
                    area is 354 square miles, or 226,895 acres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The greater part of the county rests on the
                    eastern extremity of the great bed of flötz limestone that extends over the
                    middle of the island, widening as it spreads westward. It rises in its southern
                    part into a range of mountains, which forms the verge of an elevated district,
                    extending thence for more than thirty miles to the south through the county of
                    Wicklow. Through this tract a large body of granite passes in a south-western
                    direction, commencing at Blackrock and passing by Dundrum and Rathfarnham, and
                    forming the loftiest summit in the county, bounded on its eastern and western
                    sides by incumbent rocks of great variety of structure and relations; micaceous
                    schist exists at Killiney and Rathfarnham, and argillaceous schist, on both
                    sides of the granite and quartz rock, in the eastern side alone, forming the
                    promontory of Bray Head, and reappearing in the more northern part of the
                    county, where it forms the picturesque peninsula of Howth, and rises to the
                    height of 567 feet above the level of the sea. The country near Bray presents,
                    within a small space, an instructive series of rocks; and at Killiney schistose
                    beds are to be seeιr, of considerable extent, reposing on granite. Near
                    Bυoterstown, a mass of compact limestone is visible within a few fathoms of the
                    granite. Calp, or “black quarry stone,” a variety of limestone, is the
                    prevailing rock in the immediate vicinity of Dublin, and is much used for
                    building; and the granite of Dalkey and the neighbourhood is also much used for
                    architectural purposes in the city and environs; quantities of it are exported
                    to England. Petrifactions abound in many parts of the limestone country. In the
                    peninsula of Howth gray ore of manganese, brown ironstone, and brown iron-ore
                    occur in abundance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface.—</hi> The northern portion of the county is flat, and
                    the soil good, particularly on the borders of Meath; but on the southern side
                    the land rises into elevations of considerable height. The mountains are chiefly
                    covered with heath, except where a subsidence in the ground affords a nucleus
                    for the formation of bog, with which about 2000 acres are covered. There are
                    also a few small tracts of bog in the northern part of the county. The mountain
                    district is well adapted for timber, to the growth of which some attention has
                    lately been paid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coast.—</hi> The northern coast of the county from Balbriggan
                    to Howth has generally a sandy shore, and affords omy the small harbours of
                    Balbriggan and Skerries. In the promontory of Howth, the coast suddenly assumes
                    a bolder aspect; and between the town of Howth and the picturesque rocky islet
                    of Ireland’s Eye an artificial harbour has been constructed, at an expense of
                    above one-third of a million sterling, which is useful only to vessels of small
                    burthen, and those engaged in the fisheries. Soon after the harbour was finished
                    it was discovered that a shifting sandbank was likely to render the refuge quite
                    useless; and the slow but certain filling up of the harbour is made apparent at
                    low tide. Kingstown harbour, on the south side of Dublin Bay, is by far the best
                    in the county. It was commenced in 1816, and was not quite finished until
                    1859,—at a total expenditure of ,£825,000. A quay runs out into the harbour to a
                    distance of 500 feet, at which vessels drawing 24 feet of water may unload at
                    any state of the tide. The petty harbours of Bullock and Coolamore are on this
                    coast, the former being quite dry save at high tide, and the mouth of the latter
                    being much higher than the bed. Balbriggan is little better, and that at
                    Skerries is hardly to be mentioned. Opposite Coolamore harbour lies Dalkey
                    Island, and the sound between the island and the shore is held to be dangerous
                    in certain conditions of weather. The island is 22 acres in extent, and stands
                    about midway between Kingstown harbour and the beautiful bay of Killiney. North
                    of Howth lies Lambay Island, <pb break="no"

                    Talbot de Malahide. Shell-fish, especially lobsters, are caught here in
                    abundance. Small islets lie not far off, the most interesting of which is that
                    known as Inispatrick, noted as the spot upon which St Patrick first landed in
                    Ireland, and where he built his first church. Ireland’s Eye, off Howth, is a
                    very picturesque rock standing on about 54 acres of grass land. It has afforded
                    great room for geological disquisition.</p>
                <p>The fishery districts are Dublin and Howth. The chief stations are Howth and
                    Skerries, the former of which is much used by the Manx and Cornish fishermen,
                    who resort in considerable numbers to the harbour during the fishing season.
                    Dublin Bay haddocks and herrings have long been esteemed, and justly, for their
                    superior quality and flavour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hivers</hi><hi rend="italic">and Mountains.—</hi> The chief
                    river in the county is the Liffey, which rises in the Wicklow Mountains about
                    twelve miles south-west of Dublin, and, after running about 50 miles, empties
                    itself into Dublin Bay. The course of the river is so tortuous that 40 miles may
                    be traversed and only 10 gained in direction. The scenery along the banks of the
                    Liffey is remarkable for its beauty. The mountains which occupy the southern
                    border of the county are the extremities of the great group guarding the
                    adjacent county of Wicklow. The principal summits are the Three Rock Mountain
                    and Garry Castle, the former having an elevation of 1586 feet, and the latter of
                    1869; and the group formed by Kippure and the Seefin range, Kippure being 2527,
                    and Seefin 2150 feet high. But the grandest features of these hills are the
                    great natural ravines which open in them, the most extraordinary being the
                    Scalp, through which the traveller passes from Dublin to Wicklow.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Of the 226,895 acres which form the area of
                    the county, 100,236 acres were returned in 1871 as under tillage, 91,503 as
                    pasture, 4716 wood, 15,700 in towns, and 14,470 waste, bog, mountain, and water.
                    The face of the county has indeed changed but little during the century, and the
                    statistics as to the treatment of the soil exhibit an almost stationary result.
                    The growth of the towns suburban to the city has made the only appreciable
                    change, and that change has been not inconsiderable. The farms are in general
                    small. Near Dublin, particularly on the southern side of the city, a very
                    considerable portion of the county consists of ornamental grounds, and the rents
                    are proportionately high.</p>
                <p>The produce of the crops is generally greater than in any other county,—not so
                    much on account of any natural superiority in the soil, as by reason of the
                    facilities afforded by the neighbourhood of a large city, and the greater
                    expenditure of capital on the land. Of cereals the principal crops are oats and
                    wheat; and of green crops, potatoes. In live stock the county is particularly
                    rich in proportion to its extent. The following tables give the acreage of crops
                    and numbers of stock in 1873 and 1876 :—</p>

                <p>As regards the division of the land, the number of holdings in the county has
                    somewhat diminished within recent years. In 1853, there were 9016 separate
                    holdings, while in 1876 there were only 8792. According to the Owners’ Returns
                    of 1876, the county was divided in 1874 among 4100 proprietors, of whom 2526, or
                    61 per cent., owned less than one acre of ground, a proportion almost identical
                    with the average of Leinster. From the same authority it appears that the total
                    area held amounted to 217,457 acres, giving an average of 53 acres per property
                    (that of the province being 187); and the total valuation amounted to £686,794,
                    giving an average of £3, 3s. 2d. per acre, as against 18s. 11⅛d. for the whole
                    province. Fourteen proprietors owned more than 2000 acres each, and 57,969 acres
                    in all, or 26∣ per cent, of the area, viz :— Charles Cobbe, 9662 acres; Earl of
                    Howth, 7377; Sir C. C. W. Domville, 6252; George Woods, 4141; Sir Roger Bahner,

                    of Pembroke, 2269; Lord Annaly, 2139; Marquis of Lansdowne, 2132.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi> of the county are mainly confined to the
                    city of Dublin and its neighbourhood. There is, however, a manufactory of cotton
                    hosiery at Balbriggan of some importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration, &amp;c.—</hi> There are nine baronies in the
                    county:—1 and 2. Balrothery East and West, containing Rush and Lusk (population
                    1800), Skerries (2236), and Balbriggan (2332); 3. Coolock, containing Clontarf
                    (3442), and several minor villages; 4. Nethercross, containing the ancient
                    parliamentary borough of Swords (1008), and the village of Glasnevin; 5.
                    Newcastle, con taining the village of Lucan, and Newcastle, which was
                    represented in the Irish Parliament by two members; 6. Uppercross; 7. Rathdown,
                    containing the towns of Dundrum (540), Blackrock (8089), Kingstown (16,378),
                    Dalkey (2584), and Killiney (2290); 8. Castleknock, in which is situated the
                    Phoenix Park; and 9. Dublin, containing the city and many outlying villages. The
                    village of Donnybrook, famous for its fair and accompanying riotous pleasure, is
                    now part of Pembroke township, one of the richest and most beautiful suburbs of
                    the city.</p>
                <p>The nine baronies, including the city, are divided into 99 parishes, all within
                    the archdiocese of Dublin. The county proper, excluding the capital, contains
                    222,709 acres; the rateable property is valued at £700,854; the population at
                    the last census (1871) was 158,936; and the number of houses, 28,803. Between
                    1841 and 1871 the increase of population was nearly 13 ’ 5 per cent., although
                    between May 1851 and December 1871 there emigrated from the county 58,774
                    persons. In 1871, 70⅜ per cent, of the total population were Roman Catholics. In
                    the city that denomination forms 7 9 per cent. The numbers of the last religious
                    census were—Catholics, 111,964; Episcopalians, 39,289; Presbyterians, 2995; and
                    various, 4688. There are two poor-law unions, Balrothery and Rathdown, but
                    portions of the county are in unions situated in adjacent counties. The average
                    daily number of paupers in the county workhouses in 1875 was 674.</p>
                <p>Dublin is the head-quarters of the military district, and of the general
                    commanding-in-chief and staff of Ireland.</p>
                <p>The total number of children receiving education in 1824— 26 was reported in a
                    parliamentary return to be 33,008. In 1853, there were 159 national schools in
                    operation, attended by 28,799 children, and in 1876 there were 52,127 children
                    attending the national schools.</p>
                <p>Previous to the union with Great Britain, this county returned ten
                    representatives to the Irish Parliament,—two for the county, two for the city,
                    two for the university, and two for each of the boroughs of Swords and
                    Newcastle. The number of representatives was reduced to five by the Act of
                    Union, one member being withdrawn from the university, and the boroughs of
                    Swords and Newcastle disfranchised. The Reform Act of 1832 restored the second
                    member to the university, leaving the representation in other respects
                    unchanged.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> It is stated by Ptolemy that the county Dublin
                    was inhabited by the tribe of the Eblani, who dwelt for the most part in Meath
                    county, but on their settling in Dublin founded the city Eblana, now presumed to
                    be Dublin. Later writers affirm that the Eblani were driven out by the Danes,
                    who held sway until the battle of Clontarf (1014) resulted in the overturn of
                    their power. When the English landed, the people to the north of the Liffey were
                    known among the Irish as <hi rend="italic">Fingall, or</hi> white foreigners,
                    and those living south of the river were called <hi rend="italic">Dubhgall,</hi>
                    or black foreigners. The Rev. Caesar Otway professed to be able to discern signs
                    of the different races even as late as his day; but the modem observer will fail
                    to catch any marks whereby different portions of the communitj may be
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>In 1210, King John formed this district into a county, comprising the chief
                    portion of country within the English pale. The limits of the county were,
                    however, uncertain, and underwent many changes before they were fixed. Although
                    so near the seat of government, 67,142 acres of profitable land were forfeited
                    in the Rebellion of 1641, and 34,536^acres in the Revolution of 1688. In 1603
                    the boundaries were definitely marked, the country inhabited by the O’Tooles and
                    the O’Byrnes being formed into the county of Wicklow. The absence of any
                    considerable towns decreases the interest in Dublin county, and it has no
                    historic fields to boast of. In 1867 the most formidable of the Fenian risings
                    took place near the village of Tallaght, about seven miles from the city. The
                    rebels, <hi rend="smallcaps">too</hi> numbered from 500 to 700, were found
                    wandering at dawn, some by a small force of constabulary who, having in vain
                    called upon them to yield, fired and wounded five of them; but the great bulk of
                    them were overtaken by the troops under Lord Strathnairn, who captured them with
                    ease and marched them into the city.</p>
                <p>Sir John Forbes, a distinguished Scotch physician, who visited Ireland in 1852,
                    speaks thus of the county in his <hi rend="italic">Memoranda, :—</hi> “Without
                    leaving the county of Dublin, the antiquary would have no difficulty in finding
                    numerous objects of interest and instraction, casting light upon the early
                    history of the country. Among the ancient raths, duns, or forts constructed by
                    the native Irish or the Danes, and more probably by both people, for defence or
                    security in positions of natural strength, improved by art and labour, several
                    remain in this county. One at Raheny, although much reduced in its proportions,
                    is still traceable; several yet more imperfect are faintly visible at Coolock;
                    one near Lucan is furnished with the subterranean vaults and passages not
                    unusually found in connection with the larger specimens; and another at
                    Shankhill or Rathmichael, near the remarkable natural pass through the mountain
                    called the Scalp, is of greater extent than the others, more commanding in
                    position, and in close proximity to the ancient church, and supposed fragment of
                    a round tower. Numerous sepulchral mounds of the same period also exist
                    scattered throughout the county, occasionally somewhat similar in appearance to
                    the raths, but generally smaller in extent, altogether artificial, and of
                    conical form. Among its most interesting antiquities this county reckons three
                    of the ancient round towers almost peculiar to Ireland,—one at Swords, another
                    at Lusk, forming one of the angles of the church steeple, and a third in the
                    highest state of preservation at Clondalkin.”</p>
