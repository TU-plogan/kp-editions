                    Wentworth</hi></label> (1810-1869), Baronet, bom in London, February 18, 1810,
                    was the only son of Charles Wentworth Dilke, proprietor and editor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> and was educated at Westminster school and Trinity
                    Hall, Cambridge. He studied law, and in 1834 took his degree of LL.B.; but he
                    did not enter upon the practice of his profession. He assisted his father in his
                    literary work, and afterwards gave up much of his time to several of the learned
                    societies. He was for some years chairman of the council of the Society of Arts,
                    and took a prominent part in the affairs of the Royal Horticultural Society. He
                    was one of the most zealous promoters of the Great Exhibition (1851), and a
                    member of the executive committee. At the close of the exhibition he was
                    honoured by foreign sovereigns, and the Queen offered him knighthood, which,
                    however, he did not accept; he also declined a large remuneration offered by the
                    royal commission. In 1853 Dilke was one of the English Commissioners at the New
                    York Industrial Exhibition, and prepared a report on it. He again declined to
                    receive any money reward for his services. He was appointed one of the five
                    royal commissioners for the Great Exhibition of 1862; and soon after the death
                    of the Prince Consort he was created baronet by the Queen. In 1865 he entered
                    parliament as member for Wallingford. Iu 1869 he was sent to Russia as
                    representative of England at the Horticultural Exhibition held at St Petersburg.
                    His health, however, had been for some time failing, and he died suddenly in
                    that city, May 10, 1869. He was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, aud a
                    member of other learned bodies.</p>
