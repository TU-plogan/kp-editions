                <p><label type="entry">DIONYSIUS EXIGUUS</label>, one of the most learned men of the
                    6th century, and especially distinguished as a chronologist, was, according to
                    the statement of his friend Cassiodorus, a Scythian by birth, “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Scytha natione.”</hi> This may mean only that he was a native of rhe region
                    bordering on the Black Sea, and does not necessarily imply that he was not of
                    Greek origin. Such origin is indicated by his name and by his thorough
                    familiarity with the Greek language. His surname “Exiguus” is usually translated
                    “the Little,” and is supposed to refer to his stature; but it appears to be at
                    least as probable that his known humility led him to assume the designation. He
                    was living at Rome in the first half of the 6th century, and is usually spoken
                    of as abbot of a Roman monastery. Cassiodorus, however, calls him simply “monk,”
                    while Bede calls him “abbot.” But as it was not unusual to apply the latter term
                    to distinguished monks who were not heads of their houses, it is uncertain
                    whether Dionysius was abbot in fact or only by courtesy. He was in high repute
                    as a learned theologian, was profoundly versed in the Holy Scriptures and in
                    canon law, and was also an accomplished mathematician and astronomer. We owe to
                    him a collection of ecclesiastical canons, comprising the apostolical canons and
                    the decrees of the councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, Chalcedon, and Sardis,
                    and also a collection of the decretals of the Roman pontiffs from Siricius to
                    Anastasius II. These collections were published by Justel in 1628. Dionysius did
                    good service to his contemporaries by his translations of many Greek works into
                    Latin; and by these translations some works, the originals of which have
                    perished, have been handed down to us. His name, however, is now perhaps chiefly
                    remembered for his chronological labours. It was Dionysius who introduced the
                    method of reckoning the Christian era which we now use. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Chronology.)</hi> His friend Cassiodorus depicts in glowing
                    terms the character of Dionysius as a saintly ascetic, and praises his wisdom
                    and simplicity, his accomplishments and his lowly-mindedness, his power of
                    eloquent speech and his capacity of silence. He died at Rome, probably about the
                    year 545.</p>
