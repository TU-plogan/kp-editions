                    (1812-1870), the great English novelist, was what would generally be described
                    as a self-educated man, and yet, if by a man’s education we understand
                    preparation for the work he has to do in life, he was indebted to circumstances
                    for an education on which it would have been difficult to improve. His father
                    was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office, stationed at Portsmouth when Charles was
                    born, but soon afterwards at Chatham, and soon after that in London,—a
                    conscientious man, industrious and punctual in his occupation, but too easy
                    tempered and unpractical to expend his income so as to keep pace with the wants
                    of a rapidly increasing family. The boy’s mother seems to have been a person of
                    more energy, as well as of considerable accomplishments; she taught him the
                    rudiments of Latin, and tried to establish a boarding school in Gower Street.
                    The one parent was the original of Micawber, the other the original of Mrs
                    Nickleby. With all their united efforts they could not keep out of distress; the
                    boarding school scheme came too late; and when Dickens was nine years old the
                    family was living in abject poverty in Bayham Street, Camden Town, then one of
                    the poorest London suburbs, and their difficulties were increasing upon them.
                    Charles was sent out to earn six shillings a week in a blacking warehouse, tying
                    blue covers on pots of paste-blacking. For two years the child led a very hard,
                    uncared-for life at this uncongenial work. He bitterly felt that it was
                    uncongenial, for he was a very precocious boy, had read many books, and had
                    formed an ambition to be “a learned and distinguished man.” It must have been
                    very galling to him, with his prematurely developed sensibilities and
                    aspirations, to be thrown among such companions as Bob Fagin and Poll Green. And
                    perhaps he was right in afterlife to wonder at the thoughtlessness of his
                    parents in subjecting him to such a humiliation. His sufferings were so acute,
                    and made such an impression on him, that years afterwards he could not think of
                    them without crying; and there were certain quarters of the town through which
                    he used to pass to his daily work, and where he used to loiter with less than
                    enough to eat, that he habitually shunned for their painful memories.- “It is
                    wonderful to me,” he wrote when in the height of his fame, “how I could have
                    been so easily cast away at such an age. It is wonderful to me that, even after
                    my descent into the poor little drudge I had been since we came to London, no
                    one had compassion enough on me—a child of singular abilities, quick, eager,
                    delicate, and soon hurt, bodily or mentally—to suggest that something might have
                    been spared, as certainly it might have been, to place me at any common school.
                    Our friends, I take it, were tired out. No one made any sign. My father and
                    mother were quite satisfied. They could hardly have been more so if I had been
                    twenty years of age, distinguished at a grammar school, and going to
                    Cambridge.”</p>
                <p>And indeed, if his parents could have foreseen the future, they would have had
                    cause to be much more satisfied. For •when the fragile little boy was sent into
                    his cousin’s blacking warehouse, he entered a better school, as it happened,
                    than his father could have chosen for him. It was an infinitely more painful
                    school than Harrow or Eton, but for one whose destined work was to describe the
                    poorer houses and streets of London, and the many varieties of life, odd and
                    sad, laughter-moving and pitiful, that swarmed in them, it was a more
                    instructive school, it was the true road to knowledge. The chances were that a
                    delicate boy like him succumbed to his wretchedness, and that a clever boy like
                    him became a rogue and vagabond; but he survived these dangers and became a
                    great novelist. Instead of sinking into the depths of the thronging atoms, he
                    rose above them, or kept apart from them, observed them, and became their
                    describer.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to say how this watchful habit began, and when it connected
                    itself with his love of literary distinction. We have Dickens’s own testimony
                    that he was a singularly observant child, and that at a very early period he had
                    an ambition to become “a learned and distinguished man,” but it would be going
                    too far to suppose that from his childhood he held himself apart and kept a keen
                    eye on the doings of others with a view to making capital out of his
                    observations. At first in all likelihood the distinction which he coveted was a
                    kind of distinction that seemed to him possible only through the medium of
                    grammar-schools and universities. To the last no doubt he regretted this want of
                    academical study, and believed that it had placed him at a disadvantage. Still
                    accident is so very much better a schoolmaster than design, that from the first
                    it gave him also the literary training needful to make him a painter of manners.
                    His father, the navy pay clerk, had a small collection of books, with which the
                    “very small and not over-particularly taken care of boy” had made himself
                    familiar while he was living at Chatham, before his experiences in Camden Town
                    and the blacking warehouse. Among these books were <hi rend="italic">Roderick
                    Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Clinker, Tom Jones, the Vicar of Wakefield,
                    Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Robinson Crusoe,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Arabian
                    Nights,</hi> Mrs Inchbald’s <hi rend="italic">Farces,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tales of the Genii.</hi> This literature did not glide over the
                    boy’s mind like water over marble; it found congenial soil, and fell into it as
                    seed. He lived the life of his favourite characters. “I have been Tom Jones,” he
                    says, putting his own case into the mouth of David Copperfield “ſa child’s Tom
                    Jones, a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n191/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0191-0174"/> harmless creature), for a week together. I have
                    sustained my own idea of Roderick Random for a month at a stretch, I verily
                    believe. I had a greedy relish for a few volumes of voyages and travels—I forget
                    what now—that were on these shelves; and for days and days I can remember to
                    have gone about my region of our house, armed with the centre-piece out of an
                    old set of boot-trees, the perfect realization of Captain Somebody of the Royal
                    British navy, in danger of being beset by savages, and resolved to sell his life
                    at a great price.” And then follows something still more suggestive, as showing
                    his tendency to connect these ideal creations with the world of sense around
                    him. “Every barn in the neighbourhood, every stone in the church, and every foot
                    of the churchyard had some association of its own in my mind, connected with
                    these books, and stood for some locality made famous in them. I have seen Tom
                    Piper go climbing up the church steeple; <hi rend="italic">I have</hi> watched
                    Strap, with the knapsack on his back, stopping to rest himself upon the wicket
                    gate; and I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that Commodore Trunnion held that club
                    with Mr Pickle in the parlour of our little village alehouse.” Even thus early,
                    too, he tried to imitate what he read, wrote a tragedy founded on one of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tales of the Genu,</hi> and acquired great fame in his own circle
                    as a teller of stories.</p>
                <p>A boy with this preliminary training was excellently prepared for a course of
                    strange and painful experiences. The bitter contrast between the ideal world in
                    which he had lived, and the miserable poverty in which he spent the first three
                    years of his life in London, making himself useful at home, running errands,
                    carrying things to the pawnbrokers, visiting his father in the Marshalsea, into
                    which the poor man and his family soon drifted, tying up pots of blacking at the
                    warehouse, prowling about cook-shops, <hi rend="italic">à-la-mode</hi>
                    beef-shops, and coffee-shops, a shabbily clad and insufficiently fed little boy,
                    seeking to invest his livelihood of a shilling a day to the best advantage,
                    helped to fix these experiences and the many odd scenes and characters with
                    which they brought him in contact more indelibly on his memory. According to his
                    own account, intensely as he felt the misery and shame of this kind of life, he
                    was not without a perception of its humorous side. He used to say that,
                    incredible as it might appear, he looked upon things then very much as he did
                    afterwards. He even began to make attempts to sketch what he saw. Colman’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Broad Grins</hi> was lent him by some kind people—another wise
                    provision on the part of the great schoolmaster Accident; and with this before
                    him as a stimulus, he actually sketched the barber who came to shave his
                    bachelor uncle, the old charwoman who helped his mother, and laid the foundation
                    of subsequent sketches,—Mrs Pipchin, the little Marchioness, Bob Sawyer’s
                    lodgings, and many other characters and scenes to which we have not the same
                    direct traces. He was pursuing his education, in fact, as thoroughly as if he
                    had been a pupil in a painter’s studio. He was serving his apprenticeship. He
                    could not have been better employed if he had been the holder of an endowment
                    for research.</p>
                <p>Dickens himself by no means looked upon it in that light. It was with difficulty,
                    twenty-five years afterwards, that he could bring himself to speak of this
                    period of his life. In his eyes it was a miserable servitude, from which he was
                    happily relieved by a quarrel between his father and one of the partners in the
                    warehouse when he was rather more than twelve years old, and sent to a school in
                    Mornington Place, where he consorted with more respectable boys, and had some
                    chance of book learning. If his father’s fortunes had been equal to it, he might
                    now have passed through a regular course of grammar-school and university
                    training, and thereby perhaps been incapacitated for the work to which he was
                    called. But fortunately he was soon again thrown chiefly on his own resources.
                    At the age of fifteen he was engaged as an office-boy by an attorney in Gray’s
                    Inn at a salary of 13s. 6d., and afterwards 15s. a week. Here again he had a
                    good field for observation, and did not fail to use it, for his employer
                    afterwards recognized in <hi rend="italic">Pickwick</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nickleby</hi> several incidents that took place in his office, and professed
                    also to identify some of the characters. With Mr Blackmore he remained for
                    eighteen months. During that time his father became a newspaper parliamentary
                    reporter, and the office-boy, who had lost none of his thirst for distinction,
                    and spent all his spare time reading hard in the British Museum, resolved to
                    qualify himself for a similar occupation. He mastered the difficulties of
                    short-hand, and in November 1828 obtained employment as a reporter in Doctors’
                    Commons. He spent two years reporting law cases, practising in Doctors’ Commons
                    and the other law courts. It would be difficult to conceive a more perfect way
                    of completing the education of the future novelist, giving him an insight into
                    the strange by-paths of that higher stratum of society of which he had before
                    had little experience. At the age of nineteen he entered the parliamentary
                    gallery to enlarge his knowledge still further. He was a reporter of political
                    speeches in and out of Parliament for five years from 1831 to 1836. First he
                    reported for the <hi rend="italic">True Sun,</hi> then for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mirror of Parliament,</hi> finally for the <hi rend="italic">Morning
                    Chronicle.</hi> In his excursions into the country, and back with his “copy,” he
                    saw the last of the old coaching days and of the old inns that were a part of
                    them; but it will be long, as Mr Forster remarks, “before the readers of his
                    living page see the last of the life of either.”</p>
                <p>His first published piece of original writing appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Old Monthly Magazine</hi> for January 1834. The title was “A Dinner at Poplar”
                    (“Mr Minns ”), one of the pieces afterwards published as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sketches by Boz,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">nom</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    plume</hi> which he adopted from the nickname of one of his brothers. He wrote
                    nine of these sketches for the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Magazine,</hi> and then
                    he was engaged to write some for an evening offshoot to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morning Chronicle.</hi> The first series of <hi rend="italic">Sketches by
                    Boz</hi> was collected and published in two volumes in the February of 1836,
                    with illustrations by George Cruickshank. The first edition was exhausted in a
                    few months; a second was called for in August. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sketches</hi> had at once attracted attention. No wonder, for in them we find
                    already in full swing the unflagging delight in pursuing the humorous side of a
                    character, and the inexhaustible fertility in inventing ludicrous incidents,
                    which had only to be displayed on a large scale to place him ‘at once on a
                    pinnacle of fame. There are many of them, such as the Parish, the Boarding
                    House, Mr Minns and his Cousin, and the misplaced attachment of Mr John Dounce,
                    which show Dickens’s humour at its very richest. He had formed, too, by this
                    time his characteristic likes and dislikes, and plays them off upon his butts
                    and favourites with the utmost frankness. The delight in homely sociability and
                    cheerfulness, in the innocent efforts of simple people to make merry, the kindly
                    satire of their little vanities and ambitions, the hearty ridicule of dry fogies
                    who shut themselves up in selfish cares and reserves, and of sour
                    mischief-makers who take pleasure in conspiring against the enjoyment of their
                    neighbours,—these tendencies, which remained with Dickens to the last, are
                    strongly marked in the <hi rend="italic">Sketches,</hi> though lighter-hearted
                    in their expression than in his later works. The mark and indispensable
                    condition of all great work is there, that which Mr Carlyle calls veracity—the
                    description of what the writer has himself seen, heard, and felt, the fearless
                    utterance of his own sentiments in his own way.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0192-0175"/><hi rend="italic">Pickwick Club</hi> was issued in
                    April 1836. The story of its origin was first authentically told in the preface
                    to the edition of 1847. Some of the details were afterwards slightly modified.
                    The first thought of the work did not originate with Dickens, although the whole
                    character of it was determined by him. The publishers, Messrs Chapman &amp;
                    Hall, and Mr Seymour the artist, had agreed to issue a monthly serial to be
                    illustrated by Mr Seymour, and they went to Dickens, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sketches</hi> had attracted their attention, to propose that he should write
                    the letterpress of this “monthly something.” Their idea was that the author
                    should describe the adventures of a “Nimrod Club,” the members of which should
                    go out shooting, fishing, and so forth, and getting themselves into difficulties
                    through their want of dexterity. Dickens undertook the monthly something, but
                    obtained the required diverting incidents by a different machinery, namely, the
                    Pickwick Club. The first four numbers went off slowly; the demand first became
                    “brisk” after the fifth number, in which Sam Weller made his appearance. But by
                    the discerning few the value of the work was recognized; and one of them, Mr
                    Bentley the publisher, only a few weeks before fame came to the author with its
                    capricious and overwhelming suddenness, engaged him to undertake the editing of
                    a monthly magazine to be started the following January, and to write a serial
                    story for it, and further made an agreement with him for the writing of two
                    other tales at a specified early date. Of∣he vexation arising out of this
                    agreement, when the huge success of the <hi rend="italic">Pickwick Papers</hi>
                    showed its terms to be inadequate, and Dickens was disposed to resent it as a
                    selling of himself into slavery, and of the manner in which the bargain was
                    re-adjusted, an account is given by Mr Forster from the author’s point of view.
                    Nine monthly numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Pickwick Papers</hi> were
                    published in 1836; eleven more in 1837; by November of the latter year the sale
                    had reached 40,000 copies, Pickwick had become a popular hero and godfather to
                    innumerable articles of merchandise, and Sam Weller’s sayings were catchwords in
                    the street and the household wherever the English language was spoken.</p>
                <p>In the first excitement of success, the young author’s appetite for work was
                    unbounded. In 1837 he wrote his monthly instalments of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pickwick Papers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> side by side, not
                    even by a week in advance of the printer with either. They kept him fully
                    occupied, and held in abeyance for that year a taste which from his youth to the
                    end of his career was strong in him, and had no inconsiderable influence upon
                    his style as a painter of manners. In his childhood at Chatham he got his first
                    experience of fame as the author of a tragedy; at the school in Mornington Place
                    he and his companions mounted small theatres and acted small plays; when in the
                    attorney’s office in Lincoln’s Inn Fields he frequented minor theatres, the
                    nature of which he has caricatured in the <hi rend="italic">Sketches,</hi> and
                    not unfrequently engaged in parts; one of his first published sketches, “Mrs
                    Joseph Porter Over the Way,” is a description of private theatricals in a
                    stage-struck family. In 1836, before his serial engagements multiplied, he wrote
                    a farce called the <hi rend="italic">Strange Gentleman,</hi> and a short comedy
                    with songs called the <hi rend="italic">Village Coquettes.</hi> It is strange
                    that with this passion for the stage, which he always retained, he should not
                    have written more plays. He probably felt that in this kind of composition he
                    had but the use of his left hand, and did not care to risk his reputation where
                    he had no field for those powers of description and narrative over which he had
                    proved his mastery. But though he did not write plays, and finally sought no
                    outlet for his theatrical longings except in amateur acting and in reading from
                    his own novels, the habit of realizing incidents as they would appear on the
                    stage is unmistakably apparent in his work. He constantly seems to be working up
                    scenes to the pitch of stage effect, elaborating the actions of his characters
                    as if he were inventing “business” for a player, suggesting, in fact, an
                    exuberance of business far beyond the capabilities of any human performer.</p>
                <p>We doubt whether the fact that Dickens did not write plays is explained by saying
                    that his genius was descriptive and narrative, but not dramatic. There is plenty
                    of the raw material of dramatic action in his dialogues. He probably could have
                    written a good acting play if he had tried. His characters are essentially
                    theatrical, though their story is told according to the laws of the novel, and
                    not according to the laws of the drama. The explanation of his not having tried
                    to write plays we take to be simply that he discovered full employment for his
                    powers in another direction before he had applied himself to the art of
                    constructing plays. Dickens was eminently a practical man, and, when publishers
                    were fighting for his novels, he directed his whole energy to meeting the demand
                    without seeking to experiment on other modes of composition. As some
                    compensation to Mr Bentley for releasing him from the strict terms of the
                    agreement we have mentioned, he edited a life of Grimaldi, which was published
                    in 1838; but after that he put his whole strength into the art of writing
                    sketches and serial tales. As soon as <hi rend="italic">Pickwick</hi> was off
                    his hands, and before <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> was yet completed, he
                    made an agreement with Chapman &amp; Hall “to write a new work, the title
                    whereof should be determined by him, of a similar character and of the same
                    extent as the <hi rend="italic">Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club ;”</hi>
                    and between April 1838 and October 1839 he produced the <hi rend="italic">Life
                    and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.</hi></p>
                <p>Before the end of the serial publication of <hi rend="italic">Nickleby,</hi> he
                    had conceived a new project, partly with a view to relief from the strain of
                    writing a continuous story in instalments with the printer at his heels, and
                    partly with a view to getting more profit for himself out of his labours. This
                    was a weekly publication, to be edited by himself, and to contain sketches,
                    essays, tales, adventures, and letters from imaginary correspondents. He was to
                    receive a certain sum every week for what was written, and was besides to share
                    half the profits with the publishers. When the scheme was agreed to by the
                    publishers, he proceeded to release himself from other engagements by resigning
                    the editorship of <hi rend="italic">Bentley’s Miscellany,</hi> and getting clear
                    of his obligation to write <hi rend="italic">Barnaby Budge</hi> for <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">jWγ</hi> Bentley in consideration of his buying the copyright
                    and stock of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> for £2250. He thus started
                    clear with <hi rend="italic">Master Humphrey's Clock,</hi> the title upon which
                    he fixed for his new publication. The first number of <hi rend="italic">Master
                    Humphrey</hi> was issued on April 4, 1840. The sale of the first number was
                    70,000 copies, but the orders fell off when it was found that there was to be no
                    continuous story. A story in weekly instalments it was thereupon necessary for
                    him to write. A tale which he had begun in his magazine, and put into the mouth
                    of Old Humphrey, was seen to be capable of expansion, and he expanded it into
                    the <hi rend="italic">Old Curiosity Shop,</hi> finding himself thus driven to
                    his old employment of keeping ahead of the printers with a serial story, the
                    only difference being that the instalments were weekly, and that he had the
                    stimulus of larger profits from his success.</p>
                <p>It is necessary in any account of Dickens, if we care to understand his method as
                    a novelist, to give prominence to the conditions under which he worked. All that
                    has been said about the want of plot in his novels finds its true explanation in
                    those conditions. We need not search for deeper causes. His stories being
                    published in instalments, it was indispensable to success that each separate
                    part should have an independent interest; and as each instalment was published
                    before the next was written, it was necessary that he should have a plot leaving
                    him with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n193/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0193-0176"/> utmost possible freedom of action. Of course,
                    when we say that this explains his method, we do not mean that it accounts for
                    his success; we do not mean to detract from the marvellous genius that enabled
                    him to write with success under such conditions. We are only concerned to show
                    how the kind of plot that he adopted, and the numerous branches, offshoots, and
                    meanderings which he permitted himself were imposed upon him by circumstances of
                    publication and composition,—were, in fact, necessary to success under those
                    circumstances. A great deal too much has been made of the want of plot in
                    Dickens’s novels, as if it were a weakness, as if he had been incapable of
                    constructing a plot,—the truth being that his method was deliberately adopted as
                    that best suited to the position in which he found himself. It is evident that
                    he was very much exercised over this question of plot, as indeed he was on all
                    points touching his art. The <hi rend="italic">Pickwick Papers</hi> may be put
                    on one side in studying his method; he tumbled as it were into writing them; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> u</hi> no ingenuity of plot,” as he himself explained, “was
                    attempted ;” they were simply “designed for the introduction of diverting
                    characters and incidents.” [n his subsequent novels, if the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pickwick Papers</hi> can be called a novel, he could lay his plans beforehand,
                    and consider how far it was possible to reconcile the introduction of
                    interesting characters and incidents with greater regularity of structure, and
                    he never seems to have solved the problem to his own satisfaction. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> he adopted the method of Defoe, and wrote what
                    may be called a biographical novel, the hero of which is involved in a series of
                    complications, arising one after another without being foreseen and calculated
                    for from the beginning. In this way he avoided committing himself too far in
                    advance to engagements which might afterwards prove embarrassing; the toils are
                    laid for Oliver and cleared away more than once in the course of the story. In
                    <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</hi> he reserved similar freedom of action
                    by making Ralph conspire to ruin his brother’s children without committing
                    himself at the outset to any particular scheme as the villain’s one resource; he
                    thus also makes provision for a series of plots, one after another, and secures
                    a certain unity for the whole by making them all proceed from one malevolent
                    agency, whose motive was formed before the story began. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nicholas Nickleby,</hi> however, he departs from certain restraints under which
                    he had laid himself in the construction of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist;</hi>
                    he asserts greater freedom from the bit and bridle of plot in his introduction
                    of diverting incidents which have no proper connection with the main story. Miss
                    La Creevy and the Kenwigses are brought in on the slightest of pretexts,
                    slighter even than that which serves for the introduction of the Mantalinis and
                    the Crummles family. But no one can quarrel with a breadth of canvas which the
                    author is able to fill with such figures; the critic can only say that he would
                    have made a mistake if he had limited himself from the scope thereby given for
                    his powers. As in <hi rend="italic">Nickleby</hi> the moving principle of the
                    story is the malevolent humour of Ralph, so in the <hi rend="italic">Old
                    Curiosity Shop</hi> the moving principle is the malevolent humour of Daniel
                    Quilp. It is characteristic of Dickens that the uncalculating impulses should
                    have so much influence in the direction of his stories. Fagin has some amount of
                    selfish object in his designs against Oliver Twist; but Ralph and Quilp have
                    nothing to gain by their conspiracies except the gratification of pure malice.
                    The counter-agencies to these simple incarnations of the devil are equally
                    disinterested. Oliver’s good angel Nancy, Kate Nickleby’s Newman Noggs, Little
                    Nell’s Kit, and Kit’s Dick Swiveller are swayed by impulses of pure generosity.
                    Observe, too, the analogous positions of Mr Brownlow the protector of Oliver,
                    the Cheeryble brothers the protectors of Nicholas, aud Mr Garland the protector
                    of Kit. It is a game between the elementary passions, in which the good
                    triumphs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Master Humphrey's Clock</hi> was allowed to run out in November
                    1841, with the conclusion of the tale of <hi rend="italic">Barnaby Pudge,</hi>
                    which followed the <hi rend="italic">Old Curiosity Shop.</hi> The construction
                    of <hi rend="italic">Barnaby Rudge</hi> is less simple than that of any of its
                    predecessors; Dickens here attempted a more closely knit form of plot. There are
                    no incidental diversions in this novel, all the characters have some finger in
                    the main story, and every scene tends towards the development of some relation
                    which afterwards has a potent influence on the course of the main events. It is
                    true the Lord George Gordon riots fill so much space as to eclipse for a time
                    the private interests of the novel; but the lives of all the personages whose
                    fortunes we are following are interwoven with the public history with the most
                    elaborate care and consummate skill, and when our fears for the commonwealth in
                    the general storm are allayed, the keenest interest is left for the fates of the
                    individuals that have been involved in the commotion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Barnaby Rudge</hi> cost the author much labour, and after
                    finishing it, and with it <hi rend="italic">Master Humphreſ s Clock,</hi> he
                    felt the need of some change of strain. He had begun to chafe under the weekly
                    form of publication, and fret as to what he might have done with Barnaby if he
                    could only have produced it in monthly instalments. This determined him to make
                    an agreement with his publishers for the issue of his next story in the old
                    monthly form. When he projected the <hi rend="italic">Clock,</hi> one of his
                    schemes was that he should visit Ireland or America, and write from there a
                    series of descriptive papers for it. The <hi rend="italic">Clock</hi> was
                    discontinued, but the desire to seek fresh fields remained. He accordingly set
                    out for America in January 1842, returning in June, after a reception which
                    might well have turned his head, to write the <hi rend="italic">American
                    Notes.</hi> He had been run after and stared at by crowds, and cheered with
                    greater enthusiasm than if he had been a crowned potentate; and the people of
                    the United States complained that in these <hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> as well
                    as in his fierce endeavours to enlighten them on the subject of copyright, he
                    had made but a poor return for their welcome. He was superfluously aggressive,
                    there is no doubt; but they freely forgave him when he returned some years
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>From whatever cause, the sale of the first number of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Martin</hi><hi rend="italic">Chuzzleτvit</hi> (January 1843), in which he
                    returned to the broad and free method of <hi rend="italic">Nickleby,</hi> only
                    seeking a new motive for his plot in the design of a severe but benevolent old
                    uncle-for his nephew’s reformation, and the schemes of a pious hypocrite, fell
                    considerably below what he had been led to expect by the sale of his former
                    monthlies. Only 20,000 were sold; his publishers, with whom he had made a very
                    advantageous bargain, irritated him by grumbling; and though the novel obtained
                    still higher praise than any of its predecessors, he was disappointed and
                    discontented, and began to revolve other plans for making a living by his pen.
                    He conceived the idea of writing a Christmas tale, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Christmas Carol;</hi> but he made much less profit by the enterprise than he
                    made by similar tales afterwards, when he charged less for them and appealed to
                    a wider audience. Although he sacrificed nothing of his individuality in the
                    substance of the tale, and it was no failure in point of reputation, the
                    pecuniary side of the work was for the moment uppermost in his mind, for, large
                    as his income had been, he had exceeded it, and the most popular author of his
                    time was suffering horrors, as he himself said, of “intolerable anxiety and
                    disappointment.” This disappointment determined him to live abroad for a time,
                    partly to reduce his expenses, and partly to store his mind, with fresh
                    material. He settled at Genoa, and there finished <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chuzzlewit,</hi> and wrote the <hi rend="italic">Chimes,</hi> his Christmas <pb

                    read it to a party of friends and arrange for its publication. He visited the
                    principal towns of Italy in the first months of 1845, returning to England byway
                    of Switzerland in June.</p>
                <p>His first work on returning to London was to project a new weekly, to be called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cricket,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> price three
                    halfpence, if possible—partly original, partly select, notices of books, notices
                    of theatres, notices of all good things, notices of all bad ones; <hi
                    rend="italic">carol</hi> philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomization of
                    humbug, jolly good temper, papers always in season, pat to the time of year; and
                    a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything
                    to home and friends.” The scheme for the time fell through. About the same time
                    he “opened communications with a leading member of the Government to ascertain
                    what chances there might be for his appointment, upon due qualification, to the
                    paid magistracy of London; but the reply did not give him encouragement to
                    entertain the notion farther.” Soon after he was asked to undertake the
                    editorship of a new daily paper, the <hi rend="italic">Daily News,</hi> and
                    consented. But a fortnight’s experience (from January 21 to February 9, 1846)
                    satisfied him that he was out of his element. He then resolved to go abroad
                    again, and write another novel in shilling monthly numbers. The fruit of this
                    resolution was <hi rend="italic">Dombey and Son,</hi> the first number of which
                    was issued in October 1846, and the last in April 1848. On resigning the
                    editorship of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News,</hi> he did not wholly part
                    connection with it; he continued in it from January to March 1846 a series of
                    descriptive letters, which he afterwards published under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pictures from Italy.</hi> The sale of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dombey,</hi> which reached 32,000, reassured him in the pursuit of his special
                    calling. He followed it up in 1849 and 1850 with <hi rend="italic">David
                    Copperfield.</hi></p>
                <p>There is not much room for variety of incident in the life of a novelist securely
                    established in popular favour, working hard, and happy in the exercise of his

                    given the chief incidents in the later half of the literary life of Dickens. He
                    was much too restless a man, however, to settle down into a steady routine of
                    work. He was not content to appear before the public only in monthly numbers. He
                    stuck steadily enough to work in which he had proved his mastery, but yet he had
                    always a craving for new experiences, and was always planning new enterprises.
                    While <hi rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi> was still upon his hands he
                    returned to his old notion of a weekly periodical At first he thought of calling
                    it <hi rend="italic">The Shadow,</hi> making it contain, as it were, the
                    observations of “a kind of semi-omniscient, omnipresent, intangible creature,”
                    “which should go into any place, by sunlight, moonlight, starlight, firelight,
                    candlelight, and be in all houses, and all nooks and corners, and be supposed to
                    be cognizant of everything, and go everywhere, without the least difficulty;
                    which might be in the theatre, the palace, the House of Commons, the prisons,
                    the unions, the churches, on the railroad, on the sea, abroad, and at home.” But
                    on consideration he abandoned this idea, and chose the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Household Words.</hi> The first number appeared in March 30, 1850. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Household Words,</hi> besides contributing short stories to the
                    annual Christmas number, Dickens wrote <hi rend="italic">Hard Times</hi> between
                    April 1 and August 12, £854. In 1859, inconsequence of a quarrel between the
                    editor and the publishers, <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> was
                    discontinued, and <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round,</hi> practically the
                    same periodical under a new title, took its place. In <hi rend="italic">All the
                    Year Round,</hi> besides Christmas contributions, Dickens wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</hi> between April 30 and November 26, 1859;
                    the <hi rend="italic">Uncommercial</hi><hi rend="italic">Traveller,</hi> between
                    January 28 and October 13, 1860; and <hi rend="italic">Great Expectations
                    between</hi> December 1, 1860, and August 3, 1861. It is often made a question
                    whether there was any falling off of power in the later works of Dickens. <hi
                    rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi> would generally be named as the novel in
                    which his power was at its zenith. The question is not one that can be answered
                    by an unqualified yes or no. There is certainly no falling off in descriptive
                    power. The idiom of his dialogue is finer; the wit is perhaps keener and more
                    swift. His characters are more sharply defined; the force with which they are
                    drawn is more delicate. In no point of the novelist’s art, whether in the
                    general construction or in the execution of details, is there any sign of
                    failing power; on the contrary the power seems to have become firmer and more
                    sure from practice. Does the fault then lie with the reader î Is it that we have
                    grown tired of his manner <hi rend="italic">1</hi> This is probably part of the
                    reason, but yet it is not to be denied that we miss something in the later
                    works. We laugh less over the pages. There are longer “intervallums” of
                    seriousness. Humorous characters are still there in abundance; Joe Gargery, Old
                    Boffin, Silas Wegg, Rumty Wilfer, Septimus Crisparkle, Durdles, Mr Sapsea, are
                    as irresistible as any of their predecessors. But on the whole there is less
                    exuberance of animal spirits. The fun is not so unflagging. It is even less
                    hearty, for there is mixed with our laughter something of contempt or pity for
                    the object of it. Not that it is all laughter and undesigning diversion in any
                    of the earlier works. Dickens belonged to a serious and moralizing generation;
                    he came in with the Reform Bill, and partook largely of the moral spirit of its
                    framers. Even in the joyous <hi rend="italic">Pickwick Papers</hi> there is a
                    serious blow at prison abuses. <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi> is almost as
                    didactic as one of Harriet Martineau’s tales. Before writing <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nicholas Nickleby</hi> he went down to Yorkshire like a Government commissioner
                    to inquire into the abuses of the Yorkshire schools. Through all the fresh and
                    boisterous fun of his earlier works, there was an almost declared doctrine that
                    it is our duty to laugh, a sort of protest in favour of laughter, and a
                    denunciation of the dismal as a crime. The same genial doctrine runs also
                    through his later works, but it is urged with a trace of bitterness, and with a
                    greater sensitiveness to the evil principles that oppose it. Dickens was not
                    written out, but he was growing old, and the animal spirits which fed the flame
                    of his marvellous humour began to show symptoms of exhaustion. The quality of
                    his humour was unimpaired, but the quantity had suffered diminution.</p>
                <p>Dickens established his first weekly periodical from a desire to draw closer the
                    relations between himself and his readers. He drew those relations still closer
                    in 1858, by beginning a series of public readings of his own works. He had long
                    hungered for this way of giving body and substance to his feeling of success. He
                    had always been eager for the immediate and palpable triumphs of the stage. The
                    idea of taking a hall or theatre and reading from his own books was first
                    mentioned by him in 1844, after he had read the <hi rend="italic">Chimes</hi> to
                    a small company in Mr Forster’s rooms, and he often returned to it, but was
                    obliged to hold it in abeyance for fourteen years, his friends urging that it
                    would be beneath his dignity. In 1858 his resolution was taken in spite of all
                    discouragements, partly, he said, to escape from uneasiness at home, though it
                    may well bo believed that his own temper—restless, irritable, and exacting in
                    the midst of his work—was largely to blame for the discomfort from which he
                    suffered. He gave four series of readings, in 1858-59, 1861-63, 1866-67, and
                    1868-70, appearing in nearly every town of any size in the United Kingdom; and
                    in 1867-68 renewing in this way his acquaintance with the Americans. The success
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n195/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0195-0178"/> these readings was enormous from every point of
                    view. Mr Forster mentions that he remitted from America £10,000 odd as the
                    result of 34 readings.</p>
                <p>That Dickens should so long have abstained from appearing as a public reader of
                    his own works, and standing face to face with his audience to enjoy the delight
                    of their effect, notwithstanding his strong desire to do so, is a significant
                    fact. It gives a sort of measure of two things,—the force of his craving for
                    sympathy and applause, and the extent of his patience under conventional
                    prejudices. It was from deference to these prejudices that he abstained; and it
                    required an almost fierce effort on his part to dismiss those prejudices as
                    “humbug,” and “the proprieties of old women.” His attitude towards society, in
                    the narrow sense of the word, was always peculiar. To understand it, we must
                    bear in mind the circumstances of his youth. He seems never to have quite lost a
                    lurking fear that those circumstances exposed him to contempt. He was much too
                    proud and great-hearted a man to give in to such a fear; but it clung to him,
                    and was always demanding a certain struggle to keep it down. Slight as the
                    struggle was, the traces of it are perceptible in his work. We have an evidence
                    of it in the common saying that he never succeeded in painting “a gentleman.”
                    That is not to be got over by calling for a definition of the word; it is a
                    popular expression of a fact, the fact that nearly all the personages in his
                    novels occupying a position in life to which that word would have been applied
                    in his own time are painted in unfavourable colours. Perhaps the course of his
                    stories did not call upon him to paint more favourable specimens of that class;
                    still the fact remains that in Dickens’s attitude towards society there was
                    something of the defensive, even of the aggressive. He faced towards society
                    with a certain air of defiance, with the consciousness of a vast popular
                    multitude behind him, to which he oould appeal if they refused him what was his
                    due. He never claimed more than his due, and it was never refused to him. It is
                    perhaps for this reason that the traces of his spirit of revolt against society
                    are so slight as to be more matter of inference than of observation. It is more
                    correct to say that he never tried to paint “a gentleman,” than that he did not
                    succeed. The question can hardly be raised without giving it undue importance,
                    an importance which Dickens himself w ould have been the first to make light of;
                    for, though he had his full share of the little vanities inseparable from
                    humanity, he was a great man in temper as well as in genius, and littlenesses
                    were of the accidents and not of the essence of his nature.</p>
                <p>Dickens’s want of perfect sympathy with the cultured society of his time
                    incapacitated him for that kind of novel which answers to comedy in dramatic
                    composition, although it left him free for work of a greater and more enduring
                    kind. What may be called the comedy novel, the novel of Thackeray in Dickens’s
                    generation, is much less sure of enduring fame, because the sentiments on which
                    it rests, being the product of a particular knot of circumstances, are more
                    fugitive, and pass sooner into the province of the historian. The novels of
                    Dickens will live longer because they take hold of the permanent and universal
                    sentiments of the race,—sentiments which pervade all classes, and which no
                    culture can ever eradicate. His fun may be too boisterous for the refined tastes
                    of his own time, or, for the matter of that, of posterity; his pathos may appear
                    maudlin; but they carried everything before them when they first burst upon our
                    literature, because, however much exaggerated, they were exaggerations of what
                    our race feels in its inner heart; and unless culture in the future works a
                    miracle, and carries its changes beneath the surface, we may be certain that
                    Dickens will keep his hold.</p>
                <p>If Dickens had been asked why his novels were likely to five, he would probably
                    have answered that it was because he put more work into them than any of his
                    contemporaries. He was fond of insisting that genius meant attention. The
                    definition may be accepted with a qualification. No man can become a genius by
                    resolving to attend; but if he attends very much in some one direction by
                    natural impulse, then he may be said to have a genius, whatever may be his field
                    of work. No genius is of much avail for great literary productions without
                    attention. Dickens could, never have gathered together his amazing variety of
                    characters and abundance of incidents without attention. Μ. Taine, in his
                    criticism of Dickens, dwells much upon the boundless wealth of his imagination;
                    Dickens himself would have expressed the same fact by speaking of the
                    persistence and closeness of his attention. It comes to the same thing in the
                    end, whichever way we express it; but there is no doubt that Dickens’s own
                    expression is more descriptive of his actual method of work. Μ. Taine rather
                    gives us the notion that Dickens sat down and trusted to the inexhaustible
                    fertility of his imagination; whereas, ready and active as his imagination ever
                    was, he accumulated materials for it with the industry of a pre-Raphaelite
                    painter. The charm, the inimitable secret, lay, of course, in the transmuting
                    process through which dry facts passed in his imagination; but he laboured
                    earnestly, exercised the most painstaking attention, not merely in bringing his
                    facts together, but in setting them, with all their superadded value, for his
                    special purposes. Dickens would have been a humorist though he had never written
                    a line; he could never have helped attending to the humorous side of whatever
                    met his eye; but without the attention on which he prided himself as the secret
                    of his power, he could never have established himself securely as one of the
                    greatest humorists in literature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Our Mutual Friend</hi> was published in 1864 and 1865. After an
                    interval of five years, during which he contributed to three Christmas numbers
                    of <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round,</hi> and wrote <hi rend="italic">A
                    Holiday Romance</hi> and <hi rend="italic">George Silverman's Explanation</hi>
                    for an American publisher, the first number of <hi rend="italic">The Mystery of
                    Edwin Drood</hi> was issued in April 1870. He did not live to complete the
                    novel. For some years severe pains in the left hand and foot had given warning
                    that he was overtaxing his system, but the warning was not fully understood till
                    too late. He was suddenly overcome by a stupor, caused by effusion on the brain,
                    on the evening of the 8th of June, and ceased to breathe on the following day.
                    In his will he had desired that he should be buried in “an inexpensive,
                    unostentatious, and strictly private manner, without any public announcement of
                    the time or place of his burial.” These conditions were observed; but his
                    executors did not consider them inconsistent with his receiving the honour of
                    interment in Westminster Abbey, where he was buried on the 14th of June
                    1870.</p>
                <p>His death took place at Gadshill Place, a bouse near the main road between
                    Rochester and Gravesend, which he had bought in 1856, and which had been his
                    home since 1859. Here he worked, and walked, and saw his friends, and was loved
                    and almost worshipped by his poorer neighbours for miles around. His previous
                    residences in London had been FurnivaΓs Inn, where fame found him a young man
                    writing sketches for the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle;</hi> 48 Doughty Street,
                    after his marriage and first flood of success; Devonshire Terrace, from 1839 to
                    1851; Tavistock House, from 1851 to 1859. These residences were varied by his
                    numerous excursions to provincial towns, to the Continent, to America. But
                    “perhaps there was never a man who changed places so much and habits so little.
                    He was always methodical and regular, and passed his life from day to day,
                    divided for the most part between working <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0196-0179"/> and walking, the same wherever he was.” It is a
                    notable feature in his regularity that it was never a complacent routine; it was
                    persisted in in spite of restless longings which he never conquered to the
                    last.</p>
