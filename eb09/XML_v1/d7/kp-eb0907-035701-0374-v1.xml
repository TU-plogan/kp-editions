                <p><label type="entry">DON JUAN</label>, a legendary personage whose story,
                    originating in Spain, has found currency in various poetic and dramatic forms
                    throughout most of the countries of Europe. The character has a certain historic
                    basis in so far as it is localized at Seville in the time of Peter the Cruel,
                    or, according to another version, of Charles V. Don Juan, who belonged to the
                    illustrious Tenorio family, lived a life of unbridled licentiousness. In an
                    attempt to abduct Giralda, daughter of the governor of Seville, he was
                    encountered by her father, whom he subsequently killed in a duel. In mocking
                    defiance of the spirit world, in whose existence his sensuality had destroyed
                    all faith, he visited the tomb of the murdered man in the vault of San Francesco
                    and challenged his statue to follow him to supper. The invitation was accepted;
                    the animated statue appeared at table among the guests, and carried the
                    blaspheming sceptic to hell. In a few later dramatic versions of the story some
                    features are introduced belonging, to another personage of the same name, Don
                    Juan of Marana, who, having sold himself to the devil, passed the greater part
                    of his life in debauchery and crime. His mother, however, had provided that
                    masses should be said for his salvation, and, being converted through the
                    influence of these, he ended his days in a monastery, where he subjected himself
                    to the severest penance.</p>
                <p>As a dramatic type Don Juan is essentially the impersonation of the scepticism
                    that results from sensuality, and is thus the complement of Faust, whose
                    scepticism is the result of speculation. In its literary treatment it has
                    received various degrees of intensity. In the hands of the earlier Spanish
                    dramatists it becomes, without their intending it, a solemn and impressive moral
                    beacon, while Byron’s Don Juan is a gay adventurer, with nothing in common with
                    the legendary personage except his name and his libertinism. The first
                    introduction of the story into dramatic literature seems to have been in Lope de
                    Vega’s <hi rend="italic">Money makes the Man,</hi> where the incident of a
                    walking statue occurs; but the earliest occasion on which the story was
                    dramatized as a whole was in the <hi rend="italic">Burlador de Sevilla</hi> (The
                    Deceiver of Seville) of Gabriel Tellez, who published his secular works under
                    the name Tirso de Molina. The Don Juan of this play is almost heroic in his
                    fearlessness, indulging his cold grim humour without restraint even in the
                    realized presence of the supernatural; but his unrelieved depravity revolts the
                    moral sense. From Spain the drama was soon after 1620 transferred to Italy,
                    where a translation of it was produced at Naples. A few years later it was
                    transferred to Paris, where it was frequently acted, sometimes in the form of a
                    translation of the work of Tellez, and sometimes in more or less free
                    imitations, of which several were produced. A new aspect was given to the
                    character in Molière’s <hi rend="italic">Don Juan,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou le
                    Festin de Pierre</hi> (1665), where the hero, though as heartlessly depraved as
                    in the Spanish original, loses some of the sterner elements both of his
                    wickedness and of his humour, and becomes more seductive and more amusing. Into
                    English literature the story was first introduced by Shadwell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Libertine</hi> (1676), a grossly indecent and, from a literary
                    point of view, worthless play. The continued popularity of the legend in the
                    country of its birth is attested by the fact that it has furnished the
                    groundwork for a play— <hi rend="italic">Don Juan Tenorio</hi> (1844),—and two
                    poems— <hi rend="italic">El Desafio del Diablo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Un
                    Testigo di Bronce</hi> (1845),—by the celebrated poet Zorrilla. During the
                    present century it has also been a favourite subject with French writers of the
                    romantic school, having been dealt with by Dumas the elder, Musset, Levasseur,
                    Malleſille, and others. Its capacity for musical treatment has been tested by
                    two composers of the first rank. Gluck made Don Juan the hero of a ballet, and
                    Mozart’s opera, <hi rend="italic">Don Giovanni,</hi> the libretto of which was
                    furnished by Da Ponte, has probably done more to popularize the story in the
                    Molière as distinct from the severer early Spanish form than any other setting,
                    literary or musical, it has ever received.</p>
