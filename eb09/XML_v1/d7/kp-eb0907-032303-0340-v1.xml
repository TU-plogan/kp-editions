                    a learned controversial writer, was born at Dublin in October 1641. His father
                    had once been possessed of considerable property in Connaught, but having lost
                    it at the rebellion settled at York in 1648. Here Henry received his preliminary
                    education at the free school. By the death of his parents he was reduced in
                    early life to the greatest poverty. In 1654 he was sent by his uncle to Trinity
                    College, Dublin, of which he was soon afterwards chosen scholar and fellow.
                    Having conscientious objections to take <pb break="no"

                    and resided for some time at Oxford, Dublin, and London successively. In 1688 he
                    was elected Camden professor of history at Oxford; but in 1691 he was deprived
                    of his professorship for refusing to take the oaths of allegiance to William and
                    Mary. Retiring to Shottesbrooke in Berkshire, and living on the produce of a
                    small estate in Ireland, which he had at first generously relinquished in favour
                    of a near relation, he devoted himself to those literary labours m chronology
                    and ecclesiastical polity on which his fame now rests. In the former department
                    he published— <hi rend="italic">Discourse on the Phenician History of

                    Dissertationes</hi> (1701). All these obtained considerable reputation, and were
                    frequently reprinted. Gibbon speaks of his learning as “immense,” and says that
                    his “skill in employing facts is equal to his learning.” In the department of
                    ecclesiastical polity his works are more numerous and of much less value, his
                    judgment being far inferior to his power of research. In his earlier writings he
                    was regarded as one of the greatest champions of the non-jurors; but the absurd
                    doctrine which he afterwards promulgated, that immortality could be enjoyed only
                    by those who had received baptism from the hands of one set of regularly
                    ordained clergy, and was therefore a privilege from which dissenters were
                    hopelessly excluded, justly deprived him of the confidence even of his friends.
                    It is interesting, however, in view of the recent revival of the same doctrine,
                    to know that he published in 1706 a treatise professing to prove from Scripture
                    and the first fathers that the soul is naturally mortal. Dodwell died at
                    Shottesbrooke, 7th June 1711. His eldest son Henry is known as the author of a
                    pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Chnstianity not founded on Argument,</hi> to
                    which a reply was published by his brother William, who was besides engaged in a
                    controversy with Dr Conyers Middleton on the subject of miracles.</p>
