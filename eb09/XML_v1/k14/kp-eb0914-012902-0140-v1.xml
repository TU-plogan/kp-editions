                    (1784-1862), dramatic author, was born at Cork, 21st May 1784. His father was
                    the lexicographer James Knowles, cousin-german of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Not
                    long after the removal of the family to London in 1793, young Knowles began his
                    dramatic career by composing a play which was performed by himself and his
                    juvenile companions. At the age of fourteen he published a ballad entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Welsh Harper,</hi> which was set to music and obtained great
                    popularity; and about the same time his precocious talents secured him the
                    friendship of Hazlitt, through whom he also formed an intimacy with Lamb and
                    Coleridge. Of his early career little else is known except that for some time he
                    served in the Wilts and afterwards in the Tower Hamlets militia, and that he
                    left the latter corps to become pupil of Dr Willan the physician, through whom
                    he was appointed vaccinator to the Jennerian Society. Although, however, he was
                    generously offered by Dr Willan a share in his practice, he resolved to forsake
                    medicine for the stage, making his debut at the Crow Theatre, Dublin. At Wexford
                    he in October 1809 married Maria Charteris, an actress from the Edinburgh
                    Theatre. About this time he wrote <hi rend="italic">Leo,</hi> which was played
                    at Waterford with great success by Edmund Kean; but, although another piece, <hi
                    rend="italic">Brian Boroihme,</hi> which he wrote for the Belfast Theatre also
                    drew crowded houses, his labours as an actor and author secured him so little
                    pecuniary return that he found it advisable to become assistant to his father at
                    the Belfast Academical Institution. In 1817 he removed from Belfast to Glasgow,
                    where, besides conducting a flourishing school, he continued his dramatic
                    authorship. His first important dramatic success was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caius</hi><hi rend="italic">Gracchus,</hi> produced at Belfast in 1815; and by
                    <hi rend="italic">Virginius,</hi> written for Edmund Kean, and first performed
                    in 1820, he obtained a very high place among the dramatic authors of the
                    century. Besides <hi rend="italic">William Tell,</hi> in which Macready
                    performed one of his most successful parts, the other principal plays of Knowles
                    are <hi rend="italic">The Hunchback, Love,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Wife.</hi> In some of his own pieces he acted with a just appreciation of the
                    character and with considerable vigour and fire, but he failed in the power of
                    personation. He achieved some success, however, as a lecturer on elocution. In
                    his later years he forsook the stage for the pulpit, and as a Baptist preacher
                    attracted large audiences at Exeter Hall and elsewhere, while he also entered
                    the field of polemical theology, publishing two works,—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pock of Pome,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Idol Demolished by its own
                    Priests,—</hi> in both of which he combated the special doctrines of the Romish
                    Church. Knowles was for some years in the receipt of an annual <pb break="no"
