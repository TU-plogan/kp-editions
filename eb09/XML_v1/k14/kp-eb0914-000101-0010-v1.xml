                    white clay which forms an important ingredient in the manufacture of porcelain,
                    and which is, therefore, known also as <hi rend="italic">china clay.</hi> Large
                    quantities are raised in Cornwall, whence it is frequently termed <hi
                    rend="italic">Cornish clay.</hi> The name <hi rend="italic">kaolin</hi> is slid
                    to be derived from a hill near King-tih-chin, in China, named Kao-ling or “lofty
                    ridge.” The clay from this locality was first sent to Europe, under the name of
                    kaolin, by the Père d’ Eutrecolles, a Jesuit missionary who resided at
                    King-tih-chin in the early part of the last century. A similar white clay was
                    soon afterwards found at Aue, near Schneeberg in Saxony, and was used by
                    Böttcher in the manufacture of porcelain, thus laying the foundation of the
                    factory at Meissen for producing the famous Dresden china. In England kaolin was
                    first detected in Cornwall by William Cookworthy of Plymouth about 1755, a
                    discovery which resulted in the manufacture of hard paste china at Plymouth and
                    Bristol. In Cookworthy’s writings the clay is called “caulin.” Kaolin is found
                    in Nebraska, and in several of the eastern States of the American Union.</p>
                <p>Certain clays, when examined under the microscope, are seen to contain
                    crystalline pearly scales of a mineral which Messrs Johnson and Blake have
                    described as <hi rend="italic">kaolinite (American Journal of Science,</hi> ser.
                    ii. vol. xliii, 1867, p. 351). They regard this crystalline substance as a
                    distinct mineral species, a hydrated silicate of aluminium, forming the basis of
                    pure kaolin. Its composition appears to agree with Forchhammer’s formula for
                    true kaolin, viz., Al <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">

                    J. H. Collins regards the crystalline scales which are associated with the
                    Cornish kaolin, not as kaolinite, but as a white lithia-mica or lepidolite.</p>
                <p>Kaolin is almost invariably a product of the alteration of felspar, and is
                    therefore always found in association with felspathic rocks, usually granite.
                    The china-clay rocks of Cornwall and Devon are simply granites in which the
                    orthoclase-felspar has become decomposed or kaolinized. Such rocks are termed by
                    Mr Collins <hi rend="italic">carclazite,</hi> after the C∙ιrelaze mine, near St
                    Austell, where typical varieties occur. The production of kaolin from felspar is
                    rather difficult to explain, inasmuch as the alteration is sometimes observed
                    under conditions which appear to preclude the operation of atmospheric agencies.
                    It is not simply the effect of water charged with carbonic acid, whereby the
                    felspar might be decomposed and its alkaline silicate removed as a soluble
                    carbonate, while the silicate of aluminium remained behind, in a hydrated
                    condition, as kaolin or china clay. Many chemists have been inclined to
                    attribute the decomposition to the effect of water or watery vapour at a high
                    temperature, charged with hydrofluoric and boric acids. It is certain that
                    minerals containing fluorine and boron—such as fluor spar, lepidolite, and
                    schorl —are common associates of kaolin.</p>
                <p>The localities from which kaolin is obtained in Britain are all situated in
                    Cornwall and Devon; in the former county the workings are principally in the
                    neighbourhood of St Austell, St Stephen’s, and Breague, while in Devon they are
                    situated at Lee Moor and Meavy, on the south of Dartmoor. In working the clay
                    the “overburden” or superficial deposit is first removed, in order to reach the
                    clay-bearing rock. The rock is broken up by the pick, and water is introduced to
                    wash out the clay. A quantity of sand is left behind, and requires to be
                    constantly removed. The water containing the clay in suspension is either pumped
                    to the surface up a shaft, or, if the working be upon a hill-side, is run out at
                    an adit level. This claywater is led into channels called “drags,” where the
                    sand and coarser flakes of mica are deposited. From the drags the liquid passes
                    into another set of channels called “micas,” in which further deposition of
                    suspended matter occurs. Thus purified, the clay-water is conducted into a
                    series of pits and tanks, where the finely-divided particles of clay slowly
                    subside. In the tanks it is allowed to settle until it acquires a thick creamy
                    consistency, when it is transferred to the drying house or “dry.” Formerly the
                    clay was dried naturally by exposure to sun and air, but it is now always
                    artificially dried by means of heated flues, and the preparation of the clay is
                    thus greatly facilitated.</p>
                <p>China clay is not only used in the manufacture of pottery, but is also
                    extensively employed by the papermaker and by the calico-bleacher. It is
                    likewise used to a small extent in the manufacture of alum, artificial
                    ultramarine, and some other chemical products. In 1880 the quantity of china
                    clay raised in Cornwall amounted to 278,572 tons, and in Devon to 25,370
                    tons.</p>
