                    elevated and enclosed valley in the Himalaya mountains, north of the Punjab. It
                    is surrounded by lofty hills, with one opening on the west, by which flows out
                    from the valley the river Jhelum. The enclosing hills on the north and east
                    belong to the Bâra Lâcha chain, and on their outer side is the broad mountainous
                    region which holds the valley of the upper Indus, and which, beyond the Indus,
                    culminates in <pb break="no"

                    On the west and south, the hill boundary, which joins the other half of the
                    enclosure at the south-east end of the valley, is the Panjâl or Panchâl range,
                    which on its outer side sends down its branches southward, through the Jamû
                    territory, to the plains of the Punjab. The length of the Kashmir valley,
                    including the inner slopes of its surrounding hills, is about 120 miles from
                    north-west to south-east. Its greatest width is about 75 miles. The low and
                    comparatively level floor of the basin is 84 miles long and 20 to 24 miles
                    broad. Its lowest part is 5200 feet above the sea, and its mean height 6000
                    feet.</p>
                <p>This valley is but a small portion, in area, of the dominions of the maharâjâ of
                    Kashmir, which, in addition to the Jamû territory on the south (the previous
                    possession of the present maharâjâ’s father, Ghulâb Singh, before he acquired
                    Kashmir), include Baltistân and Gilgit on the north, and Kishtwâr and Lâdâk on
                    the east. On the west Kashmir is separated from the valley of Khagân by a
                    continuous range of high hills, and from the British district of Hazâra by the
                    river Jhelum.</p>
                <p>Jamù, to which Kashmir was annexed in 1846, occupies the southern slopes of the
                    Panjâl range, with a strip of plain country at their foot, and extends about 220
                    miles from east to west, with a greatest direct breadth, north to south, of
                    about 75 miles. All the rest of the maharâjâ’s dominions is hill country.</p>
                <p>The hills forming the northern half-circuit of the Kashmir valley, and running
                    beyond, include many lofty mountain masses and peaks, the most conspicuous of
                    which, a little outside the confines of Kashmir, is Nanga Parbat, a grand hill
                    (35° 15' N., 74° 35' E.), rising 26,629 feet above the sea, with an extensive
                    area of glacier on its eastern face. The great ridge which is thrown off to the
                    south-west by Nanga Parbat rises, at a distance of 12 miles, to another summit
                    20,740 feet in height, from which run south-west and south-east the ridges which
                    are the northern watershed boundary of Kashmir. The former range, after running
                    70 miles south-west, between the valleys of the Kishanganga and the Kunhâr or
                    Nain-sùkh, turns southward, closely pressing the river Jhelum, after it has
                    received the Kishanganga, with a break a few miles further south which admits
                    the Kunhâr. This range presents several prominent summits, the two highest
                    16,487 and 15,544 feet above the sea. The range which runs south-east from the
                    junction peak above-mentioned divides the valley of the Kishanganga from that of
                    the Astor and other tributaries of the Indus. The highest points on this range,
                    where it skirts Kashmir, are 16,795, 16,930, and 17,202 feet above the sea. For
                    a distance of more than 50 miles from Nanga Parbat there are no glaciers on this
                    range; thence eastward they increase; one, near the Zéji-lâ Pass, is only 10,850
                    feet above the sea. The mountains at the east end of the valley, running nearly
                    north and south, drain inwards to the Jhelum, and on the other side to the Ward
                    wân, a tributary of the Chenâb. The highest part of this eastern boundary is
                    14,700 feet. There are no glaciers. The highest point on the Panjâl range, which
                    forms the south and south-west boundary, is 15,523 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>The river Jhelum or Behat (Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">Vitasta)-</hi> the Hydaspes
                    of Greek historians and geographers—flows north-westward through the middle of
                    the valley. After a slow and winding course it expands, about 25 miles below
                    Srinagar, over a slight depression in the plain, and forms the Wιilar lake and
                    marsh, which is of ill-defined extent, but may be called about 10 miles long and
                    6 broad. The hills which this lake touches at its north end give it a more
                    defined margin on that side. Leaving the lake on the south-west side, near the
                    town of S6pιir, the river pursues its sluggish course south-westward, about 18
                    miles, to the gorge at Baramûla. From this point the stream is more rapid
                    through the narrow valley which conducts it westward 75 miles to Muzaffarâbâd,
                    where it turns sharply south, joined by the Kishanganga. At Islâmâbâd, about 40
                    miles above Srinagar, the river is 5400 feet above sealevel, and at Srinagar
                    5235 feet. It has thus a fall of about 4 feet per mile in this part of its
                    course. For the next 24 miles to the Wιilar lake, and thence to Baramûla, its
                    fall is only about 2∣ feet in the mile. On the 80 miles of the river in the flat
                    valley between Islâmâbâd and Baramûla there is much boat traffic; but none below
                    Baramûla, till the river comes out into the plains.</p>
                <p>On the north-east side of this low narrow plain of the Jhelum is a broad hilly
                    tract between which and the higher boundary range runs the Kishanganga river.
                    Near the east end of this interior hilly tract, and connected with the higher
                    range, is one summit 17,839 feet. Around this peak and between the ridges which
                    run from it are many small glaciers. These heights look down on one side into
                    the beautiful valley of the Sind river, and on another into the valley of the
                    Lidar, which join the Jhelum. Among the hills north of Srinagar rises one
                    conspicuous mountain mass, 16,903 feet in height, from which on its north side
                    descend tributaries of the Kishanganga, and on the south the Wangat river, which
                    flows into the Sind. By these rivers and their numerous affluents the whole
                    valley of Kashmir is watered abundantly.</p>
                <p>Around the foot of many spurs of the hills which run down on the Kashmir plain
                    are pieces of low table-land, which are called <hi rend="italic">karéwa.</hi>
                    These terraces vary in height at different parts of the valley from 100 to 300
                    feet above the alluvial plain. Those which are near each other are mostly about
                    the same level, and separated by deep ravines.</p>
                <p>The level plain in the middle of the Kashmir valley is fine clay and sand, with
                    water-worn pebbles. The karéwas consist of horizontal beds of clay and sand, the
                    lacustrine nature of which is shown by the shells which they contain. The hills
                    surrounding the valley are chiefly gneiss and schists. In the Lidar valley are
                    slate and sandstones of the Carboniferous period over green slate of a period
                    corresponding to Silurian. The irregular ridges of the Panjâl range are granite
                    and gneiss, with schists and slates. Limestone is found in parts of the east and
                    west ends of the valley, and in the hills upon the Mânas Bal lake. In various
                    places are marks of glacial action, down to a height of about 500 feet above the
                    level part of the basin. From the plain rise isolated hills of trap; among these
                    are the Hari Parbat and the Takht-i-Sulimân at Srinagar, on the former of which
                    stands the fort, and on the latter a conspicuous and well known ancient Hindu
                    temple. No fossils have been found in Kashmir below the rocks of the
                    Carboniferous period. The chief mineral resources of the maharaja’s dominions
                    are outside the Kashmir valley, specially in Lâdâk.</p>
                <p>In the hills of the north boundary are two passes, the Burzil (13,500 feet) and
                    the Kamri (13,200). By the former is the direct route between Srinagar and
                    Iskardo. It is usually practicable only between 15th July and 15th September.
                    The road from Srinagar to Lé in Lâdâk goes by the Zéji-lâ Pass (11,300 feet),
                    near the north-east corner of the valley. Only a short piece of the road, where
                    snow accumulates, prevents this pass being used all the year. At the south-east
                    end of the valley are three passes, the Murgil (11,600 feet), the Hoksar
                    (13,315), and the Murbul (11,550), all leading over to the valleys of the Chenâb
                    and the Râvi. South of Islâmâbâd, on the direct route to Jamu and Siâlkét, is
                    the Banihâl Pass (9200 feet). Further west on the Panjâl range is the Pir Panjâl
                    or Panchâl Pass (11,400 feet), with a second pass, the Rattan Pir (8200 feet),
                    across a second ridge about 15 miles southwest<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n20/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0020-0011"/> of the other. Between the two passes is the
                    beautifully situated fort of Bâramgali and a well-known resthouse for
                    travellers. This place is in the domain of Raja Méti Singh of Pùnch, cousin and
                    tributary of the maharaja of Kashmir. At Râjâori, south of these passes, the
                    road divides: one line leads to Bhimbar and Gujrât, the other to Jamù and
                    Siâlkôt by Aknùr. Next, south-west of Baramüla, is the Hajji Pir Pass (8500
                    feet), by which crosses the road to Pünch. From Pünch one road leads down to the
                    plains at the town of Jhelum, another eastward through the hills to the Rattan
                    Pir Pass and Râjâori. Lastly there is the river pass of the Jhelum, which is the
                    easy route from the valley westward, having two ways down to the plains, one by
                    Muzaffarâbâd and the Hazâra valley to Hassan Abdâl, the other by the British
                    hill station of Marri (Murree) to Râwal Pindi</p>
                <p>The valley of Kashmir, sheltered from the south-west monsoon by the Panjâl range,
                    has not the periodical rains of India. Its rainfall is irregular, greatest in
                    the spring months. Occasional heavy storms in the monsoon pass over the crests
                    of the Panjâl and give heavy rain on the elevated plateaus on the Kashmir side.
                    And again clouds pass over the valley and are arrested by the higher hills on
                    the north-east side, on which they pour themselves. Snow falls on the
                    surrounding hills at intervals from October to March, and sometimes in great
                    quantity. In the valley the first snow generally falls about the end of
                    December, and never to any great amount. The highest monthly average of
                    temperature from May to October, at Srinagar, is 89° in the shade at noon. There
                    has been no regular winter register; but the temperature is never very low.</p>
                <p>For all crops except rice, which is irrigated, the rain is ordinarily sufficient.
                    Barley, sown in November, ripens in June, wheat in July. Rice, sown in May and
                    June, ripens in October. Millet, maize, and buckwheat, also turnips, pease, and
                    mustard, are grown in considerable quantity.</p>
                <p>There is no natural forest in the level parts of the valley. Of the cultivated
                    trees the finest is the plane <hi rend="italic">(chindr),</hi> which grows to a
                    large size, and is of great beauty. The principal other trees of the valley are
                    the poplar, willow, cypress, walnut, apple, pear, quince, apricot, cherry,
                    mulberry. Vines are grown extensively, commonly trained up poplar trees. There
                    are many kinds of grape. On the hills around are deodar, <hi rend="italic">Pinus
                    excelsa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gerardiana, Piceα Webbiana,</hi> hazel,
                    birch, viburnum, juniper, rose, &lt;tc. The herbaceous plants and flowers are
                    very numerous. The umbelliferous plant called <hi rend="italic">prangos,</hi>
                    growing on the drier hills, is much valued as winter food for sheep. In spring
                    the bright orange-coloured colchicum shows itself in great quantity; and in
                    autumn are seen many acres of saffron with its beautiful light purple flowers,
                    grown in large fields divided into small square beds. Saffron was among the
                    articles of annual tribute to the Mughal emperors. The Dal lake at Srinagar is
                    full of reeds and water plants, <hi rend="italic">Potamogetoη,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nymphaea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Helumbiτιm,</hi> &lt;fcc. On this
                    lake there are floating gardens: a shallow layer of soil on sheets of the great
                    leaves of water lilies is made to grow quantities of vegetables. The curious <hi
                    rend="italic">singhara,</hi> or horned water nut <hi rend="italic">(Trapa
                    bispinosa),</hi> which grows in great quantity in all the lakes, is much used
                    for food, prepared in various ways. Since 1874 hops have been grown
                    experimentally for the Murree Brewery Company, with fair success, in five
                    different parts of the valley.</p>
                <p>Much has been said and written about the beauty of the vale of Kashmir. Spring
                    encircles a fresh, green, smiling valley with a noble belt of glistening
                    snow-capped ridges; autumn fills the eye with the wonderful richness of the
                    many-coloured foliage. At all times flows on the quiet glassy river, showing
                    back the groves and avenues upon its banks, the strange tall shadowy wooden
                    houses, and the craggy hills. There is no place or season which has not
                    something to show of real beauty. The rapturous praises of Mohammedan writers
                    may be often extravagant; and it is with some of their materials, reproduced
                    with more modern additions, that Moore has built up great part of his romance;
                    still few will really think that here extravagance and fiction have left truth
                    much too far behind.</p>
                <p>Many Englishmen every year resort to Kashmir for shooting. The game is in
                    consequence now only to be found within reduced areas of the more secluded
                    little valleys and more difficult hill sides, and many sportsmen now cross over
                    into Lâdâk. The animals chiefly sought in both countries are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ovis ammon, Ovis</hi><hi rend="italic">poli,</hi> antelope, ibex,
                    <hi rend="italic">mar-klιor</hi> or wild goat, musk deer, Tibetan stag, brown
                    and black bear, and leopard. In various parts of Kashmir are to be found the
                    fox, lynx, weasel, marmot, and hare. The black and grey monkey <hi rend="italic"
                    >(langur)</hi> is common on the Panjâl range. Kashmir has the snow pheasant,
                    snow owl, wild goose, duck, and teal; and the eagle is also found.</p>
                <p>The Kashmir valley has a large number of old buildings of the Hindu period,
                    interesting from their style, which is peculiar to Kashmir, and from the traces
                    which many of them bear of Greek art. Their ruinous condition is ascribed partly
                    to Sikandar the idol-breaker, partly to earthquakes, which are frequent in
                    Kashmir. The most ancient of these buildings (about 220 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> is the temple of Shankar Acharya (or, as it was formerly called, of
                    Jaiasht Iswar), on the hill at Srinagar, known as Takht-i-Sulimân, or Solomon’s
                    Throne,—a designation thought to be a Mohammedan adaptation of the name of Râjâ
                    Sandhaman, who repaired or rebuilt the temple. The other Hindu buildings mostly
                    belong to the time from the 5th to the 10th century. The chief points which
                    distinguish them from Hindu buildings in India are the trefoil-headed doorways
                    and recesses, high pediments, high straight-lined pyramidal roofs, and fluted
                    pillars.</p>
                <p>The temple of the sun at Marttand or Matan has been one of the finest. It
                    occupies a very striking position on a karéwa or natural terrace about 3 miles
                    from Islâmâbâd, and commands a splendid view of the valley of the Jhelum. Of the
                    others the most worthy of notice are the remains of two of the four temples at
                    Avantipùr, 15 miles southeast of Srinagar; the temple of Bhûmzo near Marttand,
                    built in a cave; Pâyach, on the karéwa of Naunagar near Avantipùr, a small
                    temple, the whole superstructure built of six stones; Pandrétan, 3 miles
                    south-east of Srinagar, standing with its floor below the water, in a tank;
                    Bhâniâr (Bhawâniâr) and Kutnii, a few miles west of Baramüla, both backed by
                    fine wooded cliffs crowned with deodars. A mound, with masonry in and about it,
                    at the village of Ushkara near Baramüla, is supposed to be the remains of a
                    Buddhist tope <hi rend="italic">(stupa),</hi> the place taking its name from
                    Hushka, one of the Tartar kings of Kashmir.</p>
                <p>Srinagar, the capital (34° 4' 6" N., 74° 48' 5" E.), said to have been founded by
                    Pravara Sén, in the beginning of the 6th century, is built on both banks of the
                    Jheluιn. It is a somewhat confused mass of houses, many of them built of wood,
                    with balconies and carved lattice windows, and projecting upper stories propped
                    on poles, and overhanging the narrow streets or the little canals which in some
                    parts are the streets. The city has seven bridges across the river, built of
                    beams laid on stone and timber piers. In the fort on the south side of the river
                    is the palace. There are several small Hindu temples in the town. The two chief
                    mosques are the Jâmi* mosque and that of Shah Hamadân, the latter one of the
                    most conspicuous buildings, with walls of stone and timber, low sloping wooden
                    roof, and little wooden spire. On the shores of the Dal lake are the old
                    pleasure-gardens of the Mughals.</p>

                <p>The people of Kashmir are now mostly Mohammedan. Physically of fine form, a large
                    proportion of the townpeople are enfeebled by poverty and sedentary occupati
                    &gt;n in close rooms. A few years ago the shawl weavers of Srinagar were
                    reckoned to be about 22 per cent, of the inhabitants. The proportion is now
                    less, owing to the reduced demand for Kashmir shawls, both loom-made and
                    hand-sewn. The maharAjA has endeavoured to meet the depression of the shawl
                    trade by extension of silk manufactures; silk is successfully worked, and well
                    dyed. The chief demand for shawls has generally been from France, and French
                    patterns have somewhat interfered with native art. At IslAmAbAd also many hands
                    are employed in shawl and blanket weaving. A kind of coarse chintz is also made
                    there. Embroidery on fine woollen cloths is the employment of many Kashmiris,
                    both in their own country and in their Indian settlements, Amritsar, Niirpiir,
                    and LudhiAna. The manufacture of a variety of articles in papier mâché and
                    ornamental painted wood-work employs a number of people in Srinagar. The
                    silversmiths do a good deal of business in ornamental vases, goblets,
                    flowerholders, &amp;c., silver and silver gilt. Engraved and embossed copper
                    work employs a smaller number of people; also the manufacture of ornamental
                    vessels of tinned copper, and some other minor kinds of work. A very good kind
                    of paper is made in Kashmir. A museum of Kashmir products and manufactures was
                    established at Srinagar in 1875. The people of the country, with more healthful
                    occupations and surroundings than those of the towns, especially Srinagar, are
                    robust and of active habits. The Kashmiris, both men and women, wear commonly a
                    kind of loose gown with sleeves, called <hi rend="italic">phéran</hi> (Pers.,
                    <hi rend="italic">ραιrdhan,</hi> “a robe”). In cold weather they are in the
                    habit of carrying, under this loose dress, a small portable brazier with heated
                    charcoal. The country people and boatmen use a more close-fitting costume. The
                    mountaineers, like those of neighbouring hill countries, bandage the legs from
                    the knee to the foot for protection in walking.</p>
                <p>According to a report prepared by order of the maharAjA in 1873, the population
                    of the valley at that time was nearly 492,000. Of these about 64,000 were Hindus
                    and the rest Moslems, about 4 per cent, of the latter being Shiites. The
                    estimated population of Jamil was 861,000, of Punch 77,500, of LAdAk, Iskardo,
                    and Gilgit, 104,500; total about 1,535,000 Hindus, 507,000; Moslems, 919,000;
                    Buddhists, 20,000; and “miscellaneous,” 89,000. Of Srinagar the estimated
                    population was about 132,000, of which number nearly 40,000 were Hindus. A great
                    diminution, caused by deaths and emigration, has followed the famine of 1878. It
                    was said that the towns of IslAmAbAd and Sopdr lost nearly two-thirds of their
                    inhabitants. The rice crop of 1879 was abundant, and the rains of the next year
                    seasonable and plentiful. The shawl-weaving and carpet-making trades revived in
                    1880, and numbers of people who had left the country during the famine
                    returned.</p>
                <p>The language of Kashmir (which is spoken only in the valley itself, and in the
                    few outlying settlements of Kashmiris in the neighbouring hills and in northern
                    India) is of the Aryan family. It is allied to the Hindi, Sindi, and Punjâbi,
                    and also to the current Urdιi of India (Hindustani). It uses a form of the
                    Sanskrit character like the NAgari of the Punjab. It may be said to possess no
                    literature, though Kashmir has produced many literary men. The Urdιi is now very
                    generally understood in Kashmir, among the better educated people and more
                    intelligent artisans.</p>
                <p>The chief articles of export from Kashmir are shawls and other woollen fabrics,
                    rice, saffron, fruits. The chief imports are shawl wool, English piece goods,
                    Indian cloths, metals, precious stones, skins, felts, dye-stuffs, tea, <hi
                    rend="italic">charas</hi> (hemp juice), groceries, and salt. The imports into
                    Kashmir from British India are much below those into Jamù, except tea (of which
                    the Kashmiris are extremely fond), indigo, and earthenware. Kashmir imports
                    annually a very large amount of rock salt from the Punjab. The gross annual
                    value of the imports is about £210,000, and of the exports about £172,000. This
                    latter amount is less than formerly, owing chiefly to the reduced demand for
                    shawls. The import duties, which used to be very heavy, were modified in 1864;
                    the duty on piece goods was limited to 8 per cent, and on other imports to 12⅛
                    per cent. In April 1870 a commercial treaty was entered into with the British
                    Government for developing trade with eastern Turkestan, in which, among other
                    things, the maharAjA agreed to abolish all transit duties. Joint commissioners
                    were appointed, on the part of the two Governments, to reside at Leh.</p>
                <p>The gross annual revenue of Kashmir is believed to be about £550,000, and of the
                    maharAjA’s whole territories a little over £800,000. The chief source of income
                    is the land revenue. Of this there is now a cash settlement in place of the
                    annual valuation of crops which was the practice till lately. The Government
                    ordinarily takes one-half the gross produce. Grain is stored in public
                    granaries, and sold at fixed rates to the army and the civil officials. Much
                    grain is also purchased from the zamindArs, and stored by Hindu merchants in
                    Srinagar.</p>
                <p>The maharAjA’s military force numbers 25,600 infantry (including police), 1400
                    cavalry, and 1200 artillery, with 78 field guns and 80 other pieces.</p>
                <p>At Srinagar and elsewhere the maharAjA has established dispensaries, with native
                    medical men educated in India; and he has built at his own cost a large hospital
                    for the medical mission at Srinagar.</p>
                <p>The current rupee of Kashmir, called <hi rend="italic">chilki</hi>
                    (“glittering”), has varied in value at different times from one-half to
                    five-eighths of the rupee of British India. The latest issued bears the latter
                    value.</p>
                <p>The admission of British visitors to Kashmir each season is limited. To military
                    officers, up to a fixed number, permission is granted by the commander·in chief
                    or by the Government of India. Others do not require previous permission, but
                    must intimate their intention of going to Kashmir, and obtain a copy of the
                    rules. In like manner, more than eight centuries ago, as we learn from the
                    Arabic historian Al Birùni, the passes used to be watched, and few outsiders
                    admitted. Connected with this long-cherished exclusiveness has been the general
                    badness of the roads. A really improved road has been made by the present
                    maharAjA from Kohala to Baramιila, the easiest and best entrance to the valley.
                    The author just referred to mentions the covered litters, in which people in
                    Kashmir used to be carried, raised on men’s shoulders. The same conveyances are
                    in use now. To the present day there are no wheeled conveyances in Kashmir. For
                    English visitors four routes are authorized by the Government of India, one by
                    the Pir PanjAl Pass and three by Baramιila,—from Pιinch, from Murree, and from
                    MuzaffarAbAd.</p>
                <p>In the government of his own territories the “maharAjA of Jummoo and Kashmir” is
                    independent. His relations with other states are subject to the supreme
                    authority of the Government of India. The Government of India has no resident at
                    either of the maharAjA’s capitals, but annually an “officer on special duty,” as
                    he is officially termed, is sent to Kashmir during the season from March to
                    November. A native news-writer, employed by the British Government, remains in
                    Kashmir. The annual tribute of the maharAjA, presented in token of the supremacy
                    of the British Government, in accordance with Act X. of the <pb break="no"

                    perfect shawl goats of approved breed (six male and six female), and three pairs

                    nineteen guns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The metrical history of the kings of Kashmir,
                    called <hi rend="italic">RιijΛ Tarangini,</hi> was pronounced by Professor H. H.
                    Wilson (1825) to be the only Sanskrit composition yet discovered to which the
                    title of history can with any propriety be applied. It first became known to the
                    Mohammedans when, on Akbar’s invasion of Kashmir in 1588, a copy was presented
                    to the emperor. A translation into Persian was made by his order, and a summary
                    of its contents, from this Persian translation, is given by Abu’l Fazl in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Â'in-i-Akbari.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Rιijd Tarangini</hi>
                    is a series of four histories. The first of the series, by Pandit Kalhana, was
                    written about the middle of the 12th century. His work, in six books, which
                    bears the name afterwards given to the whole, makes use of earlier writings now
                    lost. Commencing with traditional history of very early times, it comes down to
                    the reign of Sangrama Déva, 1006; and two more books attributed to the same
                    author bring the history to the reign of Singha Déva (called Jai Singh in Abu’l
                    FazΓs summary) about 1156. The second work, called <hi rend="italic">Raja
                    Vali,</hi> by Jιina Raja, takes up the history in continuation of Kalhana’s,
                    and, entering the Mohammedan period, gives an account of the reigns down to that
                    of Zain-ul-âb-ad∙din, 1412. Then follows the <hi rend="italic">Sri Jaina Rdjd
                    Tarangini,</hi> by Pandit Sri Vara, to the accession of Fattah Shah, 1477. And
                    the fourth work, called <hi rend="italic">Rdjd Vali Pataka,</hi> by Prajnia
                    Bhatta, com- ] 4etes the history to the time of the incorporation of Kashmir in
                    the dominions of the Mughal emperor, 1588.</p>
                <p>In the earliest of the four histories it is stated that the valley of Kashmir was
                    formerly a lake, and that it was drained by the great <hi rend="italic"
                    >rishi</hi> or sage, Kasyapa, son of Marichi, son of Brahma, by cutting the gap
                    in the hills at Baramûla (Varaha-mûla). When Kashmir had been drained, he
                    brought in the Brahmans to occupy it. This is still the local tradition, and in
                    the existing physical condition of the country we may see some ground for the
                    story which has taken this form. Bernier suggested that earthquakes may have
                    rent the gorge at Baramûla. Μ. Troyer considers it to have been the work of man,
                    taking advantage of facilities pointed out by nature. It is possible that the
                    river, having at one time flowed with more even fall than at present, may have
                    been choked by land slips at the Baramûla gorge. The Jhelum, stopped at
                    Baramûla, would spread over the low wide valley with very slow and quiet rise,
                    till, overtopping the barrier, the water would escape with a great descent to
                    its old channel, having meantime raised the bed of the lake, by slow
                    accumulation of deposit, to a nearly uniform high level. The name of Kasyapa,
                    however, is by history and tradition connected with the draining of the lake,
                    and the chief town or collection of dwellings in the valley was called
                    Kasyapa-pûr—a name which has been plausibly identified with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kaσπdπυpof</hi> of Hecataeus (Steph. Byz,, <hi rend="italic"
                    >s.v.)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kaστraτυpos</hi> of Herodotus (iii. 102, iv.
                    44). Kashmir is the country meant also by Ptolemy’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kaσπhpm.</hi> The ancient name Kasyapa-pûr was applied to the kingdom of
                    Kashmir when it comprehended great part of the Punjab and extended beyond the
                    Indus. In the 7th century Kashmir is said by the Chinese traveller Hwen Tsang to
                    have included Cabul and the Punjab, and the hill region of Gandhara, the country
                    of the Gandarae of classical geography. Then, under the Mughals, after the
                    annexation of Kashmir to their empire in the end of the 16th century, the name
                    of this newer possession was, for administrative purposes, extended over a much
                    larger area in Afghanistan, to which again it became united; and at one time
                    Ghazni, at another time Cabul, was made the capital of the province of
                    Kashmir.</p>
                <p>At an early date the Sanskrit name of the country became <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kds-mir.</hi> The earliest inhabitants, according to the <hi rend="italic">Rdjd
                    Tarangini,</hi> were the people called Nâga, a word which signifies “snake.” The
                    history shows the prevalence in early times of tree and serpent worship, of
                    which some sculptured stones found in Kashmir still retain the memorials. The
                    town of Islamabad is called also by its ancient name Anant-nag (eternal snake).
                    The source of the Jhelum is at Vir-nag (the powerful snake), &amp;c. The other
                    races mentioned as inhabiting this country and the neighbouring hills are
                    Gandhara, Khasa, and Darada. The Khasa people are supposed to have given the
                    name Kasmir. I n the <hi rend="italic">Mahâbhdrata</hi> the Kas-mira and Darada
                    are named together among the Kshattriya races of northern India. The question
                    whether, in the immigration of the Aryans into India, Kashmir was taken on the
                    way, or entered afterwards by that people after they had reached the Punjab from
                    the north-west, appears to require an answer in favour of the latter view (see
                    vol. it of Dr J. Muir’s <hi rend="italic">Sanskrit Texts).</hi> The Aryan races
                    of Kashmir and surrounding hills, which have at the present time separate
                    geographical distribution, are given by Mr Drew as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kashmiri</hi> (mostly Mohammedan), in the Kashmir basin and a few scattered
                    places outside; <hi rend="italic">Dard</hi> (mostly Mohammedan) in Gilgit and
                    hills north of Kashmir; <hi rend="italic">Dogra</hi> (Hindu) in Jamιi; <hi
                    rend="italic">Dogra</hi> (Mohammedan, called <hi rend="italic">Chibdli)</hi> in
                    Punch and hill country west of Kashmir; <hi rend="italic">Pahàri</hi> or
                    mountaineers (Hindu) in Kishtwar, east of Kashmir, and hills about the valley of
                    the Chenab.</p>
                <p>In the time of As6ka, about 245 B.c., one of the Indian Buddhist missions was
                    sent to Kashmir and Gandhara. After -his death Brahmanism revived. Then in the
                    time of the three Tartar princes, Hushka, Jushka, and Kanishka, who reigned in
                    Kashmir immediately before, and in the beginning of, the Christian era, Buddhism
                    was to a great extent restored. The kingdom of Kanishka (called also Kanerkes)
                    included the Punjab and Cabul as well as Kashmir. Buddhism again declined,
                    though for several centuries the two religions existed together in Kashmir,
                    Hinduism predominating. Yet Kashmir, when Buddhism was gradually losing its
                    hold, continued to send out its Buddhist teachers to other lands. In this
                    Hindu-Buddhist period, and chiefly between the 5th and 10th centuries of our
                    era, were erected the Hindu temples in Kashmir. In the 6th and 7th centuries
                    Kashmir was visited by some of the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims to India. The
                    country is called <hi rend="italic">Shie-mi</hi> iu the narrative of To Yeng and
                    Sung Van (578). One of the, Chinese travellers of the next century was for a
                    time an elephant-tamer to the king of Kashmir. Hwen Tsang spent two years
                    (631-633) in Kashmir <hi rend="italic">(Kia-chi-mi·lo).</hi> He entered by
                    Baramûla and left by the Pir Panjal Pass. He describes the hill-girt valley, and
                    the abundance of flowers and fruits, and he mentions the tradition about the
                    lake. He found in Kashmir many Buddhists as well as Hindus. In the following
                    century the kings of Kashmir appear to have paid homage and tribute to China,
                    though this is not alluded to in the Kashmir history. Hindu kings continued to
                    reign till about 1294, when Udiâna Déva was put to death by his Mohammedan
                    vizier, Amir Shah, who ascended the throne, taking the name of Shams-ud-din. Two
                    Hindus who reigned afterwards for a short time were the last kings of that race
                    in Kashmir. The notices of Kashmir by Marco Polo belong to a time near the close
                    of the Hindu rule, when the people were mostly Hindus and Buddhists.</p>
                <p>Of the Mohammedan rulers mentioned in the second of the Sanskrit histories, one,
                    who reigned about the dose of the 14th century, has made his name prominent by
                    his active opposition to the Hindu religion, and his destruction of the temples.
                    This was Sikandar, known as <hi rend="italic">But-shikan,</hi> or the
                    “idol-breaker.” It iras in bis time that India was invaded by Timur, to whom
                    Sikandar made submission and paid tribute. The country fell into the hands of
                    the Mughals in 1588. In the time of Alamgir it fell to Ahmed Shah Abdâli, on his
                    third invasion of India (1756); and from that time it remained in the hands of
                    Afghans till it was wrested from them by Ranjit Singh, the Sikh monarch of the
                    Punjab, in 1819. Eight Hindu and Sikh governors under Ranjit Singh and his
                    successors were followed by two Mohammedans similarly appointed, the second of
                    whom, Shékh Imam-ud-din, was in charge when the battles of the Sutlej, 1845-46,
                    brought about new relations between the British Government and the Sikhs,
                    involving a change in the government of Kashmir.</p>
                <p>Ghulab Singh, a Dogra Ràjpût, had from a humble position been raised to high
                    office by Ranjit Singh, who conferred on him the small principality of Jamû. On
                    tlιe final defeat of the Sikhs at Sobrâon (February 1846), Ghulab Singh was
                    called to take a leading part in arranging conditions of peace. The treaty of
                    Lahore (March 9, 1846) sets forth that, the British Government having demanded,
                    in addition to a certain assignment of territory, a payment of a crore anda half
                    of rupees (1⅜ millions sterling), and the Sikh Government being unable to pay
                    the whole, the maharaja (Dhalip Singh) cedes, as equivalent for oue crore, the
                    hill country belonging to the Punjab between the Bias and the Indus, including
                    Kashmir and Hazara. The governor-general, Sir Henry Hardinge, considered it
                    expedient to make over Kashmir to the Jamû chief, securing his friendship while
                    the British Government was administering the Punjab on behalf of the young
                    maharaja. Ghulab Singh was well prepared to make up the payment in defect of
                    which Kashmir was ceded to the British; and so,"in consideration of his sendees
                    in restoring peace, his independent sovereignty of the country made over to him
                    was recognized, and he was admitted to a separate treaty. Ghulab Singh had
                    already, after several extensions of territory cast and west of Jamû, conquered
                    Lâdak (a Buddhist country, and till then subject to Lassa), and had then annexed
                    Iskardo, which was under independent Mohammedan rulers. He had thus by degrees
                    half encircled Kashmir, and by this last addition his possessions attained
                    nearly their present form and extent. Ghulab Singh died in 1857, and was
                    succeeded by his son, Ranbir Singh.</p>
