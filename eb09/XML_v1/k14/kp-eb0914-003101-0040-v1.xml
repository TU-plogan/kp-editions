                    (1757-1823), tragedian, was the second child of Roger Kemble, a strolling
                    player, and his wife Sarah Ward, the eldest child being Sarah, known as Mrs
                    Siddons. He was born at Prescot, Lancashire, February 1, 1757. In his eleventh
                    year he became an inmate of Sedgely Park Catholic seminary, near Wolverhampton,
                    and after remaining there four years entered the college of Douai with the view
                    of becoming a priest. At the conclusion of the course, however, he discovered
                    that he had no vocation for the priesthood, and, arriving in England in the end
                    of 1775, he joined the theatrical company of Crump and Chamberlain, his first
                    appearance being in the character of Theodosius at Wolverhampton, 8th January
                    1776. Various stories more or less apocryphal are told of his early hardships,
                    until in 1778 he joined the York company of Wilkinson, where he appeared in
                    Hamlet and other leading parts, besides contributing a drama of his own on the
                    subject of Belisarius. In 1781 he made a decided step in advance, obtaining a
                    “star” engagement in Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, and achieved astonishing
                    success in the <hi rend="italic">Count of</hi><hi rend="italic">Narbonne</hi> by
                    Captain Jephson. Gradually he won for himself a high reputation as a careful and
                    finished actor, and this, combined with the greater fame of his sister Mrs
                    Siddons, led to an engagement in Drury Lane Theatre, where he made his debut
                    30th September 1783, in the part of Hamlet. His appearance was successful, but
                    rather by awakening interest and discussion than enthusiastic approval. His
                    reading of the part, though highly intellectual and elaborated with the most
                    minute care, was stiff and laboured, especially until he acquired the
                    familiarity with the personation obtainable by repetition. In Edward the Black
                    Prince, Richard III., King John, Sir Giles Overreach, and other characters he
                    did not materially advance his reputation. His first decided success was in the
                    character of Macbeth for his own benefit, when he shared in the enthusiasm
                    aroused by Mrs Siddons, and established for himself a reputation among living
                    actors second to hers only. In December 1787 he married Mrs Brereton, the widow
                    of a young actor. His appointment as manager of the theatre in October of the
                    following year gave him full opportunity to experiment with whatever parts might
                    strike his fancy, and of this he took advantage with greater courage than
                    discretion. His smile, as was wittily said, “resembled the plating on a coffin,”
                    and it was only in cases where his gravity gave a certain piquancy to the
                    character that his comedy parts were redeemed from failure, notwithstanding his
                    clever mastery of smart repartee. In Coriolanus, however, which was revived
                    during his first season, the character of the “noble Roman” was so exactly
                    suited to his powers that he not only played it with a perfection that has never
                    been approached, but, it is said, unconsciously allowed its influence to colour
                    his private manner and modes of speech. His tall and imposing person, noble
                    countenance, and solemn and grave demeanour were uniquely adapted for the Roman
                    characters in Shakespeare’s plays; and, when in addition he had to depict the
                    gradual growth and development of one absorbing passion, his representation
                    gathered a momentum and majestic force that were irresistible. His defect was in
                    flexibility, variety, rapidity; the characteristic of his style was method,
                    regularity, precision, elaboration even of the minutest details, founded on a
                    thorough psychological study of the special personality he had to represent. His
                    elocutionary art, lus fine sense of rhythm and emphasis, enabled him to excel in
                    declamation, but physically he was incapable of giving expression to impetuous
                    vehemence and searching pathos. In Coriolanus and Cato he was beyond praise, and
                    possibly he may have been superior to both Garrick and Kean in Macbeth, although
                    it must be remembered that in it part of his inspiration must have been caught
                    from Mrs Siddons. In all the other great Shakespearean characters he was,
                    according to the best critics, inferior to them, least so in Lear and Hamlet,
                    and most so in Shy lock and Richard III. On account of the eccentricities of
                    Sheridan, the proprietor of Drury Lane Theatre, Kemble withdrew from the
                    management, and, although he resumed his duties at the beginning of the season
                    1800-1, he at the close of 1802 finally resigned connexion with it. In 1803 he
                    became manager of Covent Garden, of which he was also part proprietor. The
                    theatre was burned down in 1808, and the raising of the prices after the opening
                    of the new theatre in 1809 led to a persevering succession of riots, which
                    practically suspended the performances for three months. Kemble took his final
                    leave of the stage in the part of Coriolanus, June 23, 1817, his retirement
                    being probably hastened by the increasing popularity of Kean. The remaining
                    years of his life were spent chiefly abroad, first at Toulouse, and after a
                    short stay in London at Lausanne, where he died February 20, 1823.</p>
