                    rend="smallcaps">Kryloff, Ivan Andreevitch</hi></label> (1768-1844), the great
                    national fabulist of Russia, was born February 14, 1768, at Moscow, but his
                    early years were spent at Orenburg and Tver. His father, a distinguished
                    military officer, died in 1779; and young Kriloff was left with no richer
                    patrimony than a chest of old books, to be brought up by the exertions of an
                    heroic mother. In the course of a few years his mother removed to St Petersburg,
                    in the hope of securing a Government pension; and there Kriloff obtained a post
                    in the civil service, but he gave it up immediately after his mother’s death in
                    1788. Already in 1783 he had sold to a bookseller a comedy of his own
                    composition, and by this means had procured for himself the works of Molière,
                    Racine, Boileau; and now, probably under the influence of these writers, he
                    produced <hi rend="italic">Philomela</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi>
                    which gave him access to the dramatic circle of Knyazhin. Several attempts he
                    made to start a literary magazine followed each other with little success; but,
                    along with his plays, they served to make the author known to the polite society
                    of the capital. For about four years (1797-1801) Kriloff lived at the country
                    seats of the prince Sergius Galitzin, and when the prince was appointed military
                    governor of Livonia he accompanied him as official secretary. About the years
                    which follow his resignation of this post very doubtful information has been
                    preserved, the common opinion being that he wandered from town to town under the
                    influence of a passion for card-playing. Before long he found his place as a
                    fabulist, the first collection of his <hi rend="italic">Fables,</hi>
                    twenty-three in number, appearing in 1809. From 1812 to 1841 he held a congenial
                    appointment in the Imperial Public Library—first as assistant, and then as head
                    of the Russian books department. His death took place November 21, 1844. His
                    statue in the Summer Garden is one of the finest monuments in St Petersburg.</p>
                <p>Kriloff ’ s success as a fabulist was as rapid as it has been enduring. Honours
                    were showered upon him while he yet lived: the Academy of Sciences admitted him
                    a member in 1811, and bestowed upon him the same gold medal which was accorded
                    to Karamzin for his <hi rend="italic">History of the Russian People·,</hi> in
                    1838 a great festival was held under imperial sanction to celebrate the jubilee
                    of his first appearance as an author; and the emperor assigned him a handsome
                    pension. Before his death about 77,000 copies of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fables</hi> had found sale in Russia; and his wisdom and humour had become the
                    common possession of the many. Nor is the reason far to seek. He was at once
                    poet and sage. In spite of a superficial indifference to political matters, he
                    observed everything with keen and collected interest. His fables for the most
                    part struck root in some actual event, and they told at once by their grip and
                    by their beauty. Though he began as a translator and imitator, he soon showed
                    himself a master of invention, who found abundant material in the life of his
                    native land. To the Russian ear his verse is of matchless quality; while word
                    and phrase are direct, simple, and eminently idiomatic, colour and cadence vary
                    with the theme. This perfection was the result of sustained elaboration, for,
                    though physically indolent, Kriloff was a hard intellectual worker, and had an
                    infinite faculty of taking pains. Of his carelessness in dress, absence of mind,
                    and general irreverence towards etiquette, the stories told are many.</p>
                <p>A collected edition of Kriloff’s works appeared at St Petersburg, 1844. Of the
                    numerous editions of his <hi rend="italic">Fables,</hi> which have been often
                    translated, may be mentioned that illustrated by Trutovski, 1872. The author’s
                    life has been written in Russian by Pletneff, by Lebanoff, and by Grot, <hi
                    rend="italic">Liter, zhizη Kruilοva.</hi> “Materials” for his life are published
                    in vol. vi. of the <hi rend="italic">Sbοrnik Statei</hi> of the literary
                    department of the Academy of Sciences. W. R. S. Ralston has prefixed an
                    excellent sketch to his English prose version of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fables,</hi> 1868, 2d ed. 1871.</p>
