                    Chozars, as <hi rend="italic">Ά,κάτζιροι</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Xaζapoc</hi>
                    in Byzantine writers, as Khazirs in Armenian and Khwalisses in Russian
                    chronicles, Ugri Bielii in Nestor, and Kosa (?) in Chinese, occupied a prominent
                    place amongst the secondary powers of the Byzantine state-system. In the epic of
                    Firdousi “Khazar” is the representative name for all the northern foes of
                    Persia, and legendary invasions long before the Christian era are vaguely
                    attributed to them. But the Khazars are an historic figure upon the borderland
                    of Europe and Asia for at least nine hundred years (190-1100 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a,d.).</hi> The three hundred and fifty years 600-950 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> mark the epoch of their greatness, but their rise can
                    be traced for four centuries before, and their decline for one hundred and fifty
                    years to follow. Their home was in the spurs of the Caucasus and along the
                    shores of the Caspian—the “sea of the Khazars”; and their cities, all of them
                    populous and civilized commercial centres, were <hi rend="italic">Itil,</hi> the
                    capital, upon the delta of the Volga, the “river of the Khazars,” <hi

                    towards Armenia, and <hi rend="italic">Sarkel</hi> on the Don. They were the
                    Venetians of the Caspian and the Euxine, the organizers of the transit between
                    the two basins, the universal carriers between East and West; and Itil was the
                    meeting-place of the commerce of Persia, of Byzantium, of Armenia, of Russia,
                    and of the Bulgarians of the middle Volga. The tide of their dominion ebbed and
                    flowed repeatedly during their history, but the normal Khazaria may be taken as
                    the territory included between the Caucasus, the Volga, and the Don, with the
                    outlying province of the Crimea or “Little Khazaria.” The southern boundary
                    never greatly altered; it did at times reach the Cyrus and the Araxes, but on
                    that side the Khazars were confronted by the great powers of Byzantium and
                    Persia, and were for the most part restrained within the passes of the Caucasus
                    by the fortifications of Dariel. Amongst the nomadic Ugrians and agricultural
                    Slavs of the north their frontier fluctuated widely, and in its zenith Khazaria
                    extended from the Dnieper to Bolgari upon the middle Volga, and along the
                    eastern shore of the Caspian to Asterabad.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ethnology. —</hi> Few points have been more disputed than the
                    origin of this interesting people; and there is still no consent amongst
                    authorities upon the subject. They are assigned to the Turkish stock by Latham
                    and Howorth, to the Ugrian by Klaproth and Vivien St Martin, and have even been
                    claimed as Jews on account of their use of the Hebrew character and the
                    profession of the Hebrew faith amongst them. But their geographical position,
                    their history, and the contemporary witness we have as to their physical
                    character, their language, and their own national tradition, may be accepted as
                    conclusive proof that the Khazars were an indigenous people of the Caucasus, and
                    near akin to the Armenians and the Georgians.</p>
                <p>Their king Joseph, in answer to the inquiry of the Rabbi Chasdai Ibn-Shafrût of
                    Cordova <hi rend="italic">{circ.</hi> 958) stated that his people sprang from
                    Thogarmah, grandson of Japhet, and the supposed ancestor of the other peoples of
                    the Caucasus. The Arab geographers who knew the Khazars best connect them either
                    with the Georgians (Ibn el Athir) or with the Armenians (Dimishqy, ed. Mehren,
                    p. 263); whilst Ahmed ibn Fadlan, who passed through Khazaria on a mission from
                    the caliph Moktadir (921 A.D.), positively asserts that the Khazar tongue
                    differed not only from the Turkish, but from that of the bordering nations,
                    which were Ugrian.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless there are many points connected with the Khazars which indicate a
                    close connexion with Ugrian or Turkish peoples. The official titles recorded by
                    Ibn Fadlan are those in use amongst the Tartar nations of that age, whether
                    Huns, Bulgarians, Turks, or Mongols. The names of their cities can be explained
                    only by reference to Turkish or Ugrian dialects (Klaproth, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mérn. sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les Khazars;</hi> Howorth, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khazars'}.</hi> Some too amongst the mediaeval authorities (Ibn Haukal and
                    Is(akhry) note a resemblance between the speech in use amongst the Khazars and
                    the Bulgarians; and the modern Magyar—a Ugrian dialect—can be traced back to a
                    tribe which in the 9th century formed part of the Khazar kingdom. These
                    characteristics, however, are accounted for by the fact that the Khazars were at
                    one time subject to the Huns (448 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.t&gt;.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">seq.),</hi> at another to the Turks <hi
                    rend="italic">(pire.</hi> 580), which would sufficiently explain the signs of
                    Tartar influence in their polity, and also by the testimony of all observers,
                    Greeks, Arabs, and Russians, that there was a double strain within the Khazar
                    nation. There were <hi rend="italic">Khazars</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kara</hi> (black) <hi rend="italic">Khazars.</hi> The “Khazars” were
                    fair-skinned, black-haired, and of a remarkable beauty and stature; their women
                    indeed were sought as wives equally at Byzantium and Baghdad; while the ‘ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> Kara Khazars” were ugly, short, and were reported by
                    the Arabs almost as dark as Indians. The latter were indubitably the Ugrian
                    nomads of the steppe, akin to the Tartar invaders of Europe, Huns, Bulgarians,
                    and Hungarians, who filled the armies and convoyed the caravans of the ruling
                    caste. But the Khazars proper were a civic commercial people, the founders of
                    cities, remarkable for somewhat elaborate political institutions, for
                    persistence, and for good faith— all qualities foreign to the Hunnic
                    character.</p>
                <p>They are identified with good reason (by Zeuss, V. St Martin, Howorth, Latham)
                    with the <hi rend="italic">’Ακάτζιροι</hi> (perhaps Ak-Khazari, “White Khazars”)
                    who appear upon the lower Volga in the Byzantine annals, and thence they have
                    been deduced, though with less convincing proof, either from the <hi

                    rend="italic">Kaτlaρoι</hi> of Herodotus, iv. 104 (Latham, V. St Martin). There
                    was throughout historic times a close connexion which eventually amounted to
                    political identity between the Khazars and the Barsileens (the Passils of Moses
                    of Chorene) who occupied the delta of the Volga; and the Barsileens can be
                    traced through the pages of Ptolemy <hi rend="italic">{Gcog.,</hi> v. 9), of
                    Pliny (iv. 26), of Strabo (vii. p. 306), and of Pomponius Mela (ii. c. 1, p.
                    119) to the so-called Royal Scyths, <hi rend="italic">'S.κiGaι βaσιλτjes,</hi>
                    who were known to the Greek colonies upon the Euxine, and whose political
                    superiority and commercial enterprise led to this rendering of their name. Such
                    points, h wever, need not here be further pursued than to establish the presence
                    of this white race (“La Race Blonde” of Klaproth) around the Caspian and the
                    Euxine throughout historic times. They appear in European history as White Huns
                    (Ephthalites), White Ugrians (Sar-ogours), White Bulgarians. They λvere the
                    carriers between Europe and the farthest East. Owing to climatic causes (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Asia)</hi> the tract they occupied was slowly drying up. They
                    were the outposts of civilization towards the encroaching desert, and the Tartar
                    nomadism that advanced with it. They held in precarious subjection the hordes
                    whom the conditions of the climate and the soil made it impossible to supplant.
                    They bore the brunt of each of the great waves of Tartar conquests, and were
                    eventually overwhelmed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> From out of the mass of this white race of the
                    steppe the Khazars can be first historically distinguished at the end of the 2d
                    century of our era. They burst into Armenia with the Barsileens, 198 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> They were repulsed and attacked in turn, but
                    thenceforth Khazar wars occupy a prominent place in the Armenian annals for
                    eight hundred years. The pressure of the nomads of the steppe, the quest of
                    plunder or revenge, these seem the only motives of these early expeditions; but
                    in the long struggle between the Roman and Persian empires, of which Armenia was
                    not seldom the battlefield, and eventually the prize, the attitude of this
                    powerful people of the Caucasus assumed political importance. Armenia inclined
                    to the civilization and ere long to the Christianity of Rome, whilst her Arsacid
                    princes maintained an inveterate feud with the Sassanids of Persia. It became
                    therefore the policy’ of the Persian kings to call in the Khazars to neutralize
                    or to chastize the efforts of the Armenians in every collision with the empire
                    (200-350). During the 4th century, however, the growing power of Persia
                    culminated in the annexation of eastern Armenia. The Khazars, endangered by so
                    powerful a neighbour, passed from under Persian influence into that remote
                    alliance with Byzantium which thenceforth characterized their policy, and they
                    aided Julian in his invasion of Persia (363). Simultaneously with the approach
                    of Persia to the Caucasus the terrible empire of the Huns sprang up among the
                    Ugrians of the northern steppes. The Khazars straitened on every side remained
                    passive till the danger culminated in the accession of Attila (434). The emperor
                    Theodosius, with reason terrified for civilization, sent envoys to bribe the
                    Khazars <hi rend="italic">tjhκaτζιpoι}</hi> to divert the Huns from the empire
                    by an attack upon their <pb break="no"

                    Khazar chiefs. The design was betrayed to Attila; and he extinguished the
                    independence of the nation in a moment. Khazaria became the appanage of his
                    eldest son, and the centre of government amongst the eastern subjects of the Hun
                    (448). Even the iron rule of Attila was preferable to the time of anarchy that
                    succeeded it. Upon his death (454) the wild immigration which he had aιτested
                    revived. The Khazars and the Sarogours <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> White
                    Ogors, possibly the Barsileeusof the Volga delta) were swept along in a flood of
                    mixed Tartar peoples which the conquests of the Jouan Jouan (the Avars) had set
                    in motion. The Khazars and their companions broke through the Persian defences
                    of the Caucasus. They appropriated the territory up to the Cyrus and the Araxes,
                    and roamed at large through Iberia, Georgia, and Armenia. The Persian king,
                    deeming the floodgates of the steppes opened, implored the emperor Leo I. to
                    help him defend Asia Minor at the Caucasus (457), but Rome was herself too hard
                    pressed, nor was it for fifty years that the Khazars were driven back, and the
                    pass of Derbend fortified against them <hi rend="italic">(tire.</hi> 507).</p>
                <p>Throughout the 6th century Khazaria was the mere highway for the wild hordes to
                    whom the Huns had opened the passage into Europe, and the Khazars took refuge
                    (like the Venetians from Attila) amongst the seventy mouths of the Volga· The
                    rise of the first Turk empire in Asia (554) precipitated the Avars upon the
                    West. The conquering Turks followed in their footsteps (560-580). They beat down
                    all opposition, wrested even Bosphorus in the Crimea from the empire, and by the
                    annihilation of the Ephthalites completed the ruin of the White Race of the
                    plains from the Oxus to the Don. The empires of Turks and Avars, however, ran
                    swiftly their barbaric course, and the Khazars arose out of the chaos to more
                    than their ancient renown. They issued from the land of Barsilia, and extended
                    their rule over the Bulgarian hordes left masterless by the Turks, compelling
                    the more stubborn to migrate to the Danube (641). The agricultural Slavs of the
                    Dnieper and the Oka were reduced to tribute, and before the end of the 7th
                    century the Khazars had annexed also the Crimea, had won complete command of the
                    Sea of Azoff, and, seizing upon the narrow neck which separates the Volga from
                    the Don, had organized the portage which has continued since an important link
                    in the traffic between Asia and Europe. The alliance with Byzantium was revived.
                    Simultaneously and, we cannot doubt, in concert with the Byzantine campaign
                    against Persia (589), the Khazars had reappeared in Armenia, though it was not
                    till 625 that this people, long known to Persians and Armenians as Khazirs and
                    to the Romans as Akatzirs, take their place as Khazars in the Byzantine annals.
                    They are then described as “Turks from the East,” a powerful nation which held
                    the coasts of the Caspian and the Euxine, and took tribute of the Viatitsh, the
                    Severians, and the Polyane. The khakan, enticed by the promise of an imperial
                    princess, furnished Heraclius with 40,000 men for his Persian war, who shared in
                    the victory over Chosroes at Nineveh.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile a power had arisen which transformed the whole course of Eastern
                    politics and committed the Khazars to a struggle for life which lasted two
                    hundred years. Mohammed had proclaimed his faith, and the Saracens were
                    advancing to enforce it. The Persian empire was struck down (637), and the
                    Moslems poured into Armenia. The khakan had defied the summons sent him by the
                    invaders, and he now aided the Byzantine patrician in the defence of Armenia.
                    The allies were defeated; and ere long the Moslems undertook the subjugation of
                    Khazaria (651). It was the beginning of eighty years of ceaseless, obstinate,
                    ineffectual warfare. Ten great invasions of Khazaria through the pass of Derbend
                    are recorded, and many a retributive raid upon the Moslems; but in the end their
                    fanaticism and enormous superiority in numbers prevailed. The khakan and his
                    chieftains were captured and compelled to embrace Islam (737), and till the
                    decay of the Mohammedan empire Khazaria with all the other countries of the
                    Caucasus paid an annual tribute of children and of com (737-861). Nevertheless,
                    though overpowered in the end, the Khazars had protected the plains of Europe
                    from the Mohammedans, and made the Caucasus the limit of their conquests.</p>
                <p>In the interval between the decline of the Mohammedan empire and the rise of
                    Russia the Khazars reached the zenith of their power. The merchants of
                    Byzantium, Armenia, and Baghdad met in the markets of Itil (whither since the
                    raids of the Mohammedans the capital had been transferred from Semender), and
                    traded for the wax, furs, leather, and honey that came down the Volga. So
                    important was this traffic held at Constantinople that, when the portage to the
                    Don was endangered by the irruption of a fresh horde of Turks (the Petchenegs),
                    the emperor Theophilus himself despatched the materials and the workmen to build
                    for the Khazars a fortress impregnable to their forays (834). Famous as the one
                    stone structure is in that stoneless region, the post became known far and wide
                    amongst the hordes of the steppe as Sar-kel or the White Abode. Merchants from
                    every nation found protection, justice, and perfect good faith in the Khazar
                    cities. The Jews, expelled from Constantinople, sought a home amongst them,
                    developed the Khazar trade, and contended with Mohammedans and Christians for
                    the theological allegiance of the pagan people. The dynasty accepted Judaism <hi
                    rend="italic">(tire.</hi> 740), but there was equal tolerance for all, and each
                    man was held amenable to the authorized code and to the official judges of the
                    faith which he professed. At the Byzantine court the khakan was held in high
                    honour. The emperor Justinian Rhinotmetus took refuge with him during his exile
                    and married his daughter, 702. Justinian’s rival Bardants in turn sought an
                    asylum in Khazaria, and in Leo IV. (775) the grandson of a Khazar sovereign
                    ascended the Byzantine throne. Khazar troops were amongst the bodyguard of the
                    imperial court; they fought for Leo VI. against Simon of Bulgaria (888); and the
                    khakan was honoured in diplomatic intercourse with the seal of three solidi,
                    which marked him as a potentate of the first rank, above even the pope and the
                    Carlovingian monarchs. Indeed his dominion became an object of uneasiness to the
                    jealous statecraft of Byzantium, and Constantine Porphyrogenitus, writing for
                    his son’s instruction in the government, carefully enumerates the Alans, the
                    Petchenegs, the Uzes, and the Bulgarians as the forces he must rely on to
                    restrain it.</p>
                <p>It was, however, from a power that Constantine did not consider that the
                    overthrow of the Khazars came. Long before, when a band of Slav prisoners was
                    brought into the Khazar camp, a sage had prophesied—“These men’s swords have two
                    edges; ours have but one. We conquer now; but some day they will conquer us.”
                    The arrival of the Varangians amidst the scattered Slavs (862) ha∣l now united
                    them into a nation and launched them upon that career of conquest which within a
                    hundred years carried the Russian arms to the Balkans and the Caucasus. The
                    advance of the Petchenegs from the East gave the Russians their opportunity.
                    Before the onset of those fierce invaders the precarious suzerainty of the
                    khakan broke up. By calling in the Uzes, the Khazars did indeed dislodge the
                    Petchenegs from the position they had seized in the heart of the kingdom between
                    the Volga and the Don, but only to drive them inwards to the Dnieper. The
                    Hungarians, severed from their kindred and their rulers, migrated to the
                    Carpathians, whilst Oleg, the Russ prince of Kieff, passed through the Slav
                    tribes of the Dnieper basin with the cry “Pay nothing to the Khazars” (884). The
                    kingdom dwindled rapidly to its ancient limits between the Caucasus, the Volga,
                    and the Don, whilst the Russian traders of Novgorod and Kietf supplanted the
                    Khazars as the carriers between Constantinople and the north. When Ibn Fadlan
                    visited Khazaria forty years later, Itil was even yet a great city, with baths
                    and market-places and thirty mosques. But there was no domestic product nor
                    manufacture; the kingdom depended solely upon the now precarious transit dues;
                    and the king or great khakan was a <hi rend="italic">roi fainéant</hi> hidden
                    from the sight of men, the actual administration being in the hands of a major
                    domus also called khakan. At the assault of Swiatoslav of Kieff the rotten
                    fabric crumbled into dust. His troops were equally at home on land and water.
                    Sarkel, Itil, and Semender surrendered to him (965-969). He pushed his conquests
                    to the Caucasus, and established Russian colonies upon the Sea of Azoff. The
                    principality of Tmoutorakan, founded by his grandson Mstislav (988), replaced
                    the kingdom of Khazaria, the last trace of which was extinguished by a joint
                    expedition of Russians and Byzantines (1016). The last of the khakans, George
                    Tzula, was taken prisoner. A remnant of the nation took refuge in an island of
                    the Caspian (Siahcouyé); others retired to the Caucasus; part emigrated to the
                    district of Kasakhi in Georgia, and appear for the last time joining with
                    Georgia in her successful effort to throw off the yoke of the Seljuk Turks
                    (1089). But the name is thought to survive in “Kadzaria,” the Georgian title for
                    Mingrelia, and in ‘ ’ Kadzaro,” the Turkish word for the Lazes. Till the 13th
                    century the Crimea was known to European travellers as “Gazaria”; the “ramparts
                    of the Khazars” are still distinguished in the Ukraine; and the record of their
                    dominion survives in the names of Kazarek, Kazaritshi, Kazarinovod, Kozar-owka,
                    Kozari, and Kazan (Schafarik, ii. 65).</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0072-0061"/> K H ELAT, the capital of Baluchistan, and the
                    residence of the reigning khan, is situated, at an elevation of 6800 feet above
                    the sea, in 29° N. lat., and 66° 40' E. long., in a narrow valley, which is
                    bounded to the east by the mountain ranges extending to the province of Cutch
                    Gundava; to the west is the Sha Mirdan, on the northern slope of which hill the
                    town is built; to the south the valley is closed by low hills, while to the
                    north it is of sufficient breadth to allow space for two or three small
                    villages. Through the centre of this valley runs a mountain torrent, which is
                    generally dry, but after heavy rain pours down a considerable body of water. The
                    town is surrounded by a mud wall about 30 feet in height, which is pierced by
                    three gateways. The houses are built of mud, and number from three to four
                    hundred; the streets are narrow and tortuous; it possesses a tolerably well
                    supplied bazaar. A miri or citadel, having an imposing appearance, dominates the
                    town, and contains within its walls the palace of the khan. It was in an upper
                    room of this residence that Merab Khan, then ruler of Baluchistan, was killed
                    during the storming of the town and citadel by the British troops at the close
                    of the first Afghan war in 1839. The suburbs of Khelat are comparatively
                    extensive, and contain from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, which number, however,
                    fluctuates according to the season, as well as with the political events passing
                    in the country. There are to be found both in the town and suburbs residents
                    representing many of the countries of Asia, viz., Hindus, Brahoes, Dehwars,
                    Babé, Afghans, Persians, and Baluchis. The Hindu community forms the principal
                    trading class, a fair proportion of which, however, includes the Babé tribe,
                    while agriculture is almost entirely in the hands of the Dehwar tribe. The town
                    is well supplied with excellent water, principally from a spring situated in the
                    eastern side of the valley; this water is also used for irrigating the numerous
                    enclosed gardens studded about, in which are grown most of the fruit trees to be
                    found in European climates, including the vine, apricot, apple, and mulberry;
                    vegetables of all descriptions thrive to perfection. The climate of Khelat is
                    peculiarly dry and pure, nor is there heat during the summer months that can be
                    called oppressive. The citadel, although offering an imposing appearance, has in
                    reality no military value, and could offer no resistance to the artillery in use
                    at the present day. It is quite impossible to give an idea of the period of the
                    building of Khelat, though there can be no doubt that it is of very ancient
                    origin, long prior to the Mohammedan era; but, as political events have now
                    brought England into close friendly relations with the Baluch state, we may look
                    forward to the unravelling of many traditions which now surround and obscure the
                    history of Baluchistan and its capital.</p>
