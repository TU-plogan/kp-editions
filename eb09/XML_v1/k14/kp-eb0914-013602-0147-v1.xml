                <p><label type="entry">KOLÁBA</label>, a district of the Bombay Presidency, India,
                    lying between 17° 52' and 18° 50' N. lat., and between 73° 7' and 73° 42' E.
                    long. It is bounded on the N. by Bombay harbour and Tliâni district, on the E.
                    by Γoona and Sâtâra, on the S. by Ratnâgiri and Janjira state, and on the W. by
                    the Arabian Sea. Lying between the Sihyâdri range and the sea, Kolâba district
                    abounds in hills, some being spurs of considerable regularity and height,
                    running at right angles to the main range, whilst others are isolated peaks or
                    lofty detached ridges. The sea frontage, of about 20 miles, is throughout the
                    greater part of its length fringed by a belt of cocoa-nut and betel-nut palms.
                    Behind this belt lies a stretch of flat country devoted to rice cultivation. In
                    many places along the banks of the salt-water creeks there are extensive tracts
                    of salt marsh land, some of them reclaimed, some still subject to tidal
                    inundation, and others set apart for the manufacture of salt. The district is
                    traversed by a few small streams. Tidal inlets, of which the principal are the
                    Nâgothna on the north, the Roha or Chaul in the west, and the Bânkot creek in
                    the south, run inland for 30 or 40 miles, forming highways for a brisk trade in
                    rice, salt, firewood, and dried fish. Near the coast especially, the district is
                    well supplied with reservoirs. The Sahyâdri ringe has two remarkable
                    peaks,—Ràigarli, where Sivaji built his capital, and Miradongar. There are
                    extensive teak and black wool forests, of which the value is increased by their
                    proximity to Bombay. The Kolâba teak has been pronounced the best grown in the
                    Concan, and inferior only to that of Calicut. In 1875-76 the forest revenue
                    amounted to £3634. Tigers and leopards are found all over the district, and
                    bears on the Sahyâdri range. Hyaenas and jackals abound. Bison, <hi

                    dominions of the peshwa, annexed by the Bombay Government in 1818. Alibâgh
                    lapsed to the paramount power in 1839.</p>
                <p>The population in 1872 was 350,405—Hindus, 330,914; Mohammedans, 17,194; Parsis,
                    25; Jews, 1940; and Christians, 208. Of the Hindus the most important class are
                    the Brahmans, who own large gardens and palm groves along the coast. Another
                    important class are the Bhandaras, or toddy-drawers and cocoa-nut cultivators.
                    The Beni-Israel (see vol. xiii. p. 685) are chiefly found in the seaboard
                    tracts. A considerable number of them enlist in the native army, and are highly
                    esteemed as soldiers. They also monopolize the work of oil-pressing to so great
                    an extent that they are generally known as oilmen or <hi rend="italic"

                    returned at 468,646 acres, of which upwards of 98 per cent, was taken up for
                    cultivation. Rice forms the staple produce, and is the chief export of the
                    district. The inferior grains are <hi rend="italic">nachni</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    people. The estimated value of the exports (rice, salt, timber, vegetables, and
                    fruit) is £438,249; of the imports (grain, piece goods, oil, butter, and sugar),
                    £170,816. The local industries are salt manufacture and silk-weaving. The total
                    imperial, local, and municipal revenue in 1876-77 was £106,893, of which £72,462
                    was contributed by the land tax. There are seventy-one Government or aided
                    schools attended by 3644 pupils. The average annual rainfall is 75 inches. The
                    chief town of the district is Alibâgh.</p>
