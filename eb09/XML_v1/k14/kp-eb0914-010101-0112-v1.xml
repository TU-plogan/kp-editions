                    Kisfaludy, whom he excels as a lyric poet though not as a dramatist, was born on
                    the 27th of September 1772 at Sümeg in the county of Zala, Hungary. Choosing the
                    career of a soldier, he entered the army in 1793, and was soon appointed to a
                    lieutenancy in the Hungarian life guards at Vienna. There he employed his spare
                    time in literary pursuits, and especially in the study of Italian poets. Upon
                    the death of his patron Prince Anton Eszterhâzy, Kisfaludy was sent back to
                    Hungary. Soon after this, at a vintage festival in Badacsony, he made the
                    acquaintance of Rozalia Szegedy, whom, notwithstanding a subsequent long
                    estrangement, he eventu ally married, and who under the name of Liza is the
                    subject of his <hi rend="italic">Himfy.</hi> During the Italian campaign of 1796
                    Kisfaludy was stationed at Milan, and upon the surrender of that city he was
                    sent as a prisoner of war to Vaucluse, where he began to write the series of
                    love sonnets for which he afterwards became so famous, and which were suggested
                    to his mind by the songs of Petrarch. After his release at the peace of Campo
                    Formio (17th October 1797), Kisfaludy was posted as captain in a regiment
                    quartered at Würtemberg, and in 1799 he took part in the battles of Stockach,
                    Winterthur, and Zürich. In 1800 he left the army, and stayed for five years at
                    Kâm in the county of Vas, subsequently removing to his native place Sümeg, where
                    he devoted himself to agricultural and literary pursuits. By this time Kisfaludy
                    had gained the highest reputation as a lyric poet by his <hi rend="italic">Loves
                    of Himfy,</hi> the first part of which, published anonymously at Buda in 1801,
                    was received with such applause as had never before been accorded to any Magyar
                    work. The second part appeared under his own name in 1807. On the “insurrectio,”
                    or general rising of the Hungarian nobles against Napoleon, in 1809, Kisfaludy
                    accepted the post of major of cavalry, and was also nominated by the palatine
                    one of his adjutants. After his return to private life Kisfaludy wrote several
                    dramatic pieces, and from 1820 contributed largely to his brother’s annual <hi
                    rend="italic">Aurora.</hi> In 1818 he gained the Marczibânyi prize for his <hi
                    rend="italic">Ballads</hi> (2d edition, Buda, 1818), which work was translated
                    into German by Gaal (Vienna, 1820); and in 1831 he was elected member of the
                    Hungarian academy of sciences, in the formation of which he had taken an active
                    part. He died on the 28th of October 1844, at the age of seventy-two. His
                    collective works, in 6 vols., were published at Pest in 1847 by Toldy. Exquisite
                    metrical English renderings of several verses from the <hi rend="italic"
