                    credit, for he said it seemed “to approach more nearly to the Struthious and
                    Gallinaceous tribes than to any other.” And his credit is still greater when we
                    find the venerable Latham, who is said to have examined the specimen with Shaw,
                    placing it some years later among the Penguins <hi rend="italic">(Gen. Hist.
                    Birds, X.</hi> p. 394), being apparently led to that conclusion through its
                    functionless wings and the backward situation of its legs. In this false
                    allocation Stephens also in 1826 acquiesced <hi rend="italic">(Gen.
                    Zoology,</hi> xiii. p. 70). Meanwhile in 1820 Temminck, who had never seen a

                    Lord Derby sent his unique specimen for exhibition at a meeting of the
                    Zoological Society, 12th February 1833 <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool.

                    beyoud cavil, and the author called upon all interested in zoology to aid in
                    further research as to this singular form. In consequence of this appeal a
                    legless skin was within two years sent to the society <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Proceedings,</hi> 1835, p. 61) obtained by Mr W. Yate of Waimate, who said it
                    was the second he had seen, and that he had kept the bird alive for nearly a
                    fortnight, while in less than another couple of years additional information <hi
                    rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> 1837, p. 24) came from Mr T. K. Short to the
                    effect that he had seen two living, and that all Yarrell had said was
                    substantially correct, except underrating its progressive powers. Not long
                    afterwards Lord Derby received and in March 1838 transmitted to the same society
                    the trunk and viscera of an <hi rend="italic">Apteryx,</hi> which, being
                    entrusted to Professor Owen, furnished that eminent anatomist, in conjunction
                    with other specimens of the same kind received from Drs Lyon and George Bennett,
                    with the materials of the masterly monograph laid before the society in
                    instalments, and ultimately printed in its <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi>
                    (ii. p. 257, iii. p. 277). From this time the whole structure of the Kiwi has
                    certainly been far better known than that of nearly any other bird, and by
                    degrees other examples found their way to England, some of which were
                    distributed to the various museums of the Continent and of America.<note

                    passed in 1846 to the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia, includes a

                    explained the anatomy of the group. Three years later Mr Bartlett drew attention
                    to the manifest difference existing among certain examples, all of which had
                    hitherto been regarded as specimens of <hi rend="italic">A. australis,</hi> and
                    the examination of a large series led him to conclude that under that name two
                    distinct species were confounded. To the second of these, the third of the genus
                    (according to his views), he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi

                    and it soon turned out that to this new form the majority of the specimens
                    already obtained belonged. In 1851 the first Kiwi known to have reached England
                    alive was presented to the Zoological Society by Mr Eyre, then
                    lieutenant-governor of New Zealand. This was found to belong to the newly

                    the rank of an Order may fitly be assigned, as they differ in many important
                    particulars from any of the other existing forms of Ratite birds. The most

                    positional the nostrils—almost at the tip of the maxilla—and the absence of an
                    after-shaft in the feathers, are characters nearly as manifest, and others not
                    less determinative though more recondite will be found on examination. The Kiwis
                    are peculiar to New Zealand, and it is believed that <hi rend="italic">A.
                    mantelli</hi> is the representative in the North Island of the southern <hi

                    longitudinally striped with light yellowish-brown, while <hi rend="italic">A.
                    oweni,</hi> of a light greyish-brown transversely barred with black, is said to
                    occur in both islands. About the size of a large domestic Fowl, they are birds
                    of nocturnal habit, sleeping, or at least inactive, by day, feeding mostly on
                    earth-worms, but occasionally swallowing berries, though in captivity they will
                    eat flesh suitably minced. Mr Buller writes <hi rend="italic">{B. New
                    Zealand,</hi> p. 362) :—</p>
                <p>“The Kiwi is in some measure compensated for the absence of wings by its
                    swiftness of foot. When running it makes wide strides and carries the body in an
                    oblique position, with the neck stretched to its full extent and inclined
                    forwards. In the twilight it moves about cautiously and as noiselessly as a rat,
                    to which, indeed, at this time it bears some outwardresemblance. In a quiescent
                    posture, the body generally assumes a perfectly rotund appearance; and it
                    sometimes, but only rarely, supports itself by resting the point of its bill on
                    the ground. It often yawns when disturbed in the daytime, gaping its mandibles
                    in a very grotesque manner. When provoked it erects the body, and, raising the
                    foot to the breast, strikes downwards with considerable force and rapidity, thus
                    using its sharp and powerful claws as weapons of defence. . . . While hunting
                    for its food the bird makes a continual sniffing sound through the nostrils,
                    which are placed at the extremity of the upper mandible. Whether it is guided as
                    much by touch as by smell I cannot safely say; but it appears to me that both
                    senses are used in the action. That the sense of touch is highly developed seems
                    quite certain, because the bird, although it may not be audibly·sniffing, will
                    always first touch an object with the point of its bill, whether in the act of
                    feeding or of surveying the ground; and when shut up in a cage or confined in a
                    room it may be heard, all through the night, tapping softly at the walls. ... It
                    is interesting to watch the bird, in a state of freedom, foraging for worms,
                    which constitute its principal food: it moves about with a slow action of the
                    body; and the long, flexible bill is driven into the soft ground, generally home
                    to the very root, and is either immediately withdrawn with a worm held at the
                    extreme tip of the mandibles, or it is gently moved to and fro, by an action of
                    the head and neck, the body of the bird being perfectly steady. It is amusing to
                    observe the extreme care and deliberation with which the bird draws the worm
                    from its hiding-place, coaxing it out as it were by degrees, instead of pulling
                    roughly or breaking it. On getting the worm fairly out of the ground, it throws
                    up its head with a jerk, and swallows it whole. <hi rend="superscript">

                    different proportion of the bill in the last points to some diversity in the

                    to ornithologists the most interesting group of birds now existing, and the more
                    interesting in regard to the melancholy doom of extinction which almost
                    inevitably awaits them. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
