                <p><label type="entry">KATER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi></label> (1777-1835), a
                    distinguished physicist of remarkable experimental skill, was born at Bristol,
                    April 16, 1777. At first he purposed studying law; but this he abandoned on his
                    father’s death in 1794, and entered the army, obtaining a commission in the 12th
                    regiment of foot, then stationed in India, where he rendered valuable assistance
                    in the great trigonometrical survey. Failing health, however, obliged him to
                    return to England; and in 1808, being then a lieutenant, he entered on a
                    distinguished student career in the senior department of the Royal Military
                    College at Sandhurst. Shortly after he was promoted to the rank of captain. In
                    1814 he retired on half-pay, and devoted the remainder of his life to scientific
                    research. He died at London, April 26, 1835.</p>
                <p>His first important contribution to scientific knowledge was the comparison of
                    the merits of the Cassegrainian and Gregorian telescopes, from which <hi
                    rend="italic">{Philosophical Transactions,</hi> 1813 and 1814) he deduced that
                    the illuminating power of the former exceeded that of the latter in the
                    proportion of 5: 2. This inferiority of the Gregorian he explained as being
                    probably due to the mutual interference of the rays as they crossed at the
                    principal focus before reflexion at the second mirror. His most valuable work,
                    however, was the determination of the length of the second’s pendulum, first at
                    London and subsequently at various stations throughout the country <hi
                    rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1818,1819). In these researches he skilfully
                    took advantage of the well-known property of reciprocity between the centres of
                    suspension and oscillation of an oscillating body, so as to determine
                    experimentally the precise position of the centre of oscillation; the distance
                    between these centres was then the length of the ideal simple pendulum having
                    the same time of oscillation. As the inventor of the floating collimator,
                    Captain Kater rendered a great service to practical astronomy <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1825, 1828). He also published memoirs <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Phil, Trans.,</hi> 1821, 1831) on British standards of length and mass; and in
                    1832 he published an account of his labours in verifying the Russian standards
                    of length. For his services to Russia in this respect he received in 1814 the
                    decoration of the order of St Anne; and the same year he was elected a fellow of
                    the Royal Society. His attention was also turned to the subject of compass
                    needles, his Bakerian lecture “On the Best Kind of Steel and Form for a Compass
                    Needle” <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1821) containing the results of
                    many interesting and valuable experiments. The treatise on “Mechanics” in
                    Lardner’s <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia</hi> was partly written by him and
                    partly by Dr Lardner; and his interest in more purely astronomical questions was
                    evidenced by two communications to the Astronomical Society’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi> for 1831-33—the one on an observation of Saturn’s outer ring, the
                    other on a method of determining longitude by means of lunar eclipses.</p>
