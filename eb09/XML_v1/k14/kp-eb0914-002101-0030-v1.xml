                    rend="smallcaps">Francis</hi></label> (1759-1831), an Hungarian author, known as
                    the most indefatigable agent in the regeneration of the Magyar language and
                    literature at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, was born
                    27th October 1759, at Ér-Semlyén, in the county of Bihar, Hungary. After passing
                    through the gymnasium of Sâros-Patak, he studied law at Kassa and Eperies, and
                    in Pest, where he also obtained a thorough knowledge of French and German
                    literature, and made the acquaintance of Gideon Râday, who allowed him the use
                    of his library, and encouraged him in literary pursuits. In 1784 Kazinczy became
                    subnotary for the county of Abauj; and in 1786 he was nominated inspector of
                    schools at Kassa. There he began to devote himself to the restoration of the
                    Magyar language and literature by translations from classical foreign works, and
                    by the augmentation of the native vocabulary from ancient Magyar sources. In
                    1788, with the assistance of Barôti Szabé and John Bacsânyi, he started at Kassa
                    the first Magyar literary magazine, <hi rend="italic">Magyar Muzeum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Orpheus,</hi> which succeeded it in
                    1790, was of his own creation. Although, upon the accession of Leopold II.,
                    Kazinczy, as a non-Catholic, was obliged to resign his post at Kassa, his
                    literary activity in no way decreased, and he not only assisted Gideon Râday in
                    the establishment and direction of the first Magyar dramatic society, but also
                    enriched the repertoire with several translations from foreign authors. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> which first appeared at Kassa in 1790, is a rendering
                    from the German version of Schröder. Having become implicated in the democratic
                    conspiracy of the abbot Martinovics, Kazinczy was arrested on the 14th December
                    1794, conveyed to Buda, tried, and condemned to death; but the sentence was
                    commuted to imprisonment. He was released in 1801, and shortly afterwards
                    married Sophia Török, daughter of his former patron, and retired to his small
                    estate at Széphalom or “Fairhill,” near Sâtor-Ujhely, in the county of Zemplén.
                    In 1828 he took an active part in the conferences held for the establishment of
                    the Hungarian academy, in the historical section of which he became the first
                    corresponding member. He died of Asiatic cholera, at Széphalom, on the 22d
                    August 1831, in the seventy-second year of his age.</p>
                <p>Kazinczy, although possessing great beauty of style, cannot be regarded as a
                    powerful and original thinker; his fame is chiefly due to the felicity of his
                    translations from the masterpieces of Lessing, Goethe, Wieland, Klopstock,
                    Ossian, La Rochefoucauld, Marmontel, Molière, Metastasio, Shakespeare, Sterne,
                    Cicero, Sallust, Anacreon, and many others. He also edited the works of Baroczy
                    (Pest, 1812, 8 vols.) and of the poet Zrinyi (1817, 2 Vols.), and the poems of
                    Dayka (1813, 3 vols.) and of John Kis (1815, 3 vols.). A collective edition of
                    his works, consisting for the most part of translations, was published at Pest,
                    1814-1816, in 9 vols. His original productions, largely made up of letters, were
                    edited by Joseph Bajza and Francis Toldy at Pest, 1836-45, in 5 vols. Editions
                    of his poems appeared in 1858 and in 1863. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
