                    (1478-1529), diplomatist and man of letters, was born at Casatico near Mantua,
                    and was educated at Milan under the famous professors Merula and Chalcondyles.
                    In 1496 he entered the service of Lodovico Sforza, duke of Milan, returning to
                    Mantua in 1500 when Lodovico was carried prisoner into France. In 1504 he was
                    attached to the court of Guidobaldo Malatesta, duke of Urbino, and in 1506 he
                    was sent by that prince on a mission to Henry VII. of England, who had before
                    conferred on Federigo Malatesta, “the Good Duke,” the most famous mercenary of
                    his age, the order of the Garter. Guidobaldo dying childless in 1508, the duchy
                    of Urbino was given to Francesco Maria della Rovere, for whom Castiglione, envoy
                    at the court of Leo X. (Medici), obtained the office of generalissimo of the
                    Papal troops. Charged with the arrangement of the dispute between Clement VII.
                    (Medici) and Charles V., Castiglione crossed, in 1524, into Spain, where he was
                    received with highest honours, being afterwards naturalized, and made bishop of
                    Avila. In 1527, however, Rome was seized and sacked by the Imperialists under
                    Bourbon, and in the July of the same year the surrender of the castle of Sant’
                    Angelo placed Clement in their hands. Castiglione had been tricked by the
                    emperor, but there were not wanting accusations of treachery against himself. He
                    had, however, placed fidelity highest among the virtues of his ideal “courtier;”
                    and when he died at Toledo in 1529, it was said that he had died of grief and
                    shame at the imputation. The emperor mourned him as “one of the world’s best
                    cavaliers.” A portrait of him, now at the Louvre, was painted by Raphael, who
                    disdained neither his opinion nor his advice.</p>
                <p>Castiglione wrote little, but that little is of rare merit. His verses, in Latin
                    and Italian, are elegant in the extreme; his letters (Padua, 1769-1771) are full
                    of grace and finesse. But the book by which he is best remembered is the famous
                    treatise, <hi rend="italic">Il Cori,egiano,</hi> written in 1514, published at
                    Venice by Aldus in 1528, and translated into English by a certain Thomas Hoby as
                    early as 1561. This book, called by the Italians <hi rend="italic">II</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Libro</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Oro,</hi>
                    and remarkable for its easy force and undemonstrative elegance of style no less
                    than for the nobility and manliness of its theories, describes the Italian
                    gentleman of the Renaissance, under his brightest and fairest aspect, and gives
                    a charming picture of the court of Guidobaldo da Montefeltre, duke of Urbino,
                    “confessedly the purest and most elevated court in Italy.” In the form of a
                    discussion held in the duchess’s drawingroom—with Elizabetta Gonzaga, Pietro
                    Bembo, Bernardo Bibbiena, Giuliano de’ Medici, Emilia Pia, and Ceretino the
                    Unique among the speakers—the question, What constitutes a perfect courtier <hi
                    rend="italic">1</hi> is debated. With but few differences, the type determined
                    on is the ideal gentleman of the present day. See Ginguené, <hi rend="italic"
