                    (1800-1868), an English painter, chiefly in water-colours, was born at
                    Dickleburgh, near Diss, Norfolk; in August 1800. At the age of sixteen he began
                    working as an architectural and topographical draughtsman; afterwards he
                    contributed designs to be engraved in the annuals then so fashionable and
                    popular; thence he progressed into water-colour painting, becoming an associate
                    of the Water-Colour Society in 1822, and a full member in 1833. In 1851 he
                    withdrew from active connection with this society, and with the practice of
                    watercolour painting, and took to oil-colouring. His most fertile period was
                    between 1833 and 1851, In 1855, as an exhibitor in the British Fine Art section
                    of the Great Exhibition in Paris (water-colour branch), he received one of the
                    five first-class gold medals awarded to British painters. He also enjoyed
                    professional honours in Amsterdam and in Belgium. He died on the 24th July 1868.
                    Among his leading works are The Murder of the Bishop of Liège (1δth century),
                    The Armourer relating the Story of the Sword, The Assassination of the Regent
                    Murray by Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, and (in oil) A Terrible Secret. He was
                    largely employed by publishers, illustrating the <hi rend="italic">Waverley
                    Novels</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Historical Annual</hi> of his brother the
                    Rev. Richard Cattermole (his scenes from the wars of Cavaliers and Roundheads in
                    this series are among his best engraved works), and many other volumes besides.
                    He is stated to have been “unsettled in his habits, and uncertain in
                    engagements.” Cattermole was a painter of no inconsiderable gifts, and of great
                    facility in picturesque resource; he was defective in solidity of form and
                    texture, and in realism or richness of colour. He excelled in rendering scenes
                    of chivalry, of mediaevalism, and generally of the romantic aspects of the past.
                    Indeed, his faculty in this way might almost be compared—though on a
                    considerably lower level, and with less of the spell of originality—to that of
                    Walter Scott. Just as Scott was fading from the region of mediaeval romanticism
