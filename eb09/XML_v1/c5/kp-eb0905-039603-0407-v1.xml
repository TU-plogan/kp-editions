                <p><label type="entry">CHAPMAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>, translator
                    of Homer, dramatist, and gnomic poet, was born in 1559, and died in 1634. At
                    fifteen, according to Anthony Wood, “he being well grounded in school learning,
                    was sent to the university” of Oxford; at thirty-five he published his first
                    poem, <hi rend="italic">The Shadow of Night.</hi> Between these dates, though no
                    fact has been unearthed concerning his career, it is not improbable that he may
                    have travelled in Germany. At thirty-nine he was reckoned “among the best of our
                    tragic writers for the stage;” but his only play published at that age was a
                    crude and formless attempt at romantic comedy, which had been acted three years
                    before it passed from the stage to the press; and his first tragedy now extant
                    in print, without name of author, did not solicit the suffrage of a reader till
                    the poet was forty-eight. At thirty-nine he had also published the first
                    instalment of his celebrated translation of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> in
                    a form afterwards much remodelled; at sixty-five he crowned the lofty structure
                    of his labour by the issue of an English version of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hymns</hi> and other minor Homeric poems. The former he dedicated to Robert
                    Devereux, Earl of Essex, the hapless favourite of Elizabeth; the latter to
                    Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset, the infamous minion of James. Six years earlier
                    he had inscribed to Bacon, then Lord Chancellor, a translation of Hesiod’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Works and Days.</hi> His only other versions of classic poems are
                    from the fifth satire of Juvenal and the <hi rend="italic">Hero and Leander</hi>
                    which goes under the name of Musaeus, the latter dedicated to Inigo Jones. His
                    revised and completed version of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> had been
                    inscribed in a noble and memorable poem of dedication to Henry Prince of Wales,
                    after whose death he and his <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> fell under the
                    patronage of Carr. Of the manner of his death at seventy-five we know nothing
                    more than may be gathered from the note appended to a manuscript fragment, which
                    intimates that the remainder of the poem, a lame and awkward piece of satire on
                    his old friend Jonson, had been “lost in his sickness.”</p>
                <p>Chapman, his first biographer is careful to let us know, “was a person of most
                    reverend aspect, religious and temperate, qualities rarely meeting in a poet;”
                    he had also certain other merits at least as necessary to the exercise of that
                    profession. He had a singular force and solidity of thought, an admirable ardour
                    of ambitious devotion to the service of poetry, a deep and burning sense at once
                    of the duty implied and of the dignity inherent in his office; a vigour,
                    opulence, and loftiness of phrase, remarkable even in that age of spiritual
                    strength, wealth, and exaltation of thought and style; a robust eloquence,
                    touched not unfrequently<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n408/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0408-0397"/> with flashes of fancy, and kindled at times into
                    heat of imagination. The main fault of his style is one more commonly found in
                    the prose than in the verse of his time,—a quaint and florid obscurity, rigid
                    with elaborate rhetoric and tortuous with labyrinthine illustration; not dark
                    only to the rapid reader through closeness and subtlety of thought, like Donne,
                    whose miscalled obscurity is so often “all glorious within,” but thick and slab
                    as a witch’s gruel with forced and barbarous eccentricities of articulation. As
                    his language in the higher forms of comedy is always pure and clear, and
                    sometimes exquisite in the simplicity of its earnest and natural grace, the
                    stiffness and density of his more ambitious style may perhaps be attributed to
                    some pernicious theory or conceit of the dignity proper to a moral and
                    philosophic poet. Nevertheless, many of the gnomic passages in his tragedies and
                    allegoric poems are of singular weight and beauty; the best of these, indeed,
                    would not discredit the fame of the very greatest poets for sublimity of equal
                    thought and expression: witness the lines chosen by Shelley as the motto for a
                    poem, and fit to have been chosen as the motto for his life.</p>
                <p>The romantic and sometimes barbaric grandeur of Chapman’s Homer remains attested
                    by the praise of Keats, of Coleridge, and of Lamb; it is written at a pitch of
                    strenuous and laborious exaltation, which never flags or breaks down, but never
                    flies with the ease and smoothness of an eagle native to Homeric air. From his
                    occasional poems an expert and careful hand might easily gather a noble
                    anthology of excerpts, chiefly gnomic or meditative, allegoric or descriptive.
                    The most notable examples of his tragic work are comprised in the series of
                    plays taken, and adapted sometimes with singular licence, from the records of
                    such part of French history as lies between the reign of Francis I. and the
                    reign of Henry IV., ranging in date of subject from the trial and death of
                    Admiral Chabot to the treason and execution of Marshal Biron. The two plays
                    bearing as epigraph the name of that famous soldier and conspirator are a
                    storehouse of lofty thought and splendid verse, with scarcely a flash or sparkle
                    of dramatic action. The one play of Chapman’s whose popularity on the stage
                    survived the Restoration is <hi rend="italic">Bussy d’Ambois</hi> (d’Amboise),—
                    a tragedy not lacking in violence of action or emotion, and abounding even more
                    in sweet and sublime interludes than in crabbed and bombastic passages. His
                    rarest jewels of thought and verse detachable from the context lie embedded in
                    the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Caesar and Pompey,</hi> whence the finest of
                    them were first extracted by the unerring and unequalled critical genius of
                    Charles Lamb. In most of his tragedies the lofty and labouring spirit of Chapman
                    may be said rather to shine fitfully through parts than steadily to pervade the
                    whole; they show nobly altogether as they stand, but even better by help of
                    excerpts and selections. But the excellence of his best comedies can only be
                    appreciated by a student who reads them fairly and fearlessly through, and,
                    having made some small deductions on the score of occasional pedantry and
                    occasional indecency, finds in <hi rend="italic">All Fools, Monsieur d'Olive,
                    The Gentleman Usher,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Widow’s Tears</hi> a wealth
                    and vigour of humorous invention, a tender and earnest grace of romantic poetry,
                    which may atone alike for these passing blemishes and for the lack of such
                    clear-cut perfection of character and such dramatic progression of interest as
                    we find only in the yet higher poets of our heroic age.</p>
                <p>So much it may here suffice to say of Chapman as an original poet, one who held
                    of no man and acknowledged no master, but throughout the whole generation of our
                    greatest men, from the birth of Marlowe well-nigh to the death of Jonson, held
                    on his own hard and haughty way of austere and sublime ambition, not without
                    kindly and graceful inclination of his high grey head to salute such younger and
                    still nobler compeers as Jonson and Fletcher. With Shakespeare we should never
                    have guessed that he had come at all in contact, had not the keen intelligence
                    of a living critic, Mr Minto, divined or rather discerned him to be the rival
                    poet referred to in Shakespeare’s sonnets with a grave note of passionate
                    satire, hitherto as enigmatic as almost all questions connected with those
                    divine and dangerous poems. This conjecture the critic has fortified by such apt
                    collocation and confrontation of passages that we may now reasonably accept it
                    as an ascertained and memorable fact.</p>
                <p>The objections which a just and adequate judgment may bring against Chapman’s
                    master-work, his translation of Homer, may be summed up in three epithets: it is
                    romantic, laborious, Elizabethan. The qualities implied by these epithets are
                    the reverse of those which should distinguish a translator of Homer; but setting
                    this apart, and considering the poems as in the main original works, the
                    superstructure of a romantic poet on the submerged foundations of Greek verse,
                    no praise can be too warm or high for the power, the freshness, the
                    indefatigable strength and inextinguishable fire which animate this exalted
                    work, and secure for all time that shall take cognizance of English poetry an
                    honoured place in its highest annals for the memory of Chapman. <hi
