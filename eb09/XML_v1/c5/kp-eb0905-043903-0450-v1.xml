                <p><label type="entry">CHATHAM</label>, a town of England, in the county of Kent, on
                    the south side of the Medway about 15 miles from its junction with the estuary
                    of the Thames, and 27 miles east of London. Though still nominally distinct, it
                    is practically united with Rochester on the west, and is in close proximity to
                    Brompton and Gillingham on the east. In Chatham proper the streets are for the
                    most part narrow, and with the exception of the docks and fortifications, there
                    are but few objects of interest. St Mary’s church is a brick building erected
                    about 1788, but occupying the site of an earlier structure of the 14 th century;
                    it contains a monumental brass to the memory of Stephen Borough, the discoverer
                    of the northern passage to Russia. There are a few remains of the hospital for
                    lepers founded by Bishop Gundulf in 1078; but the funds for its maintenance were
                    appropriated by decision of the court of chancery to the new hospital of St
                    Bartholomew erected in 1863 within the boundaries of Rochester. The almshouse,
                    established in 1592 by Sir John Hawkins for poor decayed seamen and shipwrights,
                    is still in existence, the building having been re-erected in the present
                    century; but the fund called the Chatham Chest, originated by Hawkins and Drake
                    in 1588, was incorporated with Greenwich Hospital in 1802. The town possesses
                    numerous churches and chapels of various denominations, a ragged school, a
                    nautical school, a mechanics’ institute, and a lecture hall The Medway union
                    workhouse is situated a short distance to the south-east. The water supply is
                    obtained from springs at the village of Lupton, about half a mile further off in
                    the same direction; and extensive reservoirs were constructed in 1862 at Star
                    Hill in the neighbourhood of the village. Numerous brickyards, lime-kilns, and
                    flour-mills are in the surrounding district, and the town carries on a large
                    retail trade, partly from the presence of the garrison.</p>
                <p>The fortifications are among the most elaborate in the kingdom. The so-called
                    Chatham Lines ought rather to bear the name of the village of Brompton which
                    they enclose. They were commenced in 1758 and completed in 1807; but various
                    alterations and additions have since been effected. They are strengthened by
                    several detached forts and redoubts, and consist of a very intricate system of
                    trenches, batteries, and subterranean passages. Fort Pitt, which rises above the
                    town to the west, was built in 1779, and is now used as a general military
                    hospital; it was regarded as the principal establishment of the kind in the
                    country till the foundation of Netley in Hampshire.</p>

                <p>The lines include the Chatham, the Royal Marine, the Brompton, the Hut, and St
                    Mary’s barracks; the garrison hospital and Melville hospital; the arsenal with
                    its large park of artillery; the gymnasium, established in 1864: for gymnastic
                    exercise; the military school for the practical instruction of sappers and
                    engineers, opened in 1812; a military institute for the men in garrison; the
                    convict prison; and, finally, the extensive system of dockyards which has made
                    the town so famous.</p>
                <p>Numerous Roman remains, both architectural and domestic, have been discovered at
                    Chatham and Brompton; but they appear to have belonged to the Roman city of
                    Rochester. Till the reign of Elizabeth the place was a mere insignificant
                    village; but before 1588 the queen established the first dockyard on the site of
                    what is now called the Ordnance Wharf, and erected Castle Upnor on the opposite
                    bank of the river for its defence. The situation was changed in the following
                    reign, and under the Charleses extensive additions were made. The history of the
                    town since the attack of the Dutch in 1667 has been mainly the history of the
                    naval and military establishments. The parliamentary borough, which returns one
                    member, includes the towns of Chatham and Brompton, and the villages of
                    Gillingham, Chatham Hill, and NewBrompton, and covers an area of 2707 acres. The
                    population of the borough in 1871 numbered 45,792 persons, of whom 24,873 were
                    males and 20,919 females.</p>
