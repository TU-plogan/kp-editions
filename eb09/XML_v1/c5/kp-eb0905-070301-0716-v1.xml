                <p><label type="entry">CHRISTINE DE PISAN</label> (1363-1431), though French by
                    education and renown, was of Italian stock, and was born at Venice. When she was
                    five years old, she went to her father, a councillor of the Venetian Republic,
                    at Paris, where he held office as astrologer to Charles V. Educated at that
                    prince’s court as completely as the age would allow, at fifteen Christine
                    married Étienne du Castel, Charles’s notary and secretary. After the king’s
                    death, her father lost his appointment, and died soon after of grief and
                    infirmity; and lÁs decease being presently fo!lowed by that of her husband, she
                    found herself at five and twenty without a protector, and with three children
                    depending on her for bread. The vexations and discomforts attendant on several
                    suits at law determined her to have recourse to letters as a means of
                    livelihood. Between 1399 and 1405, as she herself declares, without reckoning
                    minor pieces, she composed some fifteen important works. Neither fame nor
                    protection failed her. The earl of Salisbury, in Paris on the occasion of the
                    marriage of Richard II. with Isabella of France (1396), took her eldest son, and
                    reared him as his <pb break="no"

                    being received and nurtured by Philip of Burgundy, at whose solicitation

                    desired her to make his court her home, and she received a like invitation from
                    Galeazzo Visconti tyrant of Milan. She preferred, however, to sojourn in France,
                    where she enjoyed the favour of Charles VI., the dukes of Berry and Burgundy,
                    the prince of Guienne, and others. Of the circumstances of her death nothing is
                    known. A son of her’s, however, Jean du Castel, is said to have attained
                    distinction as a poet under Charles VIL Christine de Pisan wrote voluminously in
                    prose and verse. Her works are by no means devoid of merit, nor altogether
                    without interest even at the present time, though the language in which they are
                    written is crude and imperfect, and they sin too often on the side of
                    diffuseness. They are principally of a moral character, Christine seldom
                    interfering in the political questions of her age save to clamour for peace and
                    unity. There is no complete edition of her works. One of them, <hi rend="italic"
