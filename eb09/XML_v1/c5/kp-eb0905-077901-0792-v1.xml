                    (1749-1801), anltalian musical composer, was bora at Aversa, in the kingdom of
                    Naples. His parents were poor but anxious to give their son a good education;
                    and after removing to Naples they sent him to a free school connected with one
                    of the monasteries of that city. The organist of the monastery, Padre Polcano,
                    was struck with the boy’s intellect, and voluntarily instructed him in the
                    elements of music, as also in the ancient and modern literature of his country.
                    To the influence of the same worthy monk Cimarosa owed a free scholarship at the
                    musical institute of Santa Maria di Loreto, where he remained for eleven years,
                    studying chiefly the great masters of the old Italian school. Piccini, Sacchini,
                    and other musicians of repute are mentioned amongst his teachers. At the age of
                    twenty-three Cimarosa entered the lists as a composer with a comic opera called
                    <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Stravaganze del Conte,</hi> first
                    performed at the theatre dei Fiorentini at Naples in 1772. The work met with
                    approval, and was followed in the same year by <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pazzie di Stellidanzα c di Zoroastro,</hi> a farce full of humour
                    and eccentricity. This work also was successful, and the fame of the young
                    composer began to spread all over Italy. In 1774 he was invited to Rome to write
                    an opera for the <hi rend="italic">stagione</hi> of that year; and he there
                    produced another comic opera called <hi rend="italic">EItaliana in
                    Londra.</hi></p>
                <p>The next thirteen years of Cimarosa’s life are not marked by any event worth
                    mentioning. He wrote a number of operas for the various theatres of Italy,
                    residing temporarily in Rome, in Naples, or wherever else his vocation as a
                    conductor of his works happened to call him. From 1784-1787 he lived at
                    Florence, writing exclusively for the theatre of that city. The productions of
                    this period of his life are very numerous, consisting of operas, both comic and
                    serious, cantatas, and various sacred compositions. The following works may be
                    mentioned amongst many others :— <hi rend="italic">Caic Mario;</hi> the three
                    Biblical operas, <hi rend="italic">Assalone,LaGiuditta,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Il</hi><hi rend="italic">Sacrificio</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">Abramo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> also <hi rend="italic">II
                    Convito di</hi><hi rend="italic">Pietra</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">La Ballerina</hi><hi rend="italic">Amante,</hi> a pretty comic
                    opera first performed at Venice with enormous success. None of these works have
                    survived, and their individual merits hardly give us cause to regret their loss.
                    Excessive productiveness of this kind cannot but become mechanical. But this is
                    no fault of Cimarosa’s. The enormous demand of the Italian stage has become
                    fatal to the genius of some of the most gifted composers of that country both in
                    the last and in the present century. Looking at Cimarosa’s works collectively,
                    it may be said that they represent a style of considerab!e individuality and a
                    perfect mastership of dramatic effect, so far at least as the vocal part is
                    concerned. Cimarosa’s orchestra, like that of most Italian composers, is
                    somewhat meagre, but here also the comparatively primitive stage of
                    orchestration at the time he wrote ought to be taken into account. Cimarosa
                    seldom succeeds in the highest walks of his art. His comic operas are infinitely
                    superior to those in which a tragic subject compelled him to attempt dramatic
                    pathos. As far as grace and melodious charm are concerned, Cimarosa was
                    surpassed by none of his contemporaries, not even by Paesiello, with whom he
                    shared for a long time the leadership of the Italian school.</p>
                <p>In 1787 Cimarosa went to St Petersburg by invitation of the Empress Catherine II.
                    At her court he remained four years and wrote an enormous number of
                    compositions, mostly of the nature of <hi rend="italic">pièces</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">occasion.</hi> Of most of these not
                    even the names are on record. In 1792 Cimarosa left St Petersburg, the northern
                    climate of Russia proving hurtful to the native of Italy. By invitation of the
                    Emperor Leopold Π. he went to Vienna, and it was there that he produced the
                    masterpiece on which his claim to immortality must mainly rest. <hi

                    by Rossini’s <hi rend="italic">Barbieri</hi> alone. After the lapse of more than
                    eighty years it evinces its vitality at theatres and concert halls wherever the
                    whole opera or detached pieces are heard. Its humour is founded on human nature
                    itself, and is therefore independent of local and temporal conditions. 1793
                    Cimarosa returned to Naples where <hi rend="italic">The Secret Marriage</hi> and
                    other works were received with great applause. Amongst the works belonging to
                    his last stay in Naples, the charming opera <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Astuzie Feminili</hi> may be mentioned. This period of his life is
                    said to have been embittered by the intrigues of envious and hostile persons,
                    amongst whom one is sorry to meet with Paesiello his old rival. During the
                    occupation of Naples by the troops of the French Republic, Cimarosa joined the
                    liberal party, and on the return of the Bourbons, was like many of his political
                    friends condemned to death. By the intercession of influential admirers his
                    sentence was commuted into banishment, and the composer left Naples with the
                    intention of returning to St Petersburg. But his health was broken, and after
                    much suffering he died at Venice in 1801 of inflammation of the intestines. The
                    nature of his disease led to the rumour of his having been poisoned by his
                    enemies, which, however, a formal inquest proved to be unfounded. He worked till
                    the last moment of his life, and one of his operas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Artemisia,</hi> remained unfinished at Lis death. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f.
