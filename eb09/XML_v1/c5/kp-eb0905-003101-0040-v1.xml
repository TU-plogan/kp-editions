                    or bluish-coloured insects, with the breast finely punctured and pubescent, head
                    and thorax with a longitudinal channel, and elytra with two slightly elevated
                    lines. The insect is from half-an-inch to an inch in length, and from one to two
                    lines broad, the female being broader in the abdomen and altogether larger than
                    the male. It is a native of the South of Europe, being found in Spain, France,
                    Germany, Italy, Hungary, and the South of Russia, and it is also obtained in
                    Siberia. The Spanish fly is also occasionally found in the South of England. The
                    insects feed upon ash, lilac, privet, and jasmine leaves, and are found more
                    rarely on elder, rose, apple, and poplar trees. Their presence is made known by
                    a powerful disagreeable odour, which penetrates to a considerable distance; and
                    people sitting under trees on which the insects were feeding have been known to
                    be injuriously affected by their presence. They are collected for use at late
                    evening or early morning, while in a dull bedewed condition, by shaking them off
                    the trees or shrubs into cloths spread on the ground; and they are killed by
                    dipping them into hot water or vinegar, or by exposing them for some time over
                    the vapour of vinegar. They are then dried and put up for preservation in
                    glass-stoppered bottles; and they require to be very carefully guarded against
                    mites and various other minute insects to the attacks of which they are
                    peculiarly liable. Mr H. Pocklington has discovered by means of spectroscopic
                    observations that the green colour of the elytra, &amp;c., is due to the
                    presence of chlorophyll; and he has demonstrated that the variations of the
                    spectral bands are sufficient, after the lapse of many years, to indicate with
                    some certainty the kind of leaves on which the insects were feeding shortly
                    before they were killed. Cantharides owe their value to the presence of a
                    peculiar chemical principle, to which the name cantharidin has been given. It is
                    most abundant in large full-grown insects, while in very young specimens no
                    cantharidin at all has been found. From about one-fourth to rather more than
                    one-half per cent, of cantharidin has been obtained from different samples; and
                    it has been ascertained that the hard parts of the insect contain about six
                    times more of the active principle than the soft parts. Cantharidin crystallizes
                    in colourless four-sided prisms; in solution or prepared with lard it produces
                    very powerful vesication, and taken internally it is a violent irritant
                    poison.</p>

                <p>Spanish flies are most largely used as an external application, being but rarely
                    taken internally. They are applied as a topical stimulant for indolent ulcers,
                    as rubefacients, and especially for blistering in inflammatory diseases. Taken
                    internally in the form of tincture, they have been used in dropsy, in paralysis
                    of the bladder, and for producing aphrodisiacal effects. They have also been
                    employed in lepra and other skin diseases; and they have had a reputation in
                    hydrophobia and other nervous disorders which they do not deserve.</p>
                <p>A very large number of other insects belonging to the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cantliaridoe</hi> possess blistering properties owing to their containing
                    cantharidin. Of these the most remarkable is the Telini fly of India <hi
                    rend="italic">(My</hi><hi rend="italic">labris cichorii),</hi> the range of
                    which extends from Italy and Greece through Egypt and Central Asia as far as
                    China. It is very rich in cantharidin, yielding fully twice as much as ordinary
                    cantharides. Several green-coloured beetles are, on account of their colour,
                    used as adulterants to cantharides, but they are very easily detected by
                    examination with the eye, or, if powdered, with the microscope.</p>
