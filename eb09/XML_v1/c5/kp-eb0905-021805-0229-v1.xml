                <p><label type="entry">CATARRH</label> (from <hi rend="italic">καταρρέω,</hi> to
                    flow down) is a term employed to describe a state of irritation of the mucous
                    membrane of the air passages, or what is called in popular language a cold. This
                    complaint, so prevalent in damp and cold weather, usually begins as a nasal
                    catarrh or coryza, with a feeling of weight about the forehead and some degree
                    of difficulty in breathing through the nose, increased on lying down. Fits of
                    sneezing accompanied with a profuse watery discharge from the nostrils and eyes
                    soon follow, while the sense of smell and to some extent that of taste become
                    considerably impaired. There is usually present some amount of sore throat and
                    of bronchial irritation, causing hoarseness and cough. Sometimes the vocal
                    apparatus becomes so much inflamed (laryngeal catarrh) that temporary loss of
                    voice results. There is always more or less feverishness and discomfort, and
                    frequently an extreme sensitiveness to cold. After two or three days the
                    symptoms begin to abate, the discharge from the nostrils and chest becoming
                    thicker and of purulent character, and producing when dislodged considerable
                    relief to the breathing. On the other hand the catarrh may assume a more severe
                    aspect and pass into some form of pulmonary inflammation (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bronchitis).</hi></p>
                <p>A peculiar catarrhal affection occasionally occurs, in an epidemic form, to which
                    the name Influenza is applied (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Influenza).</hi></p>
                <p>Many remedies have been proposed with the view of cutting short a catarrh, but
                    none of them are infallible, even where they can be safely employed. In some
                    cases an opiate taken at the outset proves effectual for this end, but as often
                    it will be found to fail. Entire abstinence from liquids of every kind for a
                    period of forty-eight hours has been recommended as sufficient to cure any
                    catarrh, but few will be found willing to submit to such a regimen. Many persons
                    appear to think that they will get rid of a cold most quickly by continuing to
                    go about, and, happily, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n230/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0230-0219"/> in the majority of such cases, no harm results.
                    Nevertheless it is more than probable that by a brief confinement to a warm room
                    and the employment of means to promote perspiration (such as Dover’s powder,
                    along with a warm or vapour bath) speedier relief will be obtained; and at all
                    events the evil consequences attendant upon a “neglected cold,” which are so
                    familiar to the experience of every physician, will be obviated. Local
                    applications, in the form of inhalation of the vapour of iodine, turpentine, or
                    ammonia, sometimes relieve the uncomfortable feelings in the head. Lately the
                    use of a snuff composed of the trisnitrate of bismuth has been strongly
                    recommended as affording marked relief in nasal catarrh. Where attacks of
                    catarrh are of frequent occurrence no more useful prophylactic will be found
                    than the habitual employment of the cold bath.</p>
                <p>The term catarrh is now used in medical nomenclature in a still wider sense than
                    that above mentioned, being employed to describe a state of irritation of any
                    mucous surface in the body which is accompanied with an abnormal discharge of
                    its natural secretion, hence the terms gastric catarrh, intestinal catarrh,
                    &amp;c.</p>
