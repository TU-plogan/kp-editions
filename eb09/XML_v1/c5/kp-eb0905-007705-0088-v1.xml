                    small island of Italy on the south side of the Bay of Naples, in 40° 32' N. lat.
                    and 14° 11' E. long., and separated by a space of 3 A miles from the promontory
                    of Sorrento. It is a mass of limestone rock, with an area of about 20 square
                    miles, rising into two distinct peaks or plateaus, with a little valley of great
                    fertility between. The coast consists for the most part of precipitous cliffs,
                    and there are only two landing-places in the whole circuit. The scenery
                    throughout the island is of unusual beauty, and some of the sea-caves are
                    unrivalled for the splendid colours reflected on the rock. The two most famous
                    are called respectively the Blue and the Green Grotto; the former, though it has
                    only become a popular resort in the present century, seems to have been known in
                    the 17th. The inhabitants still retain distinct traces of the Greek type of
                    countenance and figure. They are industrious, religious, and simple, and, in
                    general, poor. Besides the cultivation of the narrow surface that can be
                    reclaimed from the rock, they chiefly depend on the capture of the quails which
                    visit the island in May and December; and about 200 of the young men take part
                    annually in the coral fishery off the coast of Africa. The chief towns are Capri
                    in the east, with 2332 inhabitants, and a beautiful cathedral and a seminary;
                    and Anacapri in the west, situated on the summit of <pb break="no"

                    steps cut in the rock.</p>
                <p>First inhabited, according to Virgil and Tacitus, by the Teleboae, Capri
                    afterwards became a naval station of the Etruscans; and in the 5th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> passed under the power of the Greeks of Neapolis.
                    From that city it was purchased by Augustus, who occasionally retired to its
                    grateful seclusion in the latter part of his life. It is chiefly celebrated,
                    however, as the retreat of Tiberius, where he spent the last ten years of his
                    reign. He erected twelve villas in different parts of the island, the most
                    famous of which was the <hi rend="italic">Villa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Jovis,</hi> built on the summit of the eastern cliffs 1500 feet above the sea.
                    Large parts of the building, which combined the strength of a fortress with the
                    luxury of a palace, still remain to bear witness to the power and wealth of the
                    empire. The whole island, indeed, is full of Roman remains, and has yielded to
                    the archaeologist a rich harvest of mosaics, bas-reliefs, coins, and
                    inscriptions. Of the last one of the most remarkable is the strange lamentation
                    of Hypatus, which was discovered in the Mithraic temple at Metromania. On the
                    fall of the Roman empire, Capri passed to the see of Rome, and it formed part of
                    the bishopric of Sorrento till the 10th century, when it received a bishop of
                    its own. Of its mediaeval history the principal remains are the castles of
                    Castiglione and Anacapri. In 1803 it was captured by Sir Sidney Smith, and
                    defended by new fortifications; but in 1808, while Sir Hudson Lowe was in
                    command, it was recaptured by Murat.</p>
