                <p><label type="entry">CHARIOT</label>, in antiquity, was a conveyance used in
                    battle, for the chase, in public processions, and in games. It had two wheels,
                    and was made to be drawn by two horses; if a third or, more commonly, two
                    reserve horses were added, they were attached on each side of the main pair by a
                    single trace fastened to the front of the chariot, as may be seen on two prize
                    vases iu the British Museum from the Panathenaic games at Athens, on which <hi
                    rend="italic">quadmgoe</hi> are represented. On the monuments there is no other
                    sign of traces, from the want of which wheeling round must have been difficult.
                    Immediately on the axle, without springs of any kind, rested the basket or body
                    of the chariot, which consisted of a floor to stand on, and a semicircular guard
                    round the front about half the height of the driver. It was entirely open at the
                    back, so that the combatant might readily leap to the ground and up again as was
                    necessary. There was no seat, and generally only room for the combatant and his
                    charioteer to stand in. The pole was probably attached to the middle of the
                    axle, though it appears to spring from the front of the basket; at the end of
                    the pole was the yoke, which consisted of two small saddles fitting the necks of
                    the horses, and fastened by broad bands round the chest. Besides this the
                    harness of each horse consisted of a bridle and a pair of reins, mostly the same
                    as in use now, made of leather and ornamented with studs of ivory or metal. The
                    reins were passed through rings attached to the collar bands or yoke, and were
                    long enough to be tied round the waist of the charioteer in case of his having
                    to defend himself. The wheels and body of the chariot were usually of wood,
                    strengthened in places with bronze or iron; the wheels had from four to eight
                    spokes and tires of bronze or iron. This description applies generally to the
                    chariots of all the nations of antiquity; the differences consisted chiefly in
                    the mountings. The chariots of the Egyptians and Assyrians, with whom the bow
                    was the principal arm of attack, were richly mounted with quivers full of
                    arrows, while those of the Greeks, whose characteristic weapon was the spear,
                    were plain except as regards mere decoration. Among the Persians, again, and
                    more remarkably among the ancient Britons, there was a class of chariot having
                    the wheels mounted with sharp sickle-shaped blades, which cut to pieces whatever
                    came in their way. This was probably an invention of the Persians; Cyrus the
                    younger employed these chariots in large numbers. Among the Greeks and Romans,
                    on the other hand, the chariot had passed out of use in war before historical
                    times, and was retained only for races in the public games, or for processions,
                    without undergoing any alteration apparently, its form continuing to correspond
                    with the descriptions of Homer, though it was lighter in build, having to carry
                    only the charioteer. On two Panathenaic prize vases in the British Museum are
                    figures of racing <hi rend="italic">bigoe,</hi> in which, contrary to the
                    description given above, the driver is seated with his feet resting on a board
                    hanging down in front close to the legs of his horses. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >biga</hi> itself consists of a seat resting on the axle, with a rail at each
                    side to protect the driver from the wheels. The chariot was unsuited to the
                    uneven soil of Greece and Italy, and it is not improbable that these nations had
                    brought it with them as part of their original habits from their former seats in
                    the East. In the remains of Egyptian and Assyrian art there are numerous
                    representations of chariots, from which it may be seen with what richness they
                    were sometimes ornamented. The “iron” chariots in use among the Jews appear to
                    have been chariots strengthened or plated with metal, and no doubt were of the
                    form above described, which prevailed generally among the other ancient
                    nations.</p>
