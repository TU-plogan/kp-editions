                <p><label type="entry">CILICIA</label>, one of the most important provinces in the
                    ancient division of Asia Minor, partly represented by the modern province of
                    Adana. It comprised a large part of the southern coast of that country,
                    extending from Pamphylia on the W. to Mount Amanus and the frontiers of Syria on
                    the E. Throughout this extent it was bounded by the central ridge of Mount
                    Taurus on the N. and by the Mediterranean on the S., so that its form was long
                    and narrow, having a length in a direct line of nearly 270 English miles, while
                    its breadth hardly anywhere exceeds 68 miles. It is divided by nature into two
                    portions of a very different character ;—the westernmost, known in ancient times
                    as Cilicia Trachea or Tracheotis (the modern Itsch Hi), the Rugged Cilicia, a
                    well-deserved epithet, as almost the whole region is occupied by a rugged
                    mountain tract, formed by the branches and offshoots of Mount Taurus, which
                    descend for the most part quite to the sea, while the interior is furrowed by
                    deep and narrow valleys, leaving but scanty spaces fit for cultivation; the
                    easternmost, on the contrary, called Cilicia Pedias, or “of the Plains,”
                    presenting a broad expanse of level alluvial plains round which the lofty chain
                    of Mount Taurus sweeps in a semicircle, forming a great mountain barrier that
                    encloses it like a wall on the north and east, and separates it from the
                    extensive upland plains of Lycaonia and Cappadocia.</p>
                <p>Towards the west the limit between Cilicia and Pamphylia was an arbitrary one;
                    the first place that is assigned by Strabo to Cilicia being Coracesium, a
                    remarkable fortress on a projecting rocky headland, now called Alaja. The whole
                    of this rugged mountain district indeed abounds in such projecting headlands,
                    with small sheltered coves or harbours beneath them,—a character that has
                    peculiarly fitted it, both in ancient and in modern times, for affording shelter
                    to pirates. At the same time the difficulty of communication with the interior
                    has prevented any of the towns on the coast from rising into important centres
                    of trade. Not withstanding these disadvantages there were in ancient times a
                    considerable number of towns surrounding the coasts of Cilicia Trachea; among
                    which may be mentioned (proceeding from W. to E.) Selinus, afterwards called
                    Trajanopolis; Anemurium, near the promontory of the same name, which is the
                    southernmost point of Asia Minor; Celenderis, still called Kelenderi, and used
                    as a place of passage to the Island of Cyprus, though now a poor decayed
                    village; andSeleucia, termed for distinction’s sake Seleucia ad Calycadnum, from
                    its position at the mouth of the river of that name. The Calycadnus, now known
                    as the Gök Su, or “Blue River,” is indeed the only river of any importance in
                    Cilicia Trachea, which it traverses nearly through its whole length, rising but
                    a short distance from the sea, and flowing through a very winding valley, but
                    with a general direction from W. to E. The only towns in the interior'of this
                    western part of Cilicia—Mout, which occupies the site of Claudiopolis, and
                    Ermenek (Germanicopolis)—are (situated in the valley of the Calycadnus, but they
                    are places of little importance. The whole of this mountain tract is still
                    covered with extensive forests, which in ancient times supplied timber for the
                    navies of the Egyptian aud Syrian kings, but are now almost entirely
                    neglected.</p>

                    the limit between the two different provinces of Cilicia. From that point the
                    mountains begin to recede from the coast, and leave a narrow strip of alluvial
                    plain between them and the εea, which, beyond Soli to the east, opens out into
                    the broad level expanse that gave name to Cilicia Pedias. The whole of this
                    extensive plain, spreading out in some parts to more than 30 miles in width, is
                    composed of alluvial deposits brought down by the rivers that intersect it. It
                    has consequently a soil of great natural fertility, and would be capable of the
                    richest cultivation; but it is for the most part a desolate uncultivated tract,
                    in which the towns of Tarsus and Adana, with their surrounding gardens and
                    fruit-trees, appear like oases in the midst of a desert. The surrounding plains
                    are the abode in winter of numerous hordes of Turcomans and Kurds, who wander
                    over them freely with their flocks and herds; while in summer they are rendered
                    pestilential by the noxious miasmata produced by the marshes formed by the
                    rivers that flow through the a, so that at this season they are almost wholly
                    uninhabited.</p>
                <p>The plains of eastern Cilicia are traversed by three considerable rivers. Of
                    these the Cydnus, which flows by Tarsus, though much the most celebrated in
                    ancient times, is the least considerable. It is formed by the junction of three
                    streams, all of which rise on the southern slope of the Bulghardagh, as the
                    portion of Mount Taurus immediately north of Tarsus is called; and it has
                    consequently but a short course from thence to the sea. But it is a deep and
                    rapid stream, and was celebrated in antiquity for the coolness and clearness of
                    its waters, a bath in which nearly cost Alexander the Great his life. The other
                    two rivers, the Sarus and Pyramus, now known as the Sihun and Jihun, are much
                    more important. Both of these take their rise in the upland plains of
                    Cappadocia, beyond the range of Mount Taurus, through which they force their way
                    to the Cilician plains below. On arriving in these they spread out into stagnant
                    pools and marshes, through which the main streams are continually changing their
                    courses, and cutting out for themselves new channels. These changes have caused
                    much confusion in reconciling the accounts given by ancient writers with the
                    present geography of the country. It appears certain that in ancient times the
                    Sarus joined the Pyramus near its mouth, and both together fell into the sea
                    immediately to the west of the small rocky headland called Karatasch Burun, near
                    the site of the ancient city of Mallus; but at the present day the Sihun holds a
                    separate course from Adana towards the south-west, flowing into the sea within a
                    few miles of the mouth of the Cydnus, while the Jihun, as it approaches the sea,
                    takes a sudden turn to the east, and flows into the Gulf of Scanderoon, between
                    the site of Mallus and that of the ancient Agae, now known as Aias.</p>
                <p>Imperfectly as the plains of this part of Cilicia are cultivated, they produce
                    cotton, wheat, barley, tobacco, and sesame in sufficient quantities to show of
                    what they would be capable if properly drained and tilled; while the gardens
                    around the towns of Tarsus and Adana are planted with palms, orange-trees, figs,
                    and other fruit trees, which flourish with the utmost luxuriance. The climate in
                    summer is intensely hot; and the plains at that season are burnt up and parched;
                    but the abundant means of irrigation at hand, if properly utilized, would
                    effectually remedy that disadvantage. These extensive plains are frequented by
                    numbers of gazelles and jerboas, as well as bustards, francolins, and other
                    game. Buffaloes also abound in the marshy tracts near the sea. In the ranges of
                    Mount Taurus leopards, for which the province was noted in the time of Cicero,
                    are still found not unfrequently.</p>
                <p>Besides Tarsus and Adana, which retain their ancient names as well as sites,
                    there were in ancient times several other important cities in the eastern
                    portion of Cilicia. Among these Soli (afterwards called Pompeiopolis, from its
                    having been repeopled and rebuilt by Pompey the Great) was situated at the
                    western extremity of the great plain, a few miles west of Mersina, the modern
                    port of Tarsus; while Mallus occupied the promontory now called Karatasch Burun,
                    at its eastern extremity. In the interior were Mopsuestia (now Missis) on the
                    River Pyramus, and Anazarbus (still called Aïn Zarba) higher up the valley of
                    the same river, which, under the Roman and Byzantine empires, became one of the
                    most flourishing cities of Cilicia. In modern times Adana, which is the capital
                    of the pashalic or vilayet that comprises all Cilicia, is much the most
                    important town in the province, and is estimated to contain 18,000 inhabitants,
                    while Tarsus does not possess more than 7000 or 8000.</p>
                <p>Mersina, the port of Tarsus, though still but a small place, is gradually
                    becoming the seat of a considerable trade, being the only outlet for the
                    productions of the interior.</p>
                <p>Cilicia is bounded on the east (as already stated) by Mount Amanus, one of the
                    most considerable of the branches or offshoots of Mount Taurus. But the range to
                    which this name was given by ancient geographers is in fact a double one, which
                    forks into two branches about midway between Marasch and the sea, and sends down
                    two arms,—the one in a south-west direction, ending in the Cilician plain before
                    reaching the sea; the other running nearly due south till it curves round the
                    Gulf of Scanderoon, and ends in the lofty mountain promontory of Ras el Khanzin,
                    the Rossicus Scopulus of Ptolemy. Between these two ranges lies the deep bay or
                    inlet called in ancient times the Gulf of Issus, and now known as the Gulf of
                    Scanderoon, from the seaport of that name; this is above 50 miles long and about
                    20 miles wide at its entrance. On its shores were situated in ancient times the
                    towns of Aegae (now Aias) on the western side, and Issus, Myriandrus, and Rhosus
                    on the eastern; but after the foundation of Alexandria on the same side of the
                    gulf, these last towns sank into comparative insignificance. Alexandria still
                    survives under the name of Alexandretta, or Iskenderun (commonly corrupted into
                    Scanderoon) as it is called by the Turks, and is a place of considerable
                    trade.</p>
                <p>The southern branch of Mount Amanus unquestionably constitutes the natural limit
                    of Cilicia, and hence Strabo correctly assigns all the towns north of the
                    promontory of Rhosus to Cilicia, and those on the other side of it to Pieria in
                    Syria. But for political purposes the limit was fixed at a point some miles
                    north of Alexandria, where there was a fortified pass called the Syrian Gates.
                    The name of Pylae Syriae or Syrian Gates was also given, however, to the
                    mountain pass across the range of Mount Amanus, now known as the Pass of Beilan,
                    which has in all ages formed the direct route from Asia Minor into Syria. It was
                    to its command of these passes, as well as that called the Cilician Gates on the
                    north, leading directly across the chain of Mount Taurus, that Cilicia owed much
                    of its importance in a military and political point of view.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Though the boundaries of
                    Cilicia, as above defined, were generally recognized in ancient times, the
                    people of that name appears to have been in early days much more widely spread,
                    and occupied a considerable extent of country north of Mount Taurus, as well as
                    in the mountain regions extending towards Armenia. Thus Herodotus extends the
                    name of Cilicia to the Euphrates, and must have comprised a large portion of
                    Cappadocia under that appellation. There can be no doubt that the Cilicians, as
                    well as the Cappadocians, were of Semitic or Aramaic descent, and belonged to
                    the same stock as the <pb break="no"

                    very early period politically separate. Cilicia appears as an independent
                    kingdom under a monarch named Syennesis, in the time of Alyattes, king of Lydia,
                    610 B.c. (Herod., i. 74), and even after it passed under the Persian empire it
                    continued to be governed by its own kings, all of whom appear to have borne the
                    name, or rather appellation, of Syennesis. From its position Cilicia attracted
                    much attention during the expedition of the younger Cyrus (401 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,c.),</hi> as well as in that of Alexander, whose first great
                    victory over the Persian king was fought at Issus, in the narrow pass between
                    Mount Amanus and the sea (333 B.c.)</p>
                <p>Cilicia now passed under the Macedonian rule, and was subject to the Seleucidan
                    kings of Syria. But owing to the feeble and unsettled character of the
                    government under the later monarchs of that dynasty, the western portion of the
                    country, or Cilicia Trachea, became the stronghold of numerous pirates, who
                    carried their depredations to such an extent as to compel the Romans to wage
                    regular war upon them. It was not till 66 B.c. that they were finally subdued by
                    Pompey, and Cilicia was regularly constituted as a Roman province, which,
                    however, comprised, in addition to Cilicia properly so called, Pamphylia,
                    Pisidia, Isauria, Lycaonia, and a large part of Phrygia. This was the extent of
                    the province when it was governed by Cicero as proconsul (51-50 B.c.), who
                    obtained some successes against the mountain tribes of Mount Amanus, of which he
                    was immoderately proud.</p>
                <p>Under the Roman empire Cilicia was again reduced to its natural limits, but did
                    not receive its final constitution as a province till the time of Vespasian. It
                    retained its condition as such under the Roman and Byzantine empires till it
                    fell, with the rest of Asia Minor, under the Seljukian Turks in the 11th
                    century. After the break-up of the Turkish monarchy Cilicia was seized by the
                    Armenians, who from the mountain districts of Mount Amanus and Taurus gradually
                    made themselves masters of the whole country, of which they retained possession,
                    notwithstanding frequent struggles with the Lusignans—the lords of the
                    neighbouring island of Cyprus—till both were expelled by the Ottoman Turks in
                    the 15th century. From that period Cilicia has continued to form part of the
                    Turkish empire, with the exception of the brief interval from 1833 to 1840,
                    during which it was annexed to his dominions by Mehemet Ali, viceroy of Egypt;
                    but after the defeat of that ruler by the allied powers he was compelled to
                    evacuate Cilicia, which was reunited as before with the Ottoman empire.</p>
                <p>The ancient geography of Cilicia is well described by Strabo (bk. xiv. ch. 5).
                    Its coasts were first visited and were described in detail by Captain Beaufort
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Karamania,</hi> 8vo, Lond., 1818. A more complete
