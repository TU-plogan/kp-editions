                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, a tetrahydric tribasic acid, first prepared in the
                    solid state by Scheele, in 1784, from the juice of lemons, in which it exists in
                    large quantity. It is present also in oranges, citrons, currants, gooseberries,
                    and many other fruits, and in several bulbs and tubers. It is made on a large
                    scale from lime or lemon juice, chiefly in the months of November and December.
                    The juice is fermented for some time to free it from mucilage, then boiled and
                    filtered, and neutralized with powdered chalk and a little milk of hme; the
                    precipitate of calcium citrate so obtained is decomposed with dilute sulphuric
                    acid, and the resulting solution of citric acid is separated by filtration,
                    evaporated to remove calcium sulphate, and concentrated. The concentration is
                    best effected in vacuum pans. The acid is thus procured in colourless rhombic
                    prisms of the composition C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">

                    Crystals of a different form are deposited from a strong boiling solution of the
                    acid. About 20 gallons of lemon juice should yield about 10 ftι of crystallized
                    citric acid. The acid may also be prepared from the juice of unripe
                    gooseberries. Calcium citrate for exportation in the place of lemon juice must
                    be manufactured<pb break="no"

                    the citrate and the production of calcium acetate and butyrate.</p>
                <p>Citric acid has an agreeable sour taste. It is soluble in ∣ths of its weight of
                    cold, and in half its weight of boiling water, and dissolves in alcohol, but not
                    in ether. At 150° C. it melts, and on the continued application of heat boils,
                    giving off its water of crystallization. At 175° C., it is resolved into water
                    and aconitic acid, C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>

                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Citric acid digested at
                    a temperature below 40° C. with concentrated sulphuric acid gives off carbonic
                    oxide. With fused potash it forms potassium oxalate and acetate. It is a strong
                    acid, and dissolved in water decomposes the carbonates and attacks iron and
                    zinc. Citric acid, in common with other tribasic acids, evolves about three
                    times the amount of heat disengaged by acetic acid when quantities of these two
                    bodies in the proportion of their molecular weights are saturated with soda,—one
                    molecule of the tribasic being equivalent to three of the monobasic acid.</p>
                <p>The citrates are a numerous class of salts, the most soluble of which are those
                    with alkaline bases; the alkaline earthy citrates are insoluble. Citric acid,
                    being tribasic, forms either acid monometallic, acid di metallic, or neutral
                    trimetallic salts; thus, mono-, di-, and tri-potassic and sodic citrates are
                    known. In a few salts a fourth atom of hydrogen is replaced by a metal, and
                    citric acid is therefore considered by some chemists to be tetrabasic. Citric
                    acid gives with excess of lime-water a slight precipitate of calcium citrate; a
                    further precipitate is produced by boiling, but it is redissolved as the liquid
                    cools. Solution of citric acid may be approximately titrated by means of
                    baryta-water and litmus.</p>
                <p>The impurities occasionally present in citric acid are salts of potassium and
                    sodium, traces of iron, lead, and copper derived from the vessels used for its
                    evaporation and crystallization, and free sulphuric, tartaric, and even oxalic
                    acid. Tartaric acid, which is sometimes present in large quantities as an
                    adulterant in commercial citric acid, may be detected in the presence of the
                    latter, by the production of a precipitate of acid potassium tartrate when
                    potassium acetate is added to a cold solution of the sample of acid to be
                    tested. Another mode of separating the two acids is to convert them into calcium
                    salts, which are then treated with a perfectly neutral solution of cupric
                    chloride, soluble cupric citrate and calcium chloride being formed, while cupric
                    tartrate remains undissolved. Citric is furthermore distinguished from tartaric
                    acid by the fact that an ammonia solution of silver tartrate produces a
                    brilliant silver mirror when boiled, whereas citric of silver is reduced only
                    after prolonged ebullition.</p>
                <p>Citric acidis used in calico-printing, also in the preparation of effervescing
                    draughts, and occasionally as a refrigerant and antiscorbutic, instead of fresh
                    lemon juice, to which, however, it is therapeutically inferior. In the form of
                    lime juice it has long been known as an antidote for scurvy, and several of the
                    citrates are much employed as medicines.</p>
