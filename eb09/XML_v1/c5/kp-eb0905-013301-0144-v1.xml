                    the name of a family, many of whose members attained distinction in Saxony in
                    the 17th and 18th centuries as jurists, theologians, and statesmen. They traced
                    their origin to Simon Carpzov, who was burgomaster of Brandenburg in the middle
                    of the 16th century, and who left two sons, Joachim and Benedict.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict Carpzov</hi> (1565-1624), first of this name,
                    second son of Simon, was an eminent jurist. He was born in Brandenburg in 1565,
                    and was educated at the universities of Frankfort and Wittenberg and other
                    German schools. He returned home in 1590, and was soon after nominated assessor
                    in law. In 1595 he was appointed professor of law at Wittenberg, whence he
                    removed in 1602 to the court of Sophia, electress of Saxony, at Colditz, who
                    named him her chancellor. After some years he returned to Wittenberg, and died
                    there, November 26, 1624, leaving five sons. He published a collection of
                    writings entitled <hi rend="italic">Disputationes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >juridicoe.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict Carpzov</hi> (1595-1666), second
                    of the name, was the second son of the preceding, and like him was a great
                    lawyer. He was born at Wittenberg in 1595, was at first a professor at Leipsic,
                    obtained an honourable post at Dresden in 1639, became Ordinary of the Faculty
                    of Jurists at Leipsic in 1645, and was named privy councillor at Dresden in
                    1653. Among his works, which had a very extensive influence on the
                    administration of justice, even beyond the limits of Saxony, are,— <hi
                    rend="italic">Definitiones forenses</hi> (1638), <hi rend="italic">P radica nova
                    rerum criminalium</hi> (1635), <hi rend="italic">Opus decisionum
                    illustrium</hi><hi rend="italic">Saxonioe</hi> (1646), <hi rend="italic"

                    (1657), &amp;c. His last years were spent at Leipsic, and his time was entirely
                    devoted to sacred studies. He read the Bible through fifty-three times, studying
                    also the comments of Osiander and Cramer, and making voluminous notes. These
