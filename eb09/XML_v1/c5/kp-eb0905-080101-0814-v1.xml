                    Antoine</hi></label><hi rend="smallcaps">Édouard,</hi> (1832-1870), an eminent
                    naturalist, was born at Geneva, April 24, 1832, and belonged to an ancient
                    family of that city. His father was pastor of the parish of Chancy, and
                    Edouard’s early years were spent in that village. After a distinguished course
                    at the classical college, the gymnasium, and the academy of his native city, he
                    repaired in 1852 to the university of Berlin, and there devoted himself with
                    self-sacrificing ardour to the study of medicine and the natural sciences and
                    the acquisition of the Germanic languages of Northern Europe. The direction of
                    his investigations was greatly affected by J. Müller and Ehrenberg, the former
                    of whom was at that period engaged in his important researches about the
                    Echinoderms. In 1855 he accompanied Müller to Norway, and there spent two months
                    on a desolate reef that he might obtain satisfactory observations. The latter
                    part of his stay at Berlin he devoted, along with Lachmann, to the study of the
                    Infusoria and Rhizopods; and their united labours resulted in an important
                    publication which at once gave them rank among the chief zoologists of the day.
                    In 1857 he obtained the degree of doctor, and soon after he was chosen professor
                    of comparative anatomy in the academy of Geneva. Here he continued to teach with
                    ever growing acceptance; and he even became a favourite of the general public
                    through his popular lectures. In 1859 he visited England, and, in company with
                    Dr Carpenter, took a voyage to the Hebrides; and in 1863 he spent some months in
                    the Bay of Biscay. On the appearance of Darwin’s work on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Origin of Species,</hi> he adopted his theories and published a valuable series

                    health; but he was a martyr from the year 1854 to a painful affection of the
                    heart, which caused excessive palpitations, frequently accompanied by spitting
                    of blood. During 1865 and 1866 he was quite incapable of work, and he determined
                    to pass the winter of 1866-7 in Naples. The change of climate produced some
                    amelioration, and the patient’s indomitable energy was attested by two elaborate
                    volumes on the Annelidae of the Gulf. He again visited Naples with advantage in
                    1868; but in 1870, instead of recovering as before, he grew worse, dropsy set
                    in, and on the 31st of May he died at Siena on his way home. Modest and
                    retiring, he was at the same time generous, hospitable, and helpful; and in
                    spite of his physical weakness, he displayed remarkable spirit in the political
                    disturbances of Geneva. A certain bluntness of expression sometimes made him
                    fail of courtesy in debate, and he could be pitilessly severe in his criticism
                    where he thought severity was deserved; but he was at the same time strikingly
                    free from uncharitableness, jealousy, or resentment. His library was bequeathed
                    to his native city. See the notice of his life by Henri de Saussure in the 42d
