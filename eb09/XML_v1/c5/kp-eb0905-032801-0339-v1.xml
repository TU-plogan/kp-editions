                    their solidification from a soft or liquid state, and without mechanical rivets,
                    things of the same or of different kinds. Stony cements may be natural, as the
                    lime employed for mortar, and the so-called Roman cements; or they may be
                    artificial, as Portland cement, made by calcining mixtures of chalk with clay or
                    river-mud (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Building,</hi> vok iv. p. 459) Roman
                    contains more clay than Portland cement, and sets more rapidly. A good
                    artificial water cement is obtained by heating for some hours to redness a
                    mixture of 3 parts of clay and 1 part of slaked lime by measure. Another
                    hydraulic cement may be made by mixing powdered clay and oxide of iron with
                    water. A very hard stone cement is prepared from 20 parts of clean river sand, 2
                    of litharge, 1 of quicklime, worked into a paste with linseedoil. Paper-pulp,
                    mixed with size and plaster of Paris is used for moulded ornaments. <hi
                    rend="italic">Keene's marble cement</hi> is plaster of Paris which has been
                    steeped in strong solution of alum or sulphate of potash, and calcined and
                    ground. It is slaked with alum solution when used. In <hi rend="italic">Martin's
                    cement,</hi> pearl-ash is employed as well as alum. <hi rend="italic">Parian
                    cement</hi> contains borax. <hi rend="italic">Selenitic cement</hi> is a mixture
                    of calcined gypsum, sand, and hydraulic lime. A cement used for cracks in
                    boilers is a mixture of clay 6 parts and iron filings 1 part with linseed-oil.
                    For steam-joints, ox-blood thickened with quicklime is employed. The <hi
                    rend="italic">iron-rust cement</hi> consists of 100 parts of iron turnings, with
                    1 part of sal-ammoniac; this is an excellent cement for ironwork. For
                    water-tight joints, equal parts of white and red lead are worked into a paste
                    with linseed-oil. A serviceable packing for connecting pipes, making joints,
                    filling cracks in retorts, &lt;fcc., may be made by adding to asbestos powder
                    enough of liquid silicate of soda to form a thick paste; the composition hardens
                    rapidly, stands great heat, and prevents the escape of acid vapours. Cracks in
                    glass vessels required to resist heat and moisture may be stopped by covering
                    them with strips of hog’s or bullock’s bladder, which are affixed by means of a
                    paste of caseine dissolved in cold saturated solution of borax; after drying,
                    the repaired portions are made capable of withstanding heat by an outside
                    coating of a mixture of concentrated solution of silicate of soda with plaster
                    of Paris or quicklime.</p>
                <p>A strong cement for alabaster and marbls, which sets in a day, may be prepared by
                    mixing 12 parts of Portland cement, 8 of fine sand, and 1 of infusorial earth,
                    and making them into a thick paste with silicate of soda; the object to be
                    cemented need not be heated. For stone, marble, and earthenware a strong cement,
                    insoluble in water, can be made as follows: skimmed-milk cheese is boiled in
                    water till of a gluey consistency, washed, kneaded well in cold water, and
                    incorporated with quicklime; the composition is warmed for use. A similar cement
                    is a mixture of dried fresh curd with <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th of its
                    weight of quicklime,’ and a little camphor; it is made into a paste with water
                    when employed. A cement for Derbyshire spar and china, &lt;fcc., is composed of
                    7 parts of resin and 1 of wax, with a little plaster of Paris; a small quantity
                    only should be applied to the surfaces to be uuited, for, as a general rule, the
                    thinner the stratum of a cement, the more powerful its action. Quicklime mixed
                    with white of egg, hardened</p>
                <p>Canada balsam, and thick copal or mastic varnish are also useful for cementing
                    broken china, which should be warmed before their application. For small
                    articles, shell-lac dissolved in spirits of wine is a very convenient cement.
                    Cements such as marine glue are mixtures of shell-lac and India-rubber, or of
                    their solutions.</p>
                <p>There are various cements for wood. For wooden cisterns a mixture is made of 4
                    parts of linseed· oil boiled with litharge, and 8 parts of melted glue; other
                    strong cements for the same purpose are prepared by softening gelatine in cold
                    water and dissolving it by heat in linseedoil, or by mixing glue with ½ of its
                    weight of Venice turpentine. Solution of shell lac in ammonia has been proposed
                    by Mons. C. Mène for the attachment of caoutchouc to wood and metals. <hi
                    rend="italic">Mahogany cement,</hi> for filling up cracks in wood, consists of 4
                    parts of beeswax, 1 of Indian red, and yellow-ochre to give colour. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cutlers' cement</hi> is made of equal parts of brick-dust and
                    melted resin, and is used for fixing knife-blades in their hafts. A cement used
                    in electrical apparatus is composed of 4 parts by weight each of red ochre and
                    beeswax, 20 parts of resin, and 1 part of plaster of Paris; these are melted
                    together till smooth. For covering bottle-corks a mixture of pitch, brick-dust,
                    and resin is employed. A cheap cement, sometimes employed to fix iron rails in
                    stone-work, is melted brimstone, or brimstone and brick-dust. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Japanese cement,</hi> for uniting surfaces of paper, is made by mixing
                    rice-flour with water and boiling it. <hi rend="italic">Jewellers' cement</hi>
                    contains 3 parts of isinglass made soft in water, and 1 part of gum ammoniacum;
                    these are heated together till a drop of the mixture stiffens immediately on
                    cooling. Gold and silver chasers keep their work firm by means of a cement of
                    pitch and resin, a little tallow, and brick dust to thicken. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Temporary cement</hi> for lathe-work, such as the· polishing and grinding of
                    jewellery and optical glasses, is compounded thus :—resin, 4 oz.; whitening
                    previously made red-hot, 4 oz.; wax, ½ oz. Mastic alone is much employed for
                    cementing and mending gems. In Turkey, jewellery for the ornamentation of
                    weapons and trinkets is secured by a composition thus made :—two small bits of
                    gum galbanum or gum ammoniacum are dissolved by trituration in 2 oz. of a glue
                    prepared by digesting softened isinglass in spirits, and the mixture is
                    incorporated at a gentle heat with a thick alcoholic solution of a little gum
                    mastic. This cement is kept in closely-stoppered phials, which must be immersed
                    in warm water when the cement is to bo liquefied for use.</p>
