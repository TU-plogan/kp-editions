                <p><label type="entry">CINQUE PORTS</label>. The Cinque Ports, or Five Ports, is the
                    name of an ancient jurisdiction in the south of England, which is still
                    maintained with considerable modifications and diminished authority. As the name
                    implies, the original members of the body were only five in number —Hastings,
                    Romney, Hythe, Dover, and Sandwich; but to these were afterwards added the
                    “Ancient Towns” of Winchelsea and Rye with the same privileges, and a good many
                    other places, both corporate and non-corporate, which, with the title of Limb or
                    Member,held a subordinate position. To Hastings were attached the corporate
                    members of Pevensey and Seaford, and the non-corporate members of Bulverheeth,
                    Petit Iham, Hidney, Beaksbourne, and Grange; to Romney, Lydd, and Old Romney,
                    Dengemarsh, and Oswardstone; to Dover, Folkstone and Feversham, and. Margate, St
                    John’s, Goresend, Burchington Wood, St Peter’s, Kingsdowne, and Ringwold; to
                    Sandwich, Fordwich, and Deale, Walmer, Ramsgate, Stoner, Sarr, and
                    Brightlingsea. The jurisdiction thus extends along the coast from Seaford in
                    Sussex to Burghington near Margate in Kent; and it also includes a number of
                    inland districts, at a considerable distance from the ports with which they are
                    connected. The non-incorporated members are within the municipal jurisdiction of
                    the ports to which they are attached; but the corporate members are as free
                    within their own liberties as the individual ports themselves. The incorporation
                    of the Cinque Ports had its origin in the necessity for some means of defence
                    along the southern seaboard of England, and in the lack of any regular navy. Up
                    to the reign of Henry VII. they had to furnish the Crown with nearly all the
                    ships and men that were needful for the state; and for a long time after they
                    were required to give large assistance to the permanent fleet. The oldest
                    charter now on record is one belonging to the 6th year of Edward I.; and it
                    refers to previous documents of the time of Edward the Confessor and William the
                    Conqueror. In return for their services the ports enjoyed extensive privileges.
                    From the Conquest or even earlier they had, besides various lesser rights,—(1)
                    Exemption from tax and tallage; (2) Soc and sac, or full cognizance of all
                    criminal and civil cases within their liberties; (3) Toll and theam, <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0800-0787"/> or the right of receiving toll and of holding
                    serfs; (4) Bloodwith and fledwith, or the right to punish shedders of blood and
                    those who were seized in an attempt to escape from justice; (5) Pillory and
                    tumbreìl; (6) Ingfangtheof and outfangtheof, or power to imprison and execute
                    felons; (7) Mundbriech, or authority to erect banks or dykes on any man’s land
                    as a defence against the sea; (8) Waives and strays, or the right to appropriate
                    lost property or cattle not claimed within a year and a day; (9) The right to
                    seize all flotsom, jetsom, or witsom, or in other words, whatever of value was
                    cast ashore by the sea; (10) The privilege of being a guild with power to impose
                    taxes for the common weal; and (11) The right of assembling in portmote or
                    parliament at Shepway or Shepway Cross, a few miles west of Hythe—the parliament
                    being empowered to make bye-laws for the Cinque Ports, to regulate the Yarmouth
                    fishery, to hear appeals from the local courts, and to give decision in all
                    cases of treason, sedition, illegal coining, or concealment of treasure trove.
                    The ordinary business of the ports is conducted in two courts known respectively
                    as the Court of Brotherhood and the Court of Brotherhood and Guestli'ng,—the
                    former being composed of the mayors of the seven principal towns and a number of
                    jurats and freemen from each, and the latter including in addition the mayors,
                    bailiffs, and other representatives of the corporate members. The Court of
                    Brotherhood was formerly called the Brotheryeeld, Brodall, or Brodhull; and the
                    name Guestling seems to owe its origin to the fact that the officials of the
                    “members” were at first in the position of invited guests. The highest office in
                    connection with the Cinque Ports is that of the Lord Warden, who also acts as
                    governor of Dover Castle, and has a maritime jurisdiction as admiral of the
                    ports. His power was formerly of great extent, and he held a court of chancery
                    at Dover in the old parish church of St James. He still presides in the court of
                    Shepway, and appoints the justices of peace for the liberties of the Cinque
                    Ports.</p>
