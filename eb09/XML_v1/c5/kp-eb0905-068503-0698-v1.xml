                <p><label type="entry">CHONS</label>, an Egyptian deity called also Khons or
                    Khonsou, principally worshipped at Thebes as the great eldest son of Amen Ra and
                    Mut, and identified with <hi rend="italic">Aah</hi> the moon. He had two names
                    in the Thebaid, his second being Neferhotep; as such he is called the god of two
                    names. By the Greeks he was called Chon, and considered to be a form of
                    Hercules. Like Horus he is represented as a youthful god, his form mummied,
                    wearing the lock of hair at the right side of his head and a skullcap surmounted
                    by the full and dichotomized lunar disk, or else hawkheaded, wearing the same.
                    He holds a crook and whip. He was a celestial deity, and at a later time
                    connected with Thoth, and was said to have proceeded from Nu or Han the
                    celestial waters, or to be the same as Har or Horus and Shu or Sos. The
                    functions of Chons are exceedingly limited; he is said in the Ritual to
                    overthrow the proud, and to be mystically connected with the Phoenix. But the
                    most remarkable characters of Chons are those mentioned on a tablet found on a
                    temple in the S.W. quarter of Karnak dedicated to the god, which had been
                    repaired or erected by Rameses III. of the 20th dynasty, said to be of sandstone
                    and basalt, the doors plated with goldandelectrum. The temple of calcareous
                    stone in the Karnak quarter was dedicated to Chons in two characters, that of
                    giving oracles and of expelling evil, and the remarkable tablet found there
                    records the departure of the god in his ark in the 16 th year of the reign of
                    Rameses XII. to the land of Bakhtan to expel a demon which had possessed the
                    daughter of the king of that country and sister of the queen of Egypt. After
                    effecting this miracle, and remaining some time there, the god returned in his
                    ark conducted by priests in the 33d year of the same reign. Attached to this
                    temple were cynocephali, a species of ape supposed to represent the moon and the
                    living avatar or sacred animal of the lunar gods, under the charge of a priest
                    or prophet. The worship of Chons appears to have been very common at the
                    Ptolemaic period, and figures of the god in bronze and porcelain are not
                    uncommon in collections. He is an inferior deity of the Pantheon, and although
                    in type allied with Ptah, Osiris, and Horus, exercises none of the attributes of
                    these deities, his chief function being that of the lunar gods; he represents
                    the youngest as Ammon did the oldest of the divine circle.</p>
