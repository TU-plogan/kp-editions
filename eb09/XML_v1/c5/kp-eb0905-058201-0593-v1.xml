                <p><label type="entry">CHEOPS</label>, the name of an Egyptian king <hi
                    rend="italic">Khufu,</hi> called Cheops by Herodotus, Chembes by Diodorus,
                    Souphis by Manetho, and Saophis by Eratosthenes. He was the second king of the
                    fourth dynasty of Manetho, and the builder of the Great Pyramid at Gizeh, 120
                    stadia distant from Memphis and about 45 from the Nile. According to Diodorus,
                    each side was 7 plethra long, and the height 6 plethra; or according to
                    Herodotus, each side of the base was 8 plethra in extent, and the height the
                    same. The former sides are supposed to have been each 764 feet long, their
                    present dimensions being about 746 feet, while the actual present height is 450
                    feet, and the angle of the casing stones 51° 5 0', according to the measurements
                    of Perring. This wonder of the ancient world, the sepulchre of the monarch, was
                    constructed at great expense and suffering, 100,000 men, changed every three
                    months, being employed by forced labour ten years in constructing the causeway
                    by which the blocks of stone were transported from the Tourah quarries, in the
                    Arabian chain, to a quay on the banks of the Nile, where they were transported
                    by boat from the other bank. Immense expense was entailed in the execution of
                    this Cuatly sepulchre, and according to a popular but improbable tradition,
                    Cheops was compelled through want of money to sacrifice the honour of his
                    daughter to complete the task. Other popular tales, according to the gloss or
                    extract of Manetho, depicted him as impious towards the gods, closing the
                    temples and stopping the worship, but subsequently repenting, and writing a
                    sacred book much esteemed by the Egyptians. His name was supposed to mean
                    wealthy, or having much hair. The monumental information about Cheops does not
                    confirm the Greek historians; on the contrary, it records the construction of
                    temples in honour of the gods, the repair of the shrine and the gift of various
                    figures of the temple of Isis and Athor close to his own pyramid, and his
                    construction or repairs of the temple of the same goddess Athor, the Egyptian
                    Venus, at Denderah or Tentyris. The sacred book may have been part of the
                    Egyptian rituals, portions of which were attributed to the early kings of Egypt,
                    and a medical papyrus records the discovery in his reign of a treatise on
                    medicine in a temple of a goddess at the town of Debmut. Cheops carried on war
                    at the Wady Magarah in the Peninsula of Sinai in Arabia, and a rock tablet
                    represents him having conquered the hostile tribes in the presence of the god
                    Thoth, who had revealed the mines of the locality. His oppression had so
                    afflicted Egypt that the charges of impiety had attached to his name; but the
                    tombs of his children reveal no change in the established religion, and his
                    pyramid only differs from those of his predecessors and immediate successor by
                    its rather larger size and greater beauty. His name Khufu, sometimes with the
                    addition of that of the god Khnum as Khnum-Khufu, has been found on several
                    monuments, and was found scrawled on the stones from the quarries of Tourah or
                    the Mons Troicus employed in the so-called chambers of construction of the Great
                    Pyramid. There is no known monument with the date of a regnal year of this
                    monarch, so that it is uncertain if he reigned the sixty-three years attributed
                    to him by Manetho, or the twenty-nine assigned by Eratosthenes. It is just
                    possible, from fragment 30 of the Papyrus of Turin, that he may have lived
                    ninety-five years and reigned the higher number, as generally recognized by
                    Egyptologists. The date of Cheops according to Lepsius is 3095-3032 B,c., but
                    great difference of opinion, amounting to nearly 2000 years, exists as to the
                    time of Menes, from whom the lists separate him by the interval of 898 years.
                    Priests of the Apis and Mnevis bulls are mentioned in the tombs of his period.
