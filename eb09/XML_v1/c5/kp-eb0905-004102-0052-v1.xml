                <p>CAPE COLONY is a large tract of country which forms the most southern part of the
                    continent of Africa, a colony of Great Britain since 1806, named from the Cape
                    of Good Hope, a small promontory on its south· west coast, from the
                    neighbourhood of which the Dutch settlers of 1652 spread out over the land. It
                    lies for the most part between 28° and 34° 50' S. lat., and 16° 30' and 29° 50'
                    E. long. West and south are the Atlantic and Indian Oceans; the Orange River
                    forms the boundary of the colony proper on the north, separating it from Great
                    Namaqua Land, the Kalahari desert, and the Orange River Free State; eastward its
                    limit runs from the Tees River, a headstream of the Orange, along the Stonu Berg
                    and down the Kei River from its most easterly source-stream to its mouth, which
                    line separates the colony from Free Kaffre Land, and includes within it the
                    divisions of British Kaffraria added to the colony in 1865. Besides this chief
                    area the colony includes various recently added irregular provinces; these
                    are—the agency of <hi rend="italic">Basuto Land,</hi> annexed in 1871,
                    consisting of the high valleys of the source-streams of the Orange River,
                    sloping down inward from the Drakenberg mountains, which separate this territory
                    from the colony of Natal; <hi rend="italic">Herschel,</hi> a native district

                    These latter districts were incorporated with the colony in 1875. It is certain
                    that in a few years the whole of what is now Free Kaffre Land will become
                    British territory, when the Cape Colony will be conterminous throughout with
                    Natal on the north-east; and preliminary steps have already been taken for the
                    extension of the western boundary of the colony to include the immense but
                    thinly inhabited region of Great Namaqua Land, which stretches north of the
                    lower Orange River to Walfisch Bay in 23° S.</p>
                <p>The lieutenant-governorship of <hi rend="italic">Griqua Land West,</hi> better
                    known as the district of the South African diamond fields, which lies north of
                    the Orange River and west of the Free State, annexed to the British empire in
                    1871, is strictly a separate dependency of the Crown, but is so intimately
                    connected with the Cape Colony as to be necessarily described along with it.</p>
                <p>The extreme breadth of the colony from north to south is about 500 miles, and its
                    length from east to west about 800, its area comprising 230,000 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The country rises from the sea by a series of terraces, of which the supporting
                    walls are nearly parallel chains of rugged mountains, intersected by deep
                    ravines, rising to a central and highest range, which divides the drainage of
                    the coastal streams from that of the inner tributaries of the Orange River in
                    the north. This central range follows a curve almost identical with that of the
                    coast, at a general distance of about 100 miles from the ocean; from the borders
                    of Natal westward it is known in different portions as the Kahlamba or
                    Drakenberg, the Storm Berg, Zuur Berg, Sneeuw Berg, Winter Berg, Nieuweveld, and
                    Roggeveld. In height its summits appear to average nearly 6000 feet, the highest
                    points being Cathkin peak, 10,300 feet, in the extreme north-east corner of the
                    colony; Compass Berg, in the Sneeuw Berg, 8300 feet; and Bulb-houders Bank, in
                    the Nιeuweveld Range, which is 7300 feet above the sea. North of this dividing
                    range the inner country slopes gradually to the Orange River, central
                    Bushmanland being a plateau of from 3000 to 4000 feet above the sea. The
                    numerous outer ranges, which form the margins of the terraces that fall towards
                    the ocean, are separated from the central range throughout the greater part of
                    the colony by the arid plateau known as the Great Karroo, nearly 300 miles in
                    length and 60 miles in width north to south, and at an elevation of about 3000
                    feet above the sea; their general direction is always that of the coast, and
                    they are cut across at intervals by rugged gorges or “kloofs” through which the
                    periodical torrents of the coastal watershed escape to the sea. Two chief ranges
                    may be distinguished, an inner and an outer, —the former having the names of
                    Zwarte Berg, Witte Berg, and Cedar Berg, along a great part of its length, the
                    latter being most prominent in the Outeniqua, Zon-deremde, Drakenstein, and
                    Olifant Bergen, rising from the south and west coasts. Some points of the inner
                    coast range exceed 7000 feet in altitude, and the outer line appears to average
                    about 4000 feet. In Namaqua Land, in the north-west of the colony, the central
                    and outer ranges, approaching one another and decreasing consider <pb break="no"

                    of chains to the lower Orange River. Within the central range, in Bushmanland,
                    the most remarkable elevations are the chains of isolated flat-topped hills
                    which rise directly from the plains of the Fraserburg and Victoria west
                    districts, known as the Karree and Praam Bergen. The Tafel Berg or Table
                    Mountain, the well-known landmark of the coast, and the nucleus of the peninsula
                    of the Cape of Good Hope, rises to 3582 feet. Though the mountains of the colony
                    and the plateaus between them present bold and picturesque outlines of
                    sharply-defined ranges and vast level plains, the landscape, excepting in the
                    coastal districts, is bare and uninviting, and deficient in water and
                    tree-growth.</p>
                <p>Nearly two-thirds of the surface of Cape Colony consists of vast arid plains,
                    covered, however, with shallow beds of the richest soil, which only requires the
                    fertilizing power of water to render it available for pasture or agriculture.
                    After the periodical rains, the plateau of the “Karroo” and the great plains of
                    Bushmanland present the appearance of vast fields of grass, but the summer sun
                    reduces them again to a barren and burnt-up aspect. The pastoral lands or ' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> velds,” which extend chiefly around the outer slopes
                    and in the east, are distinguished according to the nature of the grass or sedge
                    which they produce as “sweet” or “sour.” Shallow sheets of water termed “vleis”
                    accumulate at many places in the flat lands of the interior after rains; and in
                    the dry seasons these spots, where the soil is not excessively saline, are
                    covered with rich grass and afford favourite grazing land for cattle. Only in
                    the extreme southern coastland of the colony is there a soil and moisture supply
                    suited to forest growth, and the first requisite of every settlement in the
                    interior is the formation of a ∙' dam” or reservoir for the collection and
                    saving of a water supply. Out of an area of upwards of 40 millions of acres of
                    occupied lands, according to the census returns of 1865, only 460,000 acres were
                    then under cultivation.</p>
                <p>Geological knowledge of the vast territory of the colony is as yet imperfect,
                    though sufficient data have been collected to enable the general features of the
                    structure of the land to be mapped (A. G. Bain, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs on the
                    Geology of the Cape</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Dunn’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geological Map of the Cape</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Griesbach and Stow in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,</hi> &amp;c).
                    The following are some of the more striking general features. The whole basis
                    formation of the western province is considered to be granite, lower but more
                    recent than the clay-slate which rests upon it. A remarkable band of porphyritic
                    rock has been traced along the whole of the country between British Kaffraria
                    and the Bokkeveld Mountains in the west, a distance of more than 600 miles. A
                    series of sandstone rocks form the chains of the Zwarte and Lange Bergen. The
                    “Karroo beds,” the name given to formations which cover that plateau and the
                    country northward to beyond the Orange River, are believed from the abundance of
                    fossil wood and fresh-water shells to be of lacustrine origin, and contain
                    reptile remains of most remarkable character, unknown elsewhere. In the eastern
                    province, one of the most interesting features of the geology is that of the
                    beds of water-worn pebbles, many hundreds of feet above the present sea-level;
                    indeed there appears to be no doubt that a process of upheaval is still in
                    progress along the whole South African coast, where modern raised beaches, coral
                    reefs, and oyster banks may everywhere be seen. Slight shocks of earthquake have
                    been experienced at various times in the south-western region of the colony.
                    There are records of these in 1739, 1766, 1809, 1811, and 1844. Namaqua Land,
                    north as well as south of the Orange River, is a region composed of the older
                    rocks, gneiss and schists, and is famous for its copper deposits. These appear
                    to have been known as early as 1683, and have attracted attention at various
                    subsequent periods, but it was not till 1863 that any well-directed efforts were
                    made for the extraction of the copper; at the present time the famous mine of
                    Ookeip in the district of Springbokfontein yields an average of 7000 tons of ore
                    each year. Copper is also known to exist in the Amapondo country of Kaffraria.
                    Silver has also been discovered in Namaqua Land, but has not yet been
                    successfully worked. Coal seams are known both in the Storm Berg in the extreme
                    east and in the central district of Beaufort, but not in easily workable
                    situations.</p>
                <p>The discovery of diamonds north of the Orange River, an event which gave great
                    impetus to all affairs of the colony, was made in 1867, and in the following
                    years people from all parts of the world flocked to the fields. These lie in the
                    eastern portion of the territory known as Griqua Land West, which, as a
                    consequence of the discovery, was annexed to the British empire in 1871. The
                    mining has now become a settled industry, with its accom paniment of a fixed
                    population and rapidly-growing towns. The fields extend between the lower Vaal
                    River and its tributary the Modder; in this region the diamond-producing rock is
                    found in fragments mingled with the detritus of other rocks, occupying various
                    depressions known as “pans,” or in the deep torrent beds of the rivers. The
                    diggings are thus distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">wet,</hi> which lie
                    chiefly along the lower Vaal river, and have been almost abandoned, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">dry</hi> mines, about Kimberley, Du Toits pan, and Bulfontein,
                    farther south. One of the largest diamonds at first discovered in this region
                    weighed 83 carats, and realized £11,000; several much larger ones have since
                    been found, one of more than 200 carats. Iron ores, hematite, and magnetite
                    abound also in this region, the deficiency of fuel alone prevents the working of
                    mines of great richness.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the great water-parting mountain chain of the colony passes
                    through the centre of the country in a curve parallel to the coast line, from
                    the inner border of Natal to near the western Atlantic coast, forming an outward
                    watershed to the sea of about 100 miles in width, and an inner shed to the
                    Orange River. The streams of the outer shed are constant only in the extreme
                    east of the country; towards the south-west and. on the Atlantic coast land
                    their supply is irregular. AT partake of the character of mountain
                    torrents,—having numerous falls, flowing in deeply-cut channels, and being low
                    and feeble (in some cases dry) for the greater part of the year, but swollen and
                    rapid in rainy weather. From east round to west the chief are the Kei, Great
                    Fish, Zondag, Gamtoos, Gauritz, Breede, Berg, and Olifant; of these only two are
                    navigable for a short distance,—the Breede for small vessels for 30 or 40 miles
                    from its mouth, and the Berg for a few miles from St Helena Bay, on the Atlantic
                    coast. The Orange River, or Gariep, to which the inner shed of the colony
                    drains, rises in the Drakenberg on the border of Natal in the extreme north-east
                    of the colony, and flows westward for about 900 miles ∙to the Atlantic. Its
                    basin includes an area of upwards of 400,000 square miles, but the greater
                    portion of this belongs to the arid deserts of the Kalahari and of Bushmanland.
                    Below its confluence (in about 24° E. long.) withits chief affluent, the Vaal,
                    from the north-east, it has no permanently flowing tributary, receiving only the
                    occasional supplies of the torrent channels which are cut deep in the plateaus
                    and filled only after thunder showers,—so that its volume decreases very much in
                    its passage westward. Its upper valleys are very rugged and have been little
                    explored; the region about the confluence of the Vaal is low and alluvial; but
                    from this to the sea the river is hemmed in by steep and precipitous cliffs, and
                    broken by immense walls <pb break="no"

                    these the fall named Aukurubies (in 20° 40' E. long.), 150 feet in height, is
                    the greatest. The Orange is not navigable excepting for boats for a few miles
                    above its mouth, which is barred.</p>
                <p>Lakes are unknown in Cape Colony. Springs are frequent, aud in sandstone
                    districts afford excellent water, but in the Karroo country they are generally
                    brackish. Hot or mineral springs occur in several districts.</p>
                <p>The southern coastland of the colony is generally bold and rocky, the mountains
                    often approaching the shore; the Atlantic coast, on the other hand, is for the
                    most part low and sandy. The great ocean currents—viz., the Mozambique current
                    which sweeps down round the south of the Cape Colony, and is deflected there
                    over the great bank of Agulhas, the submarine apex of the continent, and the
                    South Atlantic current flowing northward past the Cape peninsula,—give rise to
                    many local and minor currents in opposing directions close to the coast, forming
                    great obstacles to navigation.</p>
                <p>The coast is indented by various bays and inlets; few of these, however, afford
                    con venient harbours, and the only one which is naturally safe in all winds is
                    that of Saldanha Bay on the Atlantic. From eastward round to west, the chief
                    points at which commerce reaches the coast are—the port of East London, at the
                    mouth of the Buffalo River in British Kaffraria, in which extensive harbour
                    works are being constructed; Port Alfred, or the Kowie mouth, which estuary has
                    also been rendered more commodious by engineering operations, Port Elizabeth, in
                    Algoa Bay, the second port of the colony in point of trade, but with many
                    natural disadvantages; Plettenberg Bay, of importance in coasting trade; the
                    Knysna, a land-locked estuary in 23° E.; Mossel Bay; False Bay, a wide gulf
                    formed by the peninsula of the Cape of Good Hope, and containing within it the
                    well-sheltered naval station of Simon’s Bay; Table Bay, the harbour of Cape
                    Town, which has been rendered safe by the construction of a great breakwater and
                    docks; Saldanha Bay, little visited, but one of the finest natural harbours in
                    the world; and Port Nolloth, the copper port of Namaqua Land, and the terminus
                    of a railway from the mines. Angra Pequeña Bay, in 26° 40' S,, a British
                    possession on the barren Atlantic coast north of Cape Colony, was formerly
                    visited in obtaining cattle, while the now nearly exhausted guano deposits of
                    Ichaboe and Possession Islands, north and south of it, were being worked.
                    Walfisch Bay, in 22° 50' S., up to which point it is anticipated that the
                    colonial territory will shortly be extended, is an inlet on a desolate waterless
                    coast, affording secure anchorage, and formerly much visited by American whaling
                    ships. Lighthouses are maintained at various ports and headlands on the
                    coast.</p>
                <p>In general character the climate of the Cape Colony is dry, highly salubrious,
                    and milder than that of England; the atmosphere is clear and buoyant. So
                    extensive, however, is the country, and so diversified in aspect and elevation,
                    that there are naturally many varieties of climate within its limits. As far as
                    moisture is concerned there is a gradual diminution from east to west across the
                    country; the prevailing winds in the interior are from eastward, and the
                    moisture they draw from the Indian Ocean being expended in great part on the
                    eastern slopes and mountain ranges, the western interior districts are left
                    almost rainless. In the eastern divisions heavy rains and thunderstorms moderate
                    the intense heat of summer, and keep the face of the country fresh and green.
                    The winters are cold, but the air is then clear and agreeable. At Graham’s Town
                    the average annual temperature is 63°, ranging from upwards of 100° to a minimum
                    of 35°, and the annual rainfall is about 33 inches. The south-western margin of
                    the country outside the edge of the great Karroo plateau is for eight months of
                    the year supplied with rain showers by westerly ocean winds. In summer
                    (December, January, February) the dry south-east trade winds blow with great
                    violence. The mean temperature of the year at the Cape of Good Hope is about 62°
                    attaining a maximum of 100° and a minimum of 34°, the average annual rainfall
                    being 24 inches. At Worcester, on the inner border of this region, the yearly
                    rainfall decreases to 12 inches.</p>
                <p>The low coast region in the extreme west is subject to great droughts and extreme
                    range of daily temperature; though it seldom rains there, dense fogs arise at
                    dawn. The climate of the great Karroo plateau, which is about 3000 feet above
                    the sea, is also characterized by severe droughts, by excessive heats during the
                    day in summer, by cold nights, and by sharp cold in winter. Within the
                    water-parting mountains the plains stretching to the Orange River, though also
                    subject to long periods of drought, have a salubrious climate, which is clear
                    and bracing in winter; while in summer the violent thunderstorms, which occur on
                    an average every three or four days along the mountain ranges, render the air
                    cool and pleasant, filling the water-channels and “vleis,” and reviving
                    vegetation. Hot, dry winds from the northern deserts sometimes prevail for two
                    or three days at a time in the central and eastern districts of the interior.
                    Snow seldom falls in the coast region, but in the higher mountain tracts it lies
                    for three or four months in the year. The summit of Table Mountain is
                    occasionally sprinkled with snow for a day or two. Hail-storms are rare, but are
                    of great violence after long droughts. The phenomenon of the mirage is common,
                    both on the coast and in the heated plains of the interior.</p>
                <p>Ophthalmia and rheumatism are perhaps the only diseases of the colony which are
                    at all prevalent; low fevers are common on the flat western coastlands.</p>
                <p>Though much of the land of the colony is dry and barren, the flora of the more
                    fertile portions is remarkable and varied. We have seen that the forests are
                    confined to the outward slopes of the extreme margins of the colony,— the only
                    patches of wood deserving the name being found in the Cedar Berg in the west, on
                    two sides of Table Mountain, on the Outeniqua mountains facing the south coast,
                    on the Olifants Hoek near Port Elizabeth, in the vicinity of King William’s Town
                    in British Kaffraria, and in the district of the Katberg or Stockenstroom
                    farther inland. The inner slopes of Griqua Land East are also wooded. These
                    patches of forest contain a great variety of useful woods, affording excellent
                    timber; among the commonest trees are the yellow wood, which is also one of the
                    largest, belonging to the yew species; black iron wood; heavy, close-grained,
                    and durable stinkhout; melkhout, a white wood used for wheelwork; nieshout; and
                    the assegai or Cape lancewood.</p>
                <p>In no other country do bulbous plants and heaths exhibit so many beautiful
                    varieties; of the latter several hundred varieties are described. Of pod-bearing
                    plants there are upwards of eighty genera: Cape “everlasting” flowers (generally
                    species of <hi rend="italic">llelichrysum)</hi> are in great numbers. Several
                    species of aloe are indigenous to the Cape, and form a considerable article of
                    export. The so-called American aloe has also been naturalized. The castor-oil
                    plant and many other plants of great value in medicine are indigenous in great
                    abundance. Among Cape plants which are remarkable in their appearance and
                    structure may be noted the cactuslike Euphorbiae or spurge plants, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Stapelia</hi> or carrion flower, and the elephant’s foot or
                    Hottentots' bread, a plant of the same order as the yam. Hooks, thorns, and
                    prickles are characteristic of many South African plants. There are few
                    indigenous fruits; the kei apple is the fruit of a small tree or shrub found in
                    Kaffraria and the eastern districts, where also the wild aud Kaffre plums are
                    common; hard pears, gourds, water melons, and species of almond, chestnut, and
                    lemon are also native. Almost all the fruits <pb break="no"

                    introduced, and grow in abundance. It is doubtful whether or not a species of
                    vine is indigenous to the Cape, but the cuttings of French vines introduced by
                    the Huguenots who emigrated to the colony on the. revocation of the Edict of
                    Nantes, between 1685 and 1688, have given rise to an extensive culture in the
                    south-western divisions of the colony, the grapes being among the finest in the
                    world. The Cape wines, the export of which has revived of late years, are
                    chiefly those known as Constantia, Pontac, Steen, and Hanepoot.</p>
                <p>Of the cereals, wheat is grown throughout the colony, but chiefly in the low
                    marginal division of the south-west and in the eastern midland districts; barley
                    and oats are general. Rye gives its name to the Roggeveld in the west, and is
                    chiefly grown there and in the lower hills of Namaqua Land; maize and millet are
                    cultivated in all moist situations of the north-east of the colony. Rice might
                    be extensively cultivated, and flourishes on the inundated banks of the Olifants
                    River in the west; the growth of potatoes has been much extended; melons,
                    cucumbers, beans, and pease are grown universally where there is water. Cotton
                    has been introduced experimentally in some districts; the cultivation of tobacco
                    is wide spread, that of the division of George, grown in the valley of the
                    eastern Olifants River, being most reputed.</p>
                <p>The larger and more important of the wild animals which once gave the Cape Colony
                    the character of the great hunting ground of the world have retreated before
                    advancing civilization, and few are now found within the frontier. The lion is
                    only to be met with now in the northern districts of Bushιuanland and in the
                    extreme north-eastern portion of the colony, and rarely in British Kaffraria.
                    The elephant, which also abounded at the time of the first Dutch settlement, is
                    now almost extinct in the colony, a few only existing in the forests between
                    Kaysna and the Zondag River in the extreme south. The rhinoceros and giraffe
                    have been driven far outside the frontier. Hippopotami are only found in the
                    coast rivers of British Kaffraria and in the lower Orange River. The buffalo
                    remains only perhaps in the Knysna forests and in the thickets of Great Fish
                    River. The Cape leopard, the hyena, the aard wolf or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proteles,</hi> and the jackal alone keep their ground, and are still common in
                    the colony. Quaggas and zebras are met with in large herds in the plains of the
                    Vaal, and sometimes extend into the colony as far as the divisions of Crad∩ck
                    and Graaf Reinet, where the gnu, hartebecste, and brindled gnu are also seen. Of
                    the many varieties of South African antelope the larger kinds—the eland, koodoo,
                    and sable and roan antelopes— are now banished from the colony, though the
                    smaller varieties are found along the coast region, and migratory herds of
                    springbok invade the plains of Bushmanland and Little Namaqua Land at certain
                    seasons. Ostriches, once numerous, are still thinly scattered over the colony,
                    though the supply of feathers is now mainly derived from regions north of the
                    Orange River. Ostrich farming and artificial incubation, carried on in the
                    northern, western, and eastern divisions, have, however, become of late years
                    one of the most profitable industries of the Cape,—the feathers bein∏∙ worth
                    from £30 to £60 per Ib.</p>
                <p>Birds of prey, including the bearded vulture, aasvogel, and several varieties of
                    eagles, hawks, and falcons, are numerous; cranes, stocks, flamingoes, and
                    pelicans are in large variety; partridges and pheasants, guinea fowl, and quails
                    abound. The bustard is found in several kinds, as well as ducks, wild geese, and
                    plovers.</p>
                <p>Upwards of forty varieties of edible fishes are caught in the seas surrounding
                    the Cape Colony, the waters of which also teem with whales, seals, and sharks.
                    Reptiles are exceedingly numerous; among the venomous snakes are the cobra di
                    capello and the puff adder; large toads and frogs are also common, as are
                    scorpions, tarantula spiders, hornets, and stinging ants.</p>
                <p>Sheep, cattle, and dogs of an inferior breed were possessed by the natives on the
                    discovery of the country. Horses, asses, goats, and cattle, introduced by the
                    earlier colonists, were found to thrive well. The merino breed of sheep is now
                    rapidly taking the place of the big-tailed sheep of the Dutch settlers; and some
                    of the central divisions have immense sheep farms, producing the wool which is
                    the great staple of the country’s export trade. The angora goat is now
                    extensively farmed, the hair being largely exported. Cows of the finest breeds
                    have also beenimported; the introduction of the English horse does not, however,
                    appear to have been successful, the older, heavier Spanish breed being better
                    adapted to the wants of the country.</p>
                <p>The numbers of live stock in the Cape Colony and its native districts are
                    estimated thus for 1875 :—</p>

                <p>The Cape of Good Hope was dιscoveιed by Bartholomew Diaz, the Portuguese
                    navigator, in 1486. He first landed at Algoa Bay, having, after exploring the
                    west coast, been driven out to sea by a storm. Thus accidentally doubling the
                    Cape, he saw it on his way back, and gave it the name of the Cape of Storms
                    (Cabo Tormentoso).</p>
                <p>The king of Portugal, however, gave it the more auspicious name it now bears, as
                    its discovery afforded a hope of a new and easier way of reaching India, the
                    great object of all the maritime expeditions of that age.</p>
                <p>The great navigator Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape in 1497, and carried the
                    Portuguese flag into the Indian seas. His countrymen, however, attracted by the
                    riches of the East, made no permanent settlement at the Cape, although they
                    frequently touched there on the voyage to India. But the Dutch, who, on the
                    decline of the Portuguese power, established themselves in the East, early saw
                    the importance of the place as a station where their vessels might take in water
                    and provisions. They did not, however, colonize it till 1652, when the Dutch
                    East India Company directed Jan Van Riebeeck, with a small party of colonists,
                    to form a settlement there. The country was at that time inhabited by a people
                    called Quaequae, but to whom the Dutch seem to have given the name of
                    Hottentots. The Riebeeck settlers had at first great difficulties and hardships
                    to endure, and their territory did not extend beyond a few miles round the site
                    of the present Cape Town, where they first fixed their abode. They gradually,
                    however, extended their limits, by driving the natives back or reducing them to
                    serfdom. These colonists, although under Dutch authority, were not wholly of
                    that nation, but consisted partly of persons of various nations, especially
                    Germans and Flemings, with a few Poles and Portuguese. They were for the most
                    part people of low station or indifferent character; there was, however, a small
                    number of a higher class, from whom was selected a council to assist the
                    governor. About the year 1686 the European population was increased by a number
                    of the French refugees who left their country on the revocation of the Edict of
                    Nantes. Our limits forbid our attempting to trace the history of the Cape Colony
                    during the lengthened period it remained under the Dutch Government. We may,
                    however, mention some of its prominent incidents, the effects of which are
                    visible in the colony to this hour.</p>

                <p>lsf, The Dutch, partly by so-called contracts, partly by force, gradually
                    deprived the Hottentots of their country. 2√, They reduced to slavery a large
                    part of that unfortunate people whom they did not destroy. 3cZ, They introduced
                    a number of Malays and negroes as slaves. <hi rend="smallcaps">4a4,</hi> They
                    established that narrow and tyrannical system of policy which they adopted in
                    other colonies, prescribing to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to
                    grow, demanding from them a large part of their produce, and harassing them with
                    other exactions tending to discourage industry and euterprιze. There is no doubt
                    that to this mischievous policy is due the origin of those unsettled habits,
                    that dislike to orderly government, and that desire to escape from its control,
                    which characterize a considerable part of the so-called Dutch boers of the
                    present day,—qualities utterly at variance with the character of the Dutch in
                    their native country, which were strongly manifested at the Cape, long before
                    they came under British rule and under those influences to which some
                    exclusively attribute the insubordination of those men. The attempts of the
                    boers to escape from the Dutch power, and so form an independent government
                    beyond the borders of the colony, especially in the district since called
                    Graaf-Reinet, are strikingly similar to their proceedings at a later date under
                    the British Government. <hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> The Gamtoos River formed the
                    boundary between the Hottentot aud Kaffre i aces, and was early adopted by the
                    Dutch as their eastern limit; but about the year 1740 they began to pass this
                    river, and came into collision with the Kaffres, and in 1780 they extended their
                    frontier to the Great Fish River.</p>
                <p>In 1795 the colonists, having imbibed the revolutionary principles then
                    prevailing in Europe, attempted to throw off the yoke of the Dutch, upon which
                    the British sent a fleet to support the authority of the Prince of Orange, and
                    took possession of the country in his name As, however, it was evident that
                    Holland would not be able to hold it, and that at a general peace it would be
                    made over to England, it was ruled by British governors till the year 1802,
                    when, at the peace of Amiens, it was again restored to Holland. In 1806, on the
                    renewal of the war, it was again taken by the British under Sir David Baird, and
                    has since remained in their possession, having been finally ceded by the king of
                    the Netherlands at the peace of 1815. At this time the limit of the colony was
                    formed by the Great Fish River and the line of the mountains south of
                    Bushmanland to the Büffels River and the Atlantic, the area being about 120,000
                    square miles, and the population little over 60,000. A summary may be given of
                    the chief events which have taken place since 1806</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">1st, The Kaffre Wars.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The first of
                    these wars took place in 1811— 12, and the second in 1819, when the boundary of
                    the colony was extended to the Keiskamma. The third occurred in 1835, under Sir
                    Benjamin D’Urban, when the boundary was-advanced to the Kei; but on the recall
                    of that officer the country between the Kei and Keιskamma rivers was restored to
                    the Kaffres. The fourth Kaffre war took place in 1846, and after being conducted
                    by governors Maitland and Pöttinger, it was terminated by Sir Harry Smith in
                    1848. The fifth war broke out at the end of 1850, and after being for some time
                    carried on by Governor Sir H. Smith, it was conducted in 1852 by Governor
                    Cathcart, and brought to a conclusion only in March 1853. During its progress an
                    armed police had been organized for the protection of the frontier, and British
                    Kaffraria was subsequently formed into a Crown colony, reserved at first for
                    occupation by Kaffres. A somewhat more detailed account of these wars will be
                    found under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Kaffrariλ.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >2d,</hi> In 1820, British emigrants, to the number of 5000, arrived at Algoa
                    Bay, and laid the foundation of the settlements on the eastern frontier which
                    have since become the most thriving part of the colony, including the important
                    towns of Graham’s Town and Port Elizabeth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> In 1834 the great measure of slave-emancipation took
                    effect in the Cape Colony. It has been of immense service in raising the
                    character and condition of the Hottentots and other races before held in
                    bondage, though many of the vices begotten by the state of slavery still adhere
                    to them. This measure gave great offence to the Dutch boers of the colony, aud
                    completed their already existing disaffection to the British rule.</p>
                <p>In 1835-6 a large number of these people resolved to free themselves from the
                    British Government by removing with their families beyond the limits of the
                    colony. With this object they sold their farms, mostly at a great sacrifice, and
                    crossed the Orange River into territories inhabited chiefly by tribes of the
                    Kaffre race. After meeting with great hardships and varied success in their
                    contests with the natives, a part of their number, under one Peter Retief,
                    crossed the Drakenberg Mountains and took possession of the district of Natal,
                    where they established a republican government, and maintained their ground
                    against powerful nations of Zulu Kaffres till 1842, when they were forced to
                    yield to the authority of the British Government, which took possession of
                    Natal.</p>
                <p>The boers beyond the Orange River and west of the Drakenberg still, however,
                    retained a sort of independence till 1848, when, in consequence of the lawless
                    state of the country, and the solicitation of part of the inhabitants, the
                    governor, Sir Harry Smith, declared the supremacy of the Crown over the
                    territory, which was thenceforth called the Orange River Sovereignty. Shortly
                    after this, in consequence, it was alleged, of certain acts of the British
                    Government in Natal, Andrew Pretorius, an intelligent boerof that district,
                    crossed the Drakenberg Mountains with his followers, and after being joined on
                    the western side by large numbers of disaffected boers, raised the standard of
                    rebellion. Upon this the governor, Sir H. Smith, crossed the Orange River at the
                    head of a detachment of troops, and. encountered and defeated the rebels in a
                    short but brilliant skirmish at Boem Plaats. After this Pretorius and the most
                    disaffected part of the boers retreated to beyond the Vaal River (the northern
                    limit of the sovereignty), where they established a government of their own.
                    They were subsequently, in 1852, absolved from their allegiance to the British
                    Crown by treaty with the governors and her Majesty’s commissioners for settling
                    frontier affairs.</p>
                <p>In 1853-54, in consequence of the troubled state of the Orange River Sovereignty,
                    and the difficulty of maintaining with becoming dignity the authority of her
                    Majesty there, it was resolved to abandon the country to the settlers, mostly
                    Dutch boers. This was carried into effect by a special commissioner, Sir George
                    Clerk, sent from England for the purpose; and the country, under the name of the
                    Orange Free State, is constituted a republic, with a president at its head,
                    assisted or controlled by an assembly called the Volksraad (people’s council),
                    elected by nearly universal suffrage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ith, The Convict Agitation.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> After
                    the British Government had felt itself compelled to discontinue the sending of
                    convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land, the subject of transportation
                    became one of great difficulty, the more so that an unusually large number of
                    prisoners was then on its hands in consequence of the prosecutions arising out
                    of the disturbed state of Ireland. Under these circumstances an Order in Council
                    was passed in 1848, under authority of the Act of 5 Geo. IV., authorizing the
                    secretary of state to send certain convicts to such colonies as he might think
                    proper. A circular was sent by Earl Grey, then colonial secretary, to the
                    governor of the Cape (among other colonial governors), requesting him to
                    ascertain the feelings of the colonists regarding the reception ofa certain
                    class of convicts. Unfortunately, owing to some misunderstanding, a vessel, the
                    “Neptune,” was despatched to the Cape before the opinion of the colonists had
                    been received, having on board 289 convicts, among whom were John Mitchell, the
                    Irish rebel, and his colleagues. When the news reached the Cape that this vessel
                    was on her way, the people of the colony became violently excited; and goaded to
                    fury by the inflammatory articles in the local newspapers, and guided by a few
                    demagogues, they established what was called the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Convict
                    Association,</hi> by which they bound themselves by a pledge to cease from all
                    intercourse of every kind with persons in any way connected “with the landing,
                    supplying, or employing convicts.” On the 19th of September 1849, the “Neptune”
                    arrived in Simon’s Bay; and when the intelligence reached Cape Town, the people
                    assembled in masses, and their behaviour was violent and outrageous in the
                    extreme. The governor, after adopting several resolutions, and again abandoning
                    them under the pressure of popular agitation, agreed not to land the convicts,
                    but to keep them on board ship in Simon’s Bay till he received orders to send
                    them elsewhere. Even this concession did not satisfy any but a small number of
                    more moderate men. The mass of the population, uuder the guidance or domination
                    of a few agitators, continued to do all in their power to prevent the convicts
                    and all the officers of the Government from obtaining supplies. When the Home
                    Government became aware of the state of affairs it immediately sent orders
                    directing the “Neptune” to proceed to Van Diemen’s Land, and the agitation
                    ceased. This agitation did not, however, pass away without important results,
                    since it led to another movement, the object of which was to obtain a free
                    representative government for the colony. This concession, which had been
                    previously promised by Lord Grey, was granted by her Majesty’s Government, and,
                    in 1853, a constitution was established of almost unexampled liberality.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> In 1857 án almost incredible delusion arose in the
                    Amaxosa <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n57/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0057-0046"/> tribe of British Kaffraria. It was predicted
                    among them that, on condition of a complete sacrifice of their lives and
                    property, a resurrection would take place on a certain day, in which all the
                    dead warriors and great men of the nation would arise in new strength; and
                    acting upon this faith nearly a third of the tribe, or about 50,000, perished in
                    a national suicide. The tracts thus depopulated were afterwards peopled by
                    European settlers, among whom were many of the German legion which had served
                    with the English army in the Crimea, and a body of upwards of ‘2000 industrious
                    North German emigrants, who proved to be a valuable acquisition to the
                    colony.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Qth,</hi> Public works in the colony marked an era in the
                    opening, in November 1863, of the railway from Cape Town to Wellington, begun in
                    1859, and, in 1860, of the great breakwater in Table Bay, long needed on that
                    perilous coast. In 1865 the province of British Kaffraria was incorporated with
                    the colony, under the title of the Electoral Divisions of King William’s Town
                    and East London. In the same year several important modifications of the
                    constitution were adopted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tt,h,</hi> The discovery of diamonds in the districts north of
                    the Orange River in 1867 drew the attention of the whole world to the colony,
                    and gave new life and impetus to every branch of industry, leading to the
                    annexation of the large territory of Griqua Land West to the British Crown. The
                    Basutos, a division of the Bechwana Kaffres, occupying the upper valleys of the
                    Orange River, had subsisted under a semi-protectorate of the British Government
                    from 1848 to 1854; but having been left to their own resources on the
                    abandonment of the Orange Sovereignty, they fell into a long exhaustive warfare
                    with the boers of the Free State. On the urgent petition of their chief Moshesh,
                    they were proclaimed British subjects in 1868, and their territory became part
                    of the colony by Act of Government of 1871.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">%th,</hi> More recently, in 1874 and 1875, large areas of
                    southern and northern Kaffraria, the Transkei territories of the Fingo and
                    Tambookie tribes, and the territory of Griqua Land East on the southern border
                    of Natal, have also come under British rale by the free consent of their
                    inhabitants. At the present moment attention is strongly directed towards the
                    consolidation of the European states of South Africa, and the introduction of
                    greater unity in their hitherto conflicting systems of government, with a view
                    to the more complete development of their great natural resources.</p>
                <p>A sum of five millions sterling voted by the Government is now (1876) being
                    expended in the construction of four trunk lines of railway:—one extending the
                    already existing line from Cape Town, two from Port Elizabeth, and one from East
                    London. The telegraphic wire now connects Cape Town with Port Elizabeth,
                    Grahamstown, King William’s Town, East London, Queenstown, Beaufort West, Graaf
                    Reinet, Cradock, Colesberg, and Kimberley in the diamond fields. Five steamers
                    now run between England and the Cape each month.</p>
                <p>Until the year 1873, the colony was divided for the purposes of administration
                    and election of members for the Legislative Council into two provinces, a
                    western and an eastern; but with the growth of the colony these were found to be
                    inconveniently large, and by an Act of Government, which became law in 1874, the
                    country was portioned out into seven <hi rend="italic">provinces;</hi> at about
                    the same time some new <hi rend="italic">divisions</hi> were formed within them
                    by the reduction of those already existing. Space does not admit of a special
                    description of each of these divisions; the following table, however, shows
                    their approximate area and the increase of their population from the date of the
                    first census in 1865 to that of 1875. The <hi rend="italic">native

                <p>The returns of population classified according to race have not yet been received
                    for the census of 1875. In 1865 the Europeans of the colony numbered 187,400 or
                    about 33 per cent, of the whole. The white or dominant population is composed of
                    colonial Dutch, who are most numerous in the western divisions: of Anglo-Saxons,

                <p>are in a majority in the east; and, in smaller proportions, of Germans,
                    descendants of French emigrants, and Portuguese. English, which is the language
                    of the legislation, is used in the seaports and eastern border towns, but Dutch
                    is still commonly used in many parts of the western and midland provinces. Of
                    thirty newspapers published in the colony twenty-five are English.</p>
                <p>The major part of the population of the colony, however, consists of Hottentots,
                    Malays, Negroes, and Kaffres. The aborigines with whom the first settlers at the
                    Cape came in contact had originally the generic name of Quaequae, and received
                    the name of Hottentots from the Dutch. Owing to intermarriages with Malays,
                    Negroes, and others, and illicit intercourse with the whites during the period
                    of slavery, the race has lost much of its distinctive character. In 1865 the
                    number of people distinguished as Hottentots was 82,000, nearly two-thirds of
                    whom were found in the western division. The Malays were introduced by the Dutch
                    as slaves; their descendants still retain the Mahometan religion, and most of
                    the distinctive habits and customs of their race. We have no means of
                    ascertaining their number, but it cannot be large. They are found chiefly
                    resident in the seaports. The negroes are mostly from the eastern coasts of
                    Africa. Griquas or Baastards are a mixed race sprung from the intercourse of the
                    Dutch boers or farmers with their Hottentot slaves. A great number of them
                    migrated from the colony in the early part of this century with the boers, and
                    settled between the Orange River and the Vaal under the chiefs Waterboerand Adam
                    Kok, in part of the territory now known as Griqua Land West. In 1852 Kok’s
                    people (about 15,000 in number) separated from the others, and migrated to the
                    district called Nomansland south of Natal, which had been depopulated by the
                    strifes of the Amapondo and Amabaca Kaffres, forming there the settlement called
                    Griqua Land East or New Griqua Land.</p>
                <p>The line of division between the native Hottentot (or Bushman) and Kaffre races
                    of South Africa passes south through the Cape Colony in about 26° E. long. The
                    Kaffres now resident within the colony proper are chiefly of the tribe of the
                    Amaxosa, with whom the colonists first came in contact at the line of the Great
                    Fish River in 1778, and the Fingoes. who originally came from Natal and its
                    vicinity; driven thence early in the present century by Chaka, a warlike chief
                    of the Zulu Kaffres, they took refuge with the tribes on the border of Cape
                    Colony. There they were reduced to a state of serfdom, from which they were
                    liberated by Sir Benjamin D’Urban after the third Kaffre war of 1835, when a
                    body of 16,000 of them came into the colony and settled in what is now the
                    division of Peddie. From this, again, the greater part of the Fingoes have moved
                    to the district now called Fingo Land, east of the River Kei, recently joined to
                    the colony. In 1865 the number of Kaffres within the limits of the colony was
                    not less than 164,500. The Kaffres of the native districts which have come under
                    British rule during the last three years are—</p>
                <p>(1.) The Basutos, sometimes called Mountain Bechwanas, the fragments of several
                    broken tribes of the ßechwana Kaffres which became united under the rule of
                    Chief Moshesh. Besides the inhabited districts of Basu to Land, they now occupy
                    the portion of Nomansland which lies between Griqua Land East and the range of
                    the Drakenberg. (2.) The Ama-baca, who appear to be divided,—one portion of the
                    tribe inhabiting the eastern third of Nomansland on the borders of Natal; the
                    other, under Chief Makaula, the north-eastern portion of St John’s Territory.
                    (3.) The Ama-xesibi, under Chief Jojo, in the country immediately south of
                    Griqua Land East. (4.) The Pondomisi, under the chiefs Umhlonhlo and Umditchwa,
                    occupying the southern portion of St John’s Territory. (5.) The Lehana, Zibi,
                    and Lebenya, small mountain tribes along the north-west side of St John’s
                    Territory. (6.) The Ttmbookies, one of the most numerous and powerful of the
                    Kaffre tribes, located in part within the colony proper, in the south-east of
                    the division of Wodehouse and the north-east of Queenstown, and in part
                    occupying the adjoining basin of the Tsomo, a tributary of the Kei River, in the
                    districts of their chiefs Gecelo, Stockwe, Matanzima, and Darala. The Tambookies
                    under Gangelizwe occupy the tract between the Bashca and the Umtata.</p>
                <p>AU these are now directly under British rule. The foUowing tribes of Kaffraria,
                    enclosed by British territory, still retain their independence. (1.) The
                    Ama-pondo, the largest tribe between the Cape Colony and Natal. These were also
                    formerly driven from a more northerly region by the Zulu Kaffres, and now occupy
                    the country on each side of the lower St John’s River, under their paramount
                    chief Umquikela Faku, his brother Damas ruling a smaller southern division of
                    the tribe; their numbers are estimated by missionaries resident among them at
                    not less than 160,000. (2.) The G’calecas and Bom-Vanas (Ama-bomvane), on the
                    coast-land between the Kei and the Umtata Rivers, of whom Kreli is paramount
                    chief, Moni the chief of the Bom-Vanas acknowledging his supremacy.</p>
                <p>Prior to 1827 there existed in the several districts of the colony an institution
                    established by the Dutch called the Board of Landrost and Heemraaden. The
                    landrost was the chief magistrate of the district, appointed and paid by the
                    Government. The heemraaden was a council to assist him, composed of respectable
                    inhabitants appointed by the governor, on the recommendation of the landrost.
                    These boards not only had the administration of the local affairs usually
                    entrusted to municipal bodies, but they also possessed extensive judicial
                    authority. In consequence of abuses, more especially in the exercise of the
                    latter functions, these institutions were abolished in 1827.</p>
                <p>Prior to 1837 the whole authority of the general Government was vested in the
                    governor, assisted by a small council of officials. In that year a legislative
                    council was established, consisting of certain Government officials, and five
                    persons nominated by the Crown. An executive council was also established to
                    assist the governor in executive matters, consisting of certain high officers of
                    Government. Such was the form of government till 1853, when the legislative
                    council as thus established was abolished, and a new constitution introduced.
                    Under this the legislature consists of the governor, appointed by the colonial
                    office for a term of six years, and two chambers, called the legislative council
                    and the house of assembly, both elected by the people. The former body was
                    latterly composed of eleven members for the western and ten for the eastern
                    province, chosen by the whole body of electors. But in 1873 a bill was
                    introduced for dividing the country into seven electoral provinces, to give a
                    more equable distribution of political influence, and to do away with the
                    separation of the colony into two parts; and by this arrangement each of the new
                    divisions is to return three members to the upper chamber. This bill became law
                    in 1874, but does not come into execution until the dissolution of the existing
                    council by expiration of the time of its session To qualify a man to be elected
                    for this chamber, he must possess property in land worth &lt;£2000, clear of
                    charges, or £4000 in landed and personal property together; he must be thirty
                    years of age, and must have been invited to become a candidate by written
                    requisition, signed by not less than twenty-five electors. The voting in this
                    election is cumulative,—that is, any elector may give all his votes (as many as
                    there are members to be chosen) to one candidate, or he may distribute them
                    among the candidates as he pleases. The council is elected for ten years, but so
                    that half its number, as near as may be, go out every five years.</p>
                <p>The legislative assembly is chosen by the electors of the towns and other
                    electoral districts into which the colony is divided. The candidates have to be
                    proposed and seconded at the hustings. There is no property qualification
                    required of the candidates. The assembly consists of sixty-eight members, and is
                    elected for five years.</p>
                <p>The qualification of electors of both houses is the same, namely, the occupation
                    of fixed property worth £25, or the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0059-0048"/> receipt of wages of not less than £50 a year. The
                    ministry under the governor includes a colonial secretary or premier, a
                    commissioner of crown lands and public works, an attorney-general, a
                    treasurer-general, and a secretary for native affairs. Since 1872 the ministιy
                    holds office, like the English cabinet, at the pleasure of the Parliament.</p>
                <p>The governor may dissolve both houses, or he may dissolve the house of assembly
                    without dissolving the council. He may give or refuse his assent to bills in the
                    Queen’s name, or he may reserve them for the decision of her Majesty. The Queen
                    may disallow any bill assented to by the governor at any time within two years
                    of its receipt. It is further provided, that all bills appropriating any part of
                    the revenues must be recommended to the house of assembly by the governor.</p>
                <p>The administration of justice is presided over by a supreme court of five
                    judges—a chief justice and four puisne judges. The chief justice with two judges
                    holds the supreme court in Cape Town; two other judges of the supreme court form
                    the “court of the eastern districts” held at Graham’s Town. The jurisdiction of
                    the court of Cape Town extends over the whole colony; that of Graham’s Town has
                    a concurrent jurisdiction over the eastern divisions. Circuit courts are held
                    throughout the colony twice yearly. Each division has a salaried magistrate who
                    is also civil comφissioner, and the magisterial courts have a limited
                    jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases. The civil commissioner presides over
                    the “divisional council” of his district, an elected body charged with the
                    superintendence of roads, boundaries, and other interests of the division. The
                    Roman or civil law, as received in Holland before the introduction of the Code
                    Napoleon there in 1811, was in force in Cape Colony at the time of its cession
                    to Britain, and remains authoritative, though a few modifications have been
                    sanctioned by Parliament.</p>
                <p>The Cape Colony possesses important British military and naval stations, and the
                    establishment maintained by the Home Government has always been very
                    considerable. This was especially the case during the Kaffre wars. In recent
                    years, however, a gradual reduction of the number of imperial troops in the
                    colony has taken place. In 1873 two British Infantry regiments, with detachments
                    of the Royal Artillery and Engineers, were quartered in the colony; but these
                    are kept at the Cape rather for the purposes of the Home Government than for the
                    domestic defence of the colony. A force named the Frontier Armed and Mounted
                    Police was organized for the latter purpose in 1853, and has been specially
                    serviceable in quelling disturbances on the interior borders of the country.
                    This force is divided into seven troops, and numbers 750 men. Small volunteer
                    corps of rifles and cavalry have been organized at various points of the eastern
                    and western divisions.</p>
                <p>The greater number of the Protestant denominations of the United Kingdom, as well
                    as the Roman Catholic Church, are represented in Cape Colony. The Dutch Reformed
                    Church, as might be anticipated from the early history of the country, is by far
                    the most numerous community. In form of government and in order of service it
                    closely resembles the Church of Scotland, to which country a considerable number
                    of its ministers belong. The Church of England has, perhaps, the next smaller
                    number of adherents. In 1847 a bishop of Cape Town was appointed to preside over
                    this church, whose diocese extended not only over Cape Colony and Natal, but
                    also over the island of St Helena, Later, however, separate bishops were
                    appointed for the eastern province (with the seat at Graham’s Town) and for
                    Natal. Wesleyan Methodists nearly equal the Anglicans in number, and have a
                    larger proportion of coloured people in their body than any other sect.
                    TheCongregationalists, including Independents and Baptists, are an important
                    body. Lutherans, Presbyterians, and other Protestant communities, such as the
                    Moravians, are in smaller numbers. The Roman Catholics have bishops in Cape Town
                    and Graham’s Town, but are comparatively few. Government provides an annual
                    grant for ecclesiastical purposes, which is distributed among the various
                    religious bodies, the Congregationalists alone declining to receive aid from the
                    state. According, however, to the provisions of the “Voluntary Act,” recently
                    passed, the grants in aid are to be continued only to present incumbents. There
                    are besides several foreign missions in the colony, the most important being the
                    Moravian, London, and Rhenish missionary societies. The Moravians have been
                    established there since 1732, and have laboured hard to convert the native
                    races.</p>
                <p>As early as 1839 a scheme of public schools, drawn up by Sir John Herschel, came
                    into operation, which was well adapted to the condition and circumstances of the
                    colony at that time. The Education Act of 1865, now in operation, is an advance
                    on this system, and provides three orders of schools adapted to the wants of the
                    main grades of the population, the Europeans, mixed races, and pure natives.
                    These orders comprise — (1) Undenominational public schools in each division of
                    the colony in three classes, subject to the inspection of a
                    superintendent-general of education, and having teachers whose salaries are
                    guaranteed; (2) Schools established by missionary societies to which Government
                    aid is granted under certain conditions for secular education; (3) Day schools
                    and industrial institutions for the civilization of the aborigines on the
                    frontiers of the colony. For higher education there are several colleges. The
                    South African college in Cape Town was founded in 1829, and in its higher
                    classes prepares for the European universities and for colonial examinations;
                    the college has a grant of £400 annually from Government. Graaf Reinet College,
                    on the same plan, has a similar subsidy. The Grey Institute, in Port Elizabeth;
                    Gill College, in Somerset East; the Diocesan College, under the bishop of Cape
                    Town, the first of the institutions of a purely denominational character; the
                    Theological Seminary of the Dutch Reformed Church at Stellenbosch; and four
                    educational institutions of the Roman Catholic Church, are the other schools of
                    higher education which are chiefly worthy of note. A public university, founded
                    on the plan of that of London, arose out of and superseded the Board of Public
                    Examiners (which had been constituted in 1858), and stands at the head of the
                    educational system of the colony; it was established by Act of Parliament in
                    1872. Liberal bursaries and scholarships have since been attached to it,
                    enabling students to continue their studies in Britain. The hospital of Cape
                    Town is so far recognized as a medical school by the Colleges of Surgeons and
                    Physicians, that students are allowed to spend two years of their course there
                    in qualifying for their degrees.</p>
                <p>The leading public institutions of the Cape Colony— the Royal Observatory, the
                    South African Public Library and Museum, and the Botanic Garden and Government
                    Herbarium—are noticed under <hi rend="smallcaps">Cape Town</hi> below. The
                    Albany or Graham’s Town Museum, the chief of the provincial institutions of this
                    kind, perhaps surpasses that of the capital in its collections and
                    classification of the natural products of Southern Africa. A colonial medical
                    committee, appointed by Government and presided over by a Government inspector
                    of hospitals, is at the head of the curative institutions of the colony, the
                    chief of which are the hospitals of Cape Town, the infirmary at Robben Island,
                    and those of Port Elizabeth, Graham’s Town, and King William’s Town, with the
                    numerous gaol hospitals throughout the country.</p>

                <p>The first newspaper of the colony, written in Dutch and English, was published in
                    1824, and its appearance marked an era not only in the literary but in the
                    political history of the colony, since it drew to a crisis the disputes which
                    had arisen between the colonists and the somewhat arrogant governor, Lord
                    Charles Somerset, who had issued a tyrannical decree prohibiting all persons
                    from convening or attending public meetings. Its criticisms on pubhc affairs
                    soon led to its suppression by the governor, and a memorial from the colonists
                    to the king petitioning for a free press was the result. This boon was secured
                    to the colony in 1828, and the press soon became a powerful agent, characterized
                    in an especial manner by public spirit and literary ability. There are now about
                    fifty newspapers and periodicals in English and Dutch, published in the Cape
                    Colony and Natal.</p>

                    declared value of the diamonds exported from the year of their discovery till
                    1874 was £743,000, but it is believed that diamonds to the value of upwards of
                    £10,000,000 have been taken from the mines of Griqua Land West.</p>
                <p>The copper ore of the Cape Colony is derived from the mines in Namaqua Land.
                    Since 1863, when this branch of mining became a settled industry, and the Cape
                    Copper Mining Company was formed, the exports of ore have risen steadily from an
                    annual total of 2900 tons to upwards of 13,000 tons. Wine was at one time the
                    staple export, and was imported in large quantity by England; falling into
                    disrepute there, the industry remained in a depressed state for many years, but
                    revived on the impulse given by the discovery of diamonds, and besides acquir
                    ing an increased consumption in the colony is again rising as an export.</p>
                <p>The imports of the colony consist mainly of manufactured goods, cloths and
                    hardwares, sugar and tobacco. The revenue of the colony is derived chiefly from
                    an <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> tax on all goods imported (with the
                    exception of agricultural machinery, animals, bullion, books, and un
                    manufactured African products), and on land sales and rents, and from a tax
                    called transfer-dues on the purchase money of all landed property sold,
                    stamp-duties, and postages. The expenditure is for payment of salaries of
                    officials and support of government. The colony incurs the expense of the
                    regiments of Cape mounted riflemen and police, but the British troops in the
                    colony are maintained by the Imperial Government at an annual cost of about
                    £200,000. The subjoined table shows the progress of the revenue and expenditure
                    of the colony :—</p>

                <p>The revenue of 1873 was abnormally increased by the raising of a loan of
                    £860,000, included in the statement, while the increased expenditure was caused
                    by outlay on public works. The revenue of 1874 was increased by a loan of
                    £369,400. The colony has a public debt, bearing interest at the rate of 6 per
                    cent., dating from 1859. The debt had reached the amount of £1,723,000 in
                    1874.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cape Town,</hi> the capital and seat of government of Cape
                    Colony, lies at the head of Table Bay. on the northern side of the peninsula
                    formed by Table Mountain, and 30 miles north of the Cape of Good Hope. It was
                    founded in 1652 by Van Riebeeck, and at first consisted of a few houses under
                    the shelter of a fort, at the mouth of the Zoeta or “Sweet Stream,” on the site
                    of which the still existing castle was built. The chief streets of the
                    increasing town were subsequently laid out at right angles, but the outer
                    streets and suburbs extend irregularly upwards. The town is now paved, and
                    lighted with gas, and has a regular water supply. Its architecture generally <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0061-0050"/> retains the features given to it by the earlier
                    settlers, the houses being of brick faced with stucco, with flat roofs and
                    cornices and raised platforms called “stoeps” in front; but these are rapidly
                    giving place to edifices of more modern design. Besides the castle, which is now
                    useless in a military point of view, being commanded by the surrounding heights,
                    the public buildings include the Government House (a modernized Dutch building),
                    the supreme courts, the art gallery, the exchange, the post-office, and the
                    public library (with upwards of 40,000 volumes) and museum, inaugurated in 1860,
                    perhaps the finest edifice in the city. New parliament houses are being built on
                    a magnificent scale, the legislature having voted a large sum for this purpose.
                    Cape Town is the seat of bishops of the Anglican and Roman churches.</p>
                <p>Among its ecclesiastical buildings the Roman Catholic cathedral, a Gothic
                    structure, is the most conspicuous. A university has been erected, and there are
                    several educational institutions. The botanical gardens, in the centre of the
                    town, serve the purposes of a park, and have been of great value in the
                    introduction to the colony of many trees, flowering plants, and fruits.</p>
                <p>The town is a municipality governed by a mayor and council. Its population,
                    amounting in 1875 to.nearly 33,000, is formed of many races; people of Dutch
                    descent are still more numerous than British, but all European nations are
                    represented. The “coolie” or labouring population comprises the descendants of
                    negro slaves, and halfbred Hottentots and Kaffres; the Malays form a numerous
                    class.</p>
                <p>Cape Town is the starting-point of the Great Western Railway, which at present
                    reaches Wellington, and is being extended towards Beaufort; and from the town
                    communications are maintained by post, cart, or waggon, with all chief points in
                    the interior. Besides being a market for home produce, Cape Town imports
                    manufactured articles for the greater part of the western provinces, and has a
                    large export trade in copper, wool, wine, fish, and fruit; the construction of a
                    breakwater and docks in Table Bay having rendered shipping more secure and
                    facilitated traffic. Several lines of steamers maintain regular communication
                    with Cape Town both from Europe and from India, passing along the eastern and
                    western sides of the continent.</p>
                <p>The scenery round the head of Table Bay Is very striking. Table Mountain, with
                    its branches the Devil’s Peak and Lion’s Head, rises in a massive wall
                    immediately at the back of Cape Town. During the prevalence of south-east winds
                    it is covered by a dense whitish cloud, partially overlapping its side like a
                    table-cloth. Along the base of this mountain, where lie the suburban villages of
                    Ron-debosch, Claremont, Wynberg, and Constantia, the land is covered with
                    luxuriant vegetation, including oaks and firs, with gardens of flowers and
                    shrubs (especially of heaths) and vineyards, and is studded with villas.</p>
                <p>The Royal Observatory of the Cape, established in 1820 —one of the most valuable
                    of those supported by the British Government—is three miles east of Cape
                    Town.</p>
