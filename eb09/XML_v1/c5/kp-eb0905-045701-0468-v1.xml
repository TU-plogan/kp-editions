                    (1514-1557), was born of good family at Cambridge, and was educated at St John’s
                    College. His learning gained him the position of king’s scholar, and in 1540 he
                    was chosen to fill the chair of Greek then instituted by Henry VIII. Together
                    with Sir Thomas Smith he has the honour of being one of the first who revived
                    the knowledge of that language in England. He specially interested himself in
                    its pronunciation; and he finally carried his point, through his popularity with
                    the students, notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of the chancellor, Bishop
                    Gardiner. Among those whom he taught were William Cecil and Roger Ascham, the
                    latter of whom, in his <hi rend="italic">Schoolmaster,</hi> gave him the highest
                    praise both for scholarship and character. About 1544 he was appointed tutor to
                    Prince Edward, and on the accession of his pupil to the throne he received
                    several considerable grants, and, among other honours, rose to the position of
                    secretary of state. Unfortunately for himself he followed the duke of
                    Northumberland, and acted as secretary to Lady Jane Grey during her nine days’
                    nominal reign. In consequence Mary threw him into the Tower, and confiscated his
                    wealth. In September 1554 he obtained his liberty, with leave to travel abroad.
                    He visited Italy, gave lectures on Greek at Padua, and afterwards was forced to
                    support himself by teaching that language at Strasburg. In 1556 he was lured to
                    Brussels by a message that his wife was in that town, and, on his way thither,
                    was seized by order of Philip of Spain, and again brought to the Tower. He was
                    immediately visited by two Catholic priests, who failed to convert him till he
                    was informed that he must recant or be burned. Upon this he yielded, and made
                    two public recantations. He did not long survive his disgrace, and in September
                    1557 he died in London. Perhaps the most interesting of Cheke’s works is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hurt of Sedition</hi> (1549), which gives advice to the people who
                    had risen in rebellion under Ket. To seek equality, he argues, is to make all
                    poor; and, besides, “riches and inheritance be God’s providence, and given to
                    whom of His wisdom He thinketh good.” He also wrote Latin translations of some
