                    (1503-1576), a Spanish primate and theologian, was bom of noble family at
                    Miranda in Navarre, in 1503. He studied at the university of Alcala, and entered
                    the Dominican order. The only Spaniard who could pretend to rival him in
                    learning was Melchior Canus, and as professor of theology at Valladolid he
                    gained so brilliant a reputation that students flocked thither from all parts of
                    Spain to hear him. Charles V. selected him as envoy to the Council of Trent
                    (1546). At this council he earnestly maintained that it was the duty of priests
                    to reside in their benefices; and next year he (1547) followed up this appeal by
                    publishing at Venice <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">necessaria
                    residentia episcoporum et aliarum pastorum.</hi> He was also chosen by Charles
                    to accompany to England the prince who afterwards became Philip II., on the
                    visit which he made for the purpose of marrying Mary. Carranza became that
                    queen’s confessor, and laboured very zealously for the re-establishment of Roman
                    Catholicism. In 1557 Philip appointed him to the archbishopric of Toledo, a post
                    he was very reluctant to accept, as he foresaw the jealousy which his promotion
                    would arouse; and indeed the bishop of Lérida the very next year denounced him
                    to the Inquisition as a heretic, taking as pretext his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentarios</hi><hi rend="italic">sobre</hi><hi rend="italic">el catechismo
                    Christiano,</hi> published that year at Antwerp, though that book was approved
                    by a commission of the Council of Trent. It was placed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Index</hi><hi rend="italic">Expurga·</hi><hi rend="italic">torius,</hi> and
                    Carranza was imprisoned for eight years, after which, on appealing to Rome, he
                    was taken thither and confined (1566-1576) in the castle of St Angelo. In 1576
                    he received final sentence, being made to abjure opinions which he had never
                    held, suspended from his archbishopric for five years, and banished to the
                    Dominican convent of Minerva. Seven days after this judgment he died. The people
                    of Spain honoured him as a saint, and Gregory XĬIL placed a highly laudatory
                    inscription on his tomb. His most famous work, <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi

                    considerable value, and has been frequently reprinted.</p>
