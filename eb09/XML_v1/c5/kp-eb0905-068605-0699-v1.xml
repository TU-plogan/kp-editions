                    the name applied to the royalist insurgents in the west of France, at the time
                    of the Revolution. It has been suggested that the name arose from the cry they
                    used when approaching their nocturnal rendezvous; but it is also maintained that
                    it was derived from a nickname applied to their leader Jean Cottereau.
                    Originally a contraband manufacturer of salt, Cottereau had been seized in a
                    scuffle <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n700/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0700-0687"/> with the Government officers, and condemned to
                    death, but his mother’s entreaty gained his pardon from Louis XVI., and he never
                    forgot his benefactor. He then became a soldier but deserted, and was
                    imprisoned; on his release he settled down in a legal occupation, and joined the
                    national guard. On the outbreak of the Revolution he gathered round him a band
                    of royalist peasantry with whom he retired to the wood of Misdon, where they
                    lived in huts and subterranean chambers. From Lower Maine the insurrection soon
                    spread to Brittany, and throughout the west of France. In 1793 Cottereau joined
                    Laval with some 500 men; and the band grew rapidly and swelled into a
                    considerable army, which assumed the name of La Petite Vendée. Cottereau greatly
                    distinguished himself by his personal bravery and his military ability. But
                    after the decisive defeats at Le Mans and Savenay, he retired again to his old
                    haunts in the wood of Misdon, and resumed his old course of guerilla warfare.
                    Misfortunes here increased upon him, until through treachery he fell into an
                    ambuscade and was mortally wounded. He died among his followers, July 28, 1794.
                    Ignorant as he was, he appears to have been a man of no slight ability. His
                    gratitude was intense; and his magnanimity was such that he is said on several
                    occasions to have spared those who had most deeply injured him. After the death
                    of Cottereau, the chief leaders of the Chouans were Georges Cadoudal and a man
                    who went by the name of Jambe d’Argent. For several months the Chouans continued
                    their petty warfare, which was disgraced by many acts of ferocity and rapine; in
                    August 1795 they dispersed. See Duchémin-Descepeaux, <hi rend="italic">Lettres
