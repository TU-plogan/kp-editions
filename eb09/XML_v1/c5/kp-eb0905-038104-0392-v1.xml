                <p><label type="entry">CHAMELEON</label>, the common name of a well-defined family
                    of Lizards, forming the tribe <hi rend="italic">Dendrosaura,</hi> and containing
                    the single genus <hi rend="italic">Chamoelo,</hi> which includes about twenty
                    known species, bearing a close family resemblance to each other, and differing
                    very widely from all other lizards. They are small creatures, not usually
                    exceeding 7 inches in length exclusive of the tail, which in general is as long
                    as the body. The body is greatly compressed, often with a crest—toothed or
                    otherwise—along the back and belly, and the skin is covered with granular
                    specks, giving it the appearance of shagreen. The large pyramidal head is
                    supported by a short neck composed of five vertebrae, instead of eight, as in
                    the majority of saurians; and there is no true sternum, although the anterior
                    ribs are joined to the mesial line, which thus takes the place of a breast-bone,
                    while the ribs which follow are so connected together as to form a bony circle
                    for the protection of the abdominal region. Unlike other lizards, the chameleon
                    has the body raised high on its legs, and the toes, which are five in number on
                    both posterior and anterior limbs, are divided into two opposable groups or
                    bundles, closely resembling those of a parrot, and equally serving the purpose
                    of prehension. The tail, by the greater thickness of which at the base the male
                    is distinguishable from the female, is also prehensile, and is of the greatest
                    service in giving support and security to the climbing chameleon. The lungs are
                    large, and are connected with air-vessels distributed throughout the body, by
                    the inflation of which a certain transparency is given to the body, as well as a
                    plumpness which at once disappears on their collapse, and this, together with
                    the fact that the chameleon can live apparently in a thriving condition for
                    weeks without food, seems to have given rise to the ancient belief that this
                    singular creature lived on air. The eyes of the chameleon are large, globular,
                    and covered with a circular disk formed by the junction cf the two lids and
                    having a central aperture which acts as an external pupil, being capable of
                    dilatation or contraction <pb break="no"

                    each other, so that while the one stares upwards the other may be eagerly
                    following the motions of an insect beneath, or the one may even be directed
                    backwards while the other watches in front. This extraordinary range of vision
                    amply compensates for the small degree of mobility in the neck and the general
                    slowness of motion characteristic of the chameleon. The tongue is equally
                    remarkable, being sub-cylindrical, worm-like, and extremely extensile, with the
                    end somewhat enlarged and hollow, and supplied with a glutinous secretion. It is
                    by means of this organ, which is capable of being protruded to a length of six
                    or seven inches, that chameleons obtain their food. They are arboreal in their
                    habits, supporting themselves on the branches of trees by their grasping
                    hand-like feet and prehensile tails. In their movements they are slow and
                    deliberate, and when watching for the insects which form their sole food, they
                    remain motionless for hours, partly concealed by the foliage, and still more by
                    the exercise of the faculty which they possess above all other creatures of
                    changing their colour so as to resemble surrounding objects. Their power in this
                    direction has, however, been greatly exaggerated. They cannot, as was at one
                    time supposed, assume in succession all the colours of the rainbow; but under
                    certain conditions, by no means well ascertained, their normal bluish ash colour
                    may give place to a green or yellowish hue, with irregular spots of a dull red,
                    or it may become considerably paler so as to approach to whiteness. Thus an
                    observer reports recently that he saw a chameleon making its way along the top
                    of an old wall near Ephesus, the stones of which were of a dark colour,
                    occasionally varied by a block of white marble, and he noticed that no sooner
                    did the creature rest on one of the latter than it gradually became less
                    visible, owing evidently to its assumption of a colour somewhat harmonizing with
                    the marble on which it rested. This curious phenomenon was observed by the
                    earliest writers on natural history, and gave rise to much speculation.
                    Aristotle held that the change of colour only took place when the chameleon was
                    inflated with air, to which therefore it was owing; Pliny that its varying
                    colours were borrowed from surrounding objects; while Wormius was the first to
                    attribute those variations to the play of the emotions and passions; but Milne
                    Edwards, in a paper published in the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Sciences,</hi> showed that, whatever the exciting cause of
                    these changes in colour, whether due to the emotions, the inflation of the
                    lungs, or exposure to the sun’s rays, they were rendered possible only by the
                    presence in the skin of the chameleon of two layers of differently-coloured
                    pigment, placed one over the other, and so arranged that both may appear
                    simultaneously on the surface, or the one may be displaced to a greater or less
                    extent by the other, the colour varying with the amount of such displacement.
                    Thus protected by its colouring, the chameleon awaits the coming of its prey,
                    and no sooner does an insect place itself within reach of its worm-like tongue
                    than that organ, leaping forth from its sheath with lightning speed, fixes its
                    victim on the glutinous tip, which is forthwith engulphed with equally
                    astonishing rapidity. The eggs of the chameleon are deposited under leaves on
                    the ground. They are numerous, round, and covered with an exceedingly porous
                    shell formed of calcareous matter. The species composing the family are
                    inhabitants chiefly of Africa and the islands adjacent, notably of Madagascar,
                    to which about a third of all the known species are confined. The latter include
                    such curious forms as the Rhinoceros Chameleon, the male of which has a
                    horn-like tubercle at the end of the muzzle; also a form recently described by
                    Günther, in which the tail is so short as to be almost useless for prehension, a
                    defect which seems compensated for by the presence of an additional denticle at
                    the inner base of each claw, and of a spine projecting from the side of each
                    finger and toe, which must add greatly to the creature’s prehensile power. Owing
                    to this peculiarity Günther proposes to make it the type of a new genus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proceedings of the Zoological Society,</hi> 1874). Fernando Po is
                    the home of the Three-Horned Chameleon <hi rend="italic">(Chamaeleo
                    Oιveni),</hi> which has a long conical horn over each eye, and another at the
                    extremity of the muzzle; but the best known and most widely distributed species
                    is the Common Chameleon <hi rend="italic">(C. vulgaris),</hi> found in Southern
                    Asia and the north of Africa, and naturalized in the southern countries of
                    Europe. It is often brought to England, but owing to the coldness of the climate
                    it exists there in a more or less torpid condition, and soon dies.</p>
