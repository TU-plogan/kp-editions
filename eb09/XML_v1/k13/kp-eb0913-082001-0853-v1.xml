                <p><label type="entry">KÂFIRISTÁN</label>. This Persian term, signifying “the
                    country of Kâfirs,” or unbelievers (in Islâm), has within the last hundred years
                    become established in geography as the name of a mountain tract on the north of
                    Afghanistan, occupied by tribes which have resisted conversion to the faith
                    which prevails on every side. This faith has no doubt continually gained upon
                    these tribes more or less, and with this encroachment the limits of the Kafir
                    country have shrunk; but the encroachment does not appear to have been large
                    since the name became recognized in geography. Thus Baber (c. 1504) speaks of a
                    certain place (Chaghânserâi, in recent maps “Chegarserai ”) as in the very jaws
                    of Kafiristan, and this continued to apply forty years ago, if not now. Only it
                    is clear that in his time the Kafirs occupied tracts about Bajaur, east of the
                    Kuner river, which they do not pass now except on raids. The country has never
                    been entered, and even the bordering Mahometan tracts have only here and there
                    been touched, by any European, so that we know hardly anything of its internal
                    geography, and not even the external geography with any precision. The northern
                    boundary may be taken as that unvisited part of the watershed of Hindû Kûsh
                    which lies between the Dorah Pass (71° 17' E. long.) and the Kbâwak Pass (69°
                    53' E. long.) leading into the Andarâb valley of the province of Kunduz (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Afghan Turkestan,</hi> vol. ii. 242). On the east it is limited
                    by Chitrâl or Kâshkâr; on the south and west it is more difficult to define. But
                    35° N. lat. and 70° E. long, will mark these limits roughly, though the Kafir
                    tribes seem still to extend south of the former line above Jalâlâbâd, whilst
                    their limits are <pb break="no"

                    Indeed Kafir villages, though now deserted, exist within Darah Nûr, only 20
                    miles from Jalâlâbâd. It is believed that the Kafir settlements on some points
                    also pass to the north of Hindu Kush.</p>
                <p>Tribes of Kafir kindred, subdued and converted by the Mahometans in comparatively
                    recent times are known as <hi rend="italic">Nîmcha,</hi> or “half-and-half.”
                    Many of these are on good terms with the Kafirs, and trade is carried on through
                    their mediation. A most interesting account by LieutenantColonel Tanner, of some
                    tribes of this class, will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Geog.
                    Sοc.</hi> quoted below.</p>
                <p>The most important portion of the Kafir tribes apparently occupies the valleys
                    which drain (by the Pech river) into the Kuner or Chitrâl river, below
                    Chaghanserai, in about 34° 49' N. lat. The most easterly occupy the valley
                    running south from the Dorah Pass, and joining the same river at Birkot, about
                    35° 15' N. lat. Others are on the headwaters of the Alingar and Alishang rivers,
                    which join in Laghmân, and the most westerly on the sources of the river of
                    Tagâo.</p>
                <p>Surrounded by people professing Islam and cherishing slavery, the Kafirs are
                    naturally objects of kidnapping incursions, and these they revenge by sallies
                    from their mountain fastnesses to plunder and kill. Wood, in 1838, found the
                    valley of the Upper Kokcha in Badakhshan deserted on account of Kafir forays.
                    The Lahori Pass from Dir into Chitrâl was within recent years so beset by Kafir
                    robbers that many Mussulman wayfarers were annually killed, whose graves were
                    marked by cairns and flags, and designated “The Tombs of the Martyrs.” Hundreds
                    of those dismal memorials lined the road and damped the traveller’s spirits.
                    Raverty mentions a savage invasion of Kafiristan made some thirty years ago by
                    the chief of Bajaur from the south-east, in which villages were sacked and
                    burnt, and the people carried off and sold. Faiz Bakhsh speaks of a like
                    invasion from the north in 1870 by the prince of Badakhshan, which penetrated by
                    the Dozakh Darah or “Hell-glen” to Katôr (which he calls the Kafir capital),
                    bringing back a large number of captives, whom he saw at Faizabad. Whatever
                    difficulty from within prevents the exploration of the Kafir country is due
                    apparently to this atrocious treatment at the hands of their Moslem
                    neighbours.</p>
                <p>But the Kafir wars are far from being all external. Some of the tribes wage war
                    with one another, so constant and deadly that Biddulph says their fights with
                    their Mussulman neighbours are comparatively desultory and harmless. Kafirs are
                    said, however, never to kill men of their own village.</p>
                <p>The country is, as far as can be gathered, a land of lofty mountains, dizzy
                    paths, and hair-rope bridges swinging over torrents, of narrow valleys
                    laboriously terraced, but of wine, milk, and honey rather than of agriculture;
                    the valleys on the eastern side, however, are described as thickly wooded and
                    very fertile. Though table-lands are spoken of, arable land is scanty. Over the
                    greater part of the country the winter is severe; hence the people depend much
                    on dairy-produce, and consume vast quantities of cheese and curd, besides meat,
                    and fruit, fresh or dried.</p>
                <p>The hill country of the Kafirs, and of kindred races long continuing in paganism,
                    which extended from the north of Cabul to the borders of Kashmir, was known to
                    mediaeval Asiatics, more or less loosely, as <hi rend="italic">Bilαur, a</hi>
                    name of ancient origin, which we find in Marco Polo as <hi rend="italic">Bοlοr.
                    Ρashai</hi> also, from the name of one of those races now Mussulman, seems to
                    have had a vague application to part of this region; this name also occurs both
                    in Marco Polo and in Ibn Batuta. <hi rend="italic">Kai6r</hi> likewise has
                    sometimes received a like vague extension.</p>
                <p>The first distinct mention of Kafirs as a separate race seems to be in the
                    history of Timur. When that prince, in March 1398, arrived at Andarâb on his way
                    to invade India, he was met with a cry for help against the Katôr and Siâh-posh
                    (or “black-clothed ”) Kafirs; and he entered the country of the Katôr from the
                    upper part of the Panjhir valley. It was still winter in the highlands, and the
                    difficulties were great. Timur himself was let down the snows by <hi
                    rend="italic">glissade</hi> in a basket guided by ropes. The chief of the Kafirs
                    was called the ruler of Katôr, a title which is possibly preserved in the title
                    of the king of Chitrâl (see <hi rend="smallcaps">KÂshkÂr),</hi> besides
                    surviving in the name of one of the greater Kafir tribes. Timur distinguishes
                    between Katôr and Siâh-posh; for he speaks of detaching 10,000 horse against the
                    Siâh-posh country, which lay to the left,—therefore, it would seem, to the north
                    of the country entered by him. This detachment met with great disaster. Timur
                    himself’ claims decided success, but probably found the country quite
                    impracticable, for he speedily emerged again at Khâwak. He speaks of the
                    abundant fruit trees, of the wine, of the language “distinct from Turki,
                    Persian, Hindi, and Kashmiri,” of the weapons as arrows, swords, and slings. The
                    nιler was styled <hi rend="italic">'AdâlshÛ,</hi> his residence <hi
                    rend="italic">Jοrkal,</hi> and another large place <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shοkal.</hi> Timor caused an inscription to be cut in the defiles of Katôr
                    recording his invasion and its route. Masson tells us that in the Kafir country,
                    on the Najil or Alishang river, there is a structure, still known as Timur’s
                    castle.</p>
                <p>We hear of the Kafirs again in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of Baber, of
                    their raids in Panjhir, of their wine and fondness for it,—every man carrying
                    slung round his neck a <hi rend="italic">khig</hi> or leathern bottle. The
                    ,occasional mentions of the Kafirs in the <hi rend="italic">Ain-i·Akbari</hi>
                    seem borrowed from Baber, but this work contains another passage (Gladwin’s
                    translation, 1784, ii. 195) which, probably originated a story about the Kafirs’
                    descent from Greeks, not yet quite obsolete in Europe. In fact, however, the
                    passage does not appear to refer to the “Kafirs” at all, but to the claim to
                    descent from Alexander of the princes reigning in Swat before the present
                    Yuzufzai,-a claim remarkable enough in itself, and maintained by many other
                    princes of the hill states north of Hindu Kush.</p>
                <p>Again, Benedict Goes, travelling from Peshawar to Cabul in 1603, heard of a city
                    (or country) called <hi rend="italic">Capperstam,</hi> into which no Mahometan
                    might enter on pain of death. Hindu traders might enter, though not into the
                    temples. The people were said never themselves to enter their temples except in
                    black dresses. The country abounded in grapes; the natives drank wine, of which
                    Goes tasted; and all this was so strange that he suspected the people might be
                    Christians. Little or nothing is heard of the Kafirs after this till the
                    publication of RennelΓs <hi rend="italic">Memoir of a Map of Hindostan</hi>
                    (1788),—followed twenty-six years later by Elphinstone’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caubul,</hi> in which a considerable amount of substantial information
                    regarding the Kafirs was given by that admirable writer, of whom the Afghans
                    believed, and with justice, that he had a telescope with which he could see what
                    passed on the other side of a mountain."</p>
                <p>The most favourable opportunity ever offered for the exploration of Kafiristan
                    was during the British occupation of Cabul in 1839-40; and a Kafir deputation
                    invited a visit from those whom they had been led to regard as kindred. But they
                    were coldly received, owing to the great jealousy of such intercourse shown by
                    the Afghans.</p>
                <p>Colonel Tanner of the Artillery made a spirited attempt to reach the country from
                    Jalâlâbâd in 1879, and spent some time among the Mahometans of Darah Nûr, whose
                    language and customs indicate affinity to their heathen neighbours. But he was
                    carried away dangerously ill, on the very day when a Kafir party arrived at the
                    village to escort him into their country. Similar invitations were brought to
                    Major Biddulph in Chitrâl in 1878. This officer was unable to avail himself of
                    these, but he had unusual opportunities of seeing and gaining information about
                    the people, and his chapter on the <hi rend="italic">Siâh-posh</hi> is the most
                    authentic account yet available. But there are no doubt local differences, and
                    we must not assume that to be untrue which varies from Biddulph’s
                    statements.</p>
                <p>The Kafirs are in fact only an aggregation of tribes, probably belonging to one
                    general race, but whose present close juxtaposition is the result of various
                    accidents and invasions which have driven them, in part at least, from the lower
                    countries, and concentrated them in this highland region. They have themselves
                    vague stories to this effect, and (like the Karens of Burmah) one that they
                    formerly possessed writing. Elphinstone heard a Kafir story that brought them
                    from Kandahâr. This may have been a dim tradition, not of the place now so
                    called, but of the Kandahar of the older Arab geographers, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gandaritis</hi> of Ptolemy, and <hi rend="italic">Gandhara</hi> of the Hindu
                    books, viz., the region <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n855/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0855-0822"/> of Peshawar and Yusufzai. A clan of the now
                    Moslem tribe of Sâfis is called <hi rend="italic">Gandhärai.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Kamoz</hi> tribe of Kafirs have been surmised to be living
                    representatives of the Kambojas of early Sanskrit, whose name was borrowed by
                    that region in the far East in whose forest depths religions of Indian origin
                    reared weird and stupendous fanes, lately made known. In two other Kafir clans,
                    Aspins and Ashkins, one is tempted to trace remnants of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aspasii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ässaceni</hi> of Alexander’s historians,
                    whose seat was about Kuner, Bajaur, and Dir.</p>
                <p>The people are recognized from outside as <hi rend="italic">Kâfirs</hi>
                    (“infidels”) or <hi rend="italic">Siâh-posh</hi> (“black-clad”—compare the <hi
                    rend="italic">Melanehlaeni</hi> of ancient Scythia); but they use no collective
                    term as applicable to themselves; in many cases different tribes are unable to
                    converse with each other; and apparently they recognize no common tie of
                    nationality. If hard pushed, or speaking with foreigners, they will thus employ
                    the word <hi rend="italic">Kappra</hi> (tor <hi rend="italic">Kafir),</hi> but
                    so also a Hindu talking to an Englishman will sometimes use the term <hi
                    rend="italic">Kdld</hi><hi rend="italic">âdmi</hi> (“black man ”) collectively
                    of his countrymen.</p>
                <p>The variations in the catalogue of tribes given are endless; indeed, Tanner says
                    explicitly that he never found two people who agreed in the names of four out of
                    five, and the variation in actual lists is greater than this. Major Biddulph’s
                    information leads him to divide the whole body into three main tribes (or
                    perhaps topographical divisions) (1) <hi rend="italic">Bashgalis,</hi> occupying
                    the eastern valley adjoining Chitrâl, partially tributary to that state,—their
                    principal clan being divided into Kamoz andKamtoz; (2) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Waigalis,</hi> occupying the Pech valley and its upper waters; (3) <hi
                    rend="italic">Ramgalis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lam-galis,</hi> on the upper
                    waters of the streams descending towards Laghmân (formerly <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lamghdri)</hi> and Cabul, and also apparently extending north of the great
                    watershed. But these great tribes are subdivided into numerous clans, of which
                    the Waigalis alone count eighteen. There are also broken clans, like the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kaldshas,</hi> adjoining Chitrâl, a degraded race who are claimed
                    by the Bashgalis as their slaves, and the <hi rend="italic">KMigalis,</hi> a
                    small tribe near the watershed who are subject to Munjân, one of the highland
                    cantons of Badakhshan.</p>
                <p>More copious lists of tribes have been given by Elphinstone (three lists on
                    different authorities), and by Raverty, Lumsden, Bellew, &amp;c. We may notice
                    that all lists give a prominent place to the <hi rend="italic">Katbr</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Katdr</hi> (see above). Other names that appear in several lists
                    are <hi rend="italic">Wdi</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Wdigal</hi> (already named
                    from Biddulph); <hi rend="italic">Kdm,</hi> in various forms; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wdmah,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sdnu,</hi> which, we learn from Tanner, are
                    names for one great tribe; <hi rend="italic">Pashd-gar</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pashd-gri,</hi> suggestive of connexion with the now Mahometanized <hi
                    rend="italic">Pashais</hi> of the Cabul highlands, spoken of above; <hi
                    rend="italic">Munde-gal, Paruni, Traiegama, Gambir</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gimir, Ashkong</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Askin, Ashpin</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Ishpi,</hi><hi rend="italic">Nisha</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nishai,</hi> &amp;c. The affix <hi rend="italic">gale</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gali,</hi> which attaches to several Kafir names of place and tribe, is to be
                    ascribed to a word <hi rend="italic">gal</hi> signifying “country.” The
                    characteristics of some tribes were given to Tanner by their <hi rend="italic"
                    >(gιimcha)</hi> neighbours the Chugânîs, and ran thus: “In Kafir land are many
                    languages, many tribes with different tongues. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Katawas</hi> (Katôrs ?) are horsemen. The <hi rend="italic">Parunis</hi> have
                    no guns, they kill men with clubs. The <hi rend="italic">Majgalis</hi> are
                    beautiful; they have guns and are marksmen; they are men of the chase, very
                    active and swift. The <hi rend="italic">Warnas</hi> are the nicest of all. But
                    the <hi rend="italic">Katawas</hi> (Katôrs ?) are chief before the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wamas.^</hi> And the <hi rend="italic">Nishai</hi> are fairer than
                    the <hi rend="italic">Warnas.”</hi></p>
                <p>In regard to the general aspect and complexion of the Kafirs, accounts have
                    varied. Dr Trumpp, a learned missionary, who examined three Kafirs at Peshawar,
                    declares them to have been in all respects like natives of Upper India, with
                    dark hair and eyes and swarthy colour, tinged with ruddiness due to wine. On the
                    other hand Burnes, Atkinson, Wood, and Masson all speak of their blue eyes,
                    nearly all of their brown hair. Bellew describes Faramorz Khan, an officer of
                    Kafir birth in the Afghan service, as of fair, almost florid complexion, and
                    light brown hair, hardly to be distinguished from an Englishman. And, unless
                    their fairness were a general characteristic, one hardly sees how the story
                    current among themselves of their kin to us could have found vogue. The fact
                    seems to be, as Biddulph states, and as the Chugâni characterization quoted
                    above implies, that they differ considerably in complexion, some of those living
                    at high elevations being very fair. In feature those whom he saw were pure
                    Aryans of a high type,—the women handsome (as all native reports make them),
                    with brown hair and eyes, sometimes very fair. Indeed, Sir H. Rawlinson, who
                    repeatedly saw Kafirs at Cabul in 1838-40, has stated that the most beautiful
                    Oriental lady he ever had seen was a Kafir slave; by loosening her golden hair
                    she could cover herself completely from head to foot as with a veil.</p>
                <p>The current tale has always been like that told to Goes in 1603 that no Mussulman
                    could enter their land and live. This is true of any one entering without
                    warning; but, on the eastern side at least, they receive visitors when passed in
                    by one of themselves. Thus pedlers with wares from Peshawar enter; and
                    Mahometans from Chitrâl are occasionally allowed to enter the country for sport,
                    and enjoy the hospitality for which the Kafirs are famed. The assurance that
                    they would welcome the visits of Christians has been general, and the invitation
                    often given. Two Afghans from Peshawar, Christian converts, on the invita tion
                    of a Kafir who had been a soldier in the Guides under Colonel (now Sir Harry)
                    Lumsden, visited the Kafir country in 1864, and brought back a very interesting
                    journal. They witnessed, soon after entering the country, the treacherous
                    massacre by the Kafirs, in fulfilment of an old vendetta, of a large party of
                    Mahometans who had been invited across the border, but were themselves well
                    treated.</p>
                <p>The language of the Kafir tribes belongs, like their physical type, to the Aryan
                    class. On both northern and southern slopes of Hindu Kush are spoken a number of
                    languages and dialects, all of which, with the striking exception of the Khajuna
                    or Burishki in Gilgit, belong to the class named, some of them leaning more to
                    the Persic, some to the Indic (or Prakritic) type. To the first belong
                    especially the dialects of the north known as <hi rend="italic">Ghdlcha,</hi>
                    spoken in Sirikol, Wakhân, Shighnân, and other cantons of the upper Oxus. To the
                    second belong the Shina language of Dardistan, and other dialects, spoken on the
                    Indus and west of it as far as Chitrâl. Major Biddulph considers the Kafir
                    languages, of which the Khowâr or Chitrâli is a type, to stand between the two
                    classes, drawing on the whole nearest to the Indic side, but with a larger
                    number of Persic roots than the Dard dialects. Vocabularies of Kafir or Siâhposh
                    dialects have been published by various persons <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi>
                    Leech, Bumes, Raverty, Lumsden, Trumpp, Norris, Leitner, Tanner, Biddulph). The
                    most ample are by no means the most valuable; and the data as yet, both as to
                    copiousness and as to precision regarding the locality of the dialects
                    represented, are scanty, though in these respects Major Biddulph’s book marks a
                    considerable step. The Hindi character of the lists of numerals in some of the
                    dialects is very striking. They all seem to confirm Elphinstone’s statement that
                    in all the Kafir dialects the numeration is by scores, as in the French
                    “survival” of <hi rend="italic">quatrevingt, quatreνingt-dix,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Biddulph regards the religion of the Kafirs as a crude form of the old Vedic
                    worship. <hi rend="italic">Imbra</hi> is their chief god, a name suggestive of
                    <hi rend="italic">Indra. Hani</hi> is spoken of as mediating with Imbra on
                    behalf of man. There are many inferior divinities, some acknowledged to have
                    been mortals worshipped after death. Names of some of these are given by
                    Elphinstone and by Biddulph, and a large part of the two lists agree. Stones are
                    set up as emblems of Imbra, but carved idols are not used, says Biddulph; we
                    must perhaps interpolate,—“as representations of Imbra,”—for there is much
                    evidence that images are set up. <hi rend="italic">Deogan</hi> is a name which
                    several accounts give as that of a chief god, —perhaps a generic word connected
                    with <hi rend="italic">deo, div, deus,</hi> &amp;c. Colonel Tanner’s informants
                    told him of a temple of Deogan among the Warnas, hung about with bright-coloured
                    cloths and ornaments, whilst Deogan was represented by a fierce image of wood,
                    armed with club, knife, and gun. The temples are said to be stored with the
                    accumulated spoils of ages. To all the deities cows are sacrificed, and cedar
                    branches burned. On all occasions of slaughtering for food, some deity is
                    invoked and sacrificial ceremonies observed. The Bashgalis showed Biddulph the
                    sacrifice of a goat. The detail is most remarkable, as he points out, in its
                    agreement, even in some of the minutiae (such as the ritual words used, <hi
                    rend="italic">such!</hi> and <hi rend="italic">he-mach</hi> ∕), with the account
                    given by Elphinstone after Mullah Najib,—thus attesting the authenticity of the
                    latter’s narrative.</p>
                <p>Polygamy is practised, and according to the balance of <pb break="no"

                    slightly punished or easily compensated (but on these points the Afghan
                    Christians give a strongly opposed statement). Female children are freely sold
                    by the Bashgalis to their Mussulman neighbours, and the king of Chitrâl receives
                    an annual tribute of children of both sexes (whom he sells doubtless). The black
                    clothing, which has given the Kafirs a general name, varies in character. Tribes
                    on the Cabul side wear entire goat’s skins; the Bashgalis wear short-sleeved
                    black tunics of woven goat’s hair, with a broad red binding, and girt with a
                    leather belt bearing a dagger. On their feet they wear rude sandals of wild-goat
                    skin, with a tuft on the instep. The women wear long sack-like garments of black
                    woven goat’s hair, with long loose sleeves, girt loosely at the waist, and with
                    a coloured cotton scarf tightly bound over the shoulders. It is a general
                    characteristic that men shave the whole head except a circular 3-inch patch on
                    the crown, from which the hair hangs often to the waist. The Bashgalis at least
                    wear no head covering. Women wear the hair plaited in many long thin tresses,
                    coiled under their head-dress. The headdress of the Bashgali women is
                    remarkable, consisting of a black cap with lappets and two horns about a foot
                    long, made of wood wrapt with black cloth and fixed to the cap. Such a
                    head-dress, with horns of greater length, is described by Chinese travellers of
                    the 6th and 7th centuries as worn in the valley of the upper Oxus, then held by
                    the Yetha or Ephthalites, an indication probably of kindred with or influence
                    over the ancestors of this Kafir tribe. Among the Sanus, Warnas, or Red Kafirs,
                    long, massive, silver chains presented by the tribe are worn over the shoulders
                    by successful warriors. Their women tie up the hair with a silver band.</p>
                <p>The Kafir arms are bows and arrows, battle-axe and dagger. The dagger is
                    peculiar, of excellent fabric, with a deep X hilt of iron with brass studs, and
                    slung in a triangular iron sheath. Their bows and arrows are short and
                    weak-looking, but they make good practice up to 60 yards. Swords and matchlocks
                    are spreading.</p>
                <p>Among the notable and general customs are the copious use of wine, which at their
                    feasts they drink from large silver cups which are among their most precious
                    possessions; their sitting habitually upon stools of wicker-work, whilst they
                    find it as difficult as we do to adopt the cramped postures usual among
                    Asiatics; their use of slips of pine for candles; the custom of recording the
                    deeds of a warrior by a post beside his coffin, in which a peg is driven for
                    every man he has slain. The Islamized Chugâni people of Darah Nûr also maintain
                    this practice.</p>
                <p>The people are fond of dancing. . Men and women join. Biddulph witnessed a
                    village dance, wild and strange,—the men brandishing arms, with whooping and
                    whistling and discharge of guns. At times the whole would lock arms by pairs and
                    revolve backwards and forwards in grotesque waltz, or following in order wind in
                    figures of 8.</p>
                <p>Their houses are neat and clean, generally of more than one story (communicating
                    by rough ladder beams), and sometimes of five or six on the declivity of a hill.
                    They are much embellished with wood carving. We may assume Tanner’s striking
                    description of a large Chugâni village to give a fairer idea of the Kafir towns
                    than we have yet any direct means of gaining :—</p>
                <p>“It is built on the face of a very steep slope, and the houses, of which there
                    must be six hundred, are arranged in terraces one above another. From the roof
                    of one of the lower ones I gazed with astonishment at a vast amphitheatre of
                    carved wood—at thousands of carved veranda-posts, and at tens of thousands of
                    carved panels, with which the upper story of each house is constructed.... . .
                    The carving completely covered the woodwork of the upper story of every house. .
                    The lower story is of stone and wood, and double the extent of the upper, and
                    this allows an open roof-space on which the inhabitants mostly pass their time
                    in tine weather.”</p>
                <p>A newborn child is carried with its mother to a special house outside the
                    village, where they remain secluded. After twenty days mother and child are
                    bathed and brought back with music and dancing. The dead are placed in coffins,
                    and, after much dancing and waking and sham fighting, are carried to some lofty
                    spot and there deposited, but no grave is made.</p>
                <p>The Siâh-posh dogs, cattle, sheep, fowls, and all their agricultural products are
                    famous for quality, and much sought by their neighbours. Their cattle in
                    appearance and size compare favourably with English breeds, but have large
                    humps. The women are said to do much of the agricultural work.</p>
