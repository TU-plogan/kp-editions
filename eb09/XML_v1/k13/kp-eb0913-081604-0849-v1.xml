                <p><label type="entry">KAFFRARIA, KAFFRRS</label>. The name Kaffraria or Kaffreland
                    properly means the country of the Kaffres, and in this sense would embrace the
                    whole region extending from the river Keiskamma to Delagoa Bay, including at
                    least British Kaffraria and Kaffraria Proper, Natal, Zululand, the Transvaal,
                    and the Orange River Free State. The term, however, has usually been confined to
                    the districts popularly known as British Kaffraria and Kaffraria Proper. Neither
                    term is now used officially. British Kaffraria was incorporated with Cape Colony
                    in 1866, and now forms the two official districts of King William’s Town and
                    East London; Kaffraria Proper is now known officially as .the Transkeian
                    Territories, or simply the Transkei. But, as the two designations are still in
                    popular use, and as they are in several respects convenient, it will be useful
                    here to give some account of the geography and the more important events in the
                    history of the two districts under the general heading.</p>
                <p>The physical characteristics of the two Kaffrarias bear a general resemblance to
                    those of the Cape Colony, of which they are the north-east continuation. The
                    country generally rises from the sea-level in a series of terraces to the lofty
                    mountains forming the north-west boundary. British Kaffraria culminates in the
                    Amatola mountains, rising in one part to upwards of 6000 feet. The features of
                    Kaffraria Proper are much more varied, and exhibit some of the most picturesque
                    scenery in South Africa. The rugged range of the Drakenberg forms its north-west
                    boundary, rising at its north-eastern point to a height of 9657 feet. Between
                    that range and the coast-lands are many subsidiary ranges with fertile valleys
                    through which the great rivers make their way to the Indian Ocean. The coast
                    region is more broken than is the case farther south. The prevalent rock along,
                    the coast of Kaffraria is the Old Sandstone, nonfossiliferous rock, quartzite,
                    intersected occasionally-with veins of white quartz rock, and often capped with
                    a dense mass of conglomerate; while the interior mountains are classed by Mr
                    Dunn as the Stormberg coal-bearing fossiliferous beds of the Triassic period.
                    Kaffraria is watered by hundreds of rivers, most of them rising at no great
                    distance from the coast, but several of them of large dimensions. The chief,
                    beginning at the south, are the Keiskamma, the Buffalo, the Kei, the Bashee, the
                    Umtata, the St John’s or Umzimvubu, with several large tributaries, and the
                    Umtamvuna, which separates British Kaffraria from Natal. The rivers are of
                    little use for navigation.</p>
                <p>Kaffraria forms one of the most naturally fertile regions in S. Africa. In
                    British Kaffraria most of the cereals grow, and in the cloofs, and scattered
                    over the country, are forests and clumps of valuable timber. The Transkei shows
                    even greater possibilities of culture. The mountain gorges abound in fine trees;
                    thick forest and bush cover the banks of the rivers; grass grows luxuriantly in
                    the lower regions; and the lowlands and valleys are favourable to almost any
                    kind of fruit, field, and garden cultivation. In the occupied district cattle
                    and sheep are numerous; lions are still found in the interior, and a fair amount
                    of the game characteristic of the inland districts belonging to the Cape. The
                    climate generally resembles that of the eastern province of Cape Colony, but
                    with features more approaching to those of the tropics. The coast districts are
                    extremely hot in summer, the temperature on an average varying from 70’ to 90°,
                    while in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n850/mode/1up"

                    though the nights are very cold. But the variation in altitude places climates
                    of all grades within easy reach, from the burning coast to the snow-clad
                    mountain. Thunderstorms are frequent in summer; rain mostly falls in spring and
                    summer, and the winters are generally dry. On the whole the climate may be
                    considered as extremely healthy.</p>
                <p>British Kaffraria, on its incorporation with Cape Colony, was divided into King
                    William’s Town and East London, each with a capital of the same name, and
                    forming the two most easterly divisions of the colony. King William’s Town has
                    an area of 1781 square miles, and a total population (1875) of 106,640, of whom
                    9012 are white; the population of the capital is 5169. The area of East London
                    province is 1225 square miles, and the population 15,514, of whom 3773 are
                    white. Its capital, East London (population, with the contiguous Panmure, 2134),
                    at the mouth of the Buffalo river, is the port for British Kaffraria. The
                    anchorage is exposed, but extensive harbour works are in operation (1881). In
                    1880, 135 foreign ships arrived of 134,753 tons, and coastwise 152 of 217,174
                    tons. It is connected by railway with King William’s Town, the line going
                    north-west as far as Queenstown, the capital of the province of that name. The
                    imports of East London amounted in 1880 to £1,152,610, showing an increase of
                    £72,488 over the previous year; and the exports to £303,991, being an increase
                    over 1879 of £38,369. Sheep and goat rearing is extensively carried on; there
                    are also large numbers of cattle. Wheat, maize, and millet are the staple
                    agricultural products. The wool exported from East London in 1880 amounted to
                    5,253,650 ff&gt;. In both divisions are numerous German settlements.</p>
                <p>Kaffraria Proper or the Transkeian Territories consist of the territories of
                    various native tribes, most of which have been annexed (1875-80) to the Cape
                    Colony, and are under the jurisdiction of magistrates. The area of Kaffraria
                    Proper is about 18,000 square miles,—its extreme length being about 230 miles,
                    and its breadth from the sea to the mountains bounding it on the north-west
                    averaging about 120 miles. On the south-east it is washed by the Indian Ocean;
                    the Drakenberg and Stormberg ranges bound it on the north-west; in the west and
                    south-west are the Indwe and Kei rivers, and on the east and north-east the
                    Umzimkulu and Umtamvuna. It is surrounded by Cape Colony, Basutoland, and Natal.
                    The area and population of the various districts can only be given
                    approximately; the following is an official estimate of the present population

                <p>Fingoland, to which (with the Idutwya Reserve and Gcalekaland) the name Tanskeian
                    Territory, or the Transkei, is often confined, is about 40 miles square, and is
                    the most advanced of the districts; it is suited both for pasture and for
                    cultivation. According to the latest return it had 4976 horses, 37,298 calves,
                    182,869 sheep, and 50,240 goats, the total value of its stock being £321,784.
                    The revenue in 1879 was £5047, the expenditure £3286. There are many trading
                    stations, and wool is largely exported. The annual value of the imports and
                    exports is estimated at £150,000. Tambookieland or Tembuland is divided into
                    Tambookieland Proper, the district of the Emigrant Tambookies, and Bomvaniland.
                    The first is about 75 miles long and from 30 to 40 broad. The population is
                    probably about 30,000. There are many trading stations, and large numbers of
                    sheep and cattle. A bill for the annexation of Tambookieland Proper passed the
                    Cape Parliament in 1880. The revenue of the whole of Tambookieland was estimated
                    at £12,500 for 1880. The magistracy is at Umtata on the river of that name. West
                    of Tambookieland and Fingoland is the district of the Emigrant Tambookies,
                    removed some years ago from Tambookieland over the Indwe. It is 85 miles long
                    and 20 broad; population about 40,000, with (in 1875) 5348 horses, 38,749
                    cattle, 84,201 sheep, 47,300 goats, and many trading stations. The Idutwya
                    Reserve is about 28 miles square, with (in 1874) 2514 horses, 17,698 cattle,
                    51,302 sheep, 14,909 goats; revenue about £1380, expenditure £2976. Gcalekaland,
                    the country of the Gcalekas, or Ama-Xosa Kaffres under Kreli, is about 50 miles
                    long and 30 broad. Traders are settling in the country, and a small trade in
                    wool is done. All these territories lie mainly between the Kei and Bashee
                    rivers. Bomvaniland is about 30 miles by 20; it lies between the Bashee and
                    Umtata rivers. On both sides of St John’s river, and extending to the Natal
                    boundary, is Pondoland; only that portion of it on the south side of the St
                    John’s river, known as St John’s Territories (21,905 inhabitants), has been
                    formally annexed, but the magistrate has jurisdiction on both sides. Pondoland
                    is about 60 miles square. This district is noted for its fertility and beauty,
                    and has much excellent pasture land. The district between Pondoland, Natal,
                    Basutoland, Wodehouse division, and Tambookieland, is now known as Griqualand
                    East, inhabited by various tribes (upwards of 100,000 souls), about 125 miles
                    long and 40 to 75 miles wide. A great part of this territory formerly went by
                    the name of Nomansland, in area about 6000 square miles, and lay at the foot of
                    the Drakenberg, between the Umzimkulu and Kinira rivers. In 1862 it was handed
                    over to Adam Kok’s people, but in 1877 an Act of annexation was passed, which
                    was promulgated in 1879. The boundaries of the new district were made to include
                    what was known as the St John’s River territory, including, however, British
                    Pondoland. The Griquas themselves are not numerous, being found chiefly in the
                    neighbourhood of Kokstadt, the station of the chief magistrate, 95 miles from
                    the mouth of the St John’s River. Their farms are rapidly passing into the hands
                    of Europeans. Various other tribes have had land allotted them in the district.
                    The whole district is said to be very fertile, and eminently adapted for the
                    cultivation of various kinds of grain. In 1880 land was granted and sold in
                    Griqualand East to the extent of about 300,000 acres. All these districts may be
                    regarded as virtually annexed to the Cape, with which they will doubtless be
                    gradually incorporated. Kaffraria is governed by ministers responsible to the
                    Cape legislature, in which, however, it has no representatives. Mission stations
                    and trading stations are scattered all over the region.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kaffre lVars.—</hi> During the extension of the Dutch and
                    English powers over South Africa, collisions with the natives were of course
                    inevitable; there are six contests which more especially came under the
                    designation of Kaffre wars. In 1780 the Great Fish river was settled on as the
                    boundary between the Kaffres and the colonists. For some time previous to 1811
                    the Kaffres in the Zuurveld broke the boundary, took possession of the neutral
                    ground, and committed depredations on the colonists. In order to expel them from
                    the Zuurveld, Colonel Graham took the field with a mixed force in December 1811,
                    and in the end the Kaffres were driven beyond the Fish river. In 1817 Lord
                    Charles Somerset, governor of the colony, entered into a treaty with a chief,
                    Ngqika, in which he acknowledged that chief as head of all the Ama-Xosa Kaffres,
                    and in which it was agreed that any kraal to which stolen cattle could be traced
                    should be held accountable for compensation. This was a serious blunder, Ngqika
                    being merely a subordinate chief, the paramount chief of the Ama-Xosas being
                    Hintza, the chief of the Ama-Gcalekas. Some stolen cattle having been traced to
                    one of the kraals of a chief Ndlambe, Major Fraser, with a small force, was sent
                    to enforce restitution. On this, Ndlambe and his fellow-chiefs attacked Neoika.

                    1818 by a force under Lieutenant-Colonel Brereton. They rallied, however, and a
                    great force suddenly poured into the colony in the early part of 1819, sweeping
                    at first everything before them. On April 22 the prophet-chief, Makanna,
                    attacked Grahamstown, which was garrisoned by a mere handful of troops, under
                    Colonel Wiltshire. Assistance arrived, however, and the Kaffres were defeated
                    with great slaughter. The principal chiefs were outlawed, the country between
                    Koonap Kat and the Great Fish river was added to the colony, and that between
                    the latter river and the Keiskamma declared to be neutral territory; on this
                    some of the Kaffres were allowed to settle. Final peace, however, was far from
                    being secured. One tribe or another was almost constantly on the move, causing
                    disturbances in which the colonists could not but suffer. In 1828 the chief
                    Ngqika or Gaika died, and during the minority of his infant son Sandili, the
                    government of the tribe, now called Gaikas, devolved on Macomo, his elder
                    half-brother, who had been permitted to occupy the valleys of the Kat river. On
                    account of an attack on the Ama-Tembu Kaffres, he was removed from the
                    settlement, as was also his brother Tyali (1833). Permitted to return, they were
                    removed again, and this vacillating treatment had no doubt something to do with
                    the next war. On December 11, 1834, another brother of Macorno, a chief of high
                    rank, was killed while resisting a commando party. This set the whole of the
                    Kaffre tribes in a blaze. Under Macomo, Tyali, and Xexo a force of 10,000
                    fighting men swept across the frontier, spread over the country, pillaged and
                    burned the homesteads, and murdered the farmers and all who dared to resist. The
                    fighting power of the colony was at the time scanty, but all available forces
                    were mustered, under Colonel (afterwards Sir Harry) Smith, who reached
                    Grahamstown on January 6, 1835, six days after news of the rising reached Cape
                    Town. The enemy’s territory was invaded, and after nine months’ fighting the
                    Kaffres were completely subdued, and a new treaty of peace concluded (September
                    17). By this treaty all the country as far as the river Kei was acknowledged to
                    be British, and its inhabitants declared British subjects. A site for the seat
                    of government was selected, and named King William’s Town. All this, however,
                    was undone by the home Government, the secretary of state for the colonies at
                    the time being Lord Glenelg. A policy of conciliation and mildness towards the
                    Kaffres was adopted, a policy distasteful to the colonists, although laudable
                    efforts seem to have been made to carry it out. The next war, known as the “War
                    of the Axe,” arose from the murder of a Hottentot, to whom an old Kaffre thief
                    was manacled while being conveyed to Grahamstown for trial for stealing an axe.
                    The escort was attacked by a party of Kaffres and the Hottentot killed. The
                    surrender of the murderer was refused, and war was declared on March 11, 1846.
                    The Gaikas were the chief tribe engaged in the war, assisted during the course
                    of it by the Tambookies. After some reverses the Kaffres were signally defeated
                    on June 7 by General Somerset on the Gwangu, a few miles from Fort Peddie. Still
                    the war went on, till at length Sandili, the chief of the Gaikas, surrendered,
                    as also gradually did the other chiefs; and by the beginning of 1848 the Kaffres
                    were again subdued, after twenty-one months’ fighting. The country was declared
                    under British rule, and was formed into the division of Victoria East and
                    British Kaffraria, between the new colonial boundary and the Kei river,—the
                    latter reserved for occupation by the Kaffres. The peace, however, was not to
                    last long. About October 1850 it was reported that the Kaffres were preparing^
                    for war. Sir Harry Smith proceeded to the frontier, and summoned Sandili and the
                    other chiefs to an interview. Sandili refused obedience; upon which, at an
                    assembly of other chiefs, the governor declared him deposed from his chiefship,
                    and appointed an Englishman, Mr Brownlee, a magistrate, to be chief of the Gaika
                    tribe. This measure is said to have been the immediate cause of the ensuing
                    outbreak; but there is no doubt that the Kaffres had already determined on war.
                    On the 24th of December Colonel Mackinnon, being sent with a small force to
                    capture Sandili, was attacked in a narrow defile by a large body of Kaffres, and
                    compelled to retreat with some loss. This was the signal for a general rising of
                    the Gaika tribe. The settlers in the military villages, assembled in fancied
                    security to celebrate Christmas day, were surprised by the treacherous foe, many
                    of them murdered, and their houses given to the flames. Other disasters followed
                    in quick succession. A small patrol of military was cut off to a man. The
                    greater part of the Kaffre police deserted, many of them carrying off their arms
                    and accoutrements. Flushed with success, the Kaffres in immense force surrounded
                    and attacked Fort Cox, where the governor was with an inconsiderable force. His
                    situation was truly critical. More than one unsuccessful attempt was made to
                    relieve him; but his dauntless spirit was equal to the occasion. At the head of
                    one hundred and fifty mounted riflemen, accompanied by Colonel Mackinnon, he
                    dashed out of the fort, and, through a heavy fire of the enemy, rode to King
                    William’s Town,—a distance of 12 miles. Meantime, a new enemy appeared. A large
                    number of the Kat river Hottentots, who had in former wars been firm allies of
                    the British, rose in rebellion. This revolt was followed by that of the
                    Hottentots at other missionary stations; and part of the Hottentots of the Cape
                    Mounted Rifles followed their example. We have only space to state the general
                    results of the war. After the confusion caused by the sudden outbreak had
                    subsided, and due preparations were made, Sir Harry Smith and his gallant force
                    soon turned the tide of war against the Kaffres. The Amatola mountains were
                    stormed; and the paramount chief Kreli, who all along covertly assisted the
                    Gaikas, was severely punished. In April 1852 Sir Harry Smith was recalled, and
                    was succeeded by Lieutenant-General Cathcart. Kreli was again attacked, and
                    reduced to submission. The Amatolas were finally cleared of Kaffres, and small
                    forts erected among them to prevent their reoccupation. It was not till March
                    23, 1853, that martial law was revoked, and the most sanguinary of Kaffre wars
                    brought to a conclusion, with a loss of many hundred British soldiers. Shortly
                    after, British Kaffraria was erected into a crown colony, which it remained till
                    1865, when it was incorporated with the Cape Colony. After a peace of
                    twenty-five years, once more, in 1877, the Kaffres (of Kaffraria Proper)
                    interrupted the progress of the country and caused considerable destraction and
                    distress. In September of that year the hereditary enmity between the Fingoes
                    and Gcalekas broke out into open hostility, the Government taking the part of
                    the former, who were under its protection. At first the Gcalekas were driven
                    beyond the Bashee; but collecting in force again they recrossed, and got the
                    Gaikas to join them about the end of December. After several months the governor
                    called in the aid of the imperial troops, and soon effectually broke up and
                    defeated the rebels. The war with the Zulu Kaffres will be described under <hi

                <p>The Kaffres, or Kafirs, a large South African race, form ethnically a well-marked
                    variety of the Negro type, and linguistically a distinct branch of the Bantu
                    family. There are no general or collective national names, and the various
                    tribal divisions are mostly designated by those of distinguished historical or
                    legendary chiefs, founders of dynasties or hereditary chieftaincies. The name
                    Kafir (a form which in popular usage designates the African race less frequently
                    than the inhabitants of Kafiristan in Persia) is that applied by Mahometans to
                    all who reject the faith of Islam. It was thus current along the east coast of
                    Africa at the arrival of the Portuguese, and passed from them to the Dutch and
                    English, and recently even to the natives themselves under the form <hi
                    rend="italic">Kafula,</hi> as in the expression <hi rend="italic">ba-ngama
                    Kafula-vje,</hi> they are only Kafirs. Of this race there are two main
                    divisions, jointly occupying the southeast corner of the continent from the
                    Lower Limpopo to the Great Fish river north and south, and from the escarpments
                    of the central plateau to the Indian Ocean west and east. They thus impinge
                    southwards on the Hottentot domain, westwards on the kindred Basuto and Bechuana
                    nations, northwards on the Tekezas, Makuas, and others also of kindred stock
                    occupying the region stretching from the Limpopo to the Zambesi and even beyond
                    it to Lakes Nyassa and Tanganyika. Politically the Kaffre domain comprises the
                    Portuguese possessions skirting Delagoa Bay, the semi-independent Zulu
                    territory, the colony of Natal, and the ancient territory of Zanguana, which
                    included that part of Cape Colony till recently known as British and Independent
                    Kaffraria. Of the two branches, each split up into a multiplicity of tribal
                    divisions, the representative nations are the Ama-Zulus in the north, and the
                    Ama-Xosas, Ama-Tembu, and Ama-Mpondas or Kaffres Proper in the south, whence the
                    compound term Zulu-Kaffre now commonly applied in a collective sense to the
                    whole race. Intermediate between the two were the Ama-Lala or Balala of Natal,
                    where they are still represented by the Ama-Ncolosi, and several broken AmaZulu
                    tribes now collectively known to the Kaffres as Ama-Fengu, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> “poor” or “needy” people, from <hi rend="italic">fenguza,</hi> to
                    seek service.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Ama-Fengus are regarded both by the Ama-Zulus and Ama-Xosas as slaves or
                    out-castes, without any right to the freedom and privileges of true-born
                    Kaffres. They are met with everywhere, not only in Fingoland between the Great
                    Kei and Bashee rivers south of the Ama-Xosa territory, but also in Natal,
                    Zululand, and north of it, as well as in the highlands of the interior. Yet they
                    ca⅛ scarcely be said to have any recognized territory of their own, and but for
                    the intervention of the British they would have long ago been everywhere reduced
                    to a state of serfdom by the dominant tribes. Those who were driven out of
                    Zululand early in the present century fell into the hands of the Gcalekas, from
                    whom they were delivered in 1835 by Sir Benjamin D’Urban, and by him removed to
                    the Fort Peddie district between the Fish and Keiskamma rivers. Any tribes which
                    become broken and mixed would probably be regarded as Ama-Fengus by the other
                    Kaffres. Hence the multiplicity of clans, such as the Anja-Bele, Aba-Sembotweni,
                    Ama-Zizi, Ama-Kuze, Aba-Sckunene, Ama-Ntokaze, Ama-Tetyeni, Aba-Shwawa,
                    &lt;fcc., all of whom are collectively groupe d as Ama-Fengu. Their position may
                    be compared with that of the Laconian Helots, or the low-caste tribes of
                    India.</p></note></p>

                <p>The numerous and politically important ramifications of the Kaffres Proper cannot
                    be understood without reference to the national genealogies, most of the tribal
                    names, as already stated, being those of real or reputed founders of dynasties.
                    Thus the term Ama-Xosa itself means simply the “people of Xosa,” a somewhat
                    mythical chief, supposed to have flourished about the year 1530. Ninth in
                    descent from his son Toguh was Palo, who died about 1780, leaving two sons,
                    Gcaleka and Rarabe (pronounced Kha-Kha-be), from whom came the Ama-Gcalekas,
                    Ama-Dhlambe (T’slambies), and the Ama-Ngquikas (Gaikas or Sandili’s people). The
                    Ama-Mpondas do not descend from Xosa, but probably from an elder brother, while
                    the Ama-Tembus (Tambookies), though apparently representing a younger branch,
                    are regarded by all the Kaffre tribes as the royal race. Hence the Gcaleka
                    chief, who is lord paramount of all the Ama-Xosa tribes, always takes his first
                    or ‘ ‘ great wife” from the Ama-Tembu royal family, and her issue alone have any
                    claim to the succession. The subjoined genealogical tree will help to place the
                    mutual relations of all the Kaffre tribes in a clearer light :—</p>

                <p>Here it will be seen that, as representing the elder branch, the Gcalekas stand
                    quite apart from the rest of Xosa’s descendants, whom they group collectively as
                    Ama-Rarabe (Ama-Khakhabe), and whose genealogies, except in the case of the
                    Gaikas and. T’slambies, are very confused and uncertain. The Ama-Xosa country

                <p>The Ama-Zulus, so named by their Basuto neighbours, call themselves Abantu
                    ba-Kwa-Zulu, i.e., “people of Zulu’s land,” or briefly Bakwa-Zulu, from a
                    legendary chief Zulu, founder of the royal dynasty. They were originally an
                    obscure tribe between the Bumbo and Omtukela mountains, but rose suddenly to
                    formidable power under Chaka,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    powerful Umtetwas, and who succeeded the chiefs of that tribe and of his own in
                    the beginning of the present century. But the true mother tribe seems to have
                    been the extinct Ama-Ntombela, whence the Ama-Tefulu, the U’ndwande, U’mlelas,
                    U’mtetwas, and many others, all absorbed or claiming to be true Zulus. But they
                    are only so by political subjection, and the gradual adoption of the Zulu dress,
                    usages, and speech. Hence in most cases the term Zulu implies political rather
                    than blood relationship. This remark applies also to the followers of
                    tΓmzele-katze, who, after a fierce struggle with the Bechuanas, founded in 1830
                    a second Zulu state about the head waters of the Orange river. In 1837 most of
                    them were driven northwards by the Boers, and have become dispersed amongst the
                    Makuas and Matebele tribes.</p>
                <p>The origin of the Zulu-Kaffre race has given rise to much controversy. It is
                    obvious that they are not the aborigines of their i present domain, whence in
                    comparatively recent times they have [displaced the Hottentots and Bosjesmans of
                    fundamentally distinct I stock. On the other hand they are closely allied in
                    speech and [physique to the surrounding Basutos, Bechuanas, Matebeles, and
                    (other members of the great South African Negroid family. Hence no far-fetched
                    theories are needed to account for their appearance in the south-east corner of
                    the continent, where their presence is i sufficiently explained by the gradual
                    onward movement of the populations pressing southwards on the Hottentot and
                    Bosjesman domain. The specific differences in speech and appearance by which
                    they are distinguished from the other branches of the family must in the same
                    way be explained by the altered climatic an&lt;l other outward conditions of
                    their new habitat. Hence it is that the further they have penetrated southwards
                    the further have they become differentiated from the pure Negro type, from which
                    attempts have even been made to separate them altogether.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Amongst others quite recently by Girard de

                    Negroes, and treats them as an independent division of the African races. These

                    Kaffres, (5) Nubians and Fallahs,—a classification which even on linguistic
                    grounds is untenable. J. Meyer also, notwithstanding their woolly hair, thick,
                    lips, high cheek bones, and dark complexion, maintains that their features are
                    essentially “Asiatic.”</p></note> Thus the light and clear brown complexion
                    prevalent amongst the southern Ama-Tembus becomes gradually darker as we proceed
                    northwards, passing at last to the blue-black and sepia of the Ama-Swazis and
                    Tekezas. Even many of the mixed Fengu tribes are of a polished ebony colour,
                    like that.of the Joloffs and other pure Senegambian Negroes. The hair is
                    uniformly of a woolly texture, not differing perceptibly from that of the
                    ordinary native of Sudan, nor growing in separate tufts on the scalp, as is
                    often erroneously asserted. This phenomenon of a tufted growth of hair, on which
                    many anthropologists have based their classifications of the dark races, has
                    absolutely no existence in nature. The Kaffre head also is dolichocephalic
                    (index 72 54, as compared with the West African 73*40); but it is also high or
                    long vertically (index 195 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 <hi rend="subscript"

                    length combined) that the Kaffre presents the most striking contrast with the
                    pure Negro. But, the nose being generally rather broad<note anchored="true"

                    European character. In many of them the perfect Grecian and Roman nosès are
                    discernible” (Fleming⅛ <hi rend="italic">Kaffraria,</hi> p. 92).</p></note> and
                    the lips thick, the Kaffre face, though somewhat oval, is never regular in the
                    European sense, the deviations being normally in the direction of the Negro,
                    with which race the peculiar odour of the skin again connects the Kafl'res. In
                    stature they rank next to the Patagonians, Polynesians, and West Africans,
                    averaging from 5 ft. 9 in. to 5 ft. 11 in., and even 6 feet.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gustav Fritsch, a most
                    accurate observer, gives the mean of the Ama-Xosas as 1∙718 metres, less than
                    that of the Guinea Negro (V724), but more than the English (l∙708) and Scotch
                    (1-710).</p></note> They are also slim, well-proportioned, and muscular; but
                    Fritsch’s measurements have shown that they are far from attaining the standard
                    of almost ideal beauty with which early observers credited them. Owing to the
                    hard life to which they are doomed, the women are generally inferior in
                    appearance to the men, except amongst the Zulus, and especially the Tembus.
                    Hence in the matrimonial market, while the Ama-Xosa girl realizes no more than
                    ten or twelve head of cattle, the Ama-Tembu belle fetches as many as forty, and
                    if specially fine even eighty.</p>
                <p>The symmetrical and manly figures of the more warlike tribes are usually arrayed
                    in leopard or ox-skins, of late years often replaced by European blankets, with
                    feather head-dresses, coral and metal ornaments, bead armlets, and necklaces.
                    The Makuas and a few others practise tatooing, and the Ama-Xosas are fond of
                    painting or smearing their bodies with red ochre. Their arms consist chiefly of
                    ox-hide shields 4 to 6 feet long, the kerri or club, and the assegai, of which
                    there are two kinds, one long with 9-inch narrow blade, for throwing, the other
                    short with broad blade 12 to 18 inches long, for stabbing. The dwellings, like
                    those of the Hottentots, are simple conical huts grouped in kraals or villages,
                    mostly of a temporary character. For all the Kaffres are still semi-nomadic, and
                    easily break up their homes in search of fresh pastures. But, although cattle
                    form their chief wealth, and hunting and stock-breeding their main pursuits,
                    many have in recent times turned to husbandry. The Zulus raise regular crops of
                    “mealies” (maize), and the Ama-Mpondas cultivate a species of millet, tobacco,
                    watermelons, yams, and other vegetables. Milk, millet, and maize form the
                    staples of food, and meat is seldom eaten except in time of war. Amongst some
                    tribes the order to kill and eat their cattle is in fact equivalent to an order
                    to prepare for some warlike undertaking.</p>
                <p>Mentally and morally the Kaffres are on the whole superior to the average Negro.
                    In all their social and political relations they display great tact and
                    intelligence; they are remarkably brave, warlike, and hospitable, and were
                    naturally honest and truthful until through contact with the whites they become
                    suspicious, revengeful, and thievish, besides acquiring most European vices. Of
                    religion as ordinarily understood they have very little, and have certainly
                    never developed any mythologies or dogmatic systems. It is more than doubtful
                    whether they had originally formed any notion of a Supreme Being; and such is
                    the realistic bent of their minds that all such abstract conceptions, when
                    interpreted to them by the missionaries, are immediately reduced to the grossest
                    materialism. At the same a belief in a future state is implied by a faintly
                    developed worship of ancestry, accompanied by a few superstitious rites. There
                    are no idols, sacrifices, or priests, but the prevalent belief in witchcraft has
                    naturally led to the evolution <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0853-0820"/> of the “witch-doctor” or medicine-man, who often
                    becomes an instrument of cruel oppression and injustice in the hands of
                    unscrupulous chiefs. Circumcision and polygamy are universal; the former is
                    sometimes attributed to Mahometan influences, but has really prevailed almost
                    everywhere in East Africa from the remotest time.</p>
                <p>Of the few industries thé chief are copper and iron smelting practised by the
                    Ama-Tembus, Zulus, and Swazis, who manufacture from the metal weapons, spoons,
                    and agricultural implements, both for their own use and for trade. The Swazis
                    display some taste in wood-carving, and others prepare a peculiar water-tight
                    vessel of grass, somewhat like the wickerwork vases of the Siberian Yakuts.
                    Characteristic of this race is their total ignorance or neglect of the art of
                    navigation. Not the smallest boats are ever made for crossing the rivers, much
                    less for venturing on the sea, except by the Makazana of Delagoa Bay and by the
                    Zambesi people, who have canoes and flat-bottomed boats made of planks.</p>
                <p>The Kaffre race has developed a distinct and apparently very old political
                    system, which may be described as a patriarchal monarchy limited by a powerful
                    aristocracy. Although the tribal state still prevails, the organization has thus
                    acquired almost a feudal character. The nation is grouped in tribes, each under
                    an hereditary <hi rend="italic">inkose</hi> or chief, who administers his
                    territory by means of officers chosen by himself, and who is supreme legislator
                    with absolute jurisdiction and power of life and death. If his decisions are
                    unjust, the nobles (that is, the foremost members of the tribe) protest in
                    βouncil, and their decisions form the traditional code of common law. A group of
                    clans forms a nation, recognizing a common hereditary chief with the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">umkumkani</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inkose enkulu,</hi> that
                    is, “great chief,” whose influence largely depends on his power and personal
                    qualities. He possesses in theory unlimited authority, but in practice each clan
                    retains a large share of self-government, the lord paramount seldom interfering
                    except when appealed to. In Zululand this system rapidly developed under Chaka
                    and his successors into a military despotism of an extremely arbitrary type. But
                    with the fall of Cetewayo, followed by the division of the land amongst a number
                    of semi-independent chiefs, an end was put to that absolute monarchy. While it
                    lasted it was a distinct violation of the ancient liberties of the Zulu nation
                    by the “great chief,” who arrogated to himself almost divine honours, treated
                    the people as his slaves, claimed all the land as his personal property, and
                    made everything subservient to his dynastic interests.</p>
                <p>The Zulu-Kaflre language is probably the most typical member of the wide-spread
                    Bantu family, standing in much the same relation to the other branches of this
                    stock as Sanskrit does to those of the Aryan group. It is spoken with
                    considerable uniformity throughout the whole Kaffre domain, the Zulu or northern
                    dialects differing rather in idiom and peculiar forms than in structure or
                    phonetics from the Ama-Xosa and other southern varieties. In other respects Zulu
                    is on the whole more primitive and conservative of the oldest forms, while
                    Kaffre seems truer to the original meaning of words. Marked Zulu dialects are
                    the Tefula and Swazi, both widely current in Zululand, the latter forming a
                    transition between Zulu-Kaffre and the northern Tekeza group. The Kaffre, which
                    presents no well-defined dialects, is current from the Keiskamma river to the
                    southern frontier of Natal, and from the Quathlamba mountains to the sea.</p>
                <p>The Zulu-Kaffre differs in its phonetics from most other Bantu tongues by the
                    presence of three “clicks” adopted from the Hottentots or Bosjesmans, the true
                    aborigines of this region. These are the dental, usually represented by c, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Ama-Gcaleka,</hi> the palatal <hi rend="italic">{q),</hi> as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Ama·Gqika,</hi> and the lateral (x), as in <hi
                    rend="italic">AmaXosa,</hi> uttered respectively by thrusting forward and then
                    suddenly withdrawing the tongue from the front teeth, the palate, and the side
                    teeth. Besides these there is a guttural, represented by <hi rend="italic"
                    >r,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">Rarabe,</hi> to be pronounced <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khakhabe.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> sound does not occur: it is replaced, as in Chinese, by <hi

                    language is in other respects extremely harmonious, the accent falling generally
                    on the penultimate, and all words ending in vowels, or occasionally the liquids
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and n. In its structure it is very regular, with few
                    exceptions or departures from the normal rules, which is the more surprising
                    that its mechanism is extremely delicate and involved. The verb especially is
                    highly inflected, presenting no less than two hundred and fifty different forms,
                    temporal, modal, positive, negative, active, passive, causal, augmentative,
                    &amp;c. In this respect it is probably unsurpassed even by the intricate verbal
                    systems of the Finno-Tatar group.</p>
                <p>But the characteristic feature of the Zulu-Kaffre and other Bantu languages is
                    their peculiar alliterative structure, which finds no parallel in any other
                    linguistic family, the Mande and Gor of West Africa alone excepted. This
                    principle of “euphonic concord,” as it has been called, is regulated by the
                    pronominal prefix inseparable from every noun, and repeated in a more or less
                    modified form with the following adjectives and other words in agreement with
                    the subject. The nominal root itself is unchangeable, its various relations
                    being expressed by modifications of the prefixed particle, or “inflex,” as
                    Colenso calls it. Hence the inflexion in these languages is mainly initial, not
                    final, as in most other linguistic systems, on which account they have received
                    the name of “Pronominal Prefix Languages.” Of the inflecting prefixes, of which
                    there were sixteen in the primitive Bantu speech, the chief function is
                    concordance and relationship. Thus the proper inflex of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ntu</hi> in the sense of man, person, being <hi rend="italic">um,</hi> pl. <hi
                    rend="italic">aba,</hi> we get from <hi rend="italic">um-ntu,</hi> man, <hi

                    type="authorial"><p>This word <hi rend="italic">Abantu</hi> is generally used by

                    On this ground <hi rend="italic">Abantu,</hi> shortened to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bantu,</hi> has been proposed by Bleek and generally adopted as the collective
                    name of all the races and languages belonging to this great linguistic system,
                    which reaches from four or five degrees north of the equator southwards to Cape

                    the following adjective <hi rend="italic">kulu.</hi> Here we see some
                    resemblance both to the pι∙inciple of progressive vocalic harmony as developed
                    in the Ural-Altaic group, in which the vowel of the root regulates those of all
                    the following agglutinated formative elements, and to such Latin agreements <hi

                    resemblance is more apparent than real. This surprisingly complex and almost
                    artificial principle of alliterative concordance pervading a vast number of
                    languages spread over half a continent, and spoken exclusively by unlettered and
                    barbarous races, is one of the most astonishing phenomena in the history of
                    human culture. The perfection to which the system is carried in the Zulu-Kaffre
                    group must always render that branch of the Bautu family specially interesting
