                    (1653-1716), of Saltoun, a prominent figure in Scotch history during the latter
                    half of the 17th century, was born in 1653 at his ancestral home in East
                    Lothian, and for five years was taught by the celebrated Gilbert Burnet, who was
                    then minister of the parish of Saltoun. On reaching manhood he visited the
                    Continent, where he spent several years in travel and study. In 1681 be was
                    returned as commissioner for his native county to the Scottish parliament, where
                    he distinguished himself by such determined opposition to the arbitrary measures
                    of the court that he was forced to seek refuge in Holland, while sentence of
                    outlawry (with confiscation of his estates) was passed against him. Four years
                    later he joined the expedition of the duke of Monmouth; but on their landing at
                    Lyme in Dorsetshire, he had the misfortune to kill the mayor of the town in a
                    quarrel, and was compelled once more to seek safety abroad. During the second
                    period of exile he travelled in disguise through Spain, where he had some
                    romantic adventures. He next made a tour through Hungary, where he fought as a
                    volunteer in a Turkish campaign; and finally at the Hague he took an active part
                    in forwarding the scheme of the English Revolution. In 1688 he returned to
                    Scotland when he at once regained his estates, and also sat as a member in the
                    Scottish convention and afterwards in the parliament. An enemy of the
                    monarchical form of government, he began to oppose the ministry of William
                    almost as stoutly as he had resisted that of Charles; and that he exercised
                    power in parliament is shown by the triumphant passing of the Act of Security of
                    1703, which, ripened under his care, contained two important constitutional laws
                    restraining the power of the monarch of making war without the consent of
                    parliament, and providing that all places and offices should be given by
                    parliament. During the years of negotiations, as leader of the national party,
                    he was consistent in his objections to the projected terms of the union of the
                    crowns of England and Scotland, and supported his measure of limitations in
                    animated speeches. After the Union he retired from public life; but in 1710 he
                    did his country a real if homely service by introducing from Holland the art of
                    making pot barley, and also the use of fanners for sifting grain. He died in
                    London in 1716. A contemporary describes him as a “low, thin man, of a brown
                    complexion; full of fire; with a stern, sour look.” Among the small band of good
                    early Scotch prose authors he holds a prominent place, and in the domain of
                    politics he is the most readable and entertaining of them all. His style has the
                    singular freshness of foreign culture, and, charged with strong feeling, his
                    sentences frequently turn into forcible epigrams. But both his writings and his
                    speeches possess a value beyond that of literary excellence; they afford us
                    bright glimpses of the manners and state of the country of his time. In
                    literature his name is best known in connexion with an often quoted remark,
                    which occurs in <hi rend="italic">An Account of a Conversation concerning a
                    right Regulation of Governments for the Common Good of Mankind :—</hi> “I said I
                    knew a very wise man so much of Sir Christopher’s [Musgrave] sentiment, that he
                    believed if a man were permitted to make all the ballads he need not care who
                    should make the laws of a nation. And we find that most of the ancient
                    legislators thought they could not well reform the manners of any city without
                    the help of a lyric, and sometimes of a dramatic poet.”</p>
