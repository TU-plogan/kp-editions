                <p><label type="entry">FAWKES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Guy</hi></label> (1570-1606),
                    the most notorious of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators, was born at York, of a
                    gentle family, in the year 1570. His grandfather and father were notaries and
                    proctors of the ecclesiastical courts of York, the former being registrar of the
                    exchequer court of the province, the latter an advocate of the consistory court
                    of the cathedral. It is believed that the family was connected with the ancient
                    house of the Fawkeses of Farnley in Yorkshire, but the evidence of such
                    connexion does not amount to proof. Guy was educated at the free school at the
                    “Horsefayre,” just outside the city of York, and had for schoolfellows Thomas
                    Morton, afterwards bishop of Durham, and Thomas, grandson of Sir John Cheke. The
                    school was under the superintendence of the dean and chapter, and this, and the
                    fact of his immediate ancestors being employed in the ecclesiastical courts,
                    would have led us to conclude that Fawkes was brought up in conformity to the
                    established church. But we have more direct evidence of this, for the names,
                    both of his parents and of his grandmother, occur several times in the list of
                    communicants of the parish of St Michael-le-Belfrey in which they lived. Perhaps
                    the most determinant event in Fawkes’s life happened when he was quite young.
                    His father died when he was about eight years old, and before he came of age his
                    mother married again. Her second husband was one Dionis Baynbridge, settled at
                    Scotton near Knaresborough. Baynbridge was connected with several Roman Catholic
                    families. Several families, steadfast in the old faith, were settled near
                    Scotton,—among them, that of Sir William Ingilby of Ripley, whose sister was
                    mother of the Robert, Thomas, and John Winter with whom, later in life, Fawkes
                    was brought into such close contact. For some years he lived under the roof of
                    his stepfather, who, we have every reason to believe, was a Roman Catholic. Guy
                    was the only son and, as there was no will, the sole heir of his father. He said
                    in confession, “My father left me but small living, which I spent.” There is, in
                    fact, evidence that when he came of age he sold the little land left him, and
                    soon after, as it appears, enlisted as a soldier of fortune in the army of
                    Flanders, and is said to have been present at the taking of Calais by the
                    Archduke Albert in 1598. He was sent by Sir William Stanley and the Jesuits in
                    Flanders to join Christopher Wright in a mission to the king of Spain
                    immediately after the death of Elizabeth. Early in 1604 he was again in Flanders
                    and with Stanley.</p>
                <p>The Catholics in England had hoped much from the accession of J amés I. To
                    facilitate his passage to the throne, he had given great cause for such hopes,
                    promising that the fines against recusants should not be exacted, and bestowing
                    honours upon several Roman Catholic gentlemen. Therefore, when, after James was
                    securely seated on the throne, the severe laws of Elizabeth against priests and
                    recusants were again put into execution, many Roman Catholic gentlemen
                    experienced feelings of deep resentment. Robert Catesby, a man steeped in plots,
                    conspiracies, and secret embassies, but a gentleman of great personal power and
                    fascination, conceived a plan for the remedy of all this. His parents had
                    suffered much for their religion, and he himself had been an incessant plotter
                    among the discontented Catholics of the later years of Elizabeth’s reign, and
                    for joining in Essex’s rebellion had been heavily fined. But there is no reason
                    to believe that he, or indeed any of the conspirators, were actuated by selfish
                    motives or feelings of revenge in assenting to that scheme for the carrying out
                    of which they dared and suffered so much. Catesby’s own words probably express
                    best the way in which they regarded the matter. “The nature of the disease,” he
                    said, “requires so sharp a remedy.” It should also be remembered that the plot
                    was conceived and entered upon before the more severe execution of the laws
                    against recusants. Catesby’s plan was to blow up king, lords, and commons in the
                    Parliament House with gunpowder. Early in 1604 he wrote to his cousin Thomas
                    Winter desiring him to come to London. Winter, after some hesitation, having
                    consented, found Catesby at Lambeth with John Wright. All three were old
                    plotters and companions in plots and conspiracies. Catesby now broached his new
                    scheme to Winter, who at first wondered at the strangeness of the conception and
                    doubted of success, but finally gave his consent to it or to anything that
                    Catesby should decide to enter upon. Wishing, however, to leave no quiet way
                    untried to obtain their end, it was decided that Winter should go over to
                    Flanders, to meet Velasco, the constable of Castile, who was coming to England
                    to negotiate the peace with Spain. Winter was to inform the constable of the
                    state of the Catholics in England, and to entreat him to solicit the king that
                    the penal laws against them might be recalled. Catesby named Fawkes as a likely
                    man in case this quiet way failed. Winter saw the constable at Bergen, and
                    giving up the hope that much would be done by his means, sought out Fawkes, whom
                    he found with Stanley at Ostend. Representing to him that something was in hand
                    to be done in England, they passed together from Gravelines to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n67/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0067-0058"/> Greenwich, April 22, 1604, and at once went to
                    Catesby. At a meeting soon after they were joined by Thomas Percy, another
                    zealous Romanist, a relative of the earl of Northumberland, and one of the
                    king’s pensioners. The plot was propounded and approved of; all took a solemn
                    oath of secrecy and perseverance, and afterwards received the sacrament from
                    Gerard, a Jesuit, who was in another room. In May a house adjoining the
                    Parliament House was hired in Percy’s name, from the cellars of which the
                    conspirators proposed to work a mine. Having, however, with great labour worked
                    about half-way through the nine feet of stone which composed the wall, they
                    discovered that a vault, immediately under the House of Lords, was to let, and
                    as this exactly suited their purpose, it was at once engaged by Fawkes, who,
                    being little known in England, passed as Percy’s servant, and took the name of
                    Johnson. Barrels of gunpowder which had been stored in a house at Lambeth were
                    brought over in the night, large stones and bars of iron were placed upon them,
                    and the whole covered with billets of wood, so that no suspicion might be
                    excited in case it wa3 found necessary to admit a stranger. All was prepared
                    about May 1605. The plan of the plot was that after the blow had been given, as
                    most probably the prince of Wales would attend and perish with the king, the
                    duke (Charles) was to be seized and carried into the country if possible; or
                    otherwise possession was to be obtained of the person of the Princess Elizabeth,
                    who was then at Combe Abbey in Warwickshire, and a rising was to be prepared
                    among the Catholics of the midland counties. Fawkes wa3 to fire the train, and
                    then to get over as quickly as possible into Flanders in a ship prepared for his
                    passage. After being several times prorogued, parliament was to meet on the 5th
                    of November.</p>
                <p>During the progress of the preparations many other gentlemen, Robert Winter,
                    Christopher Wright, Keyes, Rook wood, Sir Everard Digby, and Francis Tresham,
                    had been sworn in by Catesby to assist with labour or money. In the interval
                    between the completion of the preparations and the opening of parliament, Fawkes
                    wa3 sent into Flanders to acquaint Stanley and Owen the Jesuit with the plot,
                    and to secure their co-operation after the event of the explosion. A great cause
                    of disagreement among the conspirators was the fact that the Catholic lords and
                    members of parliament would be destroyed in a common catastrophe with those whom
                    the plot was specially intended to strike. That the Catholics should somehow be
                    warned there was general agreement, but not as to the method in which the
                    warning should be given. This disagreement no doubt caused the failure of the
                    whole transaction. Ten days before the opening of parliament, Lord Monteagle, a
                    Catholic and a friend of several of the conspirators, received an anonymous
                    letter giving him a warning, couched in ambiguous terms, not to attend the
                    opening, for “they shall receyve a terrible blowe this parleament.” It is not
                    known who wrote the letter. Tresham was, and is, generally suspected; but when
                    Catesby accused him of it, he vehemently and with oaths denied all knowledge of
                    the matter. Something in the character of the letter and of the attendant
                    circumstances seems to render it probable that the whole thing was prepared
                    beforehand to quash the plot, but in such a manner that the Government should
                    not be fully alive to the danger until the conspirators had had time to escape.
                    It has also been suggested that the whole plot itself was got up by Cecil, and
                    was nothing but a state trick. However, Monteagle at once took this letter to
                    Salisbury, who communicated it to the king, directly his Majesty returned from
                    Royston, where he had been hunting, and it seems to have been at once decided
                    that every precaution should be taken. Winter received warning that all was
                    discovered. Tresham also warned Catesby and the others that all was known, and
                    passionately desired them to make good their escape to foreign lands. They,
                    however, determined to await further events, and Fawkes especially stuck to his
                    post in the vault with that coolness of courage which seems to have been one of
                    his chief characteristics.</p>
                <p>The Lord Chamberlain, on the 4th November, going over the Parliament House to see
                    that all was prepared for the morrow, visited the vault, and there saw this
                    “very tall and desperate fellow,” who, together with the large quantity of fuel,
                    exciting suspicions which he communicated to the king, it was decided that a
                    more strict search should be made. Sir Thomas Knevet, a Westminster magistrate,
                    wa3 ordered to direct this search, and going down to the house suddenly, just
                    before midnight, he came upon Fawkes just stepping out of the door. The 36
                    barrels of powder were discovered; Fawkes was seized, bound with his own
                    garters, and searched. Upon him were found a watch, a tinder box, and some touch
                    wood. He at once avowed his purpose, and said that if he had been within the
                    house when taken he would have blown up house, takers, himself, and all. He was
                    taken to Whitehall and examined before the king. Answering all questions with
                    careless sarcastic indifference, he would say nothing to implicate his
                    confederates. The other conspirators fled into the country to Dunchurch, where a
                    meeting of the Catholic gentry had been convened under pretence of a hunting
                    party. In the hue and cry which followed, all were either killed or taken.
                    Fawkes and the others were repeatedly examined, and torture was, no doubt, in
                    his case used to break the wonderful will and nerve of the man. On 27th January
                    1606 the trial took place. All were condemned to be drawn, hanged, and
                    quartered. On Thursday the 30th, Digby, R. Winter, Grant, and Bates (Catesby’s
                    servant) suffered in St Paul’s churchyard; the next day, T. Winter, Rookwood,
                    Keyes, and Fawkes, at Westminster. So all yet alive who, from belief in the
                    cause or from love of Catesby, had joined his outrageous plot ascended the
                    scaffold, Fawkes last; “his body being weak with torture and sickness, he was
                    scarce able to go up the ladder.” He “made no long speech, but after a sort
                    seeming sorry for his offence, asked a kind of forgiveness of the king and the
                    state for his bloody intent,” and so died.</p>
                <p>Jesuit evidence describes Fawkes as a man “of great piety, of exemplary
                    temperance, of mild and cheerful demeanour, an enemy of broils and disputes, a
                    faithful friend,” and assert3 that his society was sought by all the most
                    distinguished in the archduke’s camp for nobility and virtue. There seems to be
                    no doubt that he had qualities which under a different rule would have carried
                    him to honour instead of to ignominy. There is something in the whole character
                    of his actions and undertakings in this plot which seems to imply absolute
                    self-renunciation for the cause believed to be just. But nothing could possibly
                    have been more disastrous to the interest of the Catholics of England. The
                    stringency of the laws against recusants was greatly increased, and their
                    observance more severely exacted. The 5th November was ordered to be kept as a
                    day of thanksgiving for ever, by an Act which was not repealed for over two
                    centuries. The festivities which were long common on what is called Guy Faw
                    kes’s day are now perhaps dying out. The custom was to dress up an absurd figure
                    in rags with a tall cap and a lantern, to parade with this through the streets
                    singing rhymes, and finally at night to burn the effigy. This holocaust was in
                    some places an important annual ceremony, presided over by the local
                    officials.</p>
                <p>The question as to the part taken by the Jesuits in the Gunpowder Plot has been a
                    much debated one. There seems to be no doubt that Garnet, the superior of the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n68/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0068-0059"/> order in England, had a guilty knowledge of the
                    plot, if he did not even actively encourage it. He was tried and condemned March
                    28 and executed May 3, 1606.</p>
                <p>Many valuable letters and memorials connected with this plot are preserved in the
                    Public Record Office. The anonymous letter to Lord Monteagle and the reports of
                    Fawkes’s various examinations are there, as well as the reports of the
                    examinations of Winter and other conspirators, supposed conspirators, suspected
                    persons, and persons in any way connected with them. These were some years ago
