                    (1773-1843), a distinguished post-Kantian writer on philosophy, was born at
                    Barby, Saxony, August 23, 1773. He was educated in a community of the Moravian
                    brethren, and in their seminary was trained for theology. In 1795 he entered at
                    the university of Leipsic, and for some years studied philosophy there and at
                    Jena. In 1801, after having acted for a time as private tutor, he began to
                    deliver courses of philosophical lectures at Jena. These he continued, with an
                    interval of two years spent in travels in Germany, France, and Italy, till 1806,
                    when he was called to Heidelberg as professor of philosophy and elementary
                    mathematics. His philosophical position with regard to his contemporaries he had
                    already made clear in the critical work <hi rend="italic">Reinhold, Fichte,
                    Schelling</hi> (1803), and in the more systematic treatises <hi rend="italic"
                    >System</hi><hi rend="italic">der Philosophie als evidenter Wissenschaft</hi>
                    (1804), <hi rend="italic">Wissen, Glauben, Ahnung</hi> (1805). Fries was an
                    unusually prolific and somewhat hurried writer, and during the ten years he
                    passed at Heidelberg he poured forth a variety of volumes, differing widely in
                    value, on philosophy and theoretical physics. The most important treatise, and
                    that by which he will always be remembered in the history of philosophy, was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Neue Kritik der Vernunft,</hi> 3 vols., 1807, an attempt to
                    give a new foundation to the critical theory of Kant. In 1811 appeared his <hi
                    rend="italic">System</hi><hi rend="italic">der Logik,</hi> a very instructive
                    work, and in 1814JuZ⅛s <hi rend="italic">and Evagoras,</hi> a philosophical
                    romance. In 1816 he was invited to Jena to fill the chair of theoretical
                    philosophy, under which appear to have been included mathematics and physics,
                    along with philosophy proper. In 1824 Fries was accused of democratic
                    tendencies, and formally deprived of the right to deliver lectures on
                    philosophical subjects, although he still retained his chair. He seems, however,
                    towards the end of his life, to have resumed his philosophical teaching. He died
                    on 10th August 1843. The most important of the many works written during his
                    Jeua professorate are the <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der praktischen
                    Philosophie</hi> (vol. i.,1818, and vol. ii., 1832), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Handbuch der psychischen Anthropologie,</hi> 2 vols., 1820; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathematische Naturphilosophie,</hi> 1822; <hi rend="italic">System der
                    Metaphysik,</hi> 1824; <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Philosophie,</hi> 1837
                    and 1840. Fries’s point of view in philosophy may be described as a modified
                    Kantianism. With Kant he regarded <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> or the critical
                    investigation of the faculty of knowledge, as the essential preliminary to
                    philosophy. But b e d iffered from Kant both as regards the foundation for this
                    criticism and as regards the metaphysical results yielded by it. Kant’s analysis
                    of knowledge had disclosed the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> element as the
                    necessary complement of the isolated <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> facts
                    of experience. But it did not seem to Fries that Kant had with sufficient
                    accuracy examined the mode in which we arrive at knowledge of this <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> element. According to him we only know these <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> principles through inner or psychical experience;
                    they are not then to be regarded as transcendental factors of all experience,
                    but as the necessary, constant elements discovered by us in our inner
                    experience. They are, in fact, to Fries, as to the Scotch school, the residuum
                    which resists analysis. Accordingly Fries, like the Scotch school, places
                    psychology or analysis of consciousness at the foundation of philosophy, and
                    called his criticism of knowledge an anthropological critique. It requires very
                    little consideration to see that Fries’s proposed amendment of Kantianism rests
                    upon an altogether mistaken view of the transcendental element in knowledge. It
                    is absurd to make the demand that what is <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> in
                    cognition should be known by an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> method. There is
                    no such method. A second point in which Fries differed from Kant is the view
                    taken as to the relation between immediate and mediate cognitions. According to
                    Fries, the understanding is purely the faculty of proof; it is in itself void;
                    immediate certitude is the only source of knowledge. Reason contains principles
                    which we cannot demonstrate, but which can be deduced, and are the proper
                    objects of belief. In this view of reason Fries approximates to Jacobi rather
                    than to Kant. The <hi rend="italic">Neue Kritik</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psychische Anthropologie</hi> contain much that is admirable in the way of
                    psychological analysis, but it cannot be thought that Fries has effected any
                    real advance on the Kantian position. See Henke, <hi rend="italic">J. F.
