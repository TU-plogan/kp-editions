                <p><label type="entry">FORTESCUE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir John</hi></label>, an
                    eminent English lawyer in the reign of Henry VI., was descended from an ancient
                    family in Devonshire, and, in all probability, was born at Norris, near South
                    Brent in Somersetshire, towards the close of the 14th century. He was educated
                    at Exeter College, Oxford. During the reign of Henry VI. he was three times
                    appointed one of the governors of Lincoln’s Inn. In 1441 he was made a king’s
                    sergeant at law, and in the following year chief justice of the king’s bench. As
                    a judge Fortescue is highly commended for his wisdom, gravity, and uprightness;
                    and he seems to have enjoyed great favour with the king, who is said to have
                    given him some substantial proofs of esteem and regard. He held his office
                    during the remainder of the reign of Henry VI., to whom he steadily adhered; and
                    having faithfully served that unfortunate monarch in all his troubles, he was
                    attainted of treason m the first parliament of Edward IV. When Henry
                    subsequently fled into Scotland, he is supposed to have appointed Fortescue, who
                    appears to have accompanied him in his flight, chancellor of England. In 1463
                    Fortescue accompanied Queen Margaret and her court in their exile on the
                    Continent, and returned with them afterwards to England. During their wanderings
                    abroad the chancellor wrote for the instruction of the young Prince Edward his
                    celebrated work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">laudibus
                    legum</hi><hi rend="italic">Angliae.</hi> On the defeat of the Lancastrian
                    party, he made his submission to Edward IV., from whom he received a general
                    pardon dated Westminster, October 13, 1471. He died at an advanced age, but the
                    exact date of his death has not been ascertained.</p>
                <p>Fortescue’s masterly vindication of the laws of England, though received with
                    great favour by the learned of the profession to whom it was communicated, did
                    not appear in print until the reign of Henry VIII., wlιen it was published by
                    Wnitechurch in 16mo, but without a date. In 1516 it was translated by Mulcaster,
                    and printed by Tottel; and again in 1567, 1573, and 1575, and also by White in
                    1598, 1599, and 1609. It was likewise printed, with Hengham’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summa Magna</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Parva,</hi> in 1616
                    and 1660, 12mo; and again with Selden’s notes in 1672, in 12mo. In 1737 it
                    appeared in folio; and, in 1775, an English translation, with the original
                    Latin, and Selden’s notes, besides a variety of remarks relative to the history,
                    antiquities, and laws of England, was published in 8vo. Waterhouse’s <hi

                    in 1663, though prolix and defective in style, may be consulted with advantage.
                    Another valuable and learned work by Fortescue, written in English, was
                    published in 1714, under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Difference between
                    an Absolute and Limited Monarchy, as it more particularly regards the English
                    Constitution, and accompanied with some remarks by John Fortescue Aland, of the
                    Inner Temple, London·,</hi> and a second edition with amendments appeared in
                    1719. In the Cotton Library there is a manuscript of this work, in the title of
                    which it is said to have been addressed to Henry VI.; but many passages show
                    plainly that it was written in favour of Edward IV. Of Fortescue’s other
                    writings, which were pretty numerous, the most important are—1. <hi
