                <p><label type="entry">FUEL</label>. This term includes all substances that may be
                    usefully employed for the production of heat by combustion with atmospheric air
                    or oxygen. Any element or combination of elements susceptible of oxidation, <hi
                    rend="italic">‰e.,</hi> any substance electro-positive to oxygen, may under
                    particular conditions be made to burn; but only those that ignite by a moderate
                    preliminary heating, and burn with comparative rapidity, and, what is
                    practically of equal importance, are obtainable in quantity and at a moderate
                    price, come fairly within the category of fuels. Among elementary substances
                    only hydrogen, sulphur, carbon, silicon, and phosphorus can be so classed, and
                    of these the last two are only of special application. More important than the
                    elements are, however, the carbohydrates, or compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and
                    oxygen, which form the bulk of the natural fuels, wood, peat, and coal, as well
                    as of their liquid and gaseous derivatives, coal gas, coal tar, pitch, oil,
                    &amp;c., which are possessed of great fuel value. Carbon in the elementary form
                    has its nearest representatives in charcoal and coke.</p>
                <p>In the determination of the value of fuel two principal factors are involved,
                    namely, the calorific power, or the total amount of heat obtainable from the
                    perfect combustion of its constituents, and the calorific intensity, or
                    pyrometric effect which is the temperature attained by the gaseous products of
                    the combustion. The first of these is constant for any particular composition,
                    and does not vary with the method of combustion, the quantity of heat developed
                    by the combustion of a unit of carbon or hydrogen being the same whether it be
                    burnt with oxygen, air, or a metallic oxide. The calorific intensity,on the
                    other hand, being inversely proportional to the volume of gases produced, it is
                    obvious that if the combustion is effected with pure oxygen the resulting
                    carbonic acid (in the case of carbon) may be very much hotter than when air is
                    used, as the duty of heating up an additional quantity of nitrogen rather more
                    than three times the weight of the oxygen is in the latter case imposed upon a
                    similar weight of carbon.</p>
                <p>Theoretically 1 unit of carbon combines with 2'67 units of oxygen to form 3 <hi

                    are diluted with 8 ’ 88 units of nitrogen, whose specific heat is 0*244. The

                <p>The calorific value of a fuel may be determined by direct experiment, either by
                    complete combustion on the small scale in a calorimeter, or by practical
                    experiment on a working scale, by ascertaining the effect of a weighed quantity
                    in performing a particular kind of work, such as evaporating water in a steam
                    boiler, the result being expressed in the number of pounds of water converted
                    into steam per pound of fuel burnt. It may also be computed from an ultimate
                    chemical analysis,—the carbon and so much of the hydrogen as remains disposable
                    for burning, after deducting sufficient to form water with the oxygen present,
                    being credited with the full heating power derivable from their complete
                    oxidation, according to the results found for these elements by the
                    calorimeter.</p>
                <p>The pyrometric effect, on the other hand, cannot be either computed or determined
                    experimentally with complete accuracy, partly because the total combustion of a
                    quantity of fuel in a given time at one operation is practically impossible, but
                    more particularly from the fact that dissociation of the gaseous compounds
                    produced in burning takes place to a greater or less extent at temperatures far
                    below those indicated as possible by calculation based upon comparisons of the
                    weight of the products of combustion and their specific heat with the calorific
                    value of the substance as found by experiment According to Bunsen, Deville,
                    Dewar, and others who have specially considered this subject, a temperature of
                    about 3000° C. will be the maximum attainable from any fuel by any ordinary
                    process of combustion. The calorific powers of the principal elementary
                    substances susceptible of use as fuels are given in the following table; they
                    are expressed in <hi rend="italic">calories</hi> or heat units, signifying the

                <p>The fuels of the highest calorific value are, therefore, those containing the
                    largest amount of disposable hydrogen. Such substances are, however, only of
                    special application as being either gases, volatile liquids, or easily fusible
                    solids; they require special contrivances for their combustion in order to avoid
                    an undue production of smoke, or the formation of vapours liable to become
                    explosive when mixed with air. The ordinary solid vegetable and mineral fuels,—
                    wood, peat, coal, &amp;c.,—are, therefore, of more general interest economically
                    considered.</p>
                <p>Wood may be considered as having the following average composition when in the
                    air-dried state :—Carbon, 39’6; hydrogen, 4'8; oxygen, 34’8; ash, IO; water, 20
                    per cent. When it is freshly felled, the water may be from 18 to 50 per cent.
                    Air-dried or even green wood ignites readily when a considerable surface is
                    exposed to the kindling flame, but in large masses with regular or smooth
                    surfaces it is often difficult to get it to burn. When previously torrefied or
                    scorched by heating to about 200°, at which part incipient charring is set up,
                    it is exceedingly inflammable. The ends of imperfectly charred boughs from the
                    charcoal heaps in this condition are used in Paris and other large towns in
                    France for kindling purposes, under the name of <hi rend="italic">fumerons.</hi>
                    The inflammability, however, varies with the density,—the so-called hard woods,
                    oak, beech, and maple taking fire less readily than the softer, and more
                    especially the coniferous varieties rich in resin. The calorific power of
                    absolutely dry woods may as an average be taken at about 4000 units, and when
                    air-dried, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> containing 25 per cent, of water, at
                    2800 to 3000 units, and their evaporative value as 3 ’ 68 and 4’44 times their
                    own weight respectively.</p>
                <p>Wood being essentially a flaming fuel is admirably adapted for use with
                    heat-receiving surfaces of large extent, such as locomotive and marine boilers,
                    and is also very cleanly in use. The absence of all cohesion in the cinders or
                    unburnt carbonized residua causes a large amount of ignited particles to be
                    projected from the chimney, when a rapid draught is used, unless special
                    spark-catchers of wire gauze or some analogous contrivance are used. When burnt
                    in open fire places the volatile products given off in the apartment on the
                    first heating have an acrid penetrating odour, which is, however, very generally
                    considered to be agreeable. Owing to the large amount of water present, no very
                    high temperatures can be obtained by the direct combustion of wood, and to
                    produce these for metallurgical purposes it is necessary to convert it
                    previously either into charcoal, or into inflammable gas in a so-called gazogene
                    or gas-producer. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Charcoal</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Carbon.</hi></p>
                <p>Peat includes a great number of substances of very unequal fuel value, the most
                    recently formed spongy light brown kind approximating in composition to wood,
                    while the dense pitchy brown compact substance, obtained from the bottom of bogs
                    of ancient formation, may be compared with lignite, or even in some instances
                    with coal. Unlike wood, however, it contains incombustible matter in variable
                    but large quantity, from 5 to 15 per cent., or even more. Much of this, when the
                    amount is large, is often due to sand mechanically intermixed; when air-dried,
                    the proportion of water is from 8 to 20 per cent. When these constituents are
                    deducted, the average composition may be stated to be— carbon, 52 to 66;
                    hydrogen, 4 ’ 7 to 7’4; oxygen, 28 to 39; and nitrogen, 1 ’ 5 to 3 per cent.
                    Average air-dried peat may be taken as having a calorific value of 3000-3500
                    units, and when freed from water by a heat of 100 degrees, and with a minimum of
                    ash (4 to 5 per cent), at about 5200 units, or from a quarter to one third more
                    than that of an equal weight of wood. The lighter and more spongy varieties of
                    peat when air-dried are exceedingly inflammable, firing at a temperature of 200°
                    C.; the denser pulpy kinds ignite less readily when in the natural state, and
                    often require a still higher temperature when prepared by pulping and
                    compression or partial carbonization. Most kinds burn with a red smoky flame,
                    developing a very strong odour, which, however, has its admirers in the same way
                    that wood smoke has. This arises from the destructive distillation of
                    imperfectly carbonized organic matter. The ash, like that of wood, is light and
                    powdery, except when much sand is present, when it is of a denser character.</p>
                <p>Peat is principally found in high latitudes, on exposed high table-lands and
                    treeless areas in more temperate climates, and in the valleys of slow-flowing
                    rivers,—as in Ireland, the west of Scotland, the table-land of Bavaria, the
                    North-German plain, and parts of the valleys of the Somme, Oise, and a few other
                    rivers in northern France. In the last-named country it is dredged from the
                    bottom of ponds, and in the summer time moulded into bricks, which are dried by
                    exposure to the sun. A principal objection to its use is its extreme bulk, which
                    for equal evaporative effect is from 8 to 18 times that of coal. On the railways
                    in Bavaria and Oldenburg, where peat is burned, the tenders, in order to have
                    the necessary fuel capacity, are made of equal dimensions with the largest goods
                    waggons, and the water reservoir is placed below the axles, nearly down to the
                    level of the rails. Various methods have been proposed, and adopted more or less
                    successfully, for the purpose of increasing the density of raw peat by
                    compression, either with or without pulping; the latter process gives the
                    heaviest products, but the improvement is scarcely sufficient to compensate for
                    the cost.</p>
                <p>Lignite or brown coal is of intermediate character between peat and coal proper.
                    The best kinds are undistinguishable in quality from free-burning coals, and the
                    lowest earthy kinds are not equal to average peat. When freshly raised, the
                    proportion of water may be from 45 to 50 per cent, and even more, which is
                    reduced from 28 to 20 per cent, by exposure to dry air. Most varieties, however,
                    when fully dried, break up into powder, which considerably diminishes their
                    utility as fuel, as they cannot be consolidated by coking. Lignite dust may,
                    however, be compacted into serviceable blocks for burning, by pressure in
                    machines similar to those used for brick-making, either in the wet state as
                    raised from the mines, or when kiln-dried at 200° C. This method, adopted to a
                    very large extent in Prussian Saxony, is noticed in Ure’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary,</hi> vol. iv. p. 530, and described in detail ∖ <hi rend="italic"

                    as far as it can be expressed by averages, varies between 3500 and 5000 units,
                    and the evaporative factor from 2 ’ 16 when freshly raised to 5 ’ 84 for the
                    best kinds of lignite when perfectly dried.</p>

                <p>The manner of estimating the heating power of coal has already been considered
                    (vol. vi. p. 80).</p>
                <p>The heating effect of fuels obtained in practice is always considerably less than
                    that indicated by theory, as the latter supposes complete combustion, a result
                    which cannot be attained in the ordinary system of burning upon a grate of bars
                    with spaces between them for the admission of air, as a certain proportion of
                    unconsumed particles when sufficiently reduced in size to pass through the grate
                    bars fall through with the ashes, forming cinders which represent so much of the
                    useful fuel lost, at any rate for the time. This proportion varies very
                    considerably with the state of the fuel and its proportion of ash. A summary of
                    the different observations upon this point made by Hartig, Playfair, Johnson,
                    and Brix gives the total loss in ash und cinders observed in the coal trials of
                    various countries as follows :—</p>

                <p>The evaporative power in these experiments is referred to water at the freezing
                    point, while in the results given in article <hi rend="smallcaps">Coal,</hi>
                    vol. vi. p. 81, it is computed from the boiling point. The latter quantities
                    therefore require to be reduced by about one-seventh to bring them into
                    comparison.</p>
                <p>In many cases, however, the evaporative factor found by practical experiment in a
                    steam boiler is from a third to nearly a half less than that indicated by
                    theory, the differences covering waste by imperfection of combustion and losses
                    by radiation, &lt;tc., in the furnace and flues.</p>
                <p>Of the other natural fuels the most important is so-called vegetable refuse, such
                    as cotton stalks, brushwood, straw, and the woody residue of sugar cane after
                    the extraction of the saccharine juice known as megasse or cane trash. These are
                    extensively used in countries where wood and coal are scarce, usually for
                    providing steam in the manufactures where they arise, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> straw for thrashing, cotton stalks for ploughing, irrigating, or
                    working presses, and cane trash for boiling down sugar or driving the cane mill.
                    According to Mr J. Head <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Inst, of Civil Engineers,</hi>
                    vol. xlviii. p. 75), the evaporative values of 1 lb of these different articles
                    when burnt in a tubular boiler are— coal, 8 lb; dry peat, <hi rend="italic"
                    >4</hi> ìb; dry wood, 3∙58-3 ’ 52 lb; cotton stalks or megasse, 3 ’ 2-2 ’ 7 ïb;
                    straw, 2 ’ 46-2 ’ 30 lb. In burning straw it is found most convenient to use a
                    pair of toothed rollers, which pass it continuously into the fire box in a thin
                    layer. Owing to the siliceous nature of the ash, it is also desirable to have a
                    means of clearing the grate bars from slags and clinkers at short intervals, and
                    to use a steam jet to clear the tubes from similar deposits.</p>
                <p>The common fuel of India and Egypt is derived from the dung of camels and oxen,
                    moulded into thin cakes, and dried in the sun. As might be imagined it has a
                    very low heating power, and in burning gives off acrid ammoniacal smoke and
                    vapour.</p>
                <p>Somewhat similar to these are the tan cakes made from spent tanners’ bark, which
                    are used to some extent in eastern France and in Germany. They are made by
                    moulding the spent bark into circular cakes, which are then slowly dried by
                    exposure to the air. Their effect is about equivalent to 80 and 30 per cent, of
                    equal weights of wood and coal respectively. The same class of fuel made from
                    exhausted dye-wood is considered to be equal to two-thirds of its weight of
                    coal.</p>
                <p>Liquid fuel in the form of natural petroleum, and the heavy or so-called dead or
                    creosote oil obtained in coal-tar distilleries, have recently been used to some
                    extent both for heating steam boilers and welding iron. In England the former
                    cannot be used from its high price, apart from the danger caused by the
                    irregular volatility of its constituents; the latter, however, is perfectly
                    manageable when blown into a heated combustion chamber as a fine spray by means
                    of steam jets, where it is immediately volatilized and takes fire. Tho heating
                    power is very great, one ton of creosote oil being equal to 2 or 2¾ tons of coal
                    in raising steam.</p>
                <p>Natural gases, consisting principally of light hydrocarbons, have at different
                    times been used as fuel, but the examples of their application are necessarily
                    rare. The most conspicuous example at the present time is afforded by the Iron
                    City and Siberia Iron Works, near Pittsburg, in Pennsylvania, where puddling and
                    welding furnaces, as well as steam boilers, are entirely fired by the gas from a
                    well bored for oil, 1200 feet deep, which is brought to the works through a pipe
                    several miles in length, and arrives with a pressure of two atmospheres.
                    Ordinary coal gas, such as is used for illuminating, can also be applied for
                    heating purposes, but it is, in spite of its very high calorific power, too
                    expensive for general use. A cheaper material obtained by the distillation of
                    lignite at a high temperature has been tried to some extent in Berlin. The
                    average composition of this is—hydrogen, 42’36; carbonic oxide, 40; marsh gas,
                    11*37; nitrogen, 3'17; carbonic acid, 2'01; and condensable hydrocarbons, l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 09 per cent According to Ziurek, a thousand cubic
                    feet of such gas corresponds in heating power to 30 or 33 íb of coal.</p>
                <p>Sulphur, phosphorus, and silicon, the other principal combustible elements, are
                    only of limited application as fuels. The first is used in the liquation of
                    sulphur-bearing rocks. The ore is piled into large heaps, which are ignited at
                    the bottom, a certain proportion, from one-fourth to one-third of the sulphur
                    contents, being sacrificed, in order to raise the mass to a sufficient
                    temperature to allow the remainder to melt, and run down to the collecting
                    basin. Phosphorus, which is of value from its low igniting point, receives its
                    only application in the manufacture of lucifer matches,—the heat generated by
                    friction against a roughened surface being sufficient to start the flame, which
                    is ultimately communicated to the dry wood, by means of a somewhat less
                    inflammable substance, such as sulphur or paraffin. The high temperature
                    produced by burning phosphorus is due to the product of combustion (phosphoric
                    acid) being solid, and therefore there is less heat absorbed than would be the
                    case with a gaseous product. The same effect is observed in a still more
                    striking manner with silicon, which in the only special case of its application
                    to the production of heat, namely, in the Bessemer process of steel-making,
                    gives rise to an enormous increase of temperature in the metal, sufficient
                    indeed to keep the softest iron melted. The absolute calorific value of silicon
                    is rather less than that of carbon, but the product of combustion (silicic acid)
                    being fixed at all furnace temperatures, the whole of the heat developed is
                    available for heating the molten iron, instead of a considerable part being
