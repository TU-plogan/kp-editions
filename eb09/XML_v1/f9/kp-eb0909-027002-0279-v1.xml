                <p><label type="entry">FITCH, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1743-1798),
                    one of the first inventors in connexion with steam navigation, was born at
                    Windsor, Connecticut, January 21, 1743. He was the son of a farmer, and received
                    the usual common school education. At the age of seventeen he went to sea, but
                    he discontinued his sailor life after a few voyages, and became successively a
                    clock maker, a brassfounder, and a silversmith. During the rebellion he followed
                    the trade of sutler to the American troops, and amassed in that way a
                    considerable sum of money, with which he bought land in Virginia. He was
                    appointed deputy-surveyor for Kentucky in 1780, and when returning to
                    Philadelphia in the following year he was captured by the Indians, but shortly
                    afterwards regained his liberty. About this time he began an exploration of the
                    north-western regions, with the view of preparing a map of the district; and
                    while sailing on the great western rivers, tho idea occurred to him that they
                    might be navigated by steam. He endeavoured by the sale of his map to find money
                    for the carrying out of his projects, but was unsuccessful. He next applied for
                    assistance to the legislatures of different States, but though each reported in
                    favourable terms of his invention, none of them would agree to grant him any
                    pecuniary assistance. He was successful, however, in 1786, in forming a company
                    for the prosecution of his enterprise, and shortly afterw ards a steam-packet of
                    his invention was launched on the Delaware. His claim to be the inventor of
                    steam-navigation was disputed by James Rumsey of Virginia, but Fitch obtained
                    exclusive rights in steam-navigation in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware,
                    while a similar privilege was granted to Rumsey in Virginia, Maryland, and New
                    York. A steam-boat built by Fitch conveyed passengers for hire on the Delaware
                    in the summer of 1790, but the undertaking was a losing one, and led to the
                    dissolution of the company. In 1793 he endeavoured to introduce his invention
                    into France, but met with no success. On his return to America he found his
                    property overrun by squatters, and reaping from his invention nothing but
                    disappointment and poverty, he committed suicide in 1798. He left behind him a
                    record of his adventures and misfortunes, “inscribed to his children and future
                    posterity ;” and from this a biography was compiled by Thompson Westcott
                    (Philadelphia, 1857).</p>
