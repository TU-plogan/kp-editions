                <p><label type="entry">FRANCISQUE</label>. Jean François Millet (c. 1644-1680),
                    commonly called Francisque, was born at Antwerp about 1644, and is generally
                    classed amongst the painters of Flanders on account of the accident of his
                    birth. But his father was a Frenchman, a turner in ivory of Dijon, who took
                    service with the prince of Condé, and probably returned after a time to his
                    native country. He remained long enough in Antwerp to apprentice his son to an
                    obscure member of a painter family called Laurent, pupil of Gabriel Franck. With
                    Laurent Franck Francisque left Antwerp for Paris, and there settled after
                    marrying his master’s daughter, He was received a member of the Academy of
                    Painting at Paris in 1673, and after gaining consideration as an imitator of the
                    Poussins he died in 1680, bequeathing his art and some of his talents to one of
                    his sons. Francisque probably knew, as well as imitated, Nicolas Poussin, Gaspar
                    Dughet, and Sebastian Bourdon; and it is doubtless because of his acquaintance
                    with these travelled artists that, being himself without familiarity with the
                    classic lands of Italy and Greece, he was able to imagine and reproduce Italian
                    and Arcadian scenery with considerable grace and effectiveness. It is indeed
                    surprising to observe, even at this day, how skilfully he executed these
                    imaginary subjects, enlivened them with appropriate figures, and shed <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n736/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0736-0701"/> over them the glow of a warm yet fresh and
                    sparkling tone. Unhappily time has been unkind to Francisque. Twelve of his most
                    important landscapes, which remained in the palace of the Tuileries, were
                    destroyed by fire quite recently; and though many of his pieces may still be
                    found catalogued in Continental and English collections, others in great number
                    remain unknown and unacknowledged. In England there are specimens of Francisque
                    in the galleries of the duke of Devonshire, and Earls Dudley and Suffolk.
                    Abroad, most of his known works are in public museums. It often happens that his
                    name is appended to pictures by Jean François, his son.</p>
                <p>Jean François Millet, the younger, was born in Paris, and was made a member of
                    the Academy of Painting at Paris in 1709. He died in 1773. He is not quite so
                    independent in his art as his father; but he had clever friends, and when he
                    wanted figures to his landscapes, he consulted Watteau, and other followers of
                    the “court shepherdess” school. But on the whole Jean François the younger’s
                    work is often lost in that of his father, and it is difficult to point to any
                    picture by him except that in the museum of Grenoble, which is prettily adorned
                    with Watteau’s figures.</p>
