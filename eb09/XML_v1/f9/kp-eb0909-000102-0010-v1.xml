                <p><label type="entry">FALASHAS</label><hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> Exiles), the
                    degenerate Jews of Abyssinia, found in considerable numbers in the provinces
                    west of Takazze, namely, Semien, Wogara, Armatshoho, Walkait, Tchelga, Dembea,
                    Tenkel, Dagusa, Alafa, Kunsula, Aschafer, Agarv-Meder, and Quara. It is doubtful
                    whether they are to be ethnologically identified with the seed of Abraham, or
                    regarded, like the Khazars of the 8th century, as, for the most part, mere
                    proselytes to Judaism. As to the date when the race or the religion was
                    introduced there is no authentic information,—one account carrying it back to
                    the days of Solomon and hie hypothetical son Menelek by the queen of Sheba,
                    another to the time of the Babylonian captivity, and a third only to the 1st
                    century of the Christian era. That one or other of the earlier dates is probably
                    correct may be gathered from the fact that the Falashas know nothing of either
                    the Babylonian or Jerusalem Talmud, make no use of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tephilin,</hi> and observe neither the feast of Purim nor the dedication of the
                    temple. They possess—not in Hebrew, of which they are altogether ignorant, but
                    in Ethiopic (or Geez)—the canonical and apocryphal books of the Old Testament; a
                    volume of extracts from the Pentateuch, with comments given to Moses by God on
                    Mount Sinai; the Te-e-sa-sa Sanbat, or laws of the Sabbath; the Ardit, a book of
                    secrets revealed to twelve saints, which is used as a charm against disease;
                    lives of Abraham, Moses, &amp;c.; and a translation of Josephus called Sana
                    Aihud. A copy of the Orit or Mosaic law is kept in the holy of holies in every
                    mesgeed or synagogue. Various pagan observances are mingled iu their ritual:
                    every newly-built house is considered uninhabitable till the blood of a sheep or
                    fowl has been spilt in it; a woman guilty of a breach of chastity has to undergo
                    purification by leaping into a flaming fire; the Sabbath has been deified and,
                    as the goddess Sanbat, receives adoration and sacrifice, and is said to have ten
                    thousand times ten thousand angels to wait on her commands. There is a monastic
                    system, introduced it is said in the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    by Aba Zebra, a pious man who retired from the world and lived in the cave of
                    Hoharewa, in the province of Armatshoho. The monks must prepare all their food
                    with their own hands, and no lay person, male or female, may enter their houses.
                    Celibacy is not practised by the priests, but they are not allowed to marry a
                    second time, and no one is admitted into the order who has eaten bread with a
                    Christian, or is the son or grandson of a man thus contaminated. Belief in the
                    evil eye or shadow is universal, and spirit-raisers, soothsayers, and
                    rain-doctors are in repute. Education is in the hands of the monks and priests,
                    and is confined to boys. Fasts, obligatory on all above seven years of age, are
                    held on every Monday and Thursday, on every new moon, and at the passover (the
                    21st or 22d of April). The annual festivals are <pb break="no"

                    Mazalat or feast of tabernacles (during which, however, no booths are built),
                    the day of covenant or assembly, and Abraham’s day. It is believed that after
                    death the soul remains in a place of darkness till the third day, when the first
                    <hi rend="italic">tciskar</hi> or sacrifice for the dead is offered; prayers are
                    read in the mesgeed for the repose of the departed, and for seven days a formal
                    lament takes place every morning in his house. No coffins are used, and a stone
                    vault is built over the corpse so that it may not come into direct contact with
                    the earth. The Falashas are an industrious people, living for the most part in
                    villages of their own, or, if they settle in a Christian or Mahometan town,
                    occupying a separate quarter. They engage in agriculture, manufacture pottery,
                    iron ware, and cloth, and are specially sought after for their skill in
                    masonwork. Their numbers are variously estimated at from 80,000 to 200,000.</p>
