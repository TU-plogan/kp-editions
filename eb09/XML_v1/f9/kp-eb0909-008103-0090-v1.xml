                <p><label type="entry">FERDINAND V</label>. of Castile, III. of Naples, II. of
                    Aragon and Sicily, surnamed <hi rend="italic">el Ccdolico</hi> (1452-1516), the
                    younger son of John II. of Navarre and Aragon by his second wife Juana Henriquez
                    of Castile, was born at Sos in Aragon on the 10th of March 1452. On the death of
                    his elder brother Carlos in 1461, he was recognized by the Aragonese as
                    heir-apparent to the crown, but the Catalans, rendered indignant by the cruelty
                    and perfidy with which Carlos had been treated, refused to recognize any further
                    claim on their allegiance, and rose in rebellion against King John. Ferdinand
                    accompanied his father in the campaigns which followed, and gave early promise
                    of distinction. In 1466 his father formally associated him with himself in the
                    government of Aragon, and in 1458 declared him king of Sicily. In October 1469
                    he was married at Valladolid, in circumstances of unusual secrecy, to Isabella,
                    sister of Henry IV. of Castile, and heiress to that throne. On the death of
                    Henry IV. in 1474, Ferdinand and Isabella were recognized by the nobles in the
                    junta of Segovia as joint-sovereigns of Castile; but a powerful party, including
                    the marquis of Villena, the grand-master of Calatrava, the archbishop of Toledo,
                    and numerous other notables, as well as some of the burghs, declared in favour
                    of Juana “la Beltraneja” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> daughter of Beltran),
                    whom Henry had shortly before his death recognized as his own child, and by his
                    will designated as his successor. Juana had also the support of Alphonso V. of
                    Portugal (to whom she was betrothed in 1470) and of Louis XI. of France. The
                    result was a civil war which continued with varying fortunes until victory
                    finally declared for the Catholic sovereigns, and the peace of Lisbon was signed
                    in 1479. In the same year, a few months previously, Ferdinand had succeeded his
                    father on the throne of Aragon, though not on that of Navarre, which went to his
                    sister Leonora de Foix. The union of Castile and Aragon, together with the
                    prosperous termination of the civil war, gave the Catholic sovereigns leisure
                    and opportunity for the development of a vigorous domestic policy. On their
                    accession they had found themselves face to face with an almost anarchical
                    condition of affairs: bitter feuds were raging in Andalucia between the great
                    houses of Cadiz and Medina Sidonia; Galicia and other provinces were rent with
                    hostile factions; robbery and outrage were paralysing commerce and agriculture
                    throughout the kingdom. One of their earliest measures for restoring the
                    much-needed order was the reorganization and development (1476) of the ancient
                    <hi rend="italic">hermandad</hi> (brotherhood), a league which had been
                    originally formed by some of the cities for mutual protection against the
                    aggression of the nobles and of the crown, and which had already more than once,
                    by means of it3 “cortes extraordinary,” made its power to be felt <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0091-0082"/> It was now augmented and mobilized as a body of
                    military police for the detection and repression of all crimes against person or
                    property committed on the highways or in the open country. For these ends it
                    proved very useful; and also for another purpose, which is believed to have been
                    aimed at in its constitution, that of checking the arrogance and rapacity of the
                    feudal aristocracy. The next step for the avowed purpose of securing orderly
                    government was the institution of the famous Inquisition as a tribunal for the
                    repression of heresy (and, as some historians do not hesitate to add, for the
                    extortion of money). The necessary bull was obtained from Sixtus IV. in 1478;
                    the court was instituted at Seville in 1480, where the first <hi rend="italic"
                    >auto de fe</hi> took place in the following year. The arrangement was extended
                    to Aragon in 1483, Torquemada being appointed first inquisitor-general. Among
                    other measures taken by Ferdinand and Isabella for the consolidation of their
                    power were the assumption of the grand-masterships of the three great military
                    orders of knighthood, and the vindication from papal usurpation of their ancient
                    rights of ecclesiastical patronage. One result of their firm and on the whole
                    wise policy was that between the years 1477 and 1482 the revenue of the country
                    had been augmented nearly six-fold, and that in 1481 they were free to resume
                    the long-suspended war against the Moors. From the capture of Alhama to the fall
                    of Granada in 1492 (1st January), the Christian arms had met with a series of
                    uninterrupted successes which resulted in the final extinction of the Mahometan
                    power in Spain,—the Moors, however, being permitted the enjoyment of certain
                    stipulated privileges, that of the free exercise of their religion being one. In
                    March 1492 the edict for the expulsion of the Jews was signed at Granada, and it
                    was on the 3d of August in the same year that Columbus sailed from Palos in
                    Andalucia, landing on the island of San Salvador on the 12th of October. In 1493
                    Ferdinand began to look abroad and take apractical interest in European affairs.
                    By the treaty of Senlis he secured from Charles VII1. the restoration of
                    Roussillon (now the department of Pyrénées Orientales) and of Cerdagne (now part
                    of Catalonia), which had been mortgaged by John IL of Aragon to Louis XI. In
                    1494 Charles VIII. having undertaken his great Italian expedition, Ferdinand
                    entered into an alliance with the emperor, the pope, and the states of Milan and
                    Venice, and thus gained a footing in Italy for the Spanish troops which, under
                    Gonsalvo de Cordova, succeeded in expelling Charles from Naples in 1496. By the
                    peace of 1498, however, the throne of that kingdom was left in possession of
                    Frederick. In 1499 the liberty of worship which had been guaranteed to the Moors
                    of Granada was treacherously withdrawn; serious risings in the Alpujarras
                    (Sierra Nevada) were the consequence (1501); a decree was issued in 1502
                    offering to the conquered insurrectionists the alternatives of baptism or exile;
                    and, the latter being usually chosen, Spain had to suffer a second time the loss
                    of many of her most useful subjects. The Neapolitan war again broke out in 1500,
                    and an alliance was formed between Ferdinand and Louis XII. on the basis of a
                    partition of their conquests. This pact was broken by Ferdinand, who by the
                    battles of Cerignola and Garigliano became sovereign of Naples (Ferdinand III.)
                    in 1504. The death of Isabella took place on November 23d of the same year; and
                    in accordance with her will Ferdinand immediately caused his daughter Juana to
                    be proclaimed queen and himself regent. Philip archduke of Austria, the husband
                    of Juana, having disputed the rights of his father-in-law and threatened an
                    appeal to arms, the latter in disgust, with the view of again separating the
                    crowns of Aragon and Castile, entered into negotiations with Louis XII., married
                    Germaine de Foix, the niece of Louis (1505), and shortly afterwards resigned the
                    regency of Castile. On the death of Philip in 1506 he resumed the
                    administration, though not without opposition, and retained it till his death.
                    In 1508 he joined the league of Cambray for the partition of Venice, and thus
                    without any trouble became master of five important Neapolitan cities. In the
                    following year (1509) the African expedition of Cardinal Ximenez was undertaken,
                    which resulted in the conquest of Oran. In 1511 Ferdinand joined Venice and Pope
                    Julius II. in a “holy league” for the expulsion of the French from Italy. This
                    gave a pretext for invading Navarre, which had entered into alliance with
                    France, and been laid under papal interdict in consequence. Aided by his
                    son-in-law Henry VIII. of England, who sent a squadron under the marquis of
                    Dorset to co-operate in the descent on Guienne, Ferdinand became master of
                    Navarre in 1513; and on the 15th of June 1515, by a solemn act in cortes held at
                    Burgos, he incorporated it with the kingdom of Castile. He died at Madrigalejo
                    (Estremadura) early in the following year, 23d January 1516. It is said that his
                    death was accelerated by a potion which in his desire for posterity he had taken
                    in order to reinvigorate his exhausted constitution. He was succeeded by his
                    grandson Charles I. of Spain, more generally known by his European title as the
                    emperor Charles V.</p>
                <p>Though by no means a great general, Ferdinand possessed undoubted military
                    capacity; though not a great statesman, he had abundant political skill. The
                    largeness of his ambition was somewhat incongruously associated with a
                    narrowness of view which showed itself very unfortunately for Spain in many
                    instances, particularly in his treatment of the Moors and Jews, and with a
                    smallness of nature which suffered him to treat with neglect his most faithful
                    servants and greatest benefactors, such as Columbus, Navarro, and Ximenez
                    himself. Yet his name is inseparably associated with the most splendid of all
                    periods in the annals of Spain. It was under his guidance that the kingdom was
                    consolidated and grew into its position of highest prosperity and greatest
                    influence as a European power. And this must be admitted even when it is
                    remembered that few sovereigns have been associated with such consorts as
                    Isabella was, or surrounded by a band of men so distinguished as were Mendoza,
                    Talavera, Ximenez, Gonsalvo de Cordova, and Pedro Navarro.</p>
