                <p><label type="entry">FREDERICK II</label>. (1194-1250), Holy Roman Emperor,
                    8urnamed the Hohenstaufen, the most remarkable historic figure of the Middle
                    Ages, grandson of the preceding, and son of Henry VI. and of Constance, heiress
                    of the throne of Sicily, was born at Jesi, near Ancona, 26th December 1194. He
                    was elected king of the Romans in 1196; and, his father having died 28th
                    September 1197, he was in May 1198, crowned king of Sicily, his mother obtaining
                    for him the recognition and support of Pope Innocent III. by acknowledging the
                    feudal supremacy of the papacy, by the sacrifice of certain ecclesiastical
                    rights, and by the payment of a yearly tribute. Dying the same year, she
                    bequeathed his guardianship to the pope; but for some time after this, Sicily
                    was the scene of hopeless political anarchy, and the custody of the young king
                    at Palermo was the occasion of continual and complicated intrigues, and of a
                    confused and protracted civil war which had very varying results. The pope could
                    thus only fulfil his trust imperfectly, but the education of his ward, so far
                    from suffering on this account, was exceptionally thorough and complete; and the
                    different nationalities with which he came into contact contributed each its
                    quota to the instruction and development of his strong and many-sided
                    character.</p>
                <p>Though crowned in infancy king of the Romans, he actually inherited from his
                    father no other throne than that of Naples and Sicily. In 1208 he entered upon
                    the personal government of his kingdom, and in the following year he was married
                    to Constance of Aragon. About this time, Otto, second son of Henry the Lion,
                    had, on account of the murder of Philip of Hohenstaufen by Otto of Wittelsbach,
                    obtained undisputed possession of the throne of Germany; but immediately after
                    his coronation at Rome in 1209 the inevitable jealousy between pope and emperor
                    led to the usual results, and when Otto was meditating the subjugation of Naples
                    and Sicily, he was met in 1211 by a bull of excommunication. At a diet held at
                    Nuremberg in October of the same year it was resolved to offer the crown of
                    Germany to the young king of Sicily. Innocent III. on certain conditions gave
                    his sanction to the offer; and to Frederick, even had he seen in it nothing to
                    incite his imaginative ardour, it must have appeared almost in the form of an
                    unexpected deliverance from impending ruin. Having therefore resolved to dispute
                    his ancestral throne with his rival, he set out in the spring of 1212 on his
                    romantic and hazardous quest. Landing at Genoa on the 1st of May accompanied by
                    only a few adherents, he made his way over the Alps by unfrequented passes to
                    Coire, and learning at St Gall that Otto was about to occupy Constance, he by
                    great good fortune was able to anticipate him by three hours. The town at once
                    declared in Frederick’s favour, and Otto, without seriously attempting to resist
                    his progress in southern Germany, retired to Saxony. In November of the same
                    year Frederick made a treaty with Philip of France, and in December he was
                    elected king <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> at Frankfort, and crowned at Mainz.
                    By inherent force of character, aided by his unrivalled diplomatic skill and his
                    bold and rapid movements, he had won success almost without striking a blow; and
                    his task was at least denuded of all difficulty through Otto’s disastrous defeat
                    by Philip at Bouvines, near Tournay, 27th July 1214. Any further organized
                    resistance was thus rendered impossible against the progress of the
                    Hohenstaufen, who in July 1215 ascended the marble throne of Charlemagne at
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, and received the silver crown. At a solemn ceremony which
                    followed he took the cross; but even after the death of Otto in May 1218 he was
                    fully occupied in establishing his influence in Germany. In 1220 he succeeded in
                    obtaining the election of his son Henry to the German throne, but the favour was
                    dearly rewarded by the charter which by the independent privileges it conferred
                    upon the princes virtually dissolved the unity of the kingdom. The election was
                    contrary to a promise made to Pope Innocent III. to appoint Henry king of
                    Sicily, but Pope Honorius III., anxious for the success of the crusade, was
                    pacified without much difficulty, and Frederick leaving Germany in the autumn of
                    1220 was crowned emperor at Rome on the 22d November, renewing at the same time
                    his oath to set out on the crusade with all possible speed. His absence in
                    Germany had permitted the growth of disorder and confusion in his southern
                    kingdom; and to restrain the licence of the Apulian nobles he now established at
                    Capua a tribunal to revise their privileges, while, to deliver the Christians in
                    Sicily from.the attacks to which they were continually exposed from the Saracen
                    mountain tribes, he transferred 2000 Saracens to Lucera, an expedient which also
                    established in Italy a convenient instrument of resistance to the papal
                    power.</p>
                <p>The departure of the crusade, at first fixed for 1223, was deferred till 1225,
                    and even then it w*as found necessary to delay it for two years longer; but, his
                    wife Constance having died in 1222, he gave a pledge that his ambition coincided
                    with the papal wishes by marrying in 1225 Yolande, daughter of King John of
                    Jerusalem; and he also bound himself by heavy penalties to set out with a
                    stipulated force in August 1227. The hostilities between him and the Lombard
                    league, begun in 1226, were suspended through the intercession of Pope Honorius
                    in February 1227, and the Lombards agreed to furnish a certain number of knights
                    for the expedition. In March Honorius died, and was succeeded by Gregory IX.,
                    who on the very day of his accession addressed a new and imperative warning to
                    the emperor against delay in the fulfilment of his oath. Frederick actually set
                    out at the time agreed upon, but returned three days afterwards, and, asserting
                    as his reason a serious illness, permitted the armament to be dissolved,
                    whereupon Gregory without further negotiation launched against him, September
                    30, the solemn bull of excommunication. The appeal to Christendom with which
                    Frederick met the church’s fulmination is remarkable in that, so far from
                    contenting himself with defending his own conduct, he, besides denouncing the
                    temporal pretensions of the pope as menacing the whole of Christendom with an
                    “unheard-of tyranny,” asserted that instead of rolling in wealth and aspiring to
                    worldly influence the church’s representatives ought to cultivate the simplicity
                    and self-denial of the early Christians. In resolving to set out on the crusade,
                    notwithstanding his excommunication, Frederick was therefore actuated, not
                    merely by the wish to take possession of a secular throne, or to demonstrate the
                    sincerity of his purpose to keep his oath, but by the determination to assert
                    his right still to act as the temporal head of the church. His preparations were
                    not delayed by the death of his wife Yolande in April 1228, and he set <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0767-0732"/> sail from Otranto on the 29th June. Meanwhile, by
                    securing the favour of the Frangipani aιid the other Roman patricians, he
                    procured the expulsion of Gregory from Rome; but the subtle spiritual influence
                    of the papal ban was not affected by this seeming victory, and tidings of his
                    excommunication reaching the Holy Land almost simultaneously with his arrival,
                    the Knights of the Temple and the Hospital refused to take part in the crusade.
                    Frederick, however, by mere diplomatic tact succeeded in persuading the sultan
                    of Egypt to agree to a treaty, by which the church obtained possession of
                    Jerusalem and the holy places on granting to the Saracens, besides various other
                    privileges, free access to Bethlehem; and on the 18th March 1229 he, without any
                    religious ceremony, crowned himself with his own hands king of Jerusalem. Such a
                    striking and unexpected success wrought almost immediately throughout Europe a
                    complete revolution of opinion in his favour; and when shortly afterwards he
                    succeeded in defeating the papal forces which had invaded his dominions, the
                    pope deemed it expedient to come to terms, and released him from the ban of
                    excommunication 28th August 1230.</p>
                <p>In the interval of peace which followed, Frederick occupied himself in forming
                    for his Sicilian kingdom a code of laws, the main features of which were the
                    superseding of irresponsible feudal and ecclesiastical jurisdictions by a
                    uniform civil legislation administered under direct imperial control; the
                    toleration extended to Jews and Mahometans, and the severe enactments against
                    schismatics; the provisions for the emancipation of the peasants; the
                    regulations for the encouragement of commerce, which contain perhaps the first
                    enunciation of the modern doctrine of free trade; and the establishment of
                    annual parliaments, consisting of barons, prelates, and representatives from the
                    towns and cities. He also devoted much of his attention to the advancement of
                    learning and of the arts and sciences. The university of Naples, founded in
                    1224, bat whose operations had been for some time suspended, he now restored and
                    liberally endowed; at the medical schools of Salerno he provided Arab, Latin,
                    Greek, and Hebrew teachers for the students of these different nationalities;
                    and he caused the translation into Latin of the works of Aristotle and of other
                    philosophers both Greek and Arabic. He himself was learned both in Mussulman
                    arts and sciences and in Christian scholasticism and philosophy; he knew Latin,
                    Greek, French, German, Arabic, and Hebrew. He had a great interest in
                    architecture, and he fostered the infancy of Italian sculpture and painting; he
                    and his minister Peter de Vinea were among the first cultivators of Italian
                    poetry; he also devoted much attention to natural history, and besides forming
                    large collections of rare and curious animals wrote a treatise on the art of
                    falconry, which shows a minute acquaintance with the habits of birds. With the
                    influences of Western civilization there was conjoined at his castles on the
                    Apulian shore an Oriental luxury and splendour; and in the harem of the
                    Christian emperor his accusers found a convenient corroboration of their
                    insinuation regarding his secret enmity to the Christian faith.</p>
                <p>The short period of peaceful progress was broken in 1234 by the rebellion of
                    Frederick’s son Henry, who, secretly instigated by the pope, joined the Lombard
                    league. The revolt was, however, suppressed on the arrival of the emperor in
                    Germany in 1235, and Henry was sent as a prisoner to the castle of San Felice in
                    Apulia. In the same year Frederick married Isabella, sister of Henry III. of
                    England. Conrad, second son of the emperor, was chosen king by the German
                    princes in January 1237; and Frederick, after the disastrous defeat of the
                    Lombards at Cortenuova, November 27th of this year, appointed, in October 1238,
                    his natural son Enzio king of Sardinia. Alarmed at the success of the imperial
                    arms, Gregory, in March 1239, renewed against the emperor the ban of
                    excommunication; but the latter advancing into the states of the church,
                    captured Ravenna, Faenza, and Benevento; and after gaining, through the help of
                    Enzio, a brilliant victory over the Genoese fleet, was nearing Rome when Gregory
                    died August 21, 1241. After the short pontificate of Celestine IV. and an
                    interregnum of eighteen months, Cardinal Sinibald Fiesco, up to this time one of
                    the emperor’s chief friends, became pope as Innocent IV. in June 1243. At once
                    negotiations were entered into for an arrangement between them; but the papal
                    demands were too humiliating to permit of their acceptance; and Innocent,
                    suddenly making Lis escape to Lyons, not only renewed, July 17, 1245, the
                    church’s ban against the emperor, but declared his throne vacant. Henry Raspe of
                    Thuringia, elected by the papal party king of the Romans in May 1246, gained a
                    victory over Conrad at Frankfort on the 5th August, but, suffering a total
                    defeat near Ulm, February 17, 1247, died shortly afterwards; and between his
                    successor William of Holland and Conrad the struggle was carried on with
                    indecisive results. In this same year Peter de Vinea, the minister and most
                    intimate friend of Frederick, was discovered plotting against his life; on 18th
                    February 1248 Frederick’s army in Italy was surprised and utterly routed by a
                    sally of the citizens of Parma; in May 1249 his son Enzio was defeated and
                    captured by the Bolognese; and, although in 1250 various successes in the north
                    of Italy and the prospect of new and powerful alliances seemed to promise him a
                    speedy and complete triumph, his strength had been so worn out by his arduous
                    struggle, and his spirit so broken by such a succession of disasters that he
                    died somewhat suddenly on the 13th December, at his hunting lodge of Fiorentino
                    (also called Firenzuola), near Lucera.</p>
                <p>The general contemporary opinion regarding Frederick II. is expressed in the
                    words <hi rend="italic">stupor</hi><hi rend="italic">mundi</hi>; and whatever
                    amount either of approbation or censure may be bestowed upon his career, wonder
                    and perplexity are the predominant sentiments which its contemplation even yet
                    awakens. It was not merely that his mental endowments were exceptionally great,
                    but that, owing to his mingled German and Italian blood, the various influences
                    to which he was subjected in his early years, the strange times in which he
                    lived, and the events with which destiny had connected him, his character was
                    exhibited in such multiform aspects and in such an individual and peculiar light
                    that in history we look in vain for his parallel. As to the nature of his
                    religious faith there are no data for arriving at a certain conclusion. The
                    theory of Μ. Huillard-Bréholles that he wished to unite with the functions of
                    emperor those of a spiritual pontiff, and aspired to be the founder of a new
                    religion, is a conjecture insufficiently supported by the isolated facts and
                    statements and the general considerations on which it is made to rest. Indeed
                    the character of Frederick seems to have been widely removed from that of a
                    religious enthusiast; and at every critical period of his life he was urged to
                    daring and adventurous projects rather by external circumstances than by either
                    the promptings of ambition or the consciousness of any divine commission. On any
                    theory his enactments in reference to religion are, however, somewhat
                    enigmatical. His perse-cutioh of heretics may not have been entirely due to a
                    desire to vindicate his orthodoxy before his Christian subjects; but although
                    his ideas regarding freedom of conscience were either inconsistent or hampered
                    in their action by a regard to expediency, his toleration of the Jews equally
                    with the Mahometans prevents us ascribing his toleration of the latter either to
                    secret sympathy with that form of faith or wholly to political <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n768/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0768-0733"/> considerations. He was in all probability a
                    believer in astrology, and he shared in many of the other superstitious ideas of
                    his time; but there is no indication that he dreaded any other than temporal
                    consequences from the ban of the church; and if certain features of the
                    Christian system had perhaps an attraction for him, yet both from his reported
                    jests and serious conversation it is evident that his Christian belief, if he
                    possessed one, bore little resemblance to that current in his age. In the
                    extravagant accusations of cruelty, perfidy, and licentiousness with which the
                    church has assailed his memory there is some nucleus of truth; but a candid
                    judgment will arrive at the conclusion that few exposed to such pernicious
                    influences have shown such a decided preference for goodness and truth, and that
                    there have been almost none who against such immense difficulties have wrought
                    to such wise purpose in behalf of human progress and enlightenment, or have
                    fought such a resolute and advantageous battle in behalf of spiritual freedom.
                    In this contest he was not an immediate victor; and indeed the dissolution of
                    the imperial power in Italy which followed bis death must be chiefly traced to
                    the fact that his policy was governed by principles too much in advance of his
                    age. But although the beneficial results of his reign are not at a first glance
                    so palpable and undeniable as some of its injurious results, yet so far was he
                    from being a mere untimely precursor of the new era which dawned in Europe more
                    than two centuries after his death that, perhaps in a greater degree than any
                    other, he was instrumental in hastening its arrival, both by sowing the first
                    seeds of the Renaissance in Italy, and by giving to the old system of things a
                    shock which was felt throughout Europe, and continued to work silently long
                    after its reverberations had passed away.</p>
                <p>After the death of Frederick the followers of Abbot Joachim continued to assert
                    that he was still alive, and both in Sicily and Germany impostors sprang up who
                    attempted to personate him. The superstition that the “emperor continued to
                    haunt the castle of Kyffhäuser,” at one time thought to refer to Frederick
                    Barbarossa, has now been shown to have had its origin in the tradition that
                    Frederick II. still lived after he had ceased to exercise the functions of
                    emperor.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Regarding the
