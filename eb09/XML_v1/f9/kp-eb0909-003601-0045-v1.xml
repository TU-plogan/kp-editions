                <p><label type="entry">FARNESE</label>, the name of a noble Italian house, to which
                    belonged Pope Paul III., the celebrated Elizabeth, wife of Philip V. of Spain,
                    and a long line of princes of Parma, including the great governor of the
                    Netherlands. The first member of the family known in history was Ranuccio
                    Farnese, a successful general of the church, who held the papal fiefs of Farnese
                    and Montalto in the 13th century. Several of his decendants also fought with
                    distinction in the armies of the Holy See, and others allied themselves with
                    Florence, Venice, Siena, and other states, among whom may be mentioned Pietro
                    Farnese, who led the Florentines to victory over Pisa in the middle of the 14th
                    century. The historical importance of the Farnesi dates, however, from the
                    accession of Alessandro Farnese to the papal throne as Paul III. Through his
                    unblushing nepotism the dignity and domains of the family were greatly enlarged.
                    For its aggrandisement the fiefs of Parma and Piacenza, Castro, and Camerino
                    were alienated from the papacy; the marquisate of Novara was obtained from
                    Charles V.; and marriages were arranged which allied it with the royal houses of
                    Spain and France.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pierluigi Farnese</hi> (1493-1547), born in 1493, was the
                    natural son of Pope Paul III., who appointed him gonfaloniere, or
                    captain-general of the armies of the church, created him sovereign duke of Parma
                    and Piacenza, and obtained for him the much coveted dignity of patrician of
                    Venice. His character was shamelessly vicious and tyrannical. He deprived his
                    nobles of their most dearly cherished privileges, forbade them to maintain armed
                    retainers, and forced them, on pain of confiscation, to leave their estates and
                    reside in the towns. His cruelty appeared in his ruthless massacre of the people
                    of Perugia, who had revolted against his father; and his uncontrollable passion
                    in the outrage he committed against the bishop of Fano. At length a conspiracy
                    against him was formed among his own subjects, assisted by Ferrante Gonzago, the
                    imperial governor of Milan, and he was assassinated in his palace. His body was
                    flung from the window, and dragged by the mob in triumph through the streets,
                    September 10, 1547. (See Affo, <hi rend="italic">Vita Pierluigi
                    Farnese.}</hi></p>
                <p>Pierluigi had several children, for all of whom Paul made a careful and generous
                    provision. The eldest, Alessandro Farnese (1519-1589), was, while a mere child,
                    created bishop of Parma by Clement VΠ., and he was only fourteen when his
                    grandfather, Paul III., appointed him cardinal. He was a man of learning, and of
                    artistic tastes. It was he who completed the Farnese palace. He also displayed
                    the diplomatic ability which appeared natural to his family, as papal envoy to
                    Germany, France, and the Low Countries. Orazio, the third son of Pierluigi, Paul
                    created duke of Castro, and married to Diana, natural daughter of Henry II. of
                    France. His fourth son, Ranuccio, was· made a cardinal when fourteen years of
                    age.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ottavio Farnesk</hi> (1520-86), the second son and successor
                    of Pierluigi, was bom in 1520. The marquisate of Novara was obtained for him as
                    an imperial fief by his grandfather Paul III., in pursuance of whose policy he
                    was married at twelve years of age to Margaret of Austria (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Margaret of Parma),</hi> daughter of Charles V., and widow of
                    the debauched Alessandro de’ Medici. She was then twenty, and not unnaturally
                    looked with dislike upon the boy bridegroom to whom she was compelled to unite
                    herself. For several years she refused to live with him; but after his return,
                    wounded, from the expedition into Barbary, in which he had fought bravely under
                    her father, her aversion seems to have entirely disappeared. But a life of
                    activity and independence was best suited to her character, and in 1559 she
                    again separated from him, being appointed governor of the Netherlands, which she
                    ruled with masculine resolution for eight years. Besides taking part in the
                    expedition to Barbary, Ottavio also fought for Charles, at the head of the
                    Italian auxiliaries, against the Protestants of Germany. He was twenty-seven
                    when, by the murder of his father, he became duke of Parma. Piacenza was held by
                    the imperialist troops which had seized it; and the means to be used for its
                    recovery became the subject of a quarrel between the pope and Ottavio, who was
                    supported by his brother Cardinal Alessandro. In consequence, Paul commanded the
                    governor of Parma, Camillo Orsino, to refuse admittance to his grandson. Ottavio
                    retaliated by an unsuccessful attack upon Parma, and even appealed to his enemy
                    the emperor for assistance. The death of Paul, hastened by vexation at this
                    unnatural rebellion, quickly followed; and Julius III., under the influence of
                    the two cardinals Farnese, restored Parma to Ottavio. His quarrel with the
                    emperor, however, was not at an end; and in 1551, having formed an alliance with
                    Henry II. of France, he was driven from his fiefs by the imperial party. But it
                    was not long before the influence of his wife obtained his restoration. The rest
                    of his life was spent peacefully at home, and the moderation of his government
                    earned for him the affection of his people. He died in 1586, and was succeeded
                    by his son, Alessandro Farnese, the great servant of Philip II., noticed
                    separately below.</p>
                <p>Ranuccio Farnese (1569-1622), born in 1569, was the son of the famous Alessandro
                    Farnese, prince of Parma, under whom he served for some time in the Low
                    Countries. His gloomy pride and his avarice rendered him unpopular, and his
                    suspicious temper led him into several acts of atrocious cruelty. On the birth
                    of a legitimate heir, he placed his bastard son, whom he had formerly intended
                    to make his successor, in strict confinement, in which the young man soon died;
                    and on the charge of being implicated in a conspiracy, in the real existence of
                    which few believed, he beheaded several of his nobles, confiscated their
                    estates, and hanged numbers of their retainers. He had, however, some taste for
                    art; and he built a fine theatre at Parma on the model of the ancient Roman
                    theatres. He died in 1622. His son Odoardo (1612—46) fought in alliance with
                    France against Spain. His failure to pay the interest of the money he had
                    borrowed at Rome, and the desire of the pope to obtain the duchy of Castro for
                    his relatives, the Barberini, gave rise to a war with Urban VIII. Odoardo’s
                    successor, Ranuccio, was also engaged in war with the Holy See; and, during his
                    reign, Innocent, takingadvantage of his weakness, and using as pretext the
                    murder of the bishop of Castro, razed that town.</p>
                <p>In 1731 the male line of Farnese became extinct by the death of Antonio Farnese.
                    But Antonio’s daughter, Elizabeth Farnese (noticed below), was the queen of
                    Philip V. of Spain, and through her efforts her sons succeeded to the Farnese
                    fiefs, the duchy of Castro being secured to Don Philippo by the treaty of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), and the rest falling to the share of Don Carlos (at that
                    time king of Naples and Sicily, afterwards king of Spain), <pb break="no"

                    Rome—the Palazzo Farnese and the Farnese gardens. A large part of the Farnese
                    art collection—including the Hercules, the Bull, and the Flora—was removed to
                    the museum at Naples. The Neapolitan court resided in the Farnese palace for
                    many years. In 18G1 the Farnese gardens, which belonged to the pope, and had
                    been held in fee by the king of Naples, were bought by Napoleon III. from
                    Francis II. for 250,000 francs, and they now belong to the Italian Government,
                    which bought them in 1870 for 650,000 francs. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
