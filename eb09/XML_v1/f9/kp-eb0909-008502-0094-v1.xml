                <p><label type="entry">FERGHANA</label>, now a province of Russian Turkestan, is the
                    valley containing the bead waters of the Sir Darya or Jaxartes (one of the two
                    great feeders of Lake Aral), and lies among the western ranges of the Thian Shan
                    mountains, which inclose it on every side except at its west extremity, where
                    the river emerges, passing Khojend, into the plains of western Turkestan. It is
                    of oval form, and extends approximately from 70° to 74° E. long., and from a
                    little below 40° to 42° N. lat, having on the N. the mountains which separate it
                    from the valleys of the Chirchik and the Talas, and on the S. the comparatively
                    unbroken chain which divides it from the mountain state of Karategin, and
                    further east from the long highland strath or steppe of the Alai.</p>
                <p>There is only one road into Ferghana practicable for wheeled vehicles, viz., that
                    from Khojend. The road from Bokhara to Kashgar enters the valley at the same
                    place, and passing along its entire length crosses the southern border range by
                    the Terek pass. This road, which passes through the chief towns of the province,
                    was before our era perhaps the most important route of the active trade between
                    China and the West, and has ever since been much frequented for general
                    purposes. The direct road from Bokhara to Kuldja also runs through Ferghana, but
                    the longer and easier route by Tashkend is usually preferred. Roads to
                    Badakhshân and the south cross the Alai range by passes 12,000 to 14,000 feet
                    high.</p>
                <p>Ths Sir Darya rises in the south-east corner of the valley, but only takes that
                    name after joining the Naryn, a much longer and more considerable stream, having
                    first given off several large canals for irrigation. Its affluents from the
                    north are few and unimportant; about one-third of the valley lies to the north
                    of the Sir, where, except in the rich districts round and to the eastof
                    Namangh⅛n,the land is usually poor, hilly, and ill-watered. On the south,
                    however, along the foot of the hills, a rich belt of cultivation 10 to 27 miles
                    wide extends with few interruptions for about 160 miles. For luxuriant beauty
                    this region is unequalled in Central Asia, and its wealth, being the combined
                    result of climate, soil, and abundant water, might be developed indefinitely.
                    The banks of the Sir (like those of the Naryn) are almost everywhere sandy and
                    sterile, for its waters are scarcely used for irrigation except near its source,
                    and countless streams flowing from the southern mountains are absorbed by
                    irrigation before reaching it. These mountains fall gradually towards the valley
                    (whose greatest width is about 65 miles) in a succession of minor parallel
                    ranges, inclosing terraces or valleys, each usually with its village, and
                    cultivated up to over 4000 feet. These valleys are of easy slope; the transverse
                    valleys through which the streams force their way to the plain are shorter,
                    steeper, and less capable of cultivation. Rich alpine pastures occur at the
                    heads of the valleys; the barren tracts in the plain are used for winter
                    grazing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agricultural Produce, &lt;L∙c.—</hi> All the products of the
                    valley (which is 1200 to 1500 feet above sea-level) are cultivated up to 3000 or
                    4000 feet. Grapes, indeed, ripen at 5800 feet, and barley at 8500. Produce is
                    classed for taxation under three heads—field produce, garden produce, and
                    fruit-trees. Among the first are wheat, barley, rice, pulses, maize, sorghum,
                    and millet; among the second, melons, water melons, pumpkins, pease and beans,
                    onions, garlic, carrots, red-pepper, madder and other dye plants, cotton,
                    tobacco, flax, and oil-seeds. Among the fruits are excellent grapes, apples,
                    pears, plums, peaches, almonds, mulberries, figs, and pomegranates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate generally is healthier and more
                    equable than that of Russian Turkestan. The winters are milder, and in summer,
                    though the heat is oppressive, the nights are cool. Little rain falls except in
                    the mountains. The sky is sometimes darkened by a dry mist of fine dust, to
                    which, in great measure, Richthofen attributes in other parts of Asia the
                    formation of vast deposits of loess (see vol. V. p. 632).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Towns.—</hi> The principal towns, which nearly all lie in the
                    fertile belt above described, are—Khokand, the late capital of the khanate, with
                    a population of 50,000 to 70,000; Namanghân, the only important place north of
                    the Sir Darya, 20,000; Andijân, the capital in Baber’s time, 20,000; and
                    Marghilân, the chief seat of the silk manufacture, 30,000. Ush, with Usgand,
                    Gulsha, and other smaller places in the hill district to the south-east, is
                    frequented by the Kirghiz, who cultivate their barley and wheat in the
                    neighbourhood. Usgand appears, from its architectural remains of the 12th
                    century, to have been a place of considerable extent. Kassan, in the north, is a
                    very ancient Tajik town.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population of Ferghana, which for Central
                    Asia is a thickly-peopled region, is about 900,000, of which perhaps two-thirds
                    are settled and the remainder nomad. The settled population consists chiefly of
                    Tajiks and Uzbegs; the former, the early Aryan inhabitants, are found in
                    greatest purity in the lower mountain valleys; those in the chief towns and
                    central districts, who are known as Sarts, show a large infusion of Uzbeg and
                    other Turki blood. The Uzbegs, who predominate in numbers, are here much more
                    modified by the Tajik element than they are in Bokhara. Being the dominant race,
                    their name is assumed by the various other Turk and Tatar elements, which in
                    successive waves have swept over or occupied this region for more than 2000
                    years.' There are also settlements of Kashgaris, who have fled from Chinese
                    oppression. The nomads are mainly Kipchaks and Kara Kirghiz or Buruts; the
                    former, the braver and more capable race, is indeed only half nomadic, occupying
                    chiefly the northern and eastern districts of the valley. The others have their
                    summer quarters in the surrounding mountains and high plateaus, chiefly in the
                    Alai and Pamir, and winter in the valley, where they eke out a livelihood by
                    cultivating patches of barley, wheat, and lucerne, thus becoming amenable to
                    taxation and control. They are poorer than the settled population, who are
                    usually well-to-do. The townspeople especially are fond of good living and
                    sociable, and being, like the Sarts everywhere, keen traders, drive good <pb

                    Mahometans; their language the classic Chaghatai Turkish, slightly influenced,
                    M. Vambéry says, by the harsher dialect of the tribes to the north-east.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Ferghana was not protected by its mountain
                    barriers from the vicissitudes which befell its neighbours. Overrun by the Arabs
                    in 719, and subject to the Samanides in the 9th and 10th centuries, it formed
                    part, successively, of the conquests of the Kara Ki tai, of J enghiz Khan, and
                    of Timur, whose descendant Baber was expelled in 1513 by the Uzbegs. After a
                    long period of disintegration the khanate was reconsolidated about 1770 by
                    Narbuta Bai, a reputed descendant of Baber, and until 1853, when the last series
                    of Russian aggressions began, the dominions of his successors, the khans of
                    Khokand, extended far beyond the valley of Ferghana to the north and nortħ-west.
                    Their influence, everywhere considerable, was most actively exerted in Kashgar,
                    probably from commercial reasons, the Chinese allowing them to maintain agents
                    there to supervise the Khokandi traders and collect dues. The encroachments of
                    Russia were made easier by the continual jealousy between Khokand and Bokhara,
                    and by dissensions between the nomad and settled populations. The late ruler,
                    Khudayar Khan, though more than once driven out by his oppressed subjects,
                    always kept on good terms with the advancing Russians, who in 1874 sent a
                    mission to Khokand. They found Khudayar setting out to suppress a Kirghiz
                    rising, and, as the disturbances increased, persuaded him to retire with them
                    and to place his country at the disposal of the czar. They then ostensibly
                    adopted his son Nasr-ed-din, appropriating, at the same time, all the country
                    north of the Sir Their conduct, however, soon fanned the existing irritation
                    into a religious war against the Russians, whose position for a time was
                    critical, and the movement was only crushed, and the province annexed, after
                    great destruction of life and property.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trade.—</hi> There are no trustworthy statistics of the trade
                    of Ferghana. Russian produce is probably imported to the value of 2,600,000
                    rubles (about £370,000), chiefly cotton, woollen, and leather manufactures,
                    yarn, and hardware.</p>
                <p>Most of the tea comes ostensibly from Russia'; but a great deal of Indian tea is
                    smuggled in. The chief exports are silk and cotton. Raw silk, value about Rs.
                    637,000,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The total
                    production is estimated by Petrofski, agent to the Russian ministry of finance,

                    Rs. 330,000, go to Tashkend, the principal mart of Russian Turkestan. Among
                    minor exports are timber, flax, wool, salt, and fruits fresh and dried. There is
                    also a good deal of trade with Bokhara and with Kashgar. Manufactures are little
                    developed: coarse cotton stuffs are made in large quantities for home use and
                    export; also some woollens, hardware, and pottery of a certain merit. There are
                    paper-mills at Khokand and at Charku, which supply nearly all Central Asia; the
                    manufacture resembles the Chinese, one of the few remaining traces of a former
                    extensive intercourse. Gun factories of a rude order exist at Khokand and
                    Andijan.</p>
                <p>There is considerable mineral wealth. Naphtha, rock-salt, and gypsum are
                    extensively worked; iron-ore, argentiferous lead, coal, and sulphur have been
                    found, and gold in the head-streams of the Sir.</p>

                    Russians have in the main adopted) has been about £360,000,<note anchored="true"

                    seven districts, viz., Khokand, Marghilân, Andijan, Ush, Uchmian'or Wadil,
                    Namanghân, and Chust. The administrative centre is removed from Khokand to
                    Marghilân, as the nomads are more easily controlled from that quarter. Justice
                    is administered in civil cases by the <hi rend="italic">shariat,</hi> or

                    Russian code. The affairs of the nomads are managed by their own elders, who are
                    obliged to adopt any new regulations imposed by the Government.</p>
