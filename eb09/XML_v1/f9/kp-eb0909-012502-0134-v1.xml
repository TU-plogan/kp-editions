                <p><label type="entry">FEVER</label> (from <hi rend="italic">ferveo,</hi> to burn).
                    This term, which may be defined as a condition of the body characterized by an
                    increase in temperature, is used in medicine with a wide application. Fever is
                    one of the most common accompaniments of diseases in general, and serves to make
                    the distinction between <hi rend="italic">febrile</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >nonfebrUe</hi> ailments. In many cases the fever must be regarded as only
                    secondary to, and symptomatic of, the morbid state with which it is found
                    associated. But there is a large class of diseases in which fever is the
                    predominant factor, and which, although differing widely among themselves as to
                    their characters and pathological manifestations, are believed to arise from the
                    introduction into the system of something of the nature of a poison, upon which
                    all the morbid phenomena depend. To such diseases the term primary or specific
                    fevers is applied.</p>
                <p>In considering the general subject of fever regard must be had in particular to
                    the two main features of the febrile process,—viz., the abnormal elevation of
                    temperature, and the changes affecting the tissues of the body in reference
                    thereto. Indeed, the two points are inseparably associated.</p>
                <p>The average heat of the body in health ranges between 98 4° and 99 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5° F. It is liable to slight variations from such
                    causes as the ingestion of food, the amount of exercise, and the temperature of
                    the surrounding atmosphere. There are, moreover, certain appreciable diurnal
                    variations, the lowest temperature being between the hours of 1.30 and 7 A. Μ.,
                    and the highest between 4 and 9 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.,</hi> with trifling
                    fluctuations during these periods.</p>
                <p>The development and maintenance of heat within the body is generally regarded as
                    depending on the destructive oxidation of all its tissues, consequent on the
                    changes continually taking place in the processes of nutrition. In health this
                    constant tissue disintegration is exactly counterbalanced by the introduction of
                    food, while the uniform normal temperature is maintained by the due adjustment
                    of the heat thus developed, and the processes of exhalation and cooling which
                    take place from the emunctories of the body, particularly the lungs and skin. In
                    the febrile state this relationship is no longer preserved, the tissue waste
                    being greatly in excess of the food supply, while the so-called law of
                    temperature is in abeyance. In this condition the body wastes rapidly, the loss
                    to the system being chiefly in the form of nitrogen compounds (urea, &lt;fcc.).
                    The extent of this loss has been made the subject of research by many
                    authorities, more particularly by Dr Senator, whose general conclusion is that
                    in the early stage of fever a patient excretes about three times as much urea as
                    he would do on the same diet if he were in health—the difference being that in
                    the latter condition he discharges a quantity of nitrogen equal to that taken in
                    in the form of food, while in the former he wastes the store of nitrogen
                    contained in the albumen of the tissues and blood corpuscles. The amount of
                    fever is estimated by the degree of elevation of the temperature above the
                    normal standard. When it reaches as high a point as 106° F. the term
                    hyperpyrexia (excessive fever) is applied, and is regarded as indicating a
                    condition of danger; while if it exceeds 107° or 108° for any length of time,
                    death almost always results. Occasionally in certain fevers and febrile diseases
                    the temperature may attain the elevation of 110°-112° prior to the fatal
                    issue.</p>
                <p>The clinical thermometer now in general use furnishes the physician with the
                    means of estimating accurately the temperature and tracing its fluctuations,
                    while the information it affords serves in many cases to indicate the particular
                    form of fever, even at an early stage, as well as to prognosticate its probable
                    result.</p>
                <p>The leading general symptoms characteristic of the febrile state are certain
                    phenomena connected with its onset, accession, and decline, necessarily modified
                    in degree by the·form the fever assumes, and by its attendant complications. The
                    commencement is usually marked by a rigor or shivering, which may only exist as
                    a slight but persistent feeling of chilliness, or, on the other hand, be of a
                    violent character, and, as occasionally happens with children, find expression
                    in the form of well-marked convulsions. Although termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cold stage</hi> of fever, the temperature of the body in this condition is
                    really increased. There are besides various accompanying feelings of illness,
                    such as pain in the back, headache, sickness, thirst, and great lassitude. In
                    all cases of febrile complaints it is of importance for the physician to note
                    the occurrence of the first rigor, which in general fixes the beginning of the
                    attack. This stage is soon followed by the full development of the febrile
                    condition, the <hi rend="italic">hot stage.</hi> The skin now feels hot and dry,
                    and the temperature, always elevated above the normal standard, will often be
                    found to exhibit diurnal variations corresponding to those observed in health,—
                    namely, a rise towards evening, and a fall towards morning. There is in general
                    a relative increase in the rate of the pulse and the number of respirations. The
                    tongue is dry and furred; the thirst is intense, while the appetite is gone; the
                    urine is scanty, of high specific gravity, containing a large quantity of solid
                    matter, particularly urea, the excretion of which is, as already stated,
                    remarkably increased in fever; while, on the other hand, certain of the saline
                    ingredients, such as the chlorides, are often diminished. The bowels are in
                    general constipated, but they may be relaxed, as is often the case in typhoid
                    fever. The nervous system participates in the general disturbance, and
                    sleeplessness, disquietude, and delirium, more or less violent, are common
                    accompaniments of the febrile state. The waste of the muscles and corresponding
                    loss of strength is very marked, and continues even although considerable
                    quantities of nutriment may be taken.</p>

                <p>The decline of the fever takes place either by the occurrence of a <hi
                    rend="italic">crisis</hi> or sudden termination of the symptoms, often
                    accompanied with some discharge from the body, such as profuse perspiration,
                    copious flow of thick urine, and occasionally diarrhoea, or by a more gradual
                    subsidence of the febrile phenomena, or, as it is technically termed, a <hi
                    rend="italic">lysis.</hi> On the other hand, death may result either from
                    hyperpyrexia or from gradual exhaustion, the patient often passing into the <hi
                    rend="italic">typhoid state</hi> (a condition of extreme prostration of the
                    physical powers, with which are associated low delirium and coma, and which is
                    an occasional mode of death in all acute diseases); or the fatal event may occur
                    suddenly from syncope after slight exertion, in which case it is believed to be
                    due to a softened state of the substance of the heart, one of the known
                    accompaniments of fever.</p>
                <p>Certain well-marked types of fever are recognized, these being determined by the
                    clinical history and peculiar character and sequence of the symptoms.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">continued fever</hi> is applied to those forms in
                    which the febrile temperature persists for a more or less definite period,
                    uninterrupted by any distinct intermission till the crisis is reached. To this
                    type belong simple continued fever or febricula, typhus and typhoid fevers, and
                    the eruptive fevers or exanthemata,—viz., small-pox, measles, and scarlet fever.
                    <hi rend="italic">Relapsing fever</hi> is a form of continued fever, the chief
                    characteristic of which is the occurrence in about a week after the crisis of a
                    distinct relapse and repetition of all the symptoms. Occasionally second and
                    third relapses take place.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">remittent</hi> is applied to those forms of fever the
                    course of which is interrupted by a short usually daily diminution of the
                    febrile phenomena, followed by a recurrence of all the symptoms. Such fevers are
                    chiefly met with in tropical climates, but occasionally continued fevers assume
                    this form, particularly in children. The condition known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >hectic fever,</hi> which occurs in the course of wasting diseases, is markedly
                    remittent in its course.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">intermittent fever</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ague</hi> there
                    is a distinct periodic subsidence of the symptoms, which, according to its
                    duration, characterizes the variety as <hi rend="italic">quotidian</hi> (where
                    the paroxysm recurs in 24 hours), <hi rend="italic">tertian</hi> (in 48 hours),
                    <hi rend="italic">quartan</hi> (in 72 hours). Intermittent fevers are most
                    common in the tropics, and are believed to be due to malarial poisoning.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">malignant</hi> is employed to describe forms of fever
                    in which the blood appears to undergo rapid deteriorating changes, sometimes
                    designated blood-poisoning. Yellow fever may be said to belong to this category
                    and the continued fevers, more especially typhus and the exanthemata,
                    occasionally assume a malignant form from the beginning. The chief forms of
                    fever will be found described in detail under separate headings.</p>
                <p>With respect to the treatment of the febrile condition in general, it may be
                    remarked that modern therapeutics have furnished several methods of great
                    importance and efficacy. It will be sufficient to refer to two of these,—
                    namely, the external application of cold, and the administration of antipyretic
                    remedies or febrifuges. The former of these methods is accomplished by means of
                    baths in which the fever patient is placed, the water being somewhat below the
                    febrile temperature, and gradually cooled down by the addition of cold water
                    till a temperature of from 60°-70° is reached. This process, when continued for
                    only a short time and frequently repeated, has been found to yield most valuable
                    results in many instances of high temperature, both in continued fever and in
                    such febrile ailments as acute rheumatism. The relief to the patient is
                    remarkable, the body rapidly parting with its heat, and the effect usually
                    continues for hours. The explanation suggested by Professor Binz is that “in
                    fever the vessels of the skin are generally much contracted. The cool water acts
                    as a strong stimulant on them, and causes a somewhat stronger contraction to
                    take place, but this is only of short duration. Relaxation for a longer time is
                    the necessary consequence. The hitherto bloodless and dry skin becomes filled
                    and moist, and thus the irradiation of warmth goes on. The cooler the bath the
                    longer it lasts.”</p>
                <p>Certain drugs possess the power of reducing the heat of fever, and are now
                    largely employed for this purpose. The most important of these is quinine,
                    which, when administered in large doses (gr. x.-xxx.), has a marked effect in
                    lowering the febrile temperature, and, if repeated, of keeping it down. It has
                    been supposed that this effect of quinine is due to its action as an antiseptic
                    upon the poison in the blood giving rise to the fever; but there seems a greater
                    degree of probability in the view that it acts as an antitriptic by retarding
                    those excessive tissue changes with which the development of heat is undoubtedly
                    connected. This opinion is strengthened by the fact that after the
                    administration of quinine the amount of urea discharged from the body is greatly
                    diminished. It is said that quinine acts best at those periods of the day when
                    the febrile temperature is inclined to undergo slight remission. Many other
                    substances are used for their antipyretic action, among which may be mentioned
                    digitalis, aconite, salicin, salicilic acid, &amp;c. Alcohol is strongly
                    recommended by some physicians for this purpose, but while its effect in large
                    doses is no doubt to lower the temperature, its extensive employment in fever is
                    objectionable on many important grounds. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> o.
