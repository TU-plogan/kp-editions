                <p><label type="entry">FILIGREE</label>, formerly written filigrain or filigrane
                    (the Italian <hi rend="italic">filigrana,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >filigrane,</hi> Span, <hi rend="italic">filigrana,</hi> Germ. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Drahtgeflecht),</hi> jewel work of a delicate* kind made with threads and beads
                    usually of gold and silver. The compound word from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >filum,</hi> thread, and <hi rend="italic">granum,</hi> grain, is not found in
                    Ducange, and is indeed of modern origin. Though filigree has become a special
                    branch of jewel work in modern times it was anciently part of the ordinary work
                    of the jeweller. Signor Castellani states, in his lecture on “Antique
                    Jewellery,” that all the jewellery of the Etruscans and Greeks was made by
                    soldering together wires and grains or minute plates of gold rather than by
                    hammering or stamping the precious metals in dies.</p>
                <p>The art may be said to consist in curling, twisting, and plaiting fine pliable
                    threads of metal, and uniting them at their points of contact with gold or
                    silver solder and borax, by the help of the blow-pipe. Small grains or beads of
                    the same metals are often set in the eyes of volutes, on the junctions, or at
                    intervals at which they will set off the wire work effectively. The more
                    delicate work is generally protected by framework of stouter wire. Brooches,
                    crosses, earrings, and other personal ornaments of modern filigree are generally
                    surrounded and subdivided by bands of square or flat metal, giving consistency
                    to the filling up, which would not otherwise keep its proper shape.</p>
                <p>Probably the oldest existing jewel work is that which has been found by Belzoni,
                    Wilkinson, Mariette, and other Egyptian discoverers in the tombs of Thebes and
                    other places. Filigree forms an important feature of the ornamentation. Amongst
                    the jewellery now in the British Museum, and in the Louvre in Paris, are
                    examples of the round plaited gold chains of fine wire, such as are still made
                    by the filigree workers of India, and known as Trichinopoly chains. From some of
                    these are hung smaller chains of finer wire with minute fishes and other
                    pendants fastened to them. Most of the rings found in these collections are
                    whipped with gold wire soldered to the hoop. The Greek and Etruscan filigree of
                    about 3000 years ago is of extraordinary fineness and very perfect execution. A
                    number of earrings and other personal ornaments found in Central Italy are
                    preserved in the Campana collection of the Louvre and amongst the gems of the
                    British Museum. Almost all of them are made of filigree work. Some earrings are
                    in the form of flowers of geometric design, bordered by one or more rims each
                    made up of minute volutes of gold wire, and this kind of ornament is varied by
                    slight differences in the way of disposing the number or arrangement of the
                    volutes. But the feathers and petals of modern Italian filigree are not seen in
                    these ancient designs. In many earrings chains hang from the upper part, and
                    tiny birds, such as doves or peacocks covered with enamel, are set amongst these
                    hanging ornaments. Other Etruscan earrings are short tubes of gold, half or
                    three-quarters of an inch long by half an inch or less in diameter, with a plate
                    of gold attached to the side, and the whole surface covered with filigree
                    soldered on in minute patterns. Many rings resemble fishes with the tails in
                    their mouths, made up of thin plates of gold and wire work of the same metal. A
                    beautiful collection of antique examples of Greek <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n173/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0173-0164"/> jewellery found in the Chersonese and along the
                    coast of Asia Minor was placed, before the Crimean war, in a museum at Kertch.
                    Many bracelets and necklaces in that collection are made of twisted wire, some
                    in as many as seven rows of plaiting, with clasps in the shape of heads of
                    animals of beaten work. Others are strings of large beads of gold, with grains
                    of gold, or with volutes and knots of wire soldered over the surfaces. (See the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bosphore</hi><hi rend="italic">Cimmerien,</hi> in which will
                    be found careful engravings of these objects.) In the British Museum a sceptre,
                    probably that of a Greek priestess, is covered with plaited and netted gold
                    wire, finished with a sort of Corinthian capital and a boss of green glass.</p>
                <p>It is probable that in India and various parts of central Asia filigree has been
                    worked from the most remote period without any change in the designs. Whether
                    the Asiatic jewellers were influenced by the Greeks settled on that continent,
                    or merely trained under traditions held in common with them, it is certain that
                    the Indian filigree workers retain the same patterns as those of the ancient
                    Greeks, and work them in the same way, down to the present day. Wandering
                    workmen are given so much gold, coined or rough, which is weighed, heated in a
                    pau of charcoal, beaten into wire, and then worked in the courtyard or verandah
                    of the employer’s house according to the designs of the artist, who weighs the
                    complete work on restoring it and is paid at a specified rate for his labour.
                    Very fine grains or beads and spines of gold, scarcely thicker than coarse hair,
                    projecting from plates of gold are methods of ornamentation still used. This
                    work requires the utmost delicacy of hand to execute, and is of extraordinary
                    richness of effect. Signor Castellani, the modern Cellini of Italy, who has made
                    the antique filigree work of the Etruscans and Greeks his special study, found
                    it for a long time impossible to revive this particular process of delicate
                    soldering; but the difficulty has been overcome at last.</p>
                <p>Passing to later times we may notice in many collections of mediaeval jewel work
                    (such as that in the South Kensington Museum) reliquaries, covers for the
                    gospels, &amp;c., made either in Constantinople from the 6th to the 12th
                    centuries, or in monasteries in Europe, in which Byzantine goldsmiths’ work was
                    studied and imitated. These objects, besides being enriched with precious
                    stones, polished, but not cut into facets, and with enamel, are often decorated
                    with filigree. Large surfaces of gold are sometimes covered with scrolls of
                    filigree soldered on; and comer pieces of the borders of book covers, or the
                    panels of reliquaries, are not unfrequently made up of complicated pieces of
                    plaited work alternating with spaces encrusted with enamel. Byzantine filigree
                    work occasionally has small stones set amongst the curves or knots. Examples of
                    such decoration can be seen in the South Kensington and British Museums.</p>
                <p>In the north of Europe the Saxons, Britons, and Celts were from an early period
                    skilful in several kinds of goldsmiths’ work. As early as the middle of the 5th
                    century the brooches and other personal ornaments of the “Littus Saxonicum” in
                    England were encrusted with enamel, often set in bands of pure gold, and the
                    enamel work varied with borders or centres of filigree.</p>
                <p>The Irish filigree work is more thoughtful in design and more varied in pattern
                    than that of any period or country that could be named. It reached its highest
                    perfection, according to Dr Petrie, in the 10th and 11th centuries. The Royal
                    Irish Academy in Dublin contains a number of reliquaries and personal jewels, of
                    which filigree is the general and most remarkable ornament. The “Tara” brooch
                    has been copied and imitated, and the shape and decoration of it are well known.
                    Instead of fine curls or volutes of gold thread, the Irish filigree is varied by
                    numerous designs in which one thread can be traced through curious knots and
                    complications, which, disposed over large surfaces, balance one another, but
                    always with special varieties and arrangements difficult to trace with the eye.
                    The loDg thread appears and disappears without breach of continuity, the two
                    ends generally worked into the head and the tail of a serpent or a monster. The
                    reliquary containing the “Bell of St Patrick” is covered with knotted work in
                    many varieties. A two-handled chalice, called the “Ardagh cup,” found near
                    Limerick a few years since, has belts, bosses at the junctions of the handles,
                    and the whole lining of the foot ornamented with work of this kind of
                    extraordinary fineness. The late Lord Dunraven <hi rend="italic">{Royal Irish
                    Academy Trans.,</hi> vol. xxiv.) numbers forty varieties of pattern on this cup
                    alone. Some are the Greek fret with Celtic varieties, spiral trumpet-shaped
                    lines, interlaced bands, knots, and arabesques, all in several varieties.</p>
                <p>Much of the mediaeval jewel work all over Europe down to the 15th century, on
                    reliquaries, crosses, croziers, and other ecclesiastical goldsmiths’ work, is
                    set off with bosses and borders of filigree. Filigree work in silver was
                    practised by the Moors of Spain during the Middle Ages with great skill, and was
                    introduced by them and established all over the Peninsula, where silver filigree
                    jewellery of delicate and artistic design is still made in considerable
                    quantities. The manufacture spread over the Balearic Islands, and among the
                    populations that border the Mediterranean. It is still made all over Italy, and
                    in Albania, the Ionian Islands, and many other parts of Greece. That of the
                    Greeks is sometimes on a large scale, with several thicknesses of wires
                    alternating with larger and smaller bosses and beads, sometimes set with
                    torquoises, &lt;fcc., and mounted on convex plates, making rich ornamental
                    headpieces, belts, and breast ornaments. Filigree silver buttons of wire work
                    and small bosses are worn by the peasants in most of the countries that produce
                    this kind of jewellery. Silver filigree brooches and buttons are also made in
                    Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Little chains and pendants are added to much of
                    this northern work. Beautiful specimens have been contributed to the various
                    international exhibitions.</p>
                <p>Some very curious filigree work was brought from Abyssinia after the capture of
                    Magdala—arm guards, slippers, cups, &amp;c., some of which are now in the South
                    Kensington Museum. They are made of thin plates of silver, over which the wire
                    work is soldered. The filigree is subdivided by narrow borders of simple
                    pattern, and the intervening spaces are made up of many patterns, some with
                    grains set at intervals.</p>
                <p>Great interest has been felt in the revival of the designs of antique jewellery
                    by Signor Castellani. He collected examples of the peasant jewellery still made
                    in many provinces of Italy on traditionary designs preserved from a remote
                    antiquity. Most of the decoration is in filigree of many varieties. It was in
                    part through the help of workmen in remote villages, who retained the use of
                    various kinds of solders, long forgotten elsewhere, that the fine reproductions
                    of antique gold filigree have been so beautifully carried into execution in
                    Italy, and by Italian jewellers in London.</p>
                <p>For examples of antique work the student should examine the jewel room of the
                    British Museum, the Campana collection in the Louvre in Paris, and the
                    collection in the South Kensington Museum. The last contains a large and very
                    varied assortment of modern Italian, Spanish, Greek, and other jewellery made
                    for the peasants of various countries. The Celtic work is well represented in
                    the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin. (J. H. P.)</p>
