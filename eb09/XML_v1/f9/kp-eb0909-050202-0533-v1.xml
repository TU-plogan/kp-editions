                    born at Boston in Lincolnshire in 1517. At the age of sixteen he entered
                    Brasenose College, Oxford, where at twenty-one he took the degree of B.A., and
                    five years later that of Μ.A. He attained a fair reputation for scholarship, was
                    elected to a fellowship at Magdalen, and wrote several Latin plays on Scriptural
                    subjects, of which the best, the <hi rend="italic">De Christo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Triumphante,</hi> was repeatedly published (London, 1551, Basel,
                    1556, &amp;c.), and was thought worthy of translation into English by Richard
                    Day, the son of the printer. Having become deeply interested in the more
                    advanced religious inquiry of his time, he devoted himself to the study of
                    Hebrew, of the ancient fathers, and of the doctrines of the <pb break="no"

                    ears of the authorities were considered so unorthodox that in 1545 he was
                    deprived of his fellowship and expelled from the university. Here his punishment
                    would probably have ended had not his stepfather taken advantage of his
                    misfortune to deprive him of his patrimony. He was glad to accept a situation as
                    tutor to the children of Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, near Stratford-on-Avon,
                    who is famous as the prototype of Shakespeare’s “Justice Shallow.” But he did
                    not long retain this situation, and he was in London in very destitute
                    circumstances when the duchess of Richmond appointed him tutor to the children
                    of her nephew, the unfortunate earl of Surrey, During the reign of Edward,
                    Foxe’s circumstances were more comfortable. He married, and settled at Reigate,
                    where, having been ordained deacon by Ridley in 1550, he preached and acted as
                    tutor to the orphan children of Surrey throughout the rest of the reign. On the
                    accession of Mary, he was for some time protected by his pupil, the duke of
                    Norfolk, but was at length obliged to seek safety by fleeing with his family to
                    Basel, where he maintained himself by writing and correcting the press for the
                    printer Oporinus. At the suggestion of Lady Jane Grey, he had already commenced
                    a Latin history of the Christian persecutions. He now received assistance from
                    two distinguished exiles, belonging to opposed sections of the Protestant
                    party—from Grindal, who afterwards as Puritan archbishop of Canterbury
                    distinguished himself by the noble firmness with which he maintained his
                    convictions, even at great personal cost, and in opposition to the commands of
                    Queen Elizabeth; and from John Aylmer, the tutor of Lady Jane Grey, who
                    afterwards, as bishop of London, was one of the bitterest enemies of the
                    Puritans. The first outline of the work appeared in 1554, and the first complete
                    edition was published by Oporinus in 1559. About a year after the accession of
                    Elizabeth, Foxe returned to England. The duke of Norfolk again extended to him
                    his patronage. For some time he resided at the duke’s manor of Christchurch in
                    London, and on the duke’s death he received a small pension. He became
                    associated with John Day, the printer, himself once a Protestant exile, with
                    whom he had many sympathies in common. We find him staying in Grub Street
                    laboriously engaged in varied literary work, and occasionally preaching at St
                    Paul’s Cross and in other parts of London. Church preferment was offered him by
                    the Government, to which his works had rendered invaluable service. Cecil
                    appointed him to the prebend of Shipton in Salisbury Cathedral, and he held for
                    a short time the living of Cripplegate; but true to his Puritan views, which
                    prevented him from subscribing to the Articles, he accepted nothing further,
                    though more was offered him. In 1563 the first English edition of the “Book of
                    Martyrs,” in which several gross errors which had been exposed were corrected,
                    appeared from the press of John Day.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    by John Foxe.</hi></p></note> Its popularity among a people which had just
                    passed through the horrors of the Marian persecutions was naturally immediate
                    and signal. The Government commanded it to be placed in each parish church; and
                    more than any other influence it fanned the flame of that fierce hatred of Spain
                    and the Inquisition which was the master passion of the reign. Nor was its
                    influence transient. For generations the popular conception of popery has been
                    derived from its melancholy and bitter pages. It was vigorously attacked by
                    Catholic writers, and its accuracy in details has been successfully challenged,
                    even such blunders as indicate gross over-credulity having been exposed; but the
                    honourable lives of Foxe and his assistants place the work above the charge of
                    wilful falsehood. If in all those who had been engaged in the persecution he
                    could only recognize the spirit of cruelty and Antichrist—if in the noble Sir
                    Thomas More he could only see “a persecuting spirit,”— this was but natural in a
                    man who had witnessed the untimely destruction of some of the noblest spirits of
                    the age, of some whom he had personally known and loved, and whose own career
                    has been undeservedly blighted by the ruthless hand of persecution; and it must
                    be remembered to his honour that in his firm grasp of the principle of religious
                    toleration he rose far above his age and his fellow Protestants. He hated
                    impartially <hi rend="italic">all</hi> religious persecution, and he wrote to
                    Queen Elizabeth pleading even for the despised Dutch Anabaptists. It is
                    interesting to note that Foxe was one of the earliest students of Anglo-Saxon,
                    and that John Day was the only printer of the day who could print the
                    Anglo-Saxon characters. In 1571 they published, under the patronage of
                    Archbishop Parker, an edition of the Saxon Gospels, dedicated to the queen. Foxe
                    died on the 18th April 1587, at the age of seventy, and was buried in the Church
                    of St Giles, Cripplegate. His life was written by his son, Samuel Foxe.</p>
