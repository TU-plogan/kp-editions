                    (1663-1727), an influential German philanthropist and theologian, was born on
                    the 22d of March 1663 at Lübeck, where his father, a doctor of laws, at that
                    time held a professional appointment. He was educated, chiefly in private, at
                    Gotha (to which his family had removed in 1666), and afteπvards at the
                    universities of Erfurt, Kiel, and Leipsic. During his student career, he busied
                    himself specially with the Hebrew and Greek languages; and in order to acquire
                    the former more thoroughly, he for some time put himself under the instructions
                    of Rabbi Ezra Edzardi at Hamburg, at whose instance he is said to have read
                    through the entire Hebrew Bible seven times within a year. He graduated at
                    Leipsic in 1685, but, having found employment as a “privatdocent,” did not quit
                    the university, until the end of 1687. During the last year of his residence he
                    had, by the help of his friend P. Anton, and with the approval and encouragement
                    of Spener, who was at that time coming into notice, originated the afterwards
                    famous collegium philobiblicum, at which a number of graduates were accustomed
                    to meet for the regular and systematic study of the Bible. He next passed a
                    number of months at Lüneburg as assistant or curate to the learned and pious
                    superintendent Sand-hagen, and there his religious life was remarkably quickened
                    and deepened. His own account of his experience at that crisis in his life, and
                    of the influence of the particular text (John xx. 31) to which he believed he
                    owed his conversion, is very interesting and characteristic. On leaving
                    Lüneburg, he spent some time in Hamburg, where he was engaged as a teacher in a
                    private school, and there also he considered himself to have acquired some
                    experience which proved invaluable in after life. After a long visit to Spener,
                    who was at that time in Dresden, and who encouraged him in the plans he had
                    formed, he returned to Leipsic in the spring of 1689, and began to give Bible
                    lectures of an exegetical and practical kind, at the same time resuming the
                    collegia philobiblica of earlier days. He rapidly became very popular as a
                    lecturer; but the peculiarities of his teaching almost immediately aroused a
                    violent opposition on the part of the university authorities; and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0737-0702"/> before the end of the year he was, on the ground
                    of his alleged pietism, interdicted from lecturing. Thus it was that Francke’s
                    name first came to be publicly associated with that of Spener, and with one of
                    the most fruitful church movements of the 17th century. Although, however, the
                    majority of those claiming to be orthodox chose to regard the pietists as a new
                    and dangerous sect, it must be remembered that neither Spener nor Francke taught
                    in any spirit of sectarianism or with any consciousness of antagonism to any of
                    the doctrines of the Lutheran Church. Loyal churchmen, they were distinguished ∙
                    from other Lutherans simply by their readiness to subordinate mere confessional
                    orthodoxy to the interests of spiritual religion and practical morality, and
                    also by the unusual earnestness with which they insisted on the necessity of
                    conversion, and of the appearance of certain symptoms of a moral and spiritual
                    change, before any one could rightly lay claim to the Christian name. The
                    pietism of Francke, at all events, was quite as compatible with churchliness as
                    was the methθιlism of Wesley or the evangelicalism of Simeon; and it is well
                    known that neither of these two men desired to set up a sect against the church.
                    Prohibited from lecturing in Leipsic, Francke in 1869 found work at Erfurt as
                    “deacon” of one of tho city churches. Here his evangelistic fervour attracted
                    multitudes to his preaching, but at the same time excited the jealousy of his
                    less zealous colleagues as well as the antipathy of the Catholic section of the
                    population; and the result of their combined opposition was that after a
                    ministry of fifteen months, he was, in September 1691, banished from the town by
                    the civil authorities. The same year witnessed the expulsion of Spener from
                    Dresden. In December Francke received and accepted an invitation to fill the
                    chair of Greek and Oriental languages in the new university of Halle, which was
                    at that time being organized by the elector Frederick III. of Brandenburg; and
                    at the same time, the chair having no salary attached to it, he was appointed
                    minister of the parish of Glaucha in the immediate neighbourhood of the town.
                    Here, for the next thirty-six years, he continued to discharge the twofold
                    office of pastor and professor with rare energy and success. Besides preaching
                    on Sundays, with an eloquence and earnestness and depth that attracted and held
                    together a large congregation, he found time for many week-day meetings for
                    edification, and was unwearied in the work of catechizing the young and of
                    giving spiritual direction to those who sought his private advice. At the very
                    outset of his labours, he had been profoundly impressed with a sense of his
                    responsibility towards the numerous outcast children who were growing up around
                    him in ignorance and crime. After a number of tentative plans, such as that of
                    gathering them together once a week at the parsonage, and that of paying their
                    school fees, he resolved in 1695 to institute what would be called in this
                    country a ragged school, relying for funds upon the charity of the benevolent
                    public. A single room was at first sufficient for the needs of the institution;
                    but within a year it was found necessary to purchase a house, to which another
                    was added in 1697. In 1698 there were 100 orphans under his charge to be clothed
                    and fed, besides 500 children who were taught as day scholars. The later
                    statistics of the many and various educational institutions of Halle which owe
                    their origin to him will be found in vol. vii. p. 675. The principles there
                    indicated were consistently applied in his university teaching. Even as
                    professor of Greek he had given great prominence in his lectures to the study of
                    the Scriptures; but he found a much more congenial sphere when, in 1698, he was
                    appointed to the chair of theology. Yet his first courses of lectures in that
                    department were on Old and New Testament introduction; and to this, as also to
                    hermeneutics, he always attached special importance, believing that for theology
                    a sound exegesis was the one indispensable requisite. “Theologus nascitur in
                    scripturis,” he used to say; but during his occupancy of the theological chair
                    he lectured at various times upon other branches of the science also, according
                    to the custom still usual in Germany. Amongst his colleagues were Anton,
                    Breithaupt, and Joachim Lange —men like-minded with himself. Through their
                    influença upon the students, Halle became a centre from which pietism, as it was
                    called, became very widely diffused over Germany; but while in some quarters the
                    new light was welcomed and cherished, in others every effort was made to
                    suppress it. Thus, while Frederick William I. of Prussia is said to have gone so
                    far as to issue an edict forbidding that any one should receive a cure of souls
                    in his dominions who had not studied in Halle for two years, and received from
                    the faculty there satisfactory certificates as to his status gratiae,
                    legislative enactments were elsewhere frequently directed against the Halle
                    school. It ought to be borne in mind with reference to these that Francke cannot
                    fairly be held responsible for the separatistic and perfectionist and chiliastic
                    tendencies which are now most commonly associated with the pietistic name. He
                    died at Halle on the 8th of June 1727.</p>
