                <p><label type="entry">FREDERICK IV</label>. (1415-1493), German king, as emperor
                    Frederick III., son of Duke Ernest of Styria, was born at Innsbruck, September
                    21, 1415. Along with his brother Albert the Prodigal he assumed in 1435 the
                    government of Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola, and, having been elected in 1440
                    to succeed Albert II. as king of Germany, he was crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle in
                    1442. He devoted his chief attention to the study of astrology, alchemy, and
                    botany, and was so undecided in his purposes and so deficient in energy and
                    force of character that he almost passively submitted to the anarchy and petty
                    external wars which during the whole of his reign disturbed the peace of the
                    empire. At the beginning of his reign he was attacked by his brother Albert, who
                    reigned in Upper Austria, and he found it necessary to pacify him by the payment
                    of a large sum of money; in 1443 he was attacked by the Swiss, and called to his
                    aid the Armagnacs from France, who, however, after their defeat by the Swiss at
                    St Jakob in 1444, joined his enemies against him, and in 1449 he was compelled
                    to agree to an unfavourable treaty; from 1445 to 1452 Austria was invaded by the
                    Hungarians; in 1447 Sforza successfully usurped the government of Milan; from
                    1449 to 1456 a war was carried on between Albert of Brandenburg and the city of
                    Nuremberg assisted by the “Eidgenossen;” and from 1449 to 1462 a succession war
                    raged in the Rhenish Palatinate. Frederick, who hoped by cultivating the
                    friendship of the Papacy to win back some of the ancient imperial rights,
                    concluded in 1448 the concordat of Vienna with Pope Nicholas V., and was crowned
                    emperor in 1452. On the death of Ladislaus duke of Austria in 1457, he laid
                    claim to the whole of Austria, and also to the crown of Bohemia and Hungary; but
                    not only was George Podiebrad made king of Bohemia and Matthias Corvinus king of
                    Hungary, but Sigismund of Tyrol obtained part of Carinthia, and Frederick’s
                    brother Albert, besides seizing Upper Austria in 1462, took possession of
                    Vienna. On the death of Albert in 1463, Frederick obtained possession of the
                    whole of Austria, with the exception of Carinthia. Notwithstanding that
                    Frederick in 1468 went to Rome to concert measures with the pope against the
                    Turks, they in 1469 penetrated without resistance to Carniola, and in 1475
                    advanced nearly to Salzburg. In 1473 he suddenly broke off a negotiation with
                    Charles the Bold at Treves for the marriage of Charles’s daughter with his son
                    Maximilian, but the marriage finally took place after the death of Charles, and
                    Maximilian thus became king of the Netherlands. The changeful and crooked policy
                    of the emperor in reference to Poland and Hungary led the kings of both
                    countries to turn their arms against him, and in 1485 Matthias of Hungary drove
                    him from his hereditary dominions, of which he did not regain possession till
                    after the death of Matthias in 1490. Frederick died in 1493.</p>
