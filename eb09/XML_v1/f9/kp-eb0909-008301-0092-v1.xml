                <p><label type="entry">FERDINAND VII</label>. (1784-1833), king of Spain, the eldest
                    son of Charles IV, and of Maria Louisa of Parma, was born at San Ildefonso,
                    October 14, 1784, and became prince of the Asturias on the accession of his
                    father in 1788. The year of his birth had also been the year of Godoy’s arrival
                    at court (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Alcudia)</hi>; and the sinister influences of
                    the royal favourite soon began to manifest themselves there. Ferdinand from a
                    very early age learned to dislike Godoy, and he found many to sympathize with
                    him in his not unnatural aversion. In 1802 he was married to Maria Antonietta,
                    daughter of the king of Naples, and she, along with his former tutor Escoiquiz,
                    the dukes of San Carlos, del Infantado, and others, fostered in him the spirit
                    of resistance to the ascendency of “the Prince of the Peace.” Soon after her
                    death in 1806 (attributed by him, though without sufficient evidence, to foul
                    play), and the forcible removal of Escoiquiz, the court became openly divided
                    into two hostile factions; but though Godoy had the entire confidence of the
                    king and queen, Ferdinand had the almost undivided sympathies of. the people. On
                    the 30th of October 1807, he was suddenly laid under arrest on a charge of
                    conspiracy against the crown and life of his father; but no documentary evidence
                    against him could be produced, except a draft memorial, apparently intended for
                    presentation to the king, in which the conduct of Godoy was bitterly complained
                    of, and a letter to Napoleon appealing for protection, and expressing a desire
                    to enter into a matrimonial connexion with the Bonaparte family. When it was
                    found that the French ambassador had been cognisant of these intrigues, the
                    matter was hushed up and Ferdinand pardoned; but meanwhile the rapid movement of
                    events, political and military, had begun to make Godoy’s position an extremely
                    precarious one. Ostensibly following out the terms of the agreement at
                    Fontainebleau of October 27,1807, Napoleon had not only invaded Portugal, but
                    had also begun to pour troops into Spain (December 1807). The Spanish people
                    were beginning to show signs of restiveness, and, dreading an outbreak, Godoy
                    had advised the withdrawal of the king and queen to Seville with a view to the
                    possible necessity for a further flight to Mexico. But before this project could
                    be carried out the revolutionary rising at Aranjuez had taken place (March
                    17-18, 1808), which resulted in the forced abdication of Charles, the final
                    overthrow of Godoy, and the enthusiastic proclamation of Ferdinand as king (19th
                    March). This last proceeding had been no part of Napoleon’s plan; and Madrid was
                    occupied four days afterwards by the French troops under Murat. By the
                    representations of the latter, both Charles and Ferdinand were induced to seek a
                    personal interview with Napoleon at Bayonne, and submit to his arbitration their
                    rival claims. The result was the treaty of Bayonne between Charles and Napoleon
                    (5th May 1808), by which the former finally renounced the Spanish throne. Next
                    day Ferdinand also was compelled to give up his claims; it was declared that the
                    Bourbons had ceased to reign in Spain; and shortly afterwards Joseph Bonaparte
                    was proclaimed king. Ferdinand was now interned at Valençay (Indre), where he
                    remained during the whole of the Spanish war of independence, receiving from
                    Napoleon an annual allowance of 600,000 francs. The letters he wrote to Napoleon
                    from his captivity were certainly far from indicating patriotism: most people
                    will doubt whether they were consistent with any self-respect. He had nothing
                    but compliments to offer on the accession of Joseph; he assured his master of
                    his ardent prayers for his prosperity, and of his most respectful and absolute
                    attachment to his august person; he wrote to public men to say, “My highest
                    desire is to prove myself to be the emperor’s adopted son, by my entire
                    submission and obedience to his wishes and desires.”</p>
                <p>The decisive victory of Wellington at Vittoria (21st June 1813), followed up by
                    the invasion of France, induced Napoleon to treat with his captive on terms more
                    nearly approaching those of equality (November 1813), and ultimately the title
                    of Ferdinand and his dynasty to the throne of Spain was recognized on his
                    agreeing to sign a convention in which it was undertaken on his part to expel
                    the English from the Peninsula, to pardon all those who had given their
                    obedience to Joseph Bonaparte, and to restore the harmonious relations of the
                    two kingdoms as these had subsisted prior to 1792. On his return to Spain in
                    March 1814, the cortes declined to recognize him until he should have sworn to
                    the constitution which had been promulgated at Cadiz in 1812; but, listening to
                    the counsels of the “servile” party, he first evaded and afterwards rejected
                    this demand. On the 4th of May he, by the decree of Valencia, annulled the
                    constitution of 1812 and all enactments made by the cortes in his absence; on
                    the 30th of the same month he issued his decree of proscription and perpetual
                    exile against the <hi rend="italic">afrancesados</hi> or those who had given
                    obedience to Joseph Bonaparte; on the 21st of July he re-established the
                    Inquisition, with all the powers it had possessed under Torquemada, and began a
                    hot crusade against “liberalism” or “constitutionalism,” in which no weapon of
                    confiscation, or imprisonment, or banishment, or execution, which despotism
                    could wield was' left unemployed. This policy of the absolutist “camarilla” was
                    for some time interrupted by a revolutionary party headed by Quiroga and Riego
                    at Cabezas de San Juan near Cadiz, which, on the 1st of January 1820, caused the
                    constitution of 1812 to be again proclaimed. *Thθ insurrection gaining daily in
                    strength, the king was compelled to make concession after concession, until at
                    length on the 9th of March he solemnly professed his entire acceptance of the
                    popular constitution, abolished the Inquisition, banished the Jesuits, and
                    restored the freedom of the press. The cortes reassembled, and the citizens who
                    had been banished reappeared. But very soon the king began to show how insincere
                    his submission had been.. Sometimes secretly, sometimes openly, he did all in
                    his power to encourage the opposition, until at last, in July <pb break="no"

                    with cries for “the absolute king.” For the time they were repressed by the
                    constitutionalists; but meanwhile the state of the Peninsula had attracted the
                    attention of the Holy Alliance, and at the congress of Verona (August 25 to
                    December 14, 1822) it was agreed to send a French army into Spain, “to deliver
                    Ferdinand from slavery.” Madrid was entered on May 23, 1823; the cortes withdrew
                    to Seville, where Ferdinand was declared incapable of governing, and a regency
                    was appointed (11 th June). Driven by the invaders to Cadiz, and there compelled
                    to surrender, the cortes yielded up their authority into the hands of Ferdinand,
                    who in his turn promised a general amnesty to all who had been concerned in the
                    revolutionary proceedings. This promise he broke the very next day, annulling
                    every act of his government since 7th March 1820. Another period of
                    proscriptions, banishments, and fusillades now set in. Enactments of the most
                    tyrannical description were unscrupulously made with the avowed purpose of
                    stamping out the last spark of constitutionalism.<note anchored="true"

                    of the ayuntamientos (17th October 1824) was expressly made “con el fin de que
                    desaparezca para siempre del suelo Espanol hasta la mas remota idea de que la
                    soberania reside en otro que en mi real persona.”</p></note> Numbers were put to
                    death for the most trivial offences, and it has been estimated that some 20,000
                    families were compelled to leave their country. Louis XVIII. offered counsels of
                    moderation; he reminded Ferdinand that “Christian princes ought not to rule by
                    means of proscriptions,” and that “a blind despotism, far from consolidating the
                    power of sovereigns, weakens it but his remonstrances were in vain. His
                    successor Charles X. used similar language; but Ferdinand’s reply was that he
                    was not able to control the reactionary party which had restored him to power.
                    During the later years of his life he took little or no interest in public
                    affairs; and the absolutists began to turn their attention to the question of
                    the succession. A scheme was matured for inducing the king to abdicate in favour
                    of his brother Don Carlos; but on the death of his third wife Maria Amalia of
                    Saxony in May 1829 without issue, Ferdinand filled the “apostolicals” with
                    consternation and the liberals with new hope by contracting a fourth marriage
                    with Maria Cristina of Naples (December 1829). In March 1830 the king decreed
                    the abrogation of the Salic law,—a measure which excited the Carlists first to
                    intrigue and afterwards to open insurrection on the birth of a daughter in
                    October. In 1832 Ferdinand was seized with a threatening illness, and wavered
                    from his formerly expressed will with regard to the succession; but ultimately,
                    in June 1833, his daughter (Isabella II.) was declared his successor, Cristina
                    was nominated as regent, and Don Carlos with many of his followers was ordered
                    to leave the kingdom. The death of Ferdinand at Madrid, September 29, 1833, was
                    the signal for the outbreak of a long and bloody civil war.</p>
                <p>Ferdinand’s selfishness, hypocrisy, mendacity, incapacity to understand even the
                    idea of patriotism, have sometimes suggested a comparison with Charles I. of
                    England. But such a comparison is unjust to Charles. Ferdinand was a Spanish
                    Bourbon, and in him the characteristic qualities of that house reached their
                    final perfection—“imbecility, dissoluteness, ferocity, mutual hate, intellect
                    never reaching higher than cunning, with a religion that was the fetichism of a
                    savage rather than the creed of a rational being.”<note anchored="true"
