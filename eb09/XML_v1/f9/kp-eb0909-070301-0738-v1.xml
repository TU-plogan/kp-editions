                    Count</hi></label> (1750-1828), a French statesman and poet, was born at
                    Saffais, in the district of Meurthe, 17th April 1750. He studied at the college
                    of Neufchâteau in the Vosges, and at the age of fourteen published a volume of
                    poetry which obtained the approbation of Rousseau, and secured or its author so
                    much <hi rend="italic">éclat</hi> that Neufchâteau conferred on him its name,
                    and he was elected member of some of the principal academies of France. In 1783
                    he was named procureur-general to the council of St Domingo. He had previously
                    been engaged on a translation of Ariosto, which he finished before his return to
                    France five years afterwards, but it perished during the shipwreck which
                    occurred during his voyage home. After the Revolution he was elected deputy to
                    the National Assembly, of which he first became secretary and then president. In
                    1793 he was imprisoned on account of the political sentiments of his drama <hi
                    rend="italic">Pamela,</hi> but a few days afterwards the Revolution of the 9th
                    of August restored to him his freedom. In 1798 he became minister of the
                    interior, in which office he distinguished himself by the thoroughness of his
                    administration in all departments. It is to him that France owes its system of
                    inland navigation. From 1804 to 1806 he was president of the senate, and in that
                    capacity the duty devolved upon him of soliciting Napoleon to assume the title
                    of emperor. In 1808 he received the dignity of count. Retiring from public life
                    in 1814, he occupied himself chiefly in the study of agriculture, until his
                    death, 10th January 1828. François de Neufchâteau had very multifarious
                    accomplishments, and interested himself in a great variety of subjects, but his
                    fame rests chiefly on what he did as a statesman for the encouragement and
                    development of the industries of France. His maturer poetical productions did
                    not fulfil the promise of those of his early years, for though some of his
                    verses have a superficial elegance, his poetry generally lacks force and
                    originality. He had considerable qualifications as a grammarian and critic, as
                    is witnessed by his editions of the <hi rend="italic">Provinciales</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Pensées</hi> of Pascal, Paris, 1822 and 1826, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gil Blas,</hi> Paris, 1820. His principal poetical works are <hi
