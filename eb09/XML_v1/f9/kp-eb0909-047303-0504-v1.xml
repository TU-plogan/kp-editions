                <p><label type="entry">FOSTER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1770-1843),
                    an English author and dissenting minister, generally known as the “Essayist,”
                    was born in a small farmhouse near Halifax, Yorkshire, September 17, 1770.
                    Partly from constitutional causes, but partly also from the want of proper
                    companions, as well as from the grave and severe habits of his parents, the
                    outward and physical life of boyhood had for him scarcely an existence, and his
                    earlier years were enshrouded in a somewhat gloomy and sombre atmosphere, which
                    was never afterwards wholly dissipated. His youthful energy, finding no proper
                    outlet, developed within him a tendency to morbid intensity of thought and
                    feeling; and, according to his own testimony, before he was twelve years old he
                    was possessed of a “painful sense of an awkward but entire individuality ;” what
                    observations he made on men and things were characterized by a precocious
                    shrewdness and gravity, but he lived in an interior world of emotions and
                    sentiments which he recoiled from communicating to any human being; his
                    imagination often exercised on him a tyrannous sway, endowing past or fictitious
                    events with a stronger and more importunate reality than the actual
                    circumstances which surrounded him, and sometimes arousing almost insupportable
                    emotions of pain or terror. A partial counteractive to the predominance of this
                    inward life was supplied by his love of natural scenery, but even here his
                    interest was rather in the grand and sublime than in the beautiful, and nature
                    awakened his strong enthusiasm more frequently than it inspired him with quiet
                    and genial enjoyment. The most wholesome influence exercised on his earlier
                    years was perhaps that obtained from the perusal of books of travel—a species of
                    literature for which he had always a decided preference. It supplied him with
                    actual scenes and adventures on which to exercise his imagination, and helped to
                    deliver him from a too constant contemplation of abstractions and a too minute
                    analysis of his own moods and sentiments. His moral feelings in youth were not
                    only sensitive but deeply rooted and constant and steadfast in their influence,
                    being manifested in entire dutifulness to his parents, strong but “not
                    malicious” antipathies, habitual abhorrence of cruelty, intense love of the
                    heroic, and a tone of mind whose seriousness was excessive.</p>
                <p>The small income accruing to Foster’s parents from their farm they supplemented
                    by weaving, and at an early age he began to assist them by spinning wool by the
                    hand wheel, and from his fourteenth year by weaving double stuffs. Even “when a
                    child,” however, he had the “feelings of a foreigner in the place ;” and though
                    he performed his monotonous task with conscientious diligence, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0505-0474"/> he succeeded so indifferently in fixing his
                    wandering thoughts upon it that his work never without difficulty passed the
                    ordeal of inspection. There is little information as to the manner in which he
                    obtained his primary education, but at an early period he had acquired a great
                    taste for reading, to gratify which he semetimes shut himself up alone in a
                    barn, afterwards working at his loom “like a horse,” to make up for lost time.
                    He had also at this period “a passion for making pictures with a pen.” Shortly
                    after completing his seventeenth year he became a member of the Baptist church
                    at Hebden Bridge, with which his parents were connected; and with the view of
                    preparing himself for the ministerial office, he began about the same time to
                    attend a seminary at Brearley Hall conducted by his pastor Dr Fawcett. The
                    mental processes of Foster followed a course which was entirely their own, and
                    the manner of their operation was often awkward and unwieldy. He had difficulty
                    in bending his attention to the continuous contemplation of a subject as it had
                    been viewed by others, and smaller niceties and details only made an impression
                    on his mind after a repeated perusal. He therefore mastered his tasks very
                    slowly and with great labour, and his application was so intense and protracted
                    as to awaken the serious anxiety of his friends. To excel in literary
                    composition was the purpose which occupied his most eager attention, and with a
                    view to obtain facility and variety of diction, it was his custom to select
                    paragraphs from different writers and to alter the structure and expression of
                    each sentence in as many different ways as his ingenuity could invent, a method
                    which, if it helped him to acquire the particular kind of flexibility which his
                    style afterwards manifested, was perhaps also in part the means of betraying him
                    into his occasional use of lumbering expressions, and of a harsh, involved, or
                    clumsy order of arrangement.</p>
                <p>After remaining three years at Brearley Hall he was admitted to the Baptist
                    College, Bristol, and on finishing his course of study at this institution, he
                    obtained an engagement at Ne wcastle-on-Tyne, where he preached to an audience
                    of less than a hundred persons, in a small and dingy room situated near the
                    river at the top of a flight of steps called Tuthill stairs. At Newcastle he
                    remained only three months. In the beginning of 1793 he proceeded to Dublin,
                    where after failing as a preacher he attempted to revive a classical and
                    mathematical school, but with so little success that he did not prosecute the
                    experiment for more than eight or nine months. From 1797 to 1799 he was minister
                    of a Baptist church at Chichester, but though he applied himself with more
                    earnestness and perseverance than formerly to the discharge of his ministerial
                    duties, his efforts produced little apparent impression, and the gradual
                    diminution of his hearers necessitated his resignation. After employing himself
                    for a few months at Battersea in the instruction of twenty African youths
                    brought to England by Zachary Macaulay, with the view of having them trained to
                    aid as missionaries to their fellow-countrymen, he in 1800 accepted the charge
                    of a small congregation at Downend, Bristol, where he continued about four
                    years. In 1804, chiefly through the recommendation of Robert Hall, he became
                    pastor of a congregation at Frome,'but a swelling in the thyroid gland compelled
                    him in 1806 to resign his charge. In the same year he published the volume of
                    <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> on which his literary fame most largely if not
                    mainly rests. They were written in the form of letters addressed to the lady
                    whom he afterwards married, and consist of four papers, —“On a Man writing
                    Memoirs of himself;” “On Decision of Character;” “Onthe Application of the
                    Epithet Romantic;” and “On some Causes by whichEvangelical Religion has been
                    rendered unacceptable to Men of Cultivated Taste.” The success of this work was
                    immediate, and was so considerable that on resigning his charge he determined to
                    adopt literature as his profession. The <hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review</hi>
                    was the only periodical with which he established a connexion; but his
                    contributions to that journal, which were begun in 1807, number no fewer than
                    185 articles. On his marriage in May 1808 he removed to Bourton-on-the-Water, a
                    small village in Gloucestershire, where he remained till 1817, when he returned
                    to Downend and resumed his duties to his old congregation. Here he published in
                    1820 his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Popular Ignorance,</hi> which was the
                    enlargement of a sermon originally preached on behalf of the British and Foreign
                    School Society. He describes this essay with a certain degree of happiness and
                    accuracy as a “broad, true, and strongly delineated picture of the intellectual
                    and moral state of the mass of our people;” only it must be added that the
                    contemplation of the gloomy features of his subject has so reacted on his vision
                    that an artificially darkened atmosphere seems to overespread his whole canvas,
                    and his picture somewhat resembles that of a landscape painted during an
                    eclipse. In 1821 he removed to Stapleton near Bristol, and in 1822 he began a
                    series of fortnightly lectures at Broadmead Chapel, Bristol, which were
                    afterwards published in 2 vols. On the settlement of Robert Hall at Bristol this
                    service was discontinued, as in such circumstances it appeared to Foster to be
                    “altogether superfluous and even bordering on impertinent.” The health of Foster
                    during the later years of his life was somewhat infirm, the result chiefly of
                    the toil and effort of literary composition; and the death of his only son, his
                    wife, and the greater number of his most intimate friends combined with his
                    bodily ailments to lend additional sombreness to his manner of regarding the
                    events and arrangements of the present world—the “visage of death” being almost
                    his “one remaining luminary.” He died at Stapleton 15th October 1843.</p>
                <p>The cast of Foster’s mind was meditative and reflective rather than logical or
                    metaphysical, and though holding moderately Calvinistic views, his language even
                    in preaching very seldom took the mould of theological forms. His “apprehension
                    of the divine mercy, and of the terms of hope and safety for poor mortals, was,”
                    he says, “widely remote from the austerity of the systematic divines.” He
                    rejected the doctrine of eternal punishment, because the idea of such protracted
                    and hopeless misery following such a “brief trial and sojourn on earth” seemed
                    inconsistent with the divine goodness, and he was thus compelled to believe that
                    the language of Scripture which seemed to support this doctrine was susceptible
                    of another and milder interpretation. Though always retaining his connexion with
                    the Baptist denomination, the evils resulting from organized religious
                    communities seemed to him so great that he came to be “strongly of opinion that
                    churches are useless and mischievous institutions, and the sooner they are
                    dissolved the better.” The only Christian observances which he regarded as of
                    any importance were public worship and the Lord’s Supper, and it so happened
                    that he never administered the ordinance of baptism.</p>
                <p>Though he was mild and charitable in his interpretation of the conduct of
                    individuals, his moral constitution was narrow and stem rather than sympathetic,
                    and his creed left little room for laughter, and on the question of amusements
                    was strongly puritanical. The dark and sombre scenes which his imagination so
                    vividly pictured forth riveted his contemplation by a fascination from which he
                    vainly struggled to be free. With such mournful views of life the “weight of
                    this unintelligible world” pressed rather heavily upon him, and his cast of
                    thought is largely coloured by a constant reference to the “endless future.” He
                    was a firm believer in supernatural appearances, and cherished a longing hope
                    that a ray of light from the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n506/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0506-0475"/> other world might sometimes in this way be
                    vouchsafed to mortals.</p>
                <p>Apart from the singularity of his modes of thought, and the unusual forms of his
                    spoken as well as his written style, Foster was constitutionally unfitted to
                    excel as an orator, and Robert Hall testifies that “though his words might be
                    fire within, the moment they left his ]ips they froze and fell down at his
                    feet.” As a writer his most characteristic quality is his searching discernment
                    of every kind of moral falsity and weakness, the dark and subtle windings of
                    which he tracks with unerring and dogged sagacity, and exposes either with easy
                    irony, or with a keen and scathing satire, whose indignation, however, is
                    slightly qualified by a faint suggestion of sorrowful contempt. He often
                    strangely interweaves the hackneyed and commonplace with the novel and
                    unexpected. The substance of his thought is old and worn, but after passing
                    through the crucible of his mind it acquires a brilliant lustre, and he places
                    it in such new and striking lights that his exhibition of it resembles the
                    revelation of something hitherto unknown. He is, however, so intent on
                    adequately representing the minutest aspects of his subject that he does not
                    sufficiently distinguish between the important and the unimportant; and he often
                    employs a beautiful sometimes a sublime figure to illustrate either an almost
                    self-evident proposition, or a thought otherwise much too lowly for such a
                    splendid dress; while, on the other hand, an elevated thought or sentiment is
                    sometimes associated with imagery as much out of harmony with its surroundings
                    and position as would be the rags of a beggar with the splendour and
                    magnificence of a court. His originality consists chiefly in placing old and
                    time-honoured beliefs in new and unexpected relations, and imparting a vividness
                    to truths which are so generally recognized that their importance is almost
                    forgotten. He has therefore given no new impulse to thought, and he has scarcely
                    entered upon the threshold of the speculation and ideas of the 19th century.
                    Though his intellectual was much wider than his moral sympathy, his literary
                    criticisms—apart from the fact that they are totally unfettered by artificial
                    rules and maxims, and record in ingenuous language the actual impression
                    produced upon his mind by the work he examines—are chiefly of value for their
                    keen detection of what is hollow and false in sentiment, and their sarcastic
                    exposure of affectation and pretence. He wrote with intense mental strain and
                    effort, and sometimes spent days in the elaboration of a single paragraph. His
                    style has the merit of entire individuality; as he himself says, his “language
                    is simply and absolutely formed for the thought—is adapted and flexible to it—is
                    taken out of the whole vocabulary of our tongue just on purpose for the
                    thoughts, and moulded to their very shape, with an almost perfect independence
                    and avoidance of all the set artificial forms of expression.” With this merit
                    however, it has the defects formerly 'adverted to; and while scarcely ever weak
                    or ambiguous, but even in the midst of its frequent involutions surprising by
                    terse and pointed or vivid and graphic interpolations, and preserving throughout
                    its winding structure a compact, nervous, and sinewy strength which occasionally
                    assumes the form of a rhythmical and measured eloquence, it is yet on the whole
                    deficient in directness, freedom, ease, and grace.</p>
