                    (1491-1544), otherwise known as Merlino Coccajo or Cocajo, one of the principal
                    macaronic poets of the 16th century, was born of noble parentage at Cipadanear
                    Mantua, November 8, 1491. From his infancy he showed great vivacity of mind, and
                    a remarkable cleverness in making verses. At the age of sixteen he entered the
                    monastery of Monte Casino near Brescia, and eighteen months afterwards he became
                    a professed member of the Benedictine order. For a few years his life as a monk
                    seems to have been tolerably regular, and he is said to have produced a
                    considerable quantity of Lutin verse, written, not unsuccessfully, in the
                    Virgilian style. About the year 1516 he forsook the monastic life for the
                    society of a wellborn young woman named Girolama Dieda, with whom he wandered
                    about the country for several years, often suffering great poverty, having no
                    other means of support than his talent for versification. His first publication
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Merlini Cocaii Macaronicon,</hi> which relates the
                    adventures of a fictitious hero named Baldus. The coarse buffoonery of this work
                    is often relieved by touches of genuine poetry, as well as by graphic
                    descriptions and acute criticisms of men and manners. Its macaronic style is
                    rendered peculiarly perplexing to the foreigner by the frequent introduction of
                    words and phrases from the Mantuan patois. Though frequently censured for its
                    occasional grossness of idea and expression, it soon attained a wide popularity,
                    and within a very few years passed through several editions. Folengo’s next
                    production was the <hi rend="italic">Orlandino,</hi> an Italian poem of eight
                    cantos, written in rhymed octaves. It appeared in 1526, and bore on the
                    title-page the new pseudonym of Limerno Pitocco (Merlin the Beggar) da Mantova.
                    In the same year, wearied with a life of dissipation, Folengo returned to his
                    ecclesiastical obedience; and shortly afterwards wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chaos del tri per uno,</hi> in which, partly in prose, partly in verse,
                    sometimes in Latin, sometimes in Italian, and sometimes in macaronic, he gives a
                    veiled account of the vicissitudes of the life he had lived under his various
                    names. We next find him about the year 1533 writing in rhymed octaves a life of
                    Christ entitled <hi rend="italic">L'Umanità del Figliuolo di Dio;</hi> and he is
                    known to have composed, still later, another religious poem upon the creation,
                    fall, and restoration of man, besides a few tragedies. These, however, have
                    never been published. Some of his later years were spent in Sicily under the
                    patronage of Don Fernando de Gonzaga, the viceroy; he even appears for a short
                    time to have had charge of a monastery there. In 1543 he retired to Santa Croce
                    de Campesio, near Bassano; and there he died on the 9th of December in the
                    following year. Among writers of macaronics Folengo undoubtedly holds a very
                    high place; nor has his title to the name of poet been disputed even by his most
                    hostile critics. He is frequently quoted and still more frequently copied by
                    that other Benedictine, his great French contemporary, Rabelais. The earlier
                    editions of his <hi rend="italic">Opus Macaronicum</hi> are now extremely rare.
                    The often reprinted edition of 1530 exhibits the text as revised by the author
                    after he had begun to amend his life.</p>
