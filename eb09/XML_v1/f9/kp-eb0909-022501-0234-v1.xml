                <p><label type="entry">FIRDOUSÍ</label>. Abu’ICásim Mansúr, who took the <hi
                    rend="italic">nom</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">2slume</hi> of
                    Firdousí, was a Persian poet of great eminence, and is chiefly known to European
                    readers by his magnificent epic poem the <hi rend="italic">Shahnamah,</hi> or
                    “Book of Kings,” a complete history of Persia in nearly 60,000 verses. He was
                    born at Shadab, a suburb of Tús, about the year 329 of the Hegira (941 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> His father, Maulana Ahmed, son of Maulana
                    Fakhr-ed-dín el Firdousí, belonged to the class of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dihkans</hi> (the old native country families and landed proprietors of Persia,
                    who had preserved their influence and status under the Arab rule), and possessed
                    an estate iu the neighbourhood of Tús. Firdousí’s own education eminently
                    qualified him for the gigantic task which he subsequently undertook, for he was
                    profoundly versed in the Arabic language and literature, and had also studied
                    deeply the Pehlavi or Old Persian, and was conversant with the ancient
                    historical records which existed in that tongue. As his history is intimately
                    connected with that of the grand epic which he composed, it will be necessary to
                    say a few words concerning the origin of the latter and the nature of the
                    authorities from which it was compiled.</p>
                <p>An epic poem, properly so called, is a collection of the ballads and songs, in
                    which the memory of heroic deeds is always preserved in the earlier periods of a
                    people’s history, thrown by the rhapsodists into a connected aud consecutive
                    form. To become national and to take hold on the people’s hearts it must contain
                    nothing but the genuine national legends and traditions, and must have grown
                    spontaneously. Many attempts have been made by poets of different nations to
                    create a national epic, but they have always failed for the lack of the elements
                    above referred to. Homer’s <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and Virgil’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> are typical specimens of the real and spurious
                    epic,—the former breathing in every line the true spirit of the Hellenic nation,
                    and always rousing the national enthusiasm and appealing to the national
                    feeling; the latter never having been regarded by the Latin race with any deeper
                    feeling than that of admiration for its literary merits. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shahnamah</hi> of Firdousí is perhaps the only exception of a poem produced by
                    a single author, and at once taking its place as the national epic of the
                    people. The nature of the work, the materials from which it was composed, and
                    the circumstances under which it was written are, however, in themselves
                    exceptional, and necessarily tended to this result. The grandeur and antiquity
                    of the empire and the vicissitudes through which it passed, their long series of
                    wars and the magnificent monuments erected by their ancient sovereigns, could
                    not fail to leave numerous traces in the memory of so imaginative a people as
                    the Persians.</p>
                <p>As early as the 5th century of the Christian era we find mention made of these
                    historical traditions in the work of an Armenian author, Moses of Khorene.
                    During the reign of Naushirwan, the contemporary of Mahomet, and by order of
                    that monarch, an attempt had been made to collect, from various parts of the
                    kingdom, all the popular tales and legends relating to the ancient kings, and
                    the results were deposited in the royal library. Under the last sovereign of the
                    Sassanian dynasty, Yezdegird, the work was resumed, the former collection being
                    revised and greatly added to by the Dihkan Danishwer, assisted by several
                    learned mobeds. His work was entitled the <hi rend="italic">Khodai-naméh,</hi>
                    which in the old dialect also meant the “Book of Kings.” On the Arab invasion
                    this work was in great danger of perishing at the hands of the iconoclastic
                    caliph Omar and his generals, but it w as fortunately preserved; and we find it
                    in the 2d century of the Hegira being paraphrased in Arabic by Abdallah ibn el
                    Mokaffa, a learned Persian who had embraced Islam. Other Guebres occupied
                    themselves privately with the collection of these traditions; and, when a prince
                    of Persian origin, Yakúb ibn Leith, founder of the Soffaride dynasty, succeeded
                    in throwing off his allegiance to the caliphate, he at once set about continuing
                    the work of his illustrious predecessors. His “Book of Kings” was completed in
                    the year 260 of the Hegira, and was freely circulated in Khorassan and Irak.
                    Yakúb’s family did not continue long in power; but the Samanian princes,
                    descendants of the Sassanians, who succeeded them, applied themselves zealously
                    to the same work, and entrusted it to the poet Dakiki himself, a Guebre by
                    religion. Dakiki’s labours were brought to a sudden stop by his own
                    assassination, and the fall of the Samanian house happened not long after, and
                    their kingdom passed into the hands of the Ghaznavides. Mahmúd ibn Sebuk-tagin,
                    the second of the dynasty (667-1030 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> continued
                    to make himself still more independent of the caliphate than his predecessors,
                    and, though a warrior and a fanatical Moslem, extended a generous patronage to
                    Persian literature and learning, and even developed it at the expense of the
                    Arabic institutions. The taſk of continuing and com <pb break="no"

                    traditions of the empire especially attracted him. With the assistance of
                    neighbouring princes and of many of the influential Dihkans, Mahmud collected a
                    vast amount of materials for the work, and after having searched in vain for a
                    man of sufficient learning and ability to edit them faithfully, and having
                    entrusted various episodes for versification to the numerous poets whom he had
                    gathered round him, he at length made choice of Firdousí. Firdousí had been
                    always strongly attracted by the ancient Pehlavi records, and had begun at an
                    early age to turn them into Persian epic verse. On hearing of the death of the
                    poet Dakiki, he conceived the ambitious design of himself carrying out the work
                    which the latter had only just commenced; and, although he had not then any
                    introduction to the court, he contrived, thanks to one of his friends, Mohammed
                    Lashkari, to procure a copy of the Dihkan Danishwer’s collection, and at the age
                    of thirty-six commenced his great undertaking. Abu Mansour, the governor of Tús,
                    patronized him and encouraged him by substantial pecuniary support. when Mahmud
                    succeeded to the throne, and evinced such active interest in the work, Firdousí
                    was naturally attracted to the court of Ghaznin. At first court jealousies and
                    intrigues prevented Firdousí from being noticed by the sultan; but at length one
                    of his friends, Mahek, undertook to present to Mahmud his poetic version of one
                    of the well-known episodes of the legendary history. Hearing that the poet was
                    born at Tús, the sultan made him explain the origin of his native town, and was
                    much struck with the intimate knowledge of ancient history which he displayed.
                    Being presented to the seven poets who were then engaged on the projected epic,
                    Abu ’1 Cásim was admitted to their meetings, and on one occasion improvised a
                    verse, at Mahmud’s request, in praise of his favourite Ayáz, with such success
                    that the sultan bestowed upon him the name of Firdousí, saying that he had
                    converted his assemblies into paradise <hi rend="italic">(shirdoκs).</hi> During
                    the early days of his sojourn at court, an incident happened which contributed
                    in no small measure to the realization of his ambition. Three of the seven poets
                    were drinking in a garden when Firdousí approached, and wishing to get rid of
                    him without rudeness, they informed him who they were, and told him that it was
                    their custom to admit none to their society but such us could give proof of
                    poetical talent. To test his acquirements they proposed that each should furnish
                    an extemporary line of verse, his own to be the last, and all three ending in
                    the same rhyme. Firdousí accepted the challenge, and the three poets having
                    previously agreed upon three rhyming words to which a fourth could not be found
                    in the Persian language, ’Ansari began—</p>
                <p>Thy beauty eclipses the light of the sun;</p>
                <p>Farrakhi added—</p>
                <p>The rose with thy oheek would comparison shun;</p>
                <p>’Asjadi continued—</p>
                <p>Thy glances pierce through the mailed warrior’s johsun;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A sort of cuirass.</p></note> and Firdousí,
                    without a moment’s hesitation, completed the quatrain—</p>
                <p>Like the lance of fierce Giv in his fight with Poshun.</p>
                <p>The poets asked for an explanation of this allusion, and Firdousí recited to them
                    the battle as described in the <hi rend="italic">Shah-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nama</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and
                    delighted and astonished them with his learning and eloquence.</p>
                <p>Mahmud now definitely selected him for the work of compiling and versifying the
                    ancient legends, and bestowed upon him such marks of his favour and munificence
                    as to elicit from the poet an enthusiastic panegyric, which is in serted in the
                    preface of the <hi rend="italic">Shahnam,ah,</hi> and forms a curious contrast
                    to the bitter satire which he subsequently prefixed to the book. The sultan
                    ordered his treasurer, Khojah Hasan Meimendi, to pay to Firdousí a thousand gold
                    pieces for every thousand verses; but the poet preferred allowing the sum to
                    accumulate till the whole was finished, with the object of amassing sufficient
                    capital to construct a dike for his native town of Tús, which suffered greatly
                    from defective irrigation, a project which had been the chief dream of his
                    childhood. Owing to this resolution, and to the jealousy of Hasan Meimendi, who
                    often refused to advance him sufficient for the necessaries of life, Firdousí
                    passed the later portion of his life in great privation, though enjoying the
                    royal favour and widely extended fame. Amongst other princes whose liberal
                    presents enabled him to combat his pecuniary difficulties, was one Rustem, son
                    of Fakhr ed dauleh, the Deilamite, who sent him a thousand gold pieces in
                    acknowledgment of a copy of the episode of Rustem and Isfendiar which Firdousí
                    had sent him, and promised him a gracious reception if he should ever come to
                    his court. As this prince belonged, like Firdousí, to the Shiah sect, while
                    Mahmud and Meimendi were Sunnites, and as he was also politically opposed to the
                    sultan, Hasan Meimendi did not fail to make the most of this incident, and
                    accused the poet of disloyalty to his sovereign and patron, as well as of
                    heresy. Other enemies and rivals also joined in the attack, and for some time
                    Firdousí’s position was very precarious, though his pre-eminent talents and
                    obvious fitness for the work prevented him from losing his post. To add to his
                    troubles he had the misfortune to lose his only son at the age of 37.</p>
                <p>At length the book was completed, and Firdousí entrusted it to Ayáz, the sultan’s
                    favourite, for presentation to him. Mahmud ordered Hasan Meimendi to take the
                    poet as much gold as an elephant could carry, but the jealous treasurer
                    persuaded the monarch that it was too generous a reward, and that an elephant’s
                    load of silver would be sufficient. 60,000 silver dirhems were accordingly
                    placed in sacks, and taken to Firdousí by Ayáz at the sultan’s command, instead
                    of the 60,000 gold pieces, one for each verse, which had been promised. The poet
                    was at that moment in the bath, and seeing the sacks, and believing that they
                    contained the expected gold, received them with great satisfaction, but finding
                    only silver he complained to Ayáz that he had not executed the sultan’s order.
                    Ayáz related what had taken place between Mahmud and Hasan Meimendi, and
                    Firdousí in a rage gave 20 thousand pieces to Ayáz himself, the same amount to
                    the bath-keeper, and paid the rest to a beer seller for a glass of beer <hi
                    rend="italic">(fotιka),</hi> sending word back to the sultan that it was not to
                    gain money that he had taken so much trouble. On hearing this message, Mahmud at
                    first reproached Hasan with having caused him to break his word, but the wily
                    treasurer succeeded in turning his master’s anger upon Firdousí to such an
                    extent that he threatened that on the morrow he would “cast that Carmathian
                    (heretic) under the feet of his elephants.” Being apprised by one of the nobles
                    of the court of what had taken place, Firdousí passed the night in great
                    anxiety; but passing in the morning by the gate that led from his own apartments
                    into the palace, he met the sultan in his private garden, and succeeded by
                    humble apologies in appeasing his wrath. He was, however, far from being
                    appeased himself, and determined at once upon quitting Ghaznin. Returning home
                    he tore up the draughts of some thousands of verses which he had composed and
                    threw them in the fire, and repairing to the grand mosque of Ghaznin he wrote
                    upon the walls, at the place where the sultan was in the habit of praying, the
                    following lines :—</p>
                <p>“The auspicious court of Mahmud, king of Zabulistαn, is like a sea. What a sea!
                    One cannot see its shore. If <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n236/mode/1up"

                    it is the fault of my star and not of the sea.”</p>
                <p>He then gave a sealed paper to Ayáz, begging him to hand it to the sultan in a
                    leisure moment after 20 days had elapsed, and set off on his travels with no
                    better equipment than his staff and a dervish’s cloak. At the expiration of the
                    20 days Ayáz gave the paper to the sultan, who on opening it found the
                    celebrated satire which is now always prefixed to copies of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shahnamah,</hi> and which is perhaps one of the bitterest and
                    severest pieces of reproach ever penned. Mahmud, in a violent rage, sent after
                    the poet, and promised a large reward for his capture, but he was already in
                    comparative safety. Firdousí directed his steps to Mazenderan, and took refuge
                    with Kabous, prince of Jorján, who at first received him with great favour, and
                    promised him his continued protection and patronage; leaning, however, the
                    circumstances under which he had left Ghaznin, he feared the resentment of so
                    powerful a sovereign as Mahmud, who he knew already coveted his kingdom, and
                    dismissed the poet with a magnificent present. Firdousí next repaired to
                    Baghdad, where he made the acquaintance of a merchant, who introduced him to the
                    vizier of the caliph, El Cadet Billah, by presenting an Arabic poem which the
                    poet had composed in his honour, The vizier gave Firdousí an apartment near
                    himself, and related to the caliph the manner in which he had been treated at
                    Ghaznin. The caliph summoned him into his presence, and was so much pleased with
                    a poem of a thousand couplets, which Firdousí composed in his honour, that he at
                    once received him into favour. The fact of his having devoted his life and
                    talents to chronicling the renown of fire-worshipping Persians was, however,
                    somewhat of a crime in the orthodox caliph’s eyes; in order, therefore, to
                    recover his prestige, Firdousí composed another poem, of 9000 couplets, on the
                    theme borrowed from the Koran of the loves of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife— <hi
                    rend="italic">Yúsuf and Zuleikha.</hi> This poem, though rare and little known,
                    is still in existence—the Royal Asiatic Society possessing a copy. But Mahmud
                    had by this time heard of his asylum at the court of the caliph, and wrote a
                    letter menacing his liege lord, and demanding the surrender of the poet.
                    Firdousí, to avoid further troubles, departed for Ahwaz, a province of the
                    Persian Irak, and dedicated his <hi rend="italic">Yúsuf and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Zτdeikha</hi> to the governor of that district. Thence he went to
                    Kυhistan, where the governor, Nasir Lek, was his intimate and devoted friend,
                    and received him with great ceremony upon the frontier. Firdousí confided to him
                    that he contemplated writing a bitter exposition of his shameful treatment at
                    the hands of the sultan of Ghaznin; but Nasir Lek, who was a personal friend of
                    the latter, dissuaded him from his purpose, but himself wrote and remonstrated
                    with Mahmud. Nasir Lek’s message and the urgent representations of Firdousí’s
                    friends had the desired effect; and Mahmud not only expressed his intention of
                    offering full reparation to the poet, but put his enemy Meimendi to death. The
                    change, however, came too late; lirdousí, now a broken and decrepit old man, had
                    in the meanwhile returned to Tús, and, while wandering through the streets of
                    his native town, heard a child lisping a verse from his own satire, in which he
                    taunts Mahmud with his slavish birth :—</p>
                <p>“Had. Mahmud’s father been what he is now A crown of gold had decked this aged
                    brow; Had Mahmud’s mother been of gentle blood, In heaps of silver knee-deep had
                    I stood.”</p>
                <p>He was so affected by this proof of universal sympathy with his misfortunes that
                    he went home, fell sick, and died. He was buried in a garden, but About Casim
                    Gourgani, chief sheikh of Tús, refused to read the usual prayers over his tomb,
                    alleging that he was an infidel, and had devoted his life to the glorification
                    of fire-worshippers and misbelievers. The next night, however, having dreamt
                    that he beheld Firdousí in paradise dressed in the sacred colour, green, and
                    wearing an emerald crown, he reconsidered his determination; and the poet was
                    henceforth held to be perfectly orthodox. He died in the year 411 of the Hegira
                    (1020 A.D.),aged about eighty, eleven years after the completion of his great
                    work. Mahmud had in the meanwhile despatched the promised hundred thousand
                    pieces of gold to Firdousí, with a robe of honour and ample apologies for the
                    past. But as the camels bearing the treasure reached one of the gates of the
                    city, Firdousí’s funeral was leaving it by another. His daughter, to whom they
                    brought the sultan’s present, refused to receive it; but, his aged sister
                    remembering his anxiety for the construction of the stone embankment for the
                    river of Tús, this work was completed in honour of the poet’s memory, and a
                    large caravanserai built with the surplus.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Shahnamah</hi> is based, as we have seen, upon the ancient
                    legends current among the populace of Persia, and collected by the Dihkans, a
                    class of men who had the greatest facilities for this purpose. There is every
                    reason to believe that Firdousí adhered faithfully to these records of
                    antiquity, and that the poem is a perfect storehouse of the genuine traditions
                    of the country. Among much that is marvellous or incongruous, therefore, we may
                    fairly look for the records of real events; and there is no doubt that, studied
                    by the light of modern criticism, the volume will prove of great service and
                    interest to future historians and ethnologists.</p>
                <p>The entire poem has been published with a French translation in a magnificent
                    folio edition, at the expense of the French Government, by the late learned and
                    indefatigable Jules de Mold. The size and number of the volumes, however, and
                    their great expense, make them difficult of access, while the original Persian,
                    though easily procurable, is of course a sealed book to the majority of European
                    readers. To supply this defect, Madame de Mohl has published in a cheap and
                    convenient form the French translation, with her illustrious husband’s critical
                    notes and introduction, This will henceforth be the standard work on the
                    subject, containing as it does a <hi rend="italic">résumé</hi> of everything
                    that has ever been written on the <hi rend="italic">Shahnamah,</hi> or which can
                    elucidate its contents. It is published at the “Imprimerie Nationale,” Paris,
