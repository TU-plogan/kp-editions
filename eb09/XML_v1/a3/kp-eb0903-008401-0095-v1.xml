                <p><label type="entry">AUGUSTUS II</label>. (also, and more accurately, designated
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Frederick Augustus</hi> I.), Elector of Saxony and King of
                    Foland, second son of John George III. of Saxony, was born at Dresden, 12th May
                    1670. His personal beauty was remarkable, and from his great physical strength
                    he received the surname of The Strong, by which he is commonly distinguished. He
                    was very carefully educated, and spent several years travelling in Europe,
                    visiting most of the courts, and taking part in some campaigns against the
                    French. In 1694 he succeeded his elder brother as elector of Saxony, and shortly
                    after, having entered into alliance with Austria, w as appointed to the chief
                    command of the imperial forces against the Turks. In 1697, after having suffered
                    a defeat at Olasch, he resigned this office, and proceeding to Vienna, entered
                    into negotiations with regard to the throne of Poland, left vacant by the death
                    of John Sobieski in 1696. As a preliminary step in his candidature, Augustus
                    renounced the Protestant faith, and proclaimed himself a Catholic. Among his
                    rivals the most formidable was the French prince of Conti. Both expended
                    enormous sums in buying over the Polish nobles, and both claimed to be elected
                    at the general diet. Conti, however, was not on the spot, and Augustus, marching
                    into Poland with his Saxon forces, gained possession of the kingdom. Scarcely
                    was he settled on the throne, when he entered into alliance with Russia and
                    Denmark against the young king of Sweden, and with his Saxon troops (for the
                    Poles would not unite with him) invaded Livonia. In the campaigns which followed
                    (1700-1704), he was completely worsted by the extraordinary military genius of
                    his opponent, the celebrated Charles XII. of Sweden; he was driven from Poland,
                    and Stanislaus Leszczinski was crowned in his place. The Swedes, following up
                    their victories, invaded Saxony, and in 1706, at Altranstädt, Augustus was
                    compelled to make peace, to repay the expenses of the Swedish army, to
                    acknowledge Stanislaus as king of Poland, and to congratulate him on his
                    accession. After these reverses he spent some time as a volunteer in the
                    Netherlands, but the defeat of Charles at Pultowa (1709) again raised his hopes.
                    He at once declared the Altranstädt treaty null and void, and having received
                    promises of assistance from Russia, entered Poland, drove out Stanislaus, and
                    was a second time proclaimed king. During the following years he continued to
                    carry on the war with Sweden, while at the same time his kingdom was distracted
                    by the jealousy with which the Poles regarded the Saxon troops, who were
                    compelled to leave Poland in 1717. In 1718 Charles XII. was killed at
                    Fredericshall, and from that time the reign of Augustus was marked by no
                    important event. His court became celebrated as the <pb break="no"

                    himself as the most dissolute and magnificent of princes. His lavish
                    expenditure, though it enriched his capital with treasures of art, impoverished
                    both Poland and Saxony, and laid the foundations for the future misfortunes of
                    those countries. He died, 1st February 1733, from mortification of an old wound.
                    Of his numerous natural children, the most famous was the distinguished general,
                    Maurice of Saxony.</p>
