                    the noblest of pagans, the crown and flower of Stoicism, was born at Rome 121 A
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">.d.,</hi> the date of his birth being variously stated as
                    the 21st and the 26th April. His original name was Marcus Annius Verus. His
                    father, Annius Verus, died while he was praetor; his mother, who survived her
                    husband, was Domitia Calvilla or Lucilla. By both his parents he was of noble
                    blood, his mother being a lady of consular rank, and his father claiming descent
                    from Numa Pompilius. Marcus was an infant when his father died, and was
                    thereupon adopted by his grandfather. The latter spared no pains upon his
                    education, and the moral training which he received, both from his grandfather
                    and from his mother, and to which he alludes in the most grateful and graceful
                    terms in his <hi rend="italic">Meditations,</hi> must have been all but perfect.
                    The noble qualities of the child attracted the attention of the Emperor Hadrian,
                    who, playing upon the name Verus, said that it should be changed to Verissimus.
                    When Marcus reached the age of seventeen, Hadrian adopted, as his successor,
                    Titus Antoninus Pius (who had married Annia Galeria Faustina, the sister of
                    Annius Verus, and was consequently the uncle of Marcus), on condition that he in
                    turn adopted both his nephew and Lucius Ceionius Commodus, the son of Aelius
                    Caesar, whom Hadrian, being childless, had originally intended as his successor,
                    but who had died before him. It is generally believed that, had Marcus been old
                    enough, Hadrian would have adopted him directly.</p>
                <p>After the death of Hadrian, and the accession of Antoninus Pius to the throne, it
                    became at once apparent that a distinguished future was in store for Marcus. He
                    had been, at the age of fifteen, betrothed to the sister of Commodus; the
                    engagement was broken off by the new emperor, and he was instead betrothed to
                    Faustina, the daughter of the latter. In 139 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the
                    title of Caesar was conferred upon him, and he dropped the name of Verus. The
                    full name he then bore was Marcus Aelius Aurelius Antoninus, Aelius coming from
                    Hadrian’s family, and Aurelius being the original name of Antoninus Pius. He is
                    generally known as Marcus Aurelius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. In 140 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> he was made consul, and entered fully upon public
                    life.</p>
                <p>The education of Aurelius in his youth was so minute, and has been so detailed by
                    himself, that it ought not to be passed over without notice. Professor Long
                    says, with perfect truth, apparently, of the trainers and the trained, “Such a
                    body of teachers, distinguished by their acquirements and their character, will
                    hardly be collected again, and as to the pupil we have not had one like him
                    since.” We have already alluded to the care bestowed upon him in youth by his
                    mother and grandfather; a better guardian than that thoroughly good man and
                    prudent ruler, Antoninus Pius, could not be conceived. Marcus himself says, “To
                    the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good
                    sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly
                    ^everything good.” He never attended any of the Roman public schools, and this
                    he makes a matter for self-congratulation. He was trained by tutors, in whom,
                    particularly in Rusticus, he appears to have been very fortunate, and to whom he
                    showed gratitude when he reached the throne by raising them to the highest
                    dignities of the state. Like most of the young Romans of the day, he began his
                    studies with rhetoric and poetry, his teachers being Herodes Atticus and Μ.
                    Cornelius Fronto. But, at the early age of eleven, he entered upon another
                    course of study, in which he may be said to have continued more or less till the
                    end of his life. He became acquainted with Diognetus the Stoic, was fascinated
                    by the philosophy he taught, assumed the dress of his sect, and ultimately
                    abandoned rhetoric and poetry for philosophy and law, having among his teachers
                    of the one Sextus of Chaeronea, and of the other L Volusianus Marcianus, a
                    distinguished jurist. He went thoroughly and heartily into the practice as well
                    as the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n98/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0098-0087"/> theory of Stoicism, and lived so abstemious and
                    laborious a life, that he injured his health. It was from his Stoical teachers
                    that he learned so many admirable lessons,—to work hard, to deny himself, to
                    avoid listening to slander, to endure misfortunes, never to deviate from his
                    purpose, to be grave without affectation, delicate in correcting others, “not
                    frequently to say to any one, nor to write in a letter, that I have no leisure,”
                    nor continually to excuse the neglect of ordinary duties by alleging urgent
                    occupations. Through all his Stoical training, Aurelius preserved the natural
                    sweetness of his nature, so that he emerged from it the most lovable as well as
                    the saintliest of Pagans.</p>
                <p>Antoninus Pius reigned from 138 to 161 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and the
                    concord between him and his destined heir was so complete, that it is recorded
                    that during these twenty-three years Marcu3 never slept offener than twice away
                    from the house of Pius. It is generally believed that Aurelius married Faustina
                    in 146, at all events a daughter was born to him in 147. The two noblest of
                    imperial Romans were associated both in the administration of the state and in
                    the simple country occupations and amusements of the sea-side villa of Lorium,
                    the birthplace of Pius, to which he loved to retire from the pomp and the
                    wretched intrigues of Rome.</p>
                <p>Antoninus Pius died of fever, 161 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.,</hi> at his villa of
                    Lorium at the age of seventy-five. As his end approached, he summoned his
                    friends and the leading men of Rome to hi3 bedside, and recommended to them
                    Marcus, who was then forty years of age, as his successor, without mentioning
                    the name of Commodus, his other adopted son, commonly called Lucius Verus. It is
                    believed that the senate agreed with what appeared to be the wishes of the dying
                    emperor, and urged Aurelius to take the sole administration of the empire into
                    his hands. But at the very commencement of his reign, Marcus showed the
                    magnanimity of his nature by admitting Verus as his partner in the empire,
                    giving him the tribunitian and proconsular powers, and the titles Caesar and
                    Augustus. This was the first time that Rome had two emperors a3 colleagues.
                    Verus proved to be a weak, self-indulgent man; but he had a high respect for his
                    adoptive brother, and deferred uniformly to his judgment. Although apparently
                    ill-assorted, they lived in peace; and Verus married Lucilla, the daughter of
                    Aurelius. In the first year of his reign Faustina gave birth to twins, one of
                    whom survived to become the infamous Emperor Commodus.</p>
                <p>The early part of the reign of Aurelius was clouded by various national
                    misfortunes: an inundation of the Tiber swept away a large part of Rome,
                    destroying fields, drowning cattle, and ultimately causing a famine; then came
                    earthquakes, fires, and plague3 of insects; and finally, the unruly and warlike
                    Parthians resumed hostilities, and under their king, Vologeses, defeated a Roman
                    army and devastated Syria. Verus, originally a man of considerable physical
                    courage and even mental ability, went to oppose the Parthians, but, having
                    escaped from the control of his colleague in the purple, he gave himself up
                    entirely to sensual excesses, and the Roman cause in Armenia would have been
                    lost, and the empire itself, perhaps, imperilled, had Verus not had under him
                    able generals, the chief of whom was Avidius Cassius. By them the Roman prestige
                    was vindicated, and the Parthian war brought to a conclusion in 165, the two
                    emperors having a triumph for their victory in the year following. Verus and his
                    army brought with them from the East a terrible pestilence, which spread through
                    the whole empire, and added greatly to the horrors of the time. The people of
                    Rome seem to have been completely unnerved by the universal distress, and to
                    have thought that the last days of the empire had come. Nor were their fears
                    without cause. The Parthians had at the best been beaten, not subdued, the
                    Britons threatened revolt, while signs appeared that various tribes beyond the
                    Alps intended to break into Italy. Indeed, the bulk of the reign of Aurelius was
                    spent in efforts to ward off from the empire the attacks of the barbarians. To
                    allay the terrors of the Romans, he went himself to the wars with Verus, his
                    headquarters being Carnuntum on the Danube. Ultimately, the Marcomanni, the
                    fiercest of the tribes that inhabited the country between Illyria and the
                    sources of the Danube, sued for peace in 168. The following year Verus died,
                    having been, it is said, cut off by the pestilence which he had brought from
                    Syria, although in that wicked age there were not wanting gossips malignant
                    enough to say even of Marcus that he hastened his brother’s death by poison.</p>
                <p>Aurelius was thenceforth undisputed master of the Roman empire, during one of the
                    most troubled periods of its history. Mr Farrar, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seekers after↑ God,</hi> thus admirably describes the manner in which he
                    discharged his multifarious duties :—“He regarded himself as being, in fact, the
                    servant of all. It was his duty, like that of the bull in the herd, or the ram
                    among the flocks, to confront every peril in his own person, to be foremost in
                    all the hardships of war, and most deeply immersed in all the toils of peace.
                    The registry of the citizens, the suppression of litigation, the elevation of
                    public morals, the care of minors, the retrenchment of public expenses, the
                    limitation of gladiatorial games and shows, the care of roads, the restoration
                    of senatorial privileges, the appointment of none but worthy magistrates, even
                    the regulation of street traffic, these and numberless other duties so
                    completely absorbed his attention, that, in spite of indifferent health, they
                    often kept him at severe labour from early morning till long after midnight. His
                    position, indeed, often necessitated his presence at games and shows, but on
                    these occasions he occupied himself either in reading, in being read to, or in
                    writing notes. He was one of those who held that nothing should be done hastily,
                    and that few crimes were worse than the waste of time.”</p>
                <p>Peace was not long allowed the emperor. The year after the death of his partner,
                    two of the German tribes, the Quadi and the Marcomanni, renewed hostilities with
                    Rome, and, for three years, Aurelius resided almost constantly at Carnuntum,
                    that he might effectually watch them. In the end, the Marcomanni were driven out
                    of Pannonia, and were almost destroyed in their retreat across the Danube. In
                    174 Aurelius gained a decisive victory over the Quadi, to which a superstitious
                    interest is attached, and which is commemorated by one of the sculptures on the
                    Column of Antonine. The story is that the Roman army had been entangled in a
                    defile, from which they were unable to extricate themselves, while at the same
                    time they suffered intensely from thirst. In this extremity a sudden storm gave
                    them abundance of rain, while the hail and thunder which accompanied the rain
                    confounded their enemies, and enabled the Romans to gain an easy and complete
                    victory. This triumph was universally considered at the time, and for long
                    afterwards, to have been a miracle, and bore the title of “The Miracle of the
                    Thundering Legion.” The Gentile writers of the period ascribed the victory to
                    their gods, while the Christians attributed it to the prayers of their brethren
                    in a legion to which, they affirmed, the emperor then gave the name of
                    Thundering. Dacier, however, and others who adhere to the Christian view of the
                    miracle, admit that the appellation of Thundering or Lightning <hi rend="italic"
                    >(κepaυvoβoλo&lt;&gt;,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">κepawoφ0poς)</hi> was not given
                    to the legion because the Quadi were struck with lightning, but because there
                    was a figure of lightning on their shields. It has also been <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n99/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0099-0088"/> virtually proved that it had the title even in
                    the reign of Augustus.</p>
                <p>Even after this Aurelius was not allowed to rest. From Rome, to which he had
                    returned, he marched to Germany to carry on the war against the tribes which
                    harassed the empire. There the alarming news reached him that Avidius Cassius,
                    the brave and experienced commander of the Roman troops in Asia, had revolted
                    and proclaimed himself emperor. But the rebellion did not last long. Cassius had
                    only enjoyed his self-conf erred honour for three months, when he was
                    assassinated, and his head was "brought to Marcus. With characteristic
                    magnanimity, Marcus did not thank the assassins for what they had done; on the
                    contrary, he begged the senate to pardon all the family of Cassius, and to allow
                    his life to be the only one forfeited on account of the civil war. This was
                    agreed to, and it must be considered as a proof of the wisdom of Aurelius’s
                    clemency, that he had little or no trouble in pacifying the provinces which had
                    been the scene of rebellion. He treated them all with forbearance, and it is
                    said that when he arrived in Syria, and the correspondence of Cassius was
                    brought him, he burnt it without reading it. During this journey of pacification
                    his wife Faustina, who had borne him eleven children, died. The gossiping
                    historians of the time, particularly Dion Cassius and Capitolinus, charge
                    Faustina with the most shameless infidelity to her husband, who is even blamed
                    for not paying heed to her crimes. But none of these stories rest on evidence
                    which can fairly be considered trustworthy; while, on the other hand, there can
                    be no doubt whatever that Aurelius loved his wife tenderly, and trusted her
                    implicitly while she lived, and mourned deeply for her loss. It would seem that
                    Aurelius, after the death of Faustina and the pacification of Syria, proceeded,
                    on his return to Italy, through Athens, and was initiated in the Eleusinian
                    mysteries, the reason assigned for his doing so being, that it was his custom to
                    conform to the established rites of any country in which he happened to find
                    himself, ⅛! Along with his son Commodus he entered Rome in 176, and obtained a
                    triumph for victories in Germany. In 177 occurred that persecution of
                    Christians, the share of Aurelius in which has caused great difference of
                    opinion, and during which Attalus and others were put to death. Meanwhile the
                    war on the German frontier continued, and the hostile tribes were defeated as on
                    former occasions. In this campaign Aurelius led his own forces; and, probably on
                    that account, he was attacked by some infectious disease, which ultimately cut
                    him off, after a short illness, according to one account, in his camp at Sirmium
                    (Mitrovitz) on the Save, in Lower Pannonia, and, according to another, at
                    Vindobona (Vienna), on the 17th March 180 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> in the
                    fifty-ninth year of his age. His ashes (according to some authorities, his body)
                    were taken to Rome, and he was deified. Those who could afford the cost obtained
                    his statue or bust, and, for a long time, statues of him held a place among the
                    Penates of the Romans. Commodus, who was with his father when he died, erected
                    to his memory the Antonine Column (now in the Piazza Colonna at Rome), round the
                    shaft of which are sculptures in relief commemorating the miracle of the
                    Thundering Legion and the various victories of Aurelius over the Quadi and the
                    Marcomanni.</p>
                <p>The one blemish in the life of Aurelius is his hostility to Christianity, which
                    is the more remarkable that his morality comes nearer than any other heathen
                    system to that of the New Testament. Attempts have been made to show that he was
                    not responsible for the atrocities with which his reign is credited, but the
                    evidence of Justin, of Athenagoras, of Apollinaris, and above all, of Melito,
                    bishop of Sardis, and of the Church of Smyrna, is overwhelmingly to the effect
                    that not only were there severe persecutions of Christians, in which men like
                    Polycarp and Justin perished, but that the foundation of these persecutions was
                    certain rescripts or constitutions issued by Aurelius as supplementary to the
                    milder decrees of his predecessors Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. In explanation,
                    however, if not in extenuation, of the attitude of Aurelius towards
                    Christianity, several circumstances should be taken into consideration. In the
                    first place, it is evident that he knew little of the Christians, and absolutely
                    nothing of Christian ethics. In his <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> he makes
                    only one reference (xi. 3) to the adherents of the new creed, and that of the
                    most contemptuous character, showing that he confounded them all with certain
                    fanatics of their number, whom even Clemens of Alexandria compares, on account
                    of their thirst for martyrdom, to the Indian gymnosophists. How far this
                    ignorance was culpable it is impossible at so remote a date to say. Further, it
                    should be noted, in regard to the rescripts upon which the persecutions were
                    founded, that, although they were in the name of the emperor, they may not have
                    proceeded directly from him. There is no evidence that he was an active
                    persecutor, except a passage in Orosius to the effect that there were
                    persecutions of the Christians in Asia and Gallia “under the orders of Marcus ;”
                    and it should not be kept out of consideration that he was to some extent a
                    constitutional monarch, and had to pay deference both to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >consulta</hi> of the senate and the precedents of previous emperors. At the
                    time there was a great popular outcry against the Christians on social and
                    political, even more than on religious, grounds; and Aurelius may have been as
                    much at the mercy of intriguers or fanatics when he gave his sanction to the
                    butcheries of Christians in Asia Minor, as William III. was at the mercy of
                    Stair and Breadalbane, the real authors of the massacre of Glencoe. Finally, it
                    should be borne in mind that, in the reign of Aurelius, the Christians had
                    assumed a much bolder attitude than they had hitherto done. Not only had they
                    caused first interest and then alarm by the rapid increase of their numbers,
                    but, not content with a bare toleration in the empire, they declared war against
                    all heathen rites, and, at least indirectly, against the Government which
                    permitted them to exist. In the eyes of Aurelius they were atheists and foes of
                    that social order which he considered it the first of a citizen’s duties to
                    maintain, and it is quite possible that, although the most amiable of men and of
                    rulers, he may have conceived it to be his duty to sanction measures for the
                    extermination of such wretches. Still his action at the time must be considered,
                    as John Stuart Mill puts it, as “one of the most tragical facts in all
                    history.”</p>
                <p>The book which contains the philosophy of Aurelius is known by the title of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Reflections,</hi> or his <hi rend="italic">Meditations,</hi>
                    although that is not the name which he gave to it himself, and of the
                    genuineness of the authorship no doubts are now entertained. It is believed that
                    the emperor also wrote an autobiography, which has perished with other treasures
                    of antiquity. The <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> were written, it is
                    evident, as occasion offered,—in the midst of public business, and even on the
                    eve of battles on which the fate of the empire depended,—hence their fragmentary
                    appearance, but hence also much of their practical value and even of their
                    charm. It is believed by many critics that they were intended for the guidance
                    in life of Aurelius’s son, Commodus. If so, history records how lamentably they
                    failed in accomplishing their immediate effect, for Com-modus proved one of the
                    greatest sensualists, buffo on ⅛ and tyrants that disgraced even the Roman
                    purple. But they have been considered as one of the most precious of the
                    legacies of antiquity,—as, in fact, the best of ⅛ noninspired reflections on
                    practical morality. They have been recognised as among the most effectual
                    stimuli to strugglεre <pb break="no"

                    position, in the field of speculation as in that of action. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Meditations</hi> of Marcus Aurelius were, with Machiavelli’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Art of War,</hi> the daily study of Captain John Smith, the real
                    founder of the United States. They are placed by Mr Mill in his posthumous essay
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Utility of Religion</hi> as almost equal in ethical
                    elevation to the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
                <p>Aurelius early embraced, and throughout life adhered to, the Stoical philosophy,
                    probably because he considered it as the sternest and most solid system to
                    oppose to the corruption of his time. But, as Tenneman says, he imparted to it
                    “a character of gentleness and benevolence, by making it subordinate to a love
                    of mankind, allied to religion.” In the <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> it is
                    difficult to discover anything like a systematic philosophy, which, indeed,
                    means, as he used the word, tranquillity, or a serene habit of mind. From the
                    manner, however, in which he seeks to distinguish between matter <hi
                    rend="italic">(y</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">f)</hi> and cause
                    or reason (αiτiα, λoγos), and from the Carlylean earnestness with which he
                    advises men to examine all the impressions on their minds (φαvτασ√αι), it may be
                    inferred that he held the view of Anaxagoras—that God and matter exist
                    independently, but that God governs matter. There can be no doubt that Aurelius
                    believed in a deity, although Schultz is probably right in maintaining that all
                    his theology amounts to this,—the soul of man is most intimately united to his
                    body, and together they make one animal which we call man; and so the deity is
                    most intimately united to the world or the material universe, and together they
                    form one whole. We find in the <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> no
                    speculations on the absolute nature of the deity, and no clear expressions of
                    opinion as to a future state. We may also observe here that, like Epictetus, he
                    is by no means so decided on the subject of suicide as the older Stoics.
                    Aurelius is, above all things, a practical moralist. The goal in life to be
                    aimed at, according to him, is not happiness, but tranquillity, or equanimity.
                    This condition of mind can be attained only by “living conformably to nature,”
                    that is to say, one’s whole nature, and as a means to that, man must cultivate
                    the four chief virtues, each of which has its distinct sphere—wisdom, or the
                    knowledge of good and evil; justice, or the giving to every man his due;
                    fortitude, or the enduring of labour and pain; and temperance, or moderation in
                    all things. It is no “fugitive and cloistered virtue” that Aurelius seeks to
                    encourage; on the contrary, man must lead the “life of the social animal,” must
                    “live as on a mountain ;” and “he is an abscess on the universe who withdraws
                    and separates himself from the reason of our common nature through being
                    displeased with the things which happen.” While the prime principle in man is
                    the social, “the next in order is not to yield to the persuasions of the body,
                    when they are not conformable to the rational principle which must govern.” This
                    “divinity within a man,” this “legislating faculty” <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(to</hi><hi rend="italic">ηyep,ovLκ0v)</hi> which, looked at from one point of
                    view, is conscience, and from another is reason, must be implicitly obeyed. He
                    who thus obeys it will attain tranquillity of mind; nothing can irritate him,
                    for everything is according to nature, and death itself “is such as generation
                    is, a mystery of nature, a composition out of the same elements, and a
                    decomposition into the same, and altogether not a thing of which any man should
                    be ashamed, for it is not contrary to the nature of a reasonable animal, and not
                    contrary to the reason of our constitution.”</p>
                <p>The morality of Marcus Aurelius cannot be said to have been new when it was given
                    to the world, far less can it be said to be systematic. Compared, indeed, with
                    elaborate treatises on ethics, the <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> of Marcus
                    Aurelius are as tonic medicine to succulent food. The charm of his morality lies
                    in its exquisite accent and its infinite tenderness. Where can the connoisseur
                    in morals find anything finer than such sentences as this Î—“The pride which is
                    proud of its want of pride is the most intolerable of all ;” or where can a more
                    delicate rebuke to the Pharisaism which lurks in the breast of every man be
                    obtained than this <hi rend="italic">1—“One</hi> man, when he has done a service
                    to another, is ready to set it down to his account as a favour conferred.
                    Another is not ready to do this, but still, in his own mind, he thinks of the
                    man as his debtor, and he knows what he has done. A third in a manner does not
                    even know what he has done, but he is like a vine which has produced grapes, and
                    seeks for nothing more after it has once produced its proper fruit. So a man
                    when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but
                    he goes on to another act as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in
                    season.” But above all, what gives the sentences of Marcus Aurelius their
                    enduring value and fascination, what renders them superior to the utterances of
                    other moralists of the same school, such as Epictetus and Seneca, is that they
                    are the gospel of his life. His practice was in accordance with his precepts, or
                    rather his precepts are simply the records of his practice. To the saintliness
                    of the cloister he added the wisdom of the man of the world; constant in
                    misfortune, not elated by prosperity, never “carrying things to the sweating
                    point ;” preserving, in a time of universal corruption, unreality, and
                    self-indulgence, a nature sweet, pure, self-denying, unaffected, Marcus Aurelius
                    has given to the world one of the finest examples of the possibilities of
                    humanity.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Meditations</hi> of Marcus Aurelius have been translated
                    into English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian. The two chief English
                    translatione are those of Jeremy Collier (1702) and of George Long; the last may
                    be considered final. The text most commonly used is the Greek one edited by J.
                    Μ. Schultz (republished by Tauchnitz in 1821). Many books have been written on
                    the life and times of Aurelius, and the essays on his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meditations</hi> are innumerable. One of the best estimates of him is contained
                    in Mr F. W. Farrar’s <hi rend="italic">Seekers after God,</hi> 1868. A scholarly
                    work issued in 1874 by Μ. Gaston Boissin, entitled <hi rend="italic">La Religion
                    Romaine d'Auguste aux Antonines,</hi> gives, perhaps, the most interesting
                    existing account of the state of society under the Antonines.</p>
