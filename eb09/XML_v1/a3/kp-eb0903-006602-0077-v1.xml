                    rend="smallcaps">Esprit,</hi> musical composer, the chief representative of the
                    French school, was the son of a Paris printseller. He was born at Caen, in
                    Normandy, on the 29th January 1782, while his mother was on a visit to that
                    town. Destined by his father to the pursuits of trade, he was allowed,
                    nevertheless, to indulge his fondness for music, and learnt to play at an early
                    age on several instruments, his first teacher being the Tyrolean composer,
                    Ladurner. Sent at the age of twenty to London to complete his business training,
                    he returned after the rupture of the peace of Amiens. He had already attempted
                    musical composition, and at this period produced several <hi rend="italic"
                    >concertos</hi><hi rend="italic">pour basse,</hi> in the manner of the
                    violoncellist, Lamare, in whose name they were published. The praise given to
                    his concerto for the violin, which was played at the Conservatoire by Mazas,
                    encouraged him to undertake the resetting of the old comic opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Julie.</hi> Conscious by this time of the need of regular study of
                    his chosen art, he placed himself under the severe training of Cherubini, by
                    which the special qualities of the young composer were admirably developed. In
                    1813 he made his <hi rend="italic">début</hi> in an opera in one act, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Séjour Militaire,</hi> the unfavourable reception of which put an
                    end for some years to his attempts as composer. But the failure in business and
                    death of his father, in 1819, compelled him once more to turn to music, and to
                    make that which had been his pastime the serious employment of his life. He
                    produced another opera, the <hi rend="italic">Testament</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">les Billets-doux,</hi> which was no better received
                    than the former. But he persevered, and the next year was rewarded by the
                    complete success of his <hi rend="italic">Bergère Châtelaine,</hi> an opera in
                    three acts. This was the first in a long series of brilliant successes,
                    terminating only in the eighty-sixth year of his age. In 1822 began his long
                    association with Μ. Scribe, who shared with him, as librettist, the success and
                    growing popularity of his compositions. The opera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leicester,</hi> in which they first worked together (1823), is remarkable also
                    as showing the first evidences of the influence of Rossini on Auber’s style.
                    This style was, however, distinctly original, and was easily recognisable. A
                    phrase of Auber, said his friend Theodore Gautier, is not the phrase of any one
                    else. His characteristics are lightness and facility, sparkling vivacity, grace
                    and elegance, clear and piquant melodiousness,—these marking him out as a true
                    son of France, and making him her darling singer. Depth of thought, elevation of
                    sentiment, intensity of passion, inspiration which grasps the sublime and the
                    infinite—these are not in Auber.</p>
                <p>Devoted by preference to the comic opera, as the most fitting field for his
                    talents, he ventured on more than one occasion to pass into the field of grand
                    opera, and in his <hi rend="italic">La Muette</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Portici,</hi> familiarly known as <hi rend="italic">Masaniello,</hi> he achieved
                    his greatest musical triumph. Produced at Paris in 1828, it rapidly became a
                    European favourite, and its overture, songs, and choruses were everywhere heard.
                    The duet, <hi rend="italic">Amour</hi><hi rend="italic">sacré de la patrie</hi>
                    was welcomed like a new <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise;</hi> sung by Nourrit at
                    Brussels in 1830, it became the signal for the revolution which broke out there.
                    Among his other works, about fifty in all, the more important are— <hi
                    rend="italic">Fra Diavolo</hi> (1830), <hi rend="italic">Lestocq</hi> (1834),
                    <hi rend="italic">I'</hi><hi rend="italic">Ambassadrice</hi> (1836), <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Domino Noir</hi> (1837), <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Lac</hi><hi rend="italic">des Fées</hi>
                    (1839), <hi rend="italic">Les Diamants de la Couronne</hi> (1841), <hi
                    rend="italic">Ilaydée</hi><hi rend="italic">iy⅛AT), Marco</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Spada</hi> (1853), and <hi rend="italic">La Fiancée</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    roi de</hi><hi rend="italic">Garbe</hi> (1864). Official and other dignities
                    testified the public appreciation of Auber’s works. In 1829 he was elected
                    member of the Institute, in 1830 he was named director of the court concerts,
                    and in 1842 he succeeded Cherubini as director of the Conservatoire. He was also
                    a member of the Legion of Honour from 1825, and attained the rank of commander
                    in 1847. One of Auber’s latest compositions was a march, written for the opening
                    of the International Exhibition in London in 1862. His fascinating manners, his
                    witty sayings, and his ever ready kindness and beneficence won for him a secure
                    place in the respect and love of his fellow-citizens. He remained in his old
                    home during the German siege of Paris, 1870-71, but the miseries of the
                    Communist war which followed sickened his heart, and he at last refused to touch
                    his beloved instrument, or to take food. He died May 13,1871. <hi
