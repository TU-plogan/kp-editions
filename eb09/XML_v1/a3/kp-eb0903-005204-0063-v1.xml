                <p><label type="entry">ATTENTION</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Psychology,</hi> may
                    be defined as the concentration of consciousness, or the direction of mental
                    energy upon a definite object or objects. By means of it we either bring within
                    the circle of our conscious life perceptions and ideas which would not otherwise
                    have risen from their obscurity, or render clearer and more distinct some of
                    those already under notice. Its mode of operation and the effects produced by it
                    may be compared with the concentration of visual activity on some definite part
                    of the field of vision, and the clearer perception of the limited portion which
                    is thereby attained. In both cases the result is brought about, not by effecting
                    any change in the perceptions themselves, but simply by isolating them, and
                    considering them to the exclusion of all other objects. Since all consciousness
                    involves discrimination, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> isolation of one object
                    from others, it involves attention, which might therefore be defined as the
                    necessary condition of consciousness. Such a definition is, however, too
                    general, and throws no light upon the nature of the process whereby our mental
                    energy is strengthened in particular cases. This increase of force, when
                    consciousness is directed to any one object to the exclusion of others, is
                    partly to be explained by reference to the general law that, as the amount of
                    intellectual energy at our disposal is limited, the greater the number of
                    objects over which it is spread, the less will each receive, <hi rend="italic"
                    >pluribus intentus,</hi><hi rend="italic">minor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >est</hi><hi rend="italic">ad singula</hi><hi rend="italic">sensus;</hi> and
                    conversely, the greater the concentration, the fewer must be the objects
                    attended to. In addition to this general law of limitation, there are special
                    circumstances which determine the amount of consciousness we shall bestow on any
                    object. In the first place, there are certain mechanical influences only partly
                    subject to the will, such are the force or vividness of the impression, the
                    interest attaching to an object, the trains of associated ideas excited, or the
                    emotions roused by its contemplation. There is, secondly, an exercise of
                    volition employed in fixing the mind upon some definite object; this is a purely
                    voluntary act, which can be strengthened by habit, is variable in different
                    individuals, and to which, as being its highest stage, the name Attention is
                    sometimes restricted. The general law of the limitation of conscious activity,
                    pointed out above, throws considerable light on the nature of abstraction and
                    its relation to Attention. It is clear that concentration of consciousness upon
                    any one attribute or attrioutes of an object involves withdrawal of
                    consciousness from all other attributes. This withdrawal is, logically and
                    etymologically, Abstraction, which is thus the negative side of Attention, or,
