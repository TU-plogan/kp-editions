                    listen), a term in medicine, applied to the method employed by physicians for
                    determining, by the sense of hearing, the condition of certain internal organs.
                    The ancient physicians appear to have practised a kind of auscultation, by which
                    they were able to detect the presence of air or fluids in the cavities of the
                    chest and abdomen. Still no general application of this method of investigation
                    was resorted to, or was indeed possible, till the advance of the study of
                    anatomy led to correct ideas regarding the locality, structure, and uses of the
                    various organs of the body, and to the alterations produced in them by disease.
                    In 1761 Auenbrugger of Vienna introduced the art of percussion in reference more
                    especially to diseases of the chest. This consisted in tapping with the fingers
                    the surface of the body, so as to elicit sounds by which the comparative
                    resonance of the subjacent parts or organs might be estimated. Auen-brugger’s
                    method attracted but little attention, till Corvisart, in 1808, demonstrated its
                    great practical importance; and then its employment in the diagnosis of
                    affections of the chest soon became general. Percussion was originally practised
                    in the manner above mentioned <hi rend="italic">(immediate percussion),</hi> but
                    subsequently the method of <hi rend="italic">mediate percussion</hi> was
                    introduced by Piorry, and is that now largely adopted. It is accomplished by
                    placing upon the spot to be examined some solid substance named a <hi
                    rend="italic">pleximeter</hi> (stroke-measurer), upon which the percussion
                    strokes are made either with the fingers or with a small hammer tipped with
                    india-rubber. The pleximeter consists of a thin oval piece of ivory; but one or
                    more fingers of the left hand applied flat upon the part answer equally well,
                    and this is the method which most physicians adopt. Percussion must be regarded
                    as a necessary part of auscultation, particularly in relation to the examination
                    of the chest; for the physician who has made himself acquainted with the normal
                    condition of that part of the body in reference to percussion is thus able to
                    recognise by the ear alterations of resonance produced by disease. But
                    percussion alone, however important in diagnosis, could manifestly convey only
                    limited and imperfect information, for it could never indicate the nature or
                    extent of functional disturbance, or fliätinguish between different forms of
                    disease, even in those organs which it had proved ∣to be in an abnormal
                    condition, while in other cases, and notably in many affections of the heart, it
                    could afford no assistance whatever.</p>
                <p>In 1819 the distinguished French physician, Laennec, introduced the method of
                    auscultation by means of the stethoscope <hi rend="italic">(στήθος,</hi> the
                    chest, and <hi rend="italic">σκoπeω,</hi> to examine), with which his name
                    stands permanently associated. For some time previously, physicians, more
                    especially in the hospitals of Paris, had been in the habit of applying the ear
                    over the region of the heart for the purpose of listening to the sounds of that
                    organ, and it was in the employment of this method that Laennec conceived the
                    idea that these sounds might be better conveyed through the medium of some solid
                    body interposed between his ear and the patient’s chest. He accordingly, by way
                    of experiment, rolled up a quire of paper into the form of a cylinder and
                    applied it in the manner just mentioned, when he found, as he states, that he
                    was able to perceive the action of the heart more distinctly than he had ever
                    been able to do by the immediate application of his ear. He thence inferred that
                    not merely the heart’s sounds, but also those of other organs of the chest might
                    be brought within reach of the ear by some such instrument, and he, therefore,
                    had constructed the wooden cylinder, or stethoscope, which bears his name. This
                    consisted of a cylindrical piece of wood, about 12 inches long, with a narrow
                    perforation from end to end, the extremity for applying to the chest having a
                    movable piece of conical form fitting into the cylinder, which was withdrawn by
                    the physician -while listening to the sounds of respiration, the complete
                    instrument being used for examining the sounds of the voice and those of the
                    heart. This instrument, though rendered portable by being made to screw into two
                    halves, was inconveniently large and heavy, and was subsequently modified by
                    Piorry to the form now generally used of a thin narrow cylinder of about 7
                    inches long, with an expansion at one end for applying to the chest, and a more
                    or less flattened surface at the other for the ear of the listener. Having
                    ascertained by careful observation the sounds elicited on auscultation of the
                    healthy chest, Laennec studied the modifications of these as produced by
                    disease; and by comparing cases with one another, and especially by
                    investigating the state of the affected parts after death, he was able, in his
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de ΓAuscultation
                    mediate,</hi> to lay the foundation for a rational system of diagnosis of the
                    great classes of pulmonary and heart complaints. It does not, however, appear to
                    be the case, as Laennec supposed, that <hi rend="italic">mediate
                    auscultation</hi> by the stethoscope is superior in an acoustic point of view to
                    <hi rend="italic">immediate auscultation</hi> by the unaided ear. On the
                    contrary, sounds are heard louder by the latter than by the former method.
                    Nevertheless, the stethoscope possesses special advantages, among the chief of
                    which are that by its use particular areas can be examined and compared with
                    greater accuracy; that it can be applied to all parts of the chest, and that it
                    can be used in all cases where, from the sex or the bodily condition of the
                    patient, the direct application of the ear is inadmissible. On the other hand,
                    immediate auscultation is to be preferred in the examination of young children,
                    who are readily frightened by the sight, and still more by the pressure upon
                    them, of the stethoscope.</p>
                <p>The whole subject of auscultation has been greatly elaborated since the time of
                    Laennec. and while some of his opinions have been found to require modification,
                    continued investigation only serves more clearly to demonstrate the value of
                    this method of diagnosis, and to elicit fresh and more accurate results from its
                    employment. Although much remains to be done in the way of the correct
                    interpretation of the phenomena observed in auscultation, yet the facts already
                    established are among the most important <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n112/mode/1up"

                    medicine. The numerous diseases affecting the lungs can now be recognised and ·
                    discriminated from each other with a precision which, but for auscultation and
                    the stethoscope, would have been altogether unattainable, a point which bears
                    most intimately upon the treatment of this great and common class of ailments.
                    The same holds good in the case of the heart, whose varied and often complex
                    forms of disease can, by auscultation, be identified with striking accuracy. But
                    in addition to these its main uses, auscultation is found to render great
                    assistance in the investigation of many obscure internal affections, such as
                    aneurisms and certain diseases of the oesophagus and stomach. To the accoucheur
                    the stethoscope yields valuable aid in the detection of some forms of uterine
                    tumours, and especially in the diagnosis of pregnancy,—the auscultatory evidence
                    afforded at a particular stage by the sounds of the foetal heart being by far
                    the most reliable of the many signs of that condition. (j. o. <hi
