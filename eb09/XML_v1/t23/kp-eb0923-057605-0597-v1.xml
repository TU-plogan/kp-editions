                <p><label type="entry">TRISTAN DA CUNHA</label>, a group of three small volcanic
                    islands, situated in the South Atlantic nearly midway between the Cape of Good
                    Hope and the coast of South America, the summit of the largest being in 37° 5'
                    50'' S. lat. and 12° 16' 40'' W. long. They rise from the low submarine
                    elevation which runs down the centre of the Atlantic and on which are likewise
                    situated Ascension, St. Paul’s Rocks, and the Azores; the average depth on this
                    ridge is from 1600 to 1700 fathoms, while depths of 3000 fathoms are found on
                    each side of it. The depth between the islands is in some places over 1000
                    fathoms. Tristan, the largest and northernmost island, is nearly circular in
                    form, about 7 miles in diameter, with a volcanic cone in the centre (7640 feet).
                    Precipitous cliffs, 1000 to 2000 feet in height, rise directly from the ocean on
                    all sides, except on the north-west, where there is an irregular plain, 100 feet
                    above the sea, and 2½ miles in length and ½ mile in breadth. The crater of the
                    central cone is said to be filled with a freshwater lake which never freezes.
                    Inaccessible Island, the westernmost of the group, is about 20 miles from
                    Tristan. It is quadrilateral in form, the sides being about 2 miles long. The
                    highest point (1840 feet) is on the west side; all round there are perpendicular
                    cliffs 1000 feet in height. At the base of these are in some places narrow
                    fringes of beach a few feet above the sealevel. Nightingale Island, the smallest
                    and most southern of the group, is 10 miles from Inaccessible Island. Its
                    coasts, unlike those of the other two islands, are surrounded by low cliffs,
                    from which there is a gentle slope up to two peaks, the one 1100 feet, the other
                    960 feet high. There are two small islets—Stoltenkoff (325 feet) and Middle (150
                    feet)—and several rocks adjacent to the coast. The rocks are feldspathic basalt,
                    dolerite, augite-andesite, sideromelane, and palagonite; some specimens of the
                    basalt have porphyritic augite. The caves in Nightingale Island indicate that it
                    has been elevated several feet. On almost all sides the islands are surrounded
                    by a broad belt of kelp, the gigantic southern sea-weed <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Macrocystis pyrifera),</hi> through which a boat may approach the rocky shores
                    even in stormy weather. There is no good or safe anchorage. The beaches and
                    lower lands are covered with a dense growth of tussock grass <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Spartina arundinacea),</hi> 8 to 10 feet in height, which shelters millions of
                    penguins <hi rend="italic">(Eudyptes chrysocoma),</hi> which there form their
                    rookeries. There is one small tree <hi rend="italic">(Phylica nitida),</hi>
                    which grows in detached patches on the lower grounds. Independently of
                    introduced plants, fifty-five species have been collected in the group,
                    twenty-nine being flowering plants and twenty-six ferns and lycopods. A majority
                    of the species are characteristic of the present general flora of the south
                    temperate zone rather than any particular part of it: botanically the group is
                    generally classed with the islands of the Southern Ocean. A finch (<hi
                    rend="italic">Nesospiza acunhae),</hi> a thrush <hi rend="italic">(Nesocichla
                    eremita),</hi> and a water hen <hi rend="italic">(Gallinula nesiotis)</hi> are
                    the only land birds—the first two being peculiar to the islands. In addition to
                    the penguins numerous other sea birds nest on the islands, as petrels,
                    albatrosses, terns, skuas, and prions. One or two land shells, a few spiders,
                    several <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera,</hi> a small lepidopter, and a few other
                    insects are recorded, but no <hi rend="italic">Orthoptera</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Hymenoptera.</hi> The prevailing winds are westerly. December to
                    March is the fine season. The climate is mild and on the whole healthy, the
                    temperature averaging 68° Fahr. in summer, 55° in winter,—sometimes falling to
                    40°. Rain is frequent; hail and snow fall occasionally on the lower grounds. The
                    sky is usually cloudy. The islands have a cold and barren appearance. The tide
                    rises and falls about four feet.</p>
                <p>The islands were discovered and named by the Portuguese in 1506. The Dutch
                    described them in 1643. D’Etcheverri landed on them in the year 1767, when he
                    gave Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands their names. Their exact geographical
                    position was determined by Captain Denham in 1852, and the “Challenger”
                    completed the exploration of the group in 1873. When first discovered the
                    islands were uninhabited. Towards the end of the 18th and in the beginning of
                    the 19th century several sealers resided on them for longer or shorter periods.
                    In 1816 the islands were taken possession of by Great Britain. In 1817 the
                    garrison was withdrawn, but Corporal William Glass, his wife and family, and two
                    men were allowed to remain. This small colony received additions from time to
                    time from shipwrecks, from whalers, and from the Cape of Good Hope. In 1826
                    there were 7 men and 2 women <pb break="no"

                    inhabitants, in 1886 97. They possess cattle, sheep, and geese. There are
                    usually good potato crops. The settlement has always been on the flat stretch of
                    laud on the north-west of Tristan, and is called Edinburgh. Two Germans lived
                    for several years on Inaccessible Island, but with this exception there have
                    been no settlements either on this or on Nightingale Island.</p>
