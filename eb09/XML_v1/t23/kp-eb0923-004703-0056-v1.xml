                <p><label type="entry">TANNIN</label>, a generic name for a class of vegetable
                    substances which, as the name indicates, are all available for tanning, meaning
                    the conversion of animal hide into leather. Tannin is widely diffused throughout
                    the vegetable kingdom. An enumeration of the principal materials which form the
                    commercial sources of the substance will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Leather,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 381, and in various special articles referred to
                    from that heading.</p>
                <p>Our chemical knowledge on the subject is very limited; and, as long as we know no
                    better, each of the various tanning materials must be viewed as containing a
                    “tannin” of its own kind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Coffee beans and tea leaves contain peculiar tannins.</p></note> Only a few
                    have as yet been obtained in a state approximating chemical purity. The
                    following characters are common to them all :—</p>
                <p>(1) All are colourless or little-coloured non-volatile solids, soluble in water
                    and in alcohol; the solution has an astringent taste.</p>
                <p>(2) They colour blue litmus paper feebly red, yet all unite with the alkalies
                    into soluble salts; the solutions of these eagerly absorb oxygen from the air,
                    with formation of dark-coloured products.</p>
                <p>(3) They form insoluble salts with the oxides of lead, zinc, copper, producible
                    by addition of solution of the tannin to one of the respective acetate.</p>
                <p>(4) They form very dark-coloured (green or blue) compounds with ferric oxide,
                    conveniently producible by addition of the tannin to ferric or ferroso-ferric
                    acetate. Ordinary old-fashioned black (gall-nut) ink may be quoted as an
                    illustration.</p>
                <p>(5) Tannin solutionsprecipitate gelatine as an insoluble compound, generally
                    assumed to be chemically similarto the substance of leather.</p>
                <p>(6) If a piece of raw hide be placed in a solution of any tannin, it imbibes the
                    latter with formation of <hi rend="smallcaps">Leather</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{y.v.}.</hi></p>
                <p>(7) Aqueous tannin-solutions, if mixed with dilute sulphuric acid, are readily
                    oxidized by solution of permanganate of potash, which, being reduced to
                    manganous salt, loses its intense violet colour.</p>
                <p>Upon the last two propositions Lowenthal has based a convenient method for the
                    assaying of tannin materials. A known weight of the substance to be analysed
                    (say sumach) is extracted with water, and the extract diluted to a known volume.
                    An aliquot part of the extract is then mixed with a certain proportion of a
                    standard solution of indigo-carmin and of sulphuric acid, and, after large
                    dilution with water, standard permanganate is dropped in from a burette
                    (graduated glass tube) until the colour of the indigo is completely discharged.
                    After deducting the volume (of reagent which would have been taken up by the
                    indigo alone, the rest is put down as corresponding to the “permanganate
                    reducers generally.” Another measured volume of the extract is then poured over
                    a sufficient weight of dry shavings of raw hide, after having been suitably
                    diluted, and the whole is allowed to stand until the tannin has all passed into
                    the hide. The liquid is then filtered, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n57/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0057-0048"/> and a measured volume, corresponding to exactly
                    the quantity of extract used for the assay, tested with permanganate. The volume
                    of reagent used this time is deducted from that used in the assay as a
                    correction. From the net permanganate the weight of pure gallotannic acid which
                    it would oxidize is calculated on the basis of standard experiments, and from
                    this weight the “percentage of tannin” is deduced. The method is purely
                    empirical, and the results are of no value unless obtained according to a
                    rigorously prescribed mode of procedure. Of individual tannins that of the
                    gall-nuts, known as <hi rend="italic">gallotannic acid,</hi> is best known. For
                    its preparation (according to Pélouze) powdered gall-nuts are placed in an
                    apparatus for extraction ‘ ‘ by displacement,” and in it soaked in a mixture of
                    9 parts of ether and 1 part of water for twenty-four hours. The liquid is then
                    allowed to drain off, and the residue washed with aqueous ether. The liquid on
                    standing separates into two layers,—a lower heavy layer, which contains the
                    tannin, and an upper more purely ethereal layer, which contains gallic acid and
                    other impurities. The lower layer is drawn off, washed once or twice with ether,
                    and then evaporated to dryness at a gentle heat; the tannin remains as a porous
                    friable mass of a slightly greyish-yellow colour. This is the tannin of the
                    pharmaceutist.</p>
                <p>Such tannin is not by any means an absolutely unitary substance. Its solution, if
                    allowed to stand in the presence of a ferment which is naturally present in
                    gall-nut extract, or more readily if boiled with sulphuric acid, yields a large
                    proportion of <hi rend="italic">gallic acid,</hi> which is easily obtained in
                    pure crystals. According to Strecker, glucose is formed at the same time, whence
                    he viewed tannin as a glucoside (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sugar).</hi> But this
                    is now recognized as a mistake, since Hugo Schiff showed that <hi rend="italic"
                    >pure</hi> tannin is only digallic acid, C <hi rend="subscript"> 14</hi> H <hi

                    5</hi> (gallic acid) minus 1H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. Pure tannin,
                    according to Schiff, can be obtained by dehydrating pure gallic acid by means of
                    chloride of acetyl. The tannin of the Chinese gall-nuts seems to be identical
                    with gallotannic acid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Quercitannic Acid.—</hi> The tannin of oak bark is certainly
                    different from gallotannic acid, because it yields no gallic acid when boiled
                    with dilute vitriol. Etti <hi rend="italic">(Jahresb. uber die Fortschr. der
                    Chemie</hi> for 1880, p. 898) prepares it by extracting the powdered bark with
                    dilute alcohol at a gentle heat, adding ordinary ether to the alcoholic extract,
                    and shaking out the tannin with acetic ether. The acetic ether extract is
                    distilled to recover the solvent, the residue filtered, and the filtrate
                    evaporated to dryness to obtain the pure (?) tannin as a reddish-white powder of
                    the composition C <hi rend="subscript"> 17</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi>

                    insoluble in water but soluble in solution of the tannin. Quercitannic acid
                    forms quite a series of such anhydrides: 34H30θ17 &gt; 0 <hi rend="subscript">

                    are contained in aqueous oak-bark extract, and they play an important part in
                    its application for tanning. According to Etti, quercitannic acid is a
                    tri-methyl substitution-product of digallic acid, C <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>Besides these two tannins, those of coffee and cachou are the only ones which
                    have been obtained in a relatively definite fofrιι.</p>
