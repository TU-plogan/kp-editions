                    of most later writers, and is remarkable as being perhaps the most cosmopolitan
                    of birds; for, though properly belonging to the northern hemisphere, there is
                    scarcely a sea-coast in the world on which it may not occur: it has been
                    obtained from Spitzbergen to the Strait of Magellan and from Point Barrow to the
                    Cape of Good Hope and New Zealand— examples from the southern hemisphere being,
                    however, almost invariably in a state of plumage that shows, if not immaturity,
                    yet an ineptitude for reproduction. It also, though much less commonly, resorts
                    to the margins of inland rivers and lakes; but it is very rarely seen except in
                    the neighbourhood of water, and salt water for preference.</p>
                <p>The Turnstone is about as big as an ordinary Snipe; but, compared with most of
                    its allies of the group <hi rend="italic">Limicolae,</hi> to which it belongs,
                    its form is somewhat heavy, and its legs are short. Still it is brisk in its
                    movements, and its variegated plumage makes it a pleasing bird. Seen in front,
                    its white face, striped with black, and broad black gorget attract attention as
                    it sits, often motionless, on the rocks; while in flight the white of the lower
                    part of the back and white band across the wings are no less conspicuous even at
                    a distance. A nearer view will reveal the rich chestnut of the mantle and upper
                    wing-coverts, and the combination of colours thus exhibited suggests the term
                    “tortoise-shell” often applied to it—the quill-feathers being mostly of a dark
                    brown and its lower parts pure white. The deeper tints are, however, peculiar to
                    the nuptial plumage, or are only to be faintly traced at other times, so that in
                    winter the adults—and the young always—have a much plainer appearance, ashy-grey
                    and white being almost the only hues observable. From the fact that Turnstones
                    may be met with at almost any season in various parts of the world,<note

                    this fact raise the ingenious question, “Do birds, after they have become old,
                    effete, or barren, prefer to stay in a warm climate ?”</p></note> and especially
                    on islands as the Canaries, Azores, and many of those in the British seas, it
                    has been inferred that these birds may breed in such places. In some cases this
                    may prove to be true, but in most evidence to that effect is wanting. In America
                    the breeding-range of this species has not been defined. In Europe there is good
                    reason to suppose that it <pb break="no"

                    western coast of the continent, from Jutland to the extreme north of Norway,
                    that the greatest number are reared. The nest, contrary to the habits of most
                    <hi rend="italic">Limicolae,</hi> is generally placed under a ledge of rock
                    which shelters the bird from observation,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
