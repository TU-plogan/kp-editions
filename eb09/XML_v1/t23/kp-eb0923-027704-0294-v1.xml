                <p><label type="entry">THEOPOMPUS</label> of Chios, a celebrated historian and
                    rhetorician, was born about 378 B.c. In early youth he seems to have spent some
                    time at Athens, along with his father, who had been exiled on account of his
                    Laconian sympathies. Here he became a pupil of Isocrates, and rapidly made great
                    progress in rhetoric: we are told that Isocrates used to say that Ephorus
                    required the spur but Theopompus the bit (Cic., <hi rend="italic">Brutus,</hi> §
                    204). At first he appears to have composed epideictic speeches, in which he
                    attained to such proficiency that in 352-351 he gained the prize of oratory
                    given by Artemisia in honour of her husband, although Isocrates was himself
                    among the competitors. It is said to have been the advice of his teacher that
                    finally determined his career as an historian,—a career for which his abundant
                    patrimony and wide knowledge of men and places (Fr. 26) had singularly fitted
                    him. Through the influence of Alexander, he was restored to Chios about 333, and
                    figured for some time as one of the boldest and most uncompromising leaders of
                    the aristocratical party in his native town. After Alexander’s death he was
                    again expelled, and took refuge with Ptolemy in Egypt, where he appears to have
                    met with a somewhat cold reception. The date of his death is unknown.</p>
                <p>The works of Theopompus were chiefly historical, and later writers frequently
                    cite them as authorities. They included an <hi rend="italic">Epitome of
                    Herodotus's History,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Hellenics</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >('Ελληνικά, 'Ελληνικά!</hi><hi rend="italic">iστoρiaι),</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Philip</hi><hi rend="italic">(Φιλιππικά),</hi> and
                    several panegyrics and hortatory addresses, the chief of which was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Letter to Alexander.</hi> The genuineness of the epitome of
                    Herodotus has been called in question; we possess only five quotations from it,
                    preserved by grammarians or lexicographers, and consisting only of single words.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Hellenics</hi> was a somewhat ambitious work in 12 books,
                    extending from 411 (where Thucydides breaks off) to 394 —the date of the battle
                    of Cnidus. A few insignificant fragments remain, but do not suffice to give us
                    any idea of the general character of the work. By far the most ambitious history
                    written by Theopompus was the <hi rend="italic">Φιλιππικά.</hi> In this he
                    narrated the history of Philip’s reign (360-336) in 58 books, with frequent
                    digressions on the names and customs of the various races and countries of which
                    he had occasion to speak. So numerous were these digressions that Philip III. of
                    Macedon reduced the bulk of the history from 58 to 16 books by cutting out those
                    parts which had no connexion with the achievements of the king. It was from this
                    history that Diodorus and Trogus Pompeius derived much of their materials.
                    Several fragments, chiefly anecdotes and strictures of various kinds upon the
                    character of nations and individuals, are preserved by Athenaeus, Plutarch, and
                    others. Of the <hi rend="italic">Letter to Alexander</hi> we possess one or two
                    fragments cited by Athenaeus, animadverting severely upon the immorality and
                    dissipations of Harpalus. The <hi rend="italic">Attack upon Plato,</hi> and the
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">On Piety,</hi> which are sometimes referred to as
                    separate works, were perhaps only two of the many digressions in the history of
                    Philip; some writers have doubted their authenticity.</p>
                <p>The nature of the extant fragments fully bears out the criticisms of antiquity
                    upon Theopompus. Their style is clear and pure, full of choice and pointed
                    expressions, but lacking in the weight and dignity which only profound thought
                    can supply. As we might expect in a pupil of Isocrates, he is especially careful
                    to avoid hiatus. The artistic unity of his work suffered severely from the
                    frequent episodes with which it was interspersed; his account of Sicily, for
                    example, extended over several books. Another fault was his excessive fondness
                    for romantic and incredible stories (Fr. 33, 66, 76, &amp;c.); a collection of
                    some of these was afterwards made and published under his name, with the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Θαυμάσια</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n295/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0295-0278"/> (Diog. Laert., i. 115). He was also severely
                    blamed in antiquity for his censoriousness, and throughout his fragments no
                    feature is more striking than this (Fr. 54, 65, &amp;c.). On the whole, however,
                    he appears to have been fairly impartial. Philip himself he censures severely
                    for drunkenness and immorality (Fr. 136, 178, 262, 298), while Demosthenes
                    receives his warm praise (Fr. 239, 263). There can be no doubt that in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philippica</hi> the world has lost a great variety of pleasant
                    tales and historians much valuable information upon many difficult points of
                    Greek history and life.</p>
