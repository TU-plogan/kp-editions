                <p><label type="entry">THIERRY</label>, the name of two excellent French historians,
                    brothers (Augustin and Amédée), both of whom, though their 1iterary and
                    historical faculty was not quite equal, displayed the same devotion to
                    historical study.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry</hi> (1795-1856), the
                    elder and most gifted, was born at Blois on the 10th May 1795. He had no
                    advantages of birth or fortune, but was greatly distinguished at the Blois
                    grammar school, and entered the École Normale, an establishment which, designed
                    on the best principles to supply France with perfectly equipped teachers, has on
                    the whole done more service to journalism and literature than to pedagogy. He
                    appears to have been very susceptible to personal influences, and was for a time
                    docile to St Simon and afterwards to Comte. But his real bent was towards more
                    solid studies, and, under the impulse of the strong current setting at the time
                    towards mediaeval research, he began, and in 1825 published, his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Norman Conquest of England,</hi> much altered and
                    improved in the later edition of 1840. Two years later he published important
                    <hi rend="italic">Lettres sur</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire de France,</hi> attacking the traditional method of history-writing,
                    and recommending recourse to the original documents. About this time the heavy
                    calamity of blindness threatened him, and by 1830 he had totally lost his sight.
                    His marriage, however, with Julie de Quérengal, a woman of ability, considerably
                    1ightened his misfortune, and about the same time he was elected to the Académie
                    des Inscriptions. He continued to pursue his historical studies, now through
                    other eyes, and in 1834 published <hi rend="italic">Dix</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ans d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Études</hi><hi rend="italic">Historiques,</hi>
                    which was followed by his capital work, the <hi rend="italic">Récits
                    Mérovingiens,</hi> in 1840. His later years were chiefly occupied in the study
                    of the history of the Tiers État, which bore fruit in more than one publication.
                    He died at Paris on May 22, 1856.</p>
                <p>The duller school of picturesque Dryasdusts (a rather miraculous combination) who
                    have profited by Thierry’s labours and continued his work have sometimes charged
                    both him and his brother with having entered on history with their minds full of
                    Walter Scott, and with having subordinated facts to graphic presentation. The
                    charge is entirely unjust, and is generally found in the mouths of those who are
                    particularly ill qualified to make it, inasmuch as they owe Thierry nearly
                    everything in style. By others he is described as the founder of the picturesque
                    school, and in this capacity, no doubt, he has much to answer for. His own work,
                    however, is of a very high and remarkable character. He had hardly any
                    forerunners, unless Gibbon may be counted as one, and his freedom from the
                    besetting sin of his own school—the subordination of sober history to
                    picturesque description and romantic narrative—is best seen by comparing him
                    with his contemporary Barante, who, however, is himself not to be named
                    otherwise than <hi rend="italic">honoris eαusα.</hi></p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Amédée Simon Dominique Thierry</hi> (1797-1873) was the
                    younger brother of Augustin, and was born on the 2d August 1797. He began life
                    as a journalist (after an essay, like his brother, at schoolmastering), was
                    connected with the famous romantic harbinger the <hi rend="italic">Globe,</hi>
                    and obtained a small Government clerkship. His first book was a brief history of
                    Guienne in 1825, and three years later appeared the <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    des Gaulois,</hi> which was received with much favour, and obtained him, from
                    the royalist premier Martignac, a history professorship at Besançon. He was,
                    however, thought too liberal for the Government of Charles X., and his lectures
                    were stopped, with the result of securing him, after the revolution, the
                    important post of prefect of the Haute-Saône, which he held eight years. During
                    this time he published nothing. In 1838 he was transferred to the council of
                    state as master of requests, which post he held through the revolution of 1848
                    and the <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> till 1860, when he was made senator—a
                    paid office, it must be remembered, and, in effect, a lucrative sinecure. He
                    also passed through all the ranks of the Legion of Honour, became a member of
                    the Académie des Inscriptions in 1841, and in 1862 received the honorary degree
                    of D.C.L. at Oxford. He had, except during the time of his prefecture, never
                    intermitted his literary work, being a constant contributor to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes,</hi> his articles (usually worked up
                    afterwards into books) almost all dealing with Roman Gaul and its period. The
                    chief were the <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Attila</hi> (1856),
                    frequently reprinted, the <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la Gaule</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sous l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Administration Romaine</hi>
                    (1840-2), a <hi rend="italic">Tableau de VEmpire Romain,</hi> and, in imitation
                    of his brother, certain <hi rend="italic">Récits</hi> of Roman history, a book
                    on St Jerome in 1867, and one on <hi rend="italic">Chrysostom and Eudoxia</hi>
                    in 1873. He died March 27, 1873.</p>
                <p>His literary and historical genius was perhaps inferior to his brother’s, and he
                    exhibits more of the defects of the anecdotic method of writing history, but he
                    shared Augustin’s passion for going to the fountainhead and for animating
                    the'dry bones of mere chronicles and mere academic discussions with accounts of
                    the life of peoples.</p>
