                <p><label type="entry">THESPIAe</label>, an ancient Greek city of Bceotia. It stood
                    on level ground commanded by the low range of hills which runs eastward from the
                    foot of Mount Helicon to Thebes. In the Persian invasion the Thespian contingent
                    of 700 men voluntarily stayed with the Spartans at Thermopylae, and shared their
                    fate. For its resistance to the Persians, the city was burned by Xerxes (480
                    B.C.). Nevertheless, in the next year 1800 Thespians shared in the great victory
                    of Plataea. At the battle of Delium (424) the flower of the Thespians fell
                    fighting against Athens on the side of Thebes, and in the following year the
                    jealous Thebans availed themselves of the weakness of their gallant confederate
                    to pull down the walls of Thespiae. The walls were restored by the Spartans
                    under Agesilaus in 378, but were again destroyed by the Thebans, apparently
                    before the battle of Leuctra (371).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Xenophon <hi rend="italic">(Hellen.,</hi> vi. 3. 1 and 5)
                    and Diodorus (xv. 46) speak of Thespiae as if it had been destroyed and its
                    inhabitants driven away before the battle of Leuctra; but, as the Thespian
                    troops were present with the Thebans immediately before the battle (Paus., ix.
                    13, 8), it would seem that only the walls, not the city itself, had been
                    previously destroyed. See Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of Greece,</hi> ix. p.
                    379.</p></note> After the battle the Thespians, who had taken no part in it,
                    withdrew to a strong place, Ceressus, from which, however, they were expelled by
                    the Thebans. In 343 the city was not yet restored; but it must have been
                    subsequently, for it is mentioned in the Roman wars.</p>
                <p>In the 2d century Pausanias mentions that Thespiae contained a theatre, a
                    market-place <hi rend="italic">(agora),</hi> and sanctuaries of Aphrodite, the
                    Muses, and Hercules. Love (Eros) was the deity most venerated by the Thespians;
                    they possessed a very ancient image of him in the shape of an unhewn block of
                    stone. The marble statue of Love by Praxiteles was the great sight at Thespiae,
                    and drew crowds to the place. It was carried off to Rome by Caligula, restored
                    by Claudius, and again carried off by Nero. There was also a bronze statue of
                    Love by Lysippus. From an inscription we learn that one of the deities
                    worshipped was Demeter Achea, the “Mater Dolorosa.” The Thespians also
                    worshipped the Muses, and celebrated a festival in their honour in the sacred
                    grove on Mount Helicon. Remains of what was probably the ancient citadel are
                    still to be seen, consisting of an oblong or oval line of fortification, solidly
                    and regularly built. The adjacent ground to the east and south is covered with
                    foundations, bearing witness to the extent of the ancient city. The neighbouring
                    village Eremo-kastro, on higher ground, was thought by Ulrichs to be probably
                    the site of the ancient Ceressus. In 1882 there were discovered, about 1200
                    yards east of Eremokastro, on the road to Arkopodi (Leuctra), the remains of a
                    <hi rend="italic">polyandrion,</hi> including a colossal stone lion. The tomb
                    dates from the 5th century B. c., and is probably that of the Thespians who fell
                    at Plataea, for those who fell at Thermopylae were buried on the field.</p>
