                <p><label type="entry">TOLL</label> is a sum of money paid for the use and enjoyment
                    of a privilege. In England it is now always or almost always a sum of money; but
                    formerly tolls in kind were not unknown. An instance is afforded by the Act of
                    36 Geo. III. c. 85, substituting a money payment for tolls of corn in kind taken
                    by millers, with an exception in favour of tolls taken by custom in soke mills.
                    Such customary tolls, if any such now exist, are apparently the only examples
                    remaining of tolls in kind. The Weights and Measures Act, 1878, enacts that all
                    tolls are to be charged and collected according to imperial weights and
                    measures.</p>
                <p>The word toll, in its earliest use, appears to have signified a franchise enjoyed
                    by lords of manors, and is defined by Glanvill as the liberty of buying and
                    selling in one’s own land: “tol, quod nos vocamus theloneum, scilicet libertatem
                    emendi et vendendi in terra sua.” The word then became used to denote duties
                    payable to the crown, especially on wool, generally with an inseparable epithet
                    indicative of unpopularity. It thus took the form of “maletote’’ or “malum
                    tolnetum,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The same term
                    was known in mediaeval Italy. Dante, in <hi rend="italic">Inferno,</hi> xi. 36.
                    alludes to “toilette dannose.”</p></note> against which many early statutes were
                    directed, from the Magna Carta of John till the final abandonment of the duty by
                    Edward III. In modern English law toll is either an incident of a <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Franchise</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.υ.),</hi> as of a market or
                    fair, or is independent of franchise. In the latter case it is claimed by
                    prescription, as toll traverse or toll thorough, or is created by Act of
                    Parliament, as in the case of turnpikes, railways, harbours, navigable rivers,
                    and canals. Toll traverse is paid for passing over a private way, bridge, or
                    ferry. No consideration need be proved. Toll thorough is paid for the use of a
                    highway. In this case, if charged by a private person, some consideration, such
                    as repair of the highway, must be shown, as such a toll is against common right.
                    In one case, that of the Cornish custom of tin-bounding, the right to tin tolls
                    may depend upon custom. At common law a toll must be reasonable. The same
                    principle appears in various Acts of Parliament. The Statute of Westminster the
                    First, 3 Edw. I. c. 31, inflicts a penalty for taking excessive toll. The
                    Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and most special Acts of railway
                    companies provide, by what are known as “the Shaftesbury clauses,” for the
                    equality of tolls, that is, that all persons and classes of goods shall under
                    like circumstances be treated alike as to charges. A right of distress is
                    incident to the right to impose tolls, but the distress cannot be sold unless an
                    Act of Parliament expressly authorizes the sale. Tolls are rateable for the
                    relief of the poor where they are appurtenant to land, but not where they are
                    extrinsic profits not arising from the possession of land. Exemption from tolls
                    may be claimed by the prerogative, by grant or prescription, or by Act of
                    Parliament. The king pays no toll, and may grant to another exemption from toll.
                    The exemptions by Act of Parliament mainly affect persons in the public service,
                    clergy on their parochial duty, and persons going to or returning from their
                    usual place of religious worship. Most of the exceptions from turnpike tolls
                    will be found in 3 Geo. IV. c. 126. Turnpike tolls, bridge money, and causeway
                    mail were abolished in Scotland by the Roads and Bridges Act, 1878, as from the
                    1st June 1883. In England there has been no such general abolition, but the
                    abolition of tolls has been facilitated by several recent Turnpike Acts, and
                    their entire disappearance is only a question of time.</p>

                    Congress have dealt with tolls in rivers and harbours (see Revised Statutes,

                <p>The question of tolls was at one time an important one in international law.
                    Tolls were exacted on certain straits and tidal rivers by virtue of the
                    sovereignty of a particular state. Such tolls have mostly ceased or been
                    redeemed. Notable instances were the Scheldt tolls and the Sound dues levied by
                    Denmark. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Navigation Laws.</hi></p>
