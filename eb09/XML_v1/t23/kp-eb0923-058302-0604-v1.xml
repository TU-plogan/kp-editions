                    Linnaeus being its type. But, since doubts exist as to whether this is that
                    which was subsequently called by Vieillot <hi rend="italic">T. collaris</hi> or
                    the <hi rend="italic">T. melanurus</hi> of Swainson, though evidence is in
                    favour of the former (<hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Cabanis, <hi rend="italic">Mus.
                    Heineanum,</hi> iv. p. 177, and Finsch, <hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool.
                    Society,</hi> 1870, p. 559), several recent writers have dropped the Linnaean
                    specific term.</p>
                <p>The Trogons are birds of moderate size: the smallest is hardly bigger than a
                    Thrush and the largest less bulky than a Crow. In most of them the bill is very
                    wide at the gape, which is invariably beset by recurved bristles. They seize
                    most of their food, whether caterpillars or fruits, on the wing, though their
                    alar power is not exceptionally great, their flight being described as short,
                    rapid, and spasmodic. Their feet are weak and of a unique structure, the second
                    toe, which in most birds is the inner anterior one, being reverted, and thus the
                    Trogons stand alone, since in all other birds that have two toes before and two
                    behind it is the outer toe that is turned backward. The plumage is very
                    remarkable and characteristic. There is not a species which has not beauty
                    beyond most birds, and the glory of the group culminates in the <hi

                    with one another in vivid coloration, or contrasted, as happens in many species,
                    with a warm tawny or a sombre slaty <hi rend="italic">grey—</hi> to say nothing
                    of the delicate freckling of black and white, as minute as the markings of a
                    moth’s wing—the whole set off by bands of white, producing an effect hardly
                    equalled in any group. It is impossible within brief space to describe its
                    glowing tints; but the plumage is further remarkable for the large size of its
                    contour-feathers, which are extremely soft and so loosely seated as to come off
                    in scores at a touch, and there is no down. The tail is generally a very
                    characteristic feature, the rectrices, though in some cases pointed, being often
                    curiously squared at the tip, and when this is the case they are usually barred
                    ladderlike with white and black.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    lateral pointed ends diverge in a way almost unique among birds.</p></note>
                    According to Gould, they are larger and more pointed in the young than in the
                    old, and grow squarer and have the white bands narrower at each succeeding
                    moult. He also asserts that in the species which have the wing-coverts freckled,
                    the freckling becomes finer with age. So far as has been observed, the
                    nidification of these birds is in holes of trees, wherein are laid without any
                    bedding two roundish eggs, generally white, but certainly in one species
                    (Quezal) tinted with bluish green.</p>
                <p>The Trogons form a very well-marked Family, belonging to the multifarious group
                    treated in the present series of articles as <hi rend="italic">Picariae·,</hi>
                    but, instead of being (so far as is known) like all the rest of them and, as
                    Prof. Huxley believed, “desmognathous,” they have been shown by W. A. Forbes
                    (<hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1881, p. 836) to be “schizognathous
                    ”—thus demonstrating, in the words of the latter, “that the structure of the
                    palate has not that unique and peculiar significance that has been claimed for
                    it in the classification of birds.” Perhaps the explanation of this anomaly may
                    lie in the fact that the Trogons are a very old form. The remains of one, <hi
                    rend="italic">T. gallicus,</hi> have been recognized by Prof. A. Milne-Edwards
                    (<hi rend="italic">Ois. foss. de la France,</hi> ii. p. 395, pl. 177, figs.
                    18-22) from the Miocene of the Allier, and it may not be too much to suppose
                    that the schizognathous structure was more ancient than the desmognathous. Again
                    too this fortunate discovery of that eminent palaeontologist seems to account
                    for the remarkable distribution of the Trogons at the present day. While they
                    chiefly abound, and have developed their climax of magnificence, in the tropical
                    parts of the New World, they yet occur in the tropical parts of the Old. The
                    species now inhabiting Africa, forming the group <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hapaloderma,</hi> can hardly be separated generically from those of the
                    Neotropical <hi rend="italic">Trogon,</hi> and the difference between the
                    Asiatic forms, if somewhat greater, is still comparatively slight. It is plain
                    then that the Trogons are an exceptionally persistent type; indeed in the whole
                    Class few similar instances occur and perhaps none that can be called parallel.
                    The extreme development of the type in the New World just noticed also furnishes
                    another hint. While in some of the American Trogons (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Pharomacrus,</hi> for instance) the plumage of the females is not very much
                    less beautiful than that of the males, there are others in which the hen birds
                    retain what may be fairly deemed a more ancient livery, while the cocks flaunt
                    in brilliant attire. Now the plumage of both sexes in all but one<note

                    rend="italic">Η. macloti</hi> be more than a local form of <hi rend="italic">H.

                    >Harpactes,</hi> resembles rather that of the young and of those females of the
                    American species which are modestly clothed. The inference from this fact would
                    seem to be that the general coloration of the Trogons prior to the
                    establishment, by geographical estrangement, of the two types was a russet
                    similar to that now worn by the adults of both sexes in the Indian region, and
                    by a portion only of the females in the Neotropical. The Ethiopian type, as
                    already said, very closely agrees with the American, and therefore would be
                    likely to have been longer in connexion therewith. Again, while the adults of
                    most of the American Trogons <hi rend="italic">{Pharomacrus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Euptilotis</hi> excepted) have the edges of the bill serrated,
                    their young have them smooth or only with a single notch on either side near the
                    tip, and this is observable in the Asiatic Trogons at all ages. At the same time
                    the most distinctive features of the whole group, which are easily taken in at a
                    glance, but are difficult to express briefly in words, are equally possessed by
                    both branches of the Family, showing that they were in all likelihood—for the
                    possibility that the peculiarities may have been evolved apart is not to be
                    overlooked—reached before the geographical sundering of these branches (whereby
                    they are now placed on opposite sides of the globe) was effected.</p>
                <p>It remains to say that about sixty species of Trogons are recognized, which Gould
                    in the second edition of his <hi rend="italic">Monograph</hi> of the Family
                    (1875) divides into seven genera; but their characters are hardly laid down. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pharomacrus, Euptilotis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trogon</hi>
                    inhabit the mainland of tropical</p>
                <p>America, no species passing to the northward of the Rio Grande nor southward of
                    the forest district of Brazil, while none occur on the west coast of Peru or
                    Chili. <hi rend="italic">Prionotelus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tmetotrogon,</hi> each with one species, are peculiar respectively to Cuba and
                    Hispaniola. The African form <hi rend="italic">Hapaloderma</hi> has two species,
                    one found only on the west coast, the other of more general range. The Asiatic
                    Trogons, <hi rend="italic">Harpactes</hi> (with eleven species according to the
                    same authority), occur from Nepal to Malacca, in Ceylon, and in Sumatra, Java,
                    and Borneo, while one species is peculiar to some of the Philippine Islands. <hi
