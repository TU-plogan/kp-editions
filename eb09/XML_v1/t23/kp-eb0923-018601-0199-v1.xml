                    oblast'),</hi> a Russian government of Caucasia, situated to the north of the
                    main Caucasus chain. It is bounded by Stavropol on the N., by the Caspian Sea
                    and Daghestan on the E., by Tiflis and Kutais on the S., and by Tchernomorsk and
                    Kuban on the W. It has an area of 23,548 square miles. From Mt Elburz to Kazbek
                    the southern boundary coincides with the main snow-covered range of the Caucasus
                    and thus includes its highest peaks; further east it follows a sinuous line so
                    as to embrace the secondary chains and their ramifications. Nearly one-third of
                    the area is occupied by hilly tracts, the remainder being undulating and flat
                    land belonging to the depression of the Terek; one-half of this last, on the
                    left bank of the river, is occupied by sandy deserts, salt clay steppes, and
                    arid stretches unsuited for cultivation. Granites, syenites, diorites, and
                    Palaeozoic schists constitute the nucleus of the Caucasus mountains; Jurassic
                    and Cretaceous formations rise to great heights in the secondary chains; and a
                    series of Tertiary formations, covered by Quaternary deposits, cover a wide area
                    in the prairies and steppes. A group of mineral springs occurs about <hi

                    69°), but frosts a few degrees below zero are not uncommon. The mountain slopes
                    receive an abundance of rain (37 in.), but the steppes suffer much from drought
                    (rainfall between 10 and 20 in.). Nearly the whole of the government belongs to
                    the drainage area of the Terek, but the north-west corner is watered by the
                    upper tributaries of the Kuma. The Terek rises at the height of about 8000 feet
                    in the glaciers of the Kazbek on the southern slope of the main chain of the
                    Caucasus, which it pierces by the Darial gorge to the south of Vtadikavkaz after
                    having received several <hi rend="italic">dons</hi> or streams (Res, Guzel,
                    Fiag, Ar). In 53 miles it descends nearly 6000 feet. A few miles above
                    Vtadikavkaz it is 2068 feet above sea-level, at Mozdok 441 feet, and it is 29
                    feet below the Black Sea at Kizlyar. From Vtadikavkaz it pursues a
                    north-easterly direction before taking its eastward course; it seems most
                    probable that at a recent epoch (Post-Pliocene) it joined the Kuma and perhaps
                    the Manytch instead of flowing into the Caspian. In the lower part of its course
                    it flows at a higher level than that of the neighbouring plains, and is kept in
                    its bed by dams. Inundations are frequent and cause great destruction. The delta
                    begins at Dubovka (50 miles from the Caspian), and at this part the river
                    frequently changes its bed. The Old Terek is no longer navigable, the chief
                    current being directed northwards into the New Terek. Several canals made by the
                    Cossacks supply water for the irrigation of the neighbouring fields. Its chief
                    tributaries are the Sunja on the right, and the Tcherekh, the Baksan, and the
                    Malka, in its upper course, on the left. The population of the government in
                    1884 was 615,660; of 606,500 inhabitants returned in 1883, 238,230 were Little
                    and Great Russians, 1230 Georgians, 18,500 Armenians, 4300 Germans, 2570 Poles,
                    4780 Jews, 23,630 Ossets, 194,480 Tchetchens and Ingushis, 72,160 Kabardians,
                    9130 mountaineers of the Avarian stem, 25,360 Kumyks, 1770 Tatars, 6270 Nogais,
                    2470 Kalmucks, and 1620 Persians. Out of these 239,500 were reckoned as
                    belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church, 336,460 were Mussulmans, 17,730
                    Gregorian Armenians, and the remainder Protestants, Catholics, and Jews. Owing
                    to the great fertility of the soil in the well-watered districts, agriculture is
                    the chief occupation. In 1882 the crops, although below the average, yielded
                    967,000 quarters of corn, 268,000 bushels of potatoes, 6,750,000 gallons of
                    wine, and tobacco to the value of £18,000. Cattle breeding is extensively
                    carried on in the steppes, and there were in the same year 118,630 horses,
                    582,800 cattle, and 1,226,400 sheep; murrains, however, are frequent, and cause
                    great loss. Manufactures occupy only 3371 persons, and their yearly production
                    hardly reaches £300,000 in value. Petty trades are rapidly spreading in the
                    villages. Trade suffers from want of good roads. The railway from Russia to the
                    Caucasus has not yet (1887) got beyond Vtadikavkaz. The military and other chief
                    roads have an aggregate of only 1300 miles. The exports are limited to corn,
                    wine, cattle, and some raw produce.</p>
                <p>The government is divided into six districts, the chief towns of which, with
                    their populations in 1883, were Vtadikavkaz (32,340), the capital, Georgievsk
                    (4250), Groznyï (6280), Kizlyar (8780), Mozdok (8380), and Pyatigorsk
                    (11,120).</p>
