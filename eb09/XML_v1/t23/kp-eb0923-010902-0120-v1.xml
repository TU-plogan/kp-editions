                <p><label type="entry">TEGEA</label>, one of the chief cities of Arcadia, of which
                    its territory occupied the south-eastern corner, being bounded on the S. by
                    Laconia, on the E. by Cynuria and Argolis, on the N. by the territory of
                    Mantinea, and on the W. by Maenalia. Its legendary founder was Tegeates, son of
                    Lycaon. Like many other cities of ancient Greece, Tegea was formed by the union
                    of a population which had previously lived dispersed in villages. The people
                    were divided into four tribes,—4he Clareotis, Hippothoetis, Apolloniatis, and
                    Athaneatis. Tegea offered a stubborn <pb break="no"

                    and on more than one occasion defeated its ambitious neighbour. About 560 B.c.,
                    however, the Lacedaemonians found the bones of Orestes in Tegea and conveyed
                    them to Sparta; and henceforward Spartan valour, backed by this powerful fetich,
                    proved too much for the merely carnal weapons of Tegea. At Plataea (479 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> 3000 Tegeans fought the good fight of freedom, and
                    were the first to enter the breach which the Athenians had made in the Persian
                    redoubt. Between the Persian and Peloponnesian Wars hostilities again broke out
                    between Tegea and Sparta, in the course of which Tegea was twice defeated.
                    However, in the Peloponnesian War (431-404), and afterwards in the Corinthian
                    War (395-387), Tegea sided with Sparta. But after the battle of Leuctra (371),
                    when the star of Sparta began to decline, Tegea concluded an alliance with the
                    victorious Thebans, and fought on their side against Sparta at the great battle
                    of Mantinea (362). In the Macedonian period Tegea joined the Aetolian League,
                    but Cleomenes, king of Sparta, having won it over to his side, the city was
                    besieged and taken by Antigonus Dosυn, king of Macedonia, the ally of the
                    Achaean League (222). In 218 the city was retaken, except the acropolis, by the
                    Lacedaemonians under Lycurgus. After the defeat of Machanidas, tyrant of Sparta,
                    by Philopoemen in 207, Tegea passed into the hands of the Achaean League. In the
                    time of Strabo it was the only town of any importance in Arcadia. In the 2d
                    century it was visited by Pausanias, who has left a fairly full description of
                    it (viii. 45-53).</p>
                <p>Of its buildings much the most famous was the great temple of Athene Aiea, which
                    had often afforded sanctuary to fugitives from Sparta. The old temple was burned
                    down in 394 B.c., and Pausanius speaks of the newer temple as by far the finest
                    and largest in the Peloponnesus (that of Zeus at Olympia, however, occupied
                    nearly double the area). The architect was Scopas; and, as the recent German
                    excavations have proved, the temple was a Doric peripteros, with six columns at
                    each end and fourteen at each side. Of the columns which Pausanias mentions in
                    addition to the Doric, the Corinthian may have stood in the pronaos and
                    posticum, the Ionic in “the interior of the temple” (for ∈κτ&lt;5s we should
                    probably read <hi rend="italic">trτos</hi> in Pausanius, viii. 45, 5). The
                    ancient image of Athene Aiea was carried off by Augustus, and placed at the
                    entrance to his new forum at Rome. The statues of Aesculapius and Health, which
                    in Pausanias’s time stood on the two sides of the image of the goddess at Tegea,
                    were by Scopas. On the front pediment of the temple was sculptured the hunt of
                    the Calydonian boar, on the back pediment the combat between Telephus and
                    Achilles. Some fragments of these pedimental sculptures (comprising the head of
                    the boar and two human heads, one helmeted) have been discovered; and, as they
                    are the only existing sculptures which can be referred with some certainty to
                    the hand of Scopas himself, they are of the highest importance for the history
                    of art. The site of the temple, at the modern village of Piali, was partially
                    excavated under the auspices of the German archaeological institute in 1879 and
                    1882. It appears that the foundations of the temple measured 49’90 metres
                    (nearly 164 feet) by 21 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 30 (70 feet). As Tegea
                    stood on a plain surrounded by mountains and liable to inundations, its site has
                    been covered by an alluvial soil which has been favourable to the preservation
                    of the ruins, and a thorough excavation might yield important results.</p>
