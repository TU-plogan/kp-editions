                <p><label type="entry">TOURNEUR, <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyril</hi></label>, a tragic
                    poet of the first order, has left no record of his existence beyond the
                    respective dates of his first and last extant works (1600-1613). An allegorical
                    poem, worthless as art and incomprehensible as allegory, is the earliest of
                    these; an elegy on the death of Prince Henry, son of James L, is the latest. The
                    two plays on which his fame rests, and on which it will rest for ever, were
                    published respectively in 1607 and 1611, but all students have agreed to accept
                    the internal evidence which assures us that the later in date of publication
                    must be the earlier in date of composition. His only other known work is an
                    epicede on Sir Francis Vere, of no great merit as poetry, but of some value as
                    conveying in a straightforward and masculine style the poet’s ideal conception
                    of a perfect knight or “happy warrior,” comparable by those who may think fit to
                    compare it with the more nobly realized ideals of Chaucer and of Wordsworth. But
                    if Tourneur had left on record no more memorable evidence of his powers than
                    might be supplied by the survival of his elegies, he could certainly have
                    claimed no higher place among English writers than is now occupied by the Rev.
                    Charles Fitzgeoffrey, whose voluminous and fervent elegy on Sir Francis Drake is
                    indeed of more actual value, historic or poetic, than either or than both of
                    Tourneur’s elegiac rhapsodies. The singular power, the singular originality, and
                    the singular limitation of his genius are all equally obvious in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Atheist’s Tragedy,</hi> a dramatic poem no less crude and
                    puerile and violent in action and evolution than simple and noble and natural in
                    expression and in style. The executive faculty of the author is in the metrical
                    parts of his first play so imperfect as to suggest either incompetence or
                    perversity in the workman; in <hi rend="italic">The Revenger’s Tragedy</hi> it
                    is so magnificent, so simple, impeccable, and sublime, that the finest passages
                    of this play can be compared only with the noblest examples of tragic dialogue
                    or monologue now extant in English or in Greek. There is no trace of imitation
                    or derivation from an alien source in the genius of this poet. The first editor
                    of Webster has observed how often he imitates Shakespeare; and, in fact,
                    essentially and radically independent as is Webster’s genius also, the sovereign
                    influence of his master may be traced not only in the general tone of his style,
                    the general scheme of his composition, but now and then in a direct and never an
                    unworthy or imperfect echo of Shakespeare’s very phrase and accent. But the
                    resemblance between the tragic verse of Tourneur <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0510-0491"/> and the tragic verse of Shakespeare is simply
                    such as proves the natural affinity between two great dramatic poets, whose
                    inspiration partakes now and then of the quality more proper to epic or to lyric
                    poetry. The fiery impulse, the rolling music, the vivid illustration of thought
                    by jets of insuppressible passion, the perpetual sustenance of passion by the
                    implacable persistency of thought, which we recognize as the dominant and
                    distinctive qualities of such poetry as finds vent in the utterances of Hamlet
                    or of Timon, we recognize also in the scarcely less magnificent poetry, the
                    scarcely less fiery sarcasm, with which Tourneur has informed the part of
                    Vindice—a harder-headed Hamlet, a saner and more practically savage and serious
                    Timon. He was a satirist as passionate as Juvenal or Swift, but with a finer
                    faith in goodness, a purer hope in its ultimate security of triumph. This
                    fervent constancy of spirit relieves the lurid gloom and widens the limited
                    range of a tragic imagination which otherwise might be felt as oppressive rather
                    than inspiriting. His grim and trenchant humour is as peculiar in its sardonic
                    passion as his eloquence is original in the strenuous music of its cadences, in
                    the roll of its rhythmic thunder. As a playwright, his method was almost crude
                    and rude in the headlong straightforwardness of its energetic simplicity; as an
                    artist in character, his interest was intense but narrow, his power magnificent
                    but confined; as a dramatic poet, the force of his genius is great enough to
                    ensure him an enduring place among the foremost of the followers of Shakespeare.
