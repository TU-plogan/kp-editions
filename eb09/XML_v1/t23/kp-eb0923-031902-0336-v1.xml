                <p><label type="entry">THRASYBULUS</label>, an Athenian who played a distinguished
                    part in the latter years of the Peloponnesian War and in the restoration of the
                    democracy at Athens. In 411 B.c., as an officer in the Athenian armament at
                    Samos, he energetically opposed the oligarchical conspiracy of the Four Hundred,
                    and was mainly instrumental in keeping the fleet and army loyal to the democracy
                    and in procuring the recall of the banished Alcibiades. At the battle of
                    Cynnosema, in the same year, he commanded the right wing of the Athenian fleet,
                    and to his valour and conduct the Athenian victory was largely due. He took an
                    active part in the naval operations of the following years, being present at the
                    victories of Cyzicus (410) and Arginusae (406). In 407 he commanded a squadron
                    on the Thracian coast, where he reduced places which had gone over to the
                    Lacedaemonians. When the infamous Thirty Tyrants were at the height of their
                    power in Athens, Thrasybulus, who as a democrat had been banished, marched from
                    Thebes with about seventy men, with the connivance of Thebes, and established
                    himself at Phyle, a strong place in the rear of Athens. There he repulsed an
                    attack directed against him by the Thirty; his numbers increased, and, after
                    surprising and routing a body of foot and horse, he seized Piraeus, the port of
                    Athens, but, finding the circuit of the walls too great to be defended by his
                    small force, he retired into the adjoining Munychia. Here he was attacked by the
                    troops of the Thirty, but in the streetfighting the democrats had the best of
                    it, and the Thirty were in consequence deposed and retired to Eleusis.
                    Hostilities, however, continued until Pausanias, one of the kings of Sparta,
                    intervened, and by force and craft effected a reconciliation. The democrats
                    marched into Athens with all the pomp of war, and sacrificed to Athene on the
                    Acropolis. This restoration of the democracy by Thrasybulus ranked henceforward
                    with the memorable deeds of Athenian history. To his counsels seems due in part
                    the credit for the wise moderation with which the democrats used their victory,
                    and the inviolate good faith with which they observed the political amnesty. The
                    grateful citizens rewarded their champion with an olive crown. In 395, when
                    Thebes was threatened by Sparta, the Athenians, stimulated by Thrasybulus,
                    repaid the friendly shelter which the Thebans had afforded them in exile by
                    resolving to stand by Thebes against Sparta, and by actually sending a force
                    under Thrasybulus to her aid. In 390, while the war known as the Corinthian was
                    still dragging on, Thrasybulus was sent with a fleet to check the growing power
                    of Sparta in the Aegean. He substituted a democracy for an oligarchy at
                    Byzantium, and won the friendship of Chalcedon; then, landing in Lesbos, he
                    defeated a joint force of Lacedaemonians and Lesbians. In the following spring
                    he prepared to assist Rhodes, which was threatened by the Lacedaemonians; but to
                    recruit his forces he levied contributions from various cities. At Aspendus, in
                    Pamphylia, an outrage committed by some of his men roused the anger of the
                    people, who fell on him by night, and slew him in his tent. He was buried at
                    Athens, in the Ceramicus, near the graves of Pericles and Phormio.</p>
