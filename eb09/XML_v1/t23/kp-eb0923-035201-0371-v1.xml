                    (1791-1871), historian of Spanish literature, was born at Boston (Mass.), on 1st
                    August 1791. He received his early education from his father, Elisha Ticknor,
                    who, though at that time in business, had been principal of the local Franklin
                    public school and was the originator both of the system of free primary schools
                    in Boston and of the first New England savings-bank. He studied at Dartmouth
                    College from 1805 to 1807, and on leaving it was placed for nearly three years
                    under Dr Gardiner, a pupil of Dr Parr. In the autumn of 1810 Ticknor entered the
                    office of a leading Massachusetts lawyer, and, though his studies appear to have
                    been literary rather than legal, he was admitted to the bar in 1813. He at once
                    commenced practice; but a year’s experiment convinced him that scholarship and
                    letters would be more congenial to his abilities. In the spring of 1815 he set
                    sail for England. Attractive in appearance, cultured, vivacious, and
                    sympathetic, he had won many influential friends in America, and his
                    introductions gave him access to most of the men then worth knowing in Europe.
                    He spent nearly two years at Göttingen; but he also visited the chief towns on
                    the Continent, meeting Prescott for the first time at Paris, and spending some
                    months in Spain and Portugal, the life and literatures of which had already
                    strong attractions for him. Returning to America in the summer of 1819, he was
                    inducted in the August following to the Smith professorship of French and
                    Spanish literature and to the college professorship of belles-lettres at
                    Harvard. The history and criticism of Spanish literature was in many respects a
                    new subject at that time even in Europe, —the Spaniards themselves having no
                    adequate treatment of their literature as a whole, and both Bouterwek and
                    Sismondi having worked with scanty or second-hand resources. To supply this
                    want, therefore, he gave his most serious thought, developing in his lectures
                    the scheme of his more permanent work. In June 1821 his father died, and in
                    September he married Anna, daughter of Samuel Eliot, a merchant and founder of
                    the chair of Greek literature at Harvard College. In the years following 1821
                    Ticknor made a vain effort to introduce measures of university reform. The death
                    of his only son in 1834 and the subsequent failure of his wife’s health led him
                    to resign his post at Cambridge to Longfellow; and in the spring of 1835 he
                    again went to Europe, where he remained until 1838. From that time till his
                    death he lived chiefly at Boston. Till 1849 he published only occasional reviews
                    and papers, such as his essays on Moore’s <hi rend="italic">Anacreon,</hi> on
                    Milton’s <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> and on Thatcher’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Sermons,</hi> in 1812; on Michael Stiefel, in 1816; on Griscom’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Tour in Europe</hi> and on General La Fayette, in 1824; on
                    amusements in Spain and on changes in Harvard College, in 1825; on
                    Chateaubriand, in 1827; on Daniel Webster, in 1831; and on the best mode of
                    teaching living languages, in 1832. His <hi rend="italic">History of Spanish
                    Literature,</hi> the first editions of which appeared in New York and London in
                    1849, was welcomed on all hands as the standard work on the subject, and was
                    rapidly translated into Spanish and other Continental languages. Whatever its
                    defects, it at least reduced to system and clearness a large mass of varied
                    historical material hitherto only vaguely known; and its copious references to
                    authorities and editions and its loving exploration of the byeways of the
                    literature made it as valuable to scholars as its direct and unpretentious style
                    made it popular with general readers. In many respects it was the admirable
                    literary complement of the historical work of Prescott. Like his, the bent of
                    Ticknor’s mind was expository rather than critical; and in both cases the
                    standards applied were of a conventional rather than of an advanced nature. As
                    with Prescott the glow of vivid narration often hides rather than reveals the
                    underlying problems of social and philosophic import, so with Ticknor a certain
                    fund of graceful and genial commonplace is apt to gloss over the really vital
                    critical issues of the subject-matter. At crucial moments in place of the keener
                    edge of criticism one is apt to find only the paper-knife intelligence of the
                    ordinary book-lover. The defect, however, was common to the critical schools of
                    the time. The merits of the work in its accurate survey of comparatively
                    untrodden ground were individual and of an exceedingly high order. Ticknor
                    subsequently took an active part in the establishment of the Boston public
                    library, in the interests of which he paid in 1856 another visit to Europe, and
                    to which he left at his death his fine collection of Spanish and Portuguese
                    works. In 1859, on the death of Prescott, he at once began to collect materials
                    for a life of his friend, which was published in 1864. His death took place at
                    Boston on 26th January 1871.</p>
