                <p><label type="entry">TELEMETER</label>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Rangefinder.</hi>
                    This is an instrument used in modern warfare to determine the distance or range
                    to an enemy’s position, in order that correct elevations may be given to guns or
                    rifles directed against it. Telemeters have been made on three distinct
                    principles, and classified as acoustic, optical, and trigonometrical
                    respectively.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acoustic telemeters</hi> record the time which elapses between
                    seeing the flash or smoke and hearing the report of a gun, rifle, or shell, the
                    range being given in yards as “the time in seconds × 364’6.” The Boulengé
                    telemeter is the best known of this class. It consists of a graduated glass tube
                    filled with liquid and containing a small metal traveller. At the flash the
                    instrument is brought to a vertical position, and the traveller starts from
                    zero; at the detonation it is turned to a horizontal position and the traveller
                    stops. The objections to the acoustic telemeter are that the rate of
                    transmission of sound in air is affected by wind and other local conditions and
                    that the instrument cannot be used until firing has commenced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Optical</hi> or <hi rend="italic">perspective telemeters</hi>
                    determine the distance to any point by observing the size of some object of
                    known dimensions, as seen in a graduated telescope. Porro’s telemeter, Elliott’s
                    telescope, and Nordenfelt’s macrometer illustrate the principle. The chief
                    defect of the system is that the objects most conveniently observed— men and
                    horses—vary considerably in size, so that the assumption of a constant dimension
                    may be productive of error.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trigonometrical telemeters</hi> shorten the ordinary methods of
                    surveying by adapting them to military purposes. They are of two kinds,—field
                    rangefinders and rangefinders for coast batteries.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Field rangefinders</hi> exist in great variety, and differ
                    from one another both in the trigonometrical methods pursued and in the
                    mechanical peculiarities exhibited. The following are the common solutions of
                    what is technically called “the range-finding triangle,”— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> a triangle in which O (fig. 1) is the object the distance to which
                    is required, AOB an acute angle, and AB the base,—O being visible both from A
                    and B. (i.) "Where the base is a fixed length and the angles are variable.—A
                    fixed base is rarely adopted except when the base forms part of the instrument,
                    the angles being observed by powerful telescopes. The range is usually read in
                    yards by the assistance of verniers, extreme perfection of mechanism being
                    necessary. Many ingenious instruments of the kind have been devised, but none
                    have as yet proved satisfactory. With a fixed base the accuracy diminishes as
                    the range increases, (ii.) Where the base and the angles are variable.—The base
                    angles are generally observed by instruments of the theodolite type, and the
                    base is actually measured or found by means of a sub-base. The range is obtained
                    by table or calculating scale. The Nolan rangefinder, which was the first
                    telemeter used by the British artillery, λvas of this kind, (iii.) Where one
                    base angle is a right angle, the other angles and base being variable.—The
                    instrument used is generally double-reflecting of the sextant type,—the base
                    being found as in (ii.). The most perfect example is the Watkin rangefinder,
                    used <hi rend="smallcaps">Fig.</hi> 2.—Watkin field rangefinder, by the British
                    horse and field artillery. It (fig. 2) consists of an ’ horizon glass capable of
                    assuming two positions, and an index glass set in a steel arm, which is worked
                    by a movable collar on a graduated bar, and this again is moved by the turning
                    of a graduated cylinder. O (fig. 3) being the object, the observer sets up a
                    picket at A, and with the instrument at zero (the horizon glass being inclined
                    45° to the index glass) finds the right angle at the point C. A sub-base AB of 6
                    yards is then set off, and (with glasses set parallel and the sliding collar at
                    6) the observer reflects B upon A by turning the cylinder, which is thus made to
                    record the base AC in yards. This reading being set on the graduated bar by
                    moving the sliding collar, the observer proceeds to A, and from there reflects C
                    upon O, which causes the range to be given in yards on the cylinder. In this
                    operation the position of the sliding collar regulates the movement of the steel
                    bar so that the number of turns of the cylinder is always a true measure of the
                    range OC, whatever the length of the base AC. (iv.) Where the angles are fixed
                    and the base is a measure of the range.— The base points are determined by the
                    use of prisms or of mirrors reflecting the particular angles adopted. The base
                    is measured or found by a subsidiary triangle, and multiplied by a constant to
                    give the range. The Weldon rangefinder, recently issued to the British infantry,
                    is on this principle. It consists of three prisms, and is generally used as
                    follows. O (fig. 4) being the object and D a convenient distant point, the
                    observer makes with the first prism the right angle OAD. He then retires in the
                    direction DA till the second prism records the angle OBD =</p>

                <p>88° 5Γ 15", when the range = 50 × AB. If it is inconvenient to measure AB, the
                    observer can retire from B in the line OB until the third prism records the
                    angle OCA = 74° 53' 15", when the range = 200 × BC. The prisms must be held in
                    the plane of the objects and looked into at the same point. This rangefinder is
                    very simple and portable, but is frequently inapplicable on hilly or broken
                    ground, and does not possess great accuracy.</p>
                <p>The merits of different field rangefinders depend mainly upon the balance of
                    advantages they offer with respect to accuracy, suitability to variety of
                    ground, simplicity, portability, and durability, these conditions being of a
                    more or less conflicting character. The following are recognized principles: —
                    (1) the naked eye cannot with certainty appreciate less than one minute
                    difference of angle, therefore telescopic power is necessary in proportion as
                    the base is short compared with the range; (2) telescopes of high power cannot
                    be steadied by hand alone; (3) the longer the base the more inconvenient are any
                    restrictions as to its length or direction; (4) it is a disadvantage to be
                    compelled to traverse the line joining base points; (5) the longest base which
                    it is convenient to measure by hand is that length of measuring line which can
                    be stretched tight in a high wind.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Rangefinders for Coast Batteries.—</hi> Rangefinding is
                    less adapted to the requirements of coast defence than “position finding,”—a
                    method which furnishes every gun with its proper training and elevation so that
                    it can be fired without sighting the target. Rangefinders are, however,
                    sometimes employed. The most worthy of notice is the Watkin depression
                    rangefinder used by the British artillery in coast batteries. The instrument
                    resembles in principle the Watkin field rangefinder, the height above the
                    sea-level being a vertical base. The range is found by observing the angle of
                    depression to the object. This is done by a powerful cross-wire telescope, which
                    forms part of the instrument. The fastest steamer can be continuously followed,
                    and even the successive grazes of shot and shell can be observed. The instrument
                    is levelled upon a tripod stand. When necessary, it finds its exact height in
                    feet above the water-level in any state of tide by reference to a datum
                    distance, and it records the range in yards automatically on a graduated
                    cylinder. An interesting contrivance combining telemeter and gun-sight,
                    applicable to guns in permanent emplacements over non-tidal waters, has been
                    tried in Italy. By means of a cam the hind-sight of the gun is always maintained
                    in the position necessary to give the proper elevation in firing, so that it
                    only remains to make the sights cover the target. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. w.
