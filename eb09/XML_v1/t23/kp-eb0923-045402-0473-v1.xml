                <p><label type="entry">TORT</label>, as a word of art in the law of England and the
                    United States, is the name of civil wrongs (not being merely breaches of
                    contract) for which there is a remedy by action in courts of common law
                    jurisdiction. It may be said to correspond approximately to the term “delict” in
                    Roman law and the systems derived from it. But this is only a rough
                    approximation. For in English usage tort includes, not only those matters which
                    in Roman law are classed under obligations <hi rend="italic">quasi ex
                    delicto,</hi> but various others which Roman or modern Continental lawyers would
                    refer to the law of ownership or real rights, and not to any such head as
                    “delict.” The truth is that the actual development of tort as a legal genus has
                    been purely historical and to no small extent accidental. Nothing can be learnt,
                    of course, from the word itself. It is merely the French word for “wrong,”
                    specialized into a technical meaning by a process which was completed only in
                    the latter years of the 17th century and the earlier of the 18th.</p>
                <p>The early common law had no theory of obligations in the Roman sense, and hardly
                    any theory of contract. Its remedies were directed either to the restitution of
                    something which the defendant unjustly detained from the plaintiff—were it land,
                    goods, or money—or to the repression of violent wrongdoing. Only the former
                    class of remedies was purely civil; the latter included a penal element of which
                    formal traces remained long after the substance had vanished. A man who
                    trespassed on his neighbour with force and arms offended the king as well as his
                    neighbour, and was liable not only to pay damages to his neighbour but to make a
                    fine to the king. Gradually the category of “force and arms” was held to include
                    all manner of direct injuries to person, land, or goods, though the force might
                    consist in nothing more than the bare setting foot without lawful cause on the
                    soil possessed by one’s neighbour. But this was still a long way from making
                    room for the modern growth of the law of torts. The decisive opening was given
                    by the Statute of Westminster, which enabled actions to be framed “on the case
                    ”— <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">consimili casu,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> that is, allowed legal remedies to be extended by analogy
                    to the forms of action already recognized. Now those forms and their incidents
                    were archaic and inelastic: the procedure was cumbrous, and plaintiffs were
                    liable in many ways to irrational and irreparable discomfiture. The more modern
                    action on the case was free from these drawbacks. Hence it was the aim of
                    ingenious pleaders to extend the action on the case as much as possible; and so
                    successful was this movement that in the 16th century a special form of
                    “trespass on the case” became, under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >assumpsit,</hi> the common and normal method of enforcing contracts not made by
                    deed, and remained so till the middle of the present century. It still holds its
                    place in those American States where the old forms of action have not been
                    abolished. Note that “assumpsit” had become a substantive title of the law, and
                    was consciously referred to its proper genus of contract, before the genus or
                    order of torts was formed. Meanwhile other actions on the case, framed mostly on
                    the analogy of trespass, but partly on that of other generically similar
                    remedies of the old law, were applied to the redress of miscellaneous injuries
                    to person or property which for one and another reason could not be touched, or
                    could not be conveniently dealt with, by the old action of trespass itself. Some
                    of these actions on the case acquired fixed forms of their own and became
                    distinct species; others did not; there remained (and there still remains in
                    theory) an undefined region of possible new actions applying the principles of
                    legal right and duty to new exigencies of fact.</p>
                <p>The extension of forms of remedy grounded on trespass caused those forms which
                    were grounded on restitution to fall into the background, with the curious
                    result that in the modern common law nothing is left answering to the <hi
                    rend="italic">vindicatio</hi> of the Roman law. We have an elaborate law of
                    property, but when it comes to the practical protection of our rights we find
                    that we can recover our property only by complaining of a wrong done to our
                    possession or right to possession. The law puts the actual possessor in the
                    first line, and allows an owner definitely out of possession to sue only for
                    “injury to the reversion,” though an owner who can resume possession at will is
                    indeed more favourably treated. Its remedies are made efficient, but at the cost
                    of straining the theory at various points. Hence many difficulties of detail and
                    much obscurity of principle. The distinction between <hi rend="italic"
                    >dominium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">obligatio</hi> exists, of course, in
                    English law, but it is peculiarly hard for an English lawyer, with the usual
                    unsystematic training, to grasp it with certainty or trace it with accuracy.</p>
                <p>There is also a region of considerable obscurity about the points of contact
                    between contract and tort. The questions thus raised are too technical for
                    discussion here. Since pleadings have ceased to be formal they are much less
                    likely to arise; on the other hand, they are more likely, in the exceptional
                    cases where they may still arise, to be unexpected and baffling.</p>
                <p>For the practical purposes of modern law we may divide torts into three
                    groups,—wrongs of a personal character, wrongs affecting property, and wrongs
                    affecting person and property, either or both. Under the first group come the
                    wrongs of physical violence and restraint, namely, assault and false
                    imprisonment; then the wrong done to men’s good name by libel and slander, in
                    which kind there are sundry curious and not wholly rational distinctions; and we
                    must here rather than elsewhere count deceit, and a somewhat ill-defined class
                    of wrongs of a like nature, of which the generic mark is the necessary presence
                    of a fraudulent intention, or at least reckless disregard of good faith. In one
                    case, that of malicious prosecution, evil motive must be shown; in fact, the
                    much-tormented word “malice” has very nearly its natural and ordinary meaning.
                    So-called slander of title belongs to this class, being in truth a special form
                    of deceit. Wilful interference with the exercise of public or private rights may
                    be an actionable wrong, though the competitive exercise of like rights is none;
                    and it is held, though not without doubt, that procuring a person to break his
                    contract for one’s own advantage (for example, a singer engaged by a rival opera
                    manager, or a specially skilled workman in a rival factory) is on this principle
                    a wrong to the other contracting party.</p>
                <p>With regard to property the broad rule of the common law is that a man meddles
                    with whatever belongs to others at his peril. This has been established and
                    worked out only through a series of intricate formal distinctions. But the
                    result is that, special exceptions excepted, even the most innocent assumption
                    of dominion without a real title makes one liable to the true owner.</p>
                <p>Wrongs of the mixed kind affecting both person and property arise from the use of
                    one’s own property, or the doing of acts lawful in themselves, in a manner
                    inconsistent with the safety and convenience of others. The accustomed heads of
                    such wrongs are nuisance and negligence. Generally some failure in due diligence
                    is involved; but in some cases the law has, on grounds of general policy,
                    imposed an absolute or all but absolute duty of avoiding harmful results. One
                    must do certain things at one’s peril, if at all, though the doing of them is
                    not in itself unlawful; others are done not at one’s peril, and yet under a
                    wider responsibility than <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n474/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0474-0455"/> the common run of lawful acts. It is not wrong to
                    make an artificial reservoir of water on one’s own land; but the landowner who
                    does so must answer for all damage, though no failure in due diligence be shown,
                    if the water escapes by any cause which reasonable human care could possibly
                    have provided against. Again, the occupier of a place of business must keep it
                    in safe repair, for the benefit of customers and others lawfully coming there;
                    and, if harm is done through the want of repair, it is no excuse for him to say
                    that he had engaged an apparently competent person to keep things in order.
                    These are modern principles in the law, and seem to have hardly yet reached
                    their full development. The doctrine of negligence is also mostly modern.
                    Questions of much interest and difficulty are raised by “contributory
                    negligence,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when it is alleged by way of defence
                    that the party complaining suffered wholly or mainly by his own want of care.
                    The true principle appears to be that, if under the circumstances the harm
                    suffered by the plaintiff was the natural and probable consequence of the
                    defendant’s want of care, the defendant is liable,—and this whether the
                    plaintiff, or some third person, has or has not in any degree contributed to the
                    final result by want of care on his own part, or even by a voluntary act,
                    provided that the act be such as might have been foreseen and expected. But if
                    the plaintiff has done something which, though induced by the defendant’s
                    default, was not a natural and probable consequence of it, or if the harm
                    suffered is due to some act of a third person which could not have been
                    reasonably foreseen or expected, then the defendant will not be liable.</p>
                <p>A great number of special duties have been imposed on different classes of
                    persons—public officers, undertakers of public occupations, and so forth—by
                    modem Acts of Parliament, and are enforcable by penalties. In some cases the
                    breach of such a duty confers a separate right of action upon a person who
                    thereby suffers damage, in others not, according to what appears to be the
                    intention of the enactment. No general rule can be laid down.</p>
                <p>In practice, a large proportion of actionable injuries, especially injuries by
                    negligence, are due to the acts or defaults of servants or workmen, from whom no
                    substantial redress could be obtained or expected. It is held in the common law,
                    and appears to be held in all modem systems, that a master is liable for the
                    acts and defaults of the servants employed by him, provided those acts or
                    defaults occur in the course of the servant's employment, that is, while the
                    servant is about the master’s business, and acting with a view to the master’s
                    interest, and not for some different private purpose of his own. But a man is
                    not generally liable for the conduct of an “independent contractor”—a person who
                    undertakes to do or get done certain work, but not to be under the employer’s
                    control as to the manner of doing it. One may be so liable, however, in virtue
                    of special duties attached to particular situations by positive rales of law.
                    When a servant is injured by the act or default of another servant working under
                    the same employer, the general rale of liability has been largely modified in
                    the employer’s favour, on grounds which have neither been consistently expounded
                    nor generally received as satisfactory. The Employers’ Liability Act of 1880 has
                    remedied the most obvious hardships consequent on the decisions, but only by way
                    of particular exceptions, so that the law as a whole, if more just than it was,
                    is much more intricate, and does not appear to rest on any intelligible
                    principle. The Scottish courts were in a way to develop a more rational
                    doctrine, but the House of Lords, instead of adopting it, forced the law of
                    Scotland into conformity with judgments which were still of only recent
                    authority in England. The subject, however, has given trouble everywhere, and
                    legislative experiments have been tried in many Continental countries. See <hi
