                    “cave-dwellers.” Caves have been widely used as human habitations both in
                    prehistoric and in historic times (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Cave),</hi> and
                    ancient writers speak of Troglodytes in various parts of the world, as in Moesia
                    near the lower Danube (Strabo, vii. 5, p. 318), in the Caucasus (Id., xi. 5, p.
                    506), but especially in various parts of Africa from Libya (Id., xvii. 3, p.
                    828) to the Red Sea. Herodotus (iv. 183) tells of a race of Troglodyte
                    Ethiopians in inner Africa, very swift of foot, living on lizards and creeping
                    things, and with a speech like the screech of an owl. The Garamantes hunted them
                    for slaves. It has been supposed that these Troglodytes may be Tibbus, who still
                    in part are cave-dwellers. Aristotle also <hi rend="italic">Hist. An.,</hi> vii.
                    12) speaks of a dwarfish race of Troglodytes on the upper course of the Nile,
                    who possessed horses and were in his opinion the Pygmies of fable. But the best
                    known of these African cave-dwellers were the inhabitants of the “Troglodyte
                    country” on the coast of the Red Sea, who reached as far north as the Greek port
                    of Berenice, and of whose strange and savage customs an interesting account has
                    been preserved by Diodorus and Photius from Agatharchides.<note anchored="true"

                    entirely on the flesh of their herds, or, in the season of fresh pasture, on
                    mingled milk and blood. But they killed only old or sick cattle (as indeed they
                    killed old men who could no longer follow the flock), and the butchers were
                    called “unclean”; nay, they gave the name of parent to no man, but only to the
                    cattle of which they had their subsistence. This last point seems to be a
                    confused indication of totemism. They went almost naked; the women wore
                    necklaces of shells as amulets. Marriage was unknown, except among the chiefs,
                    —a fact which agrees with the prevalence of female kinship in these regions in
                    much later times. They practised circumcision or a mutilation of a more serious
                    kind. The whole account, much of which must be here passed by, is one of the
                    most curious pictures of savage life in ancient literature.</p>
                <p>The Biblical Horim, who inhabited Mount Seir before the Edomites, bore a name
                    which means cave-dwellers, and may probably have been a kindred people to the
                    Troglodytes on the other side of the Red Sea. Jerome, on Obadiah 5, speaks of
                    this region as containing many cave-dwellings, and such habitations are still
                    sometimes used on the borders of the Syro-Arabian desert.</p>
