                <p><label type="entry">THERMOMETER</label>, an instrument for detecting and
                    measuring differences in temperature. The name is usually restricted to
                    instruments adapted for use at moderate temperatures; those for measuring high
                    temperatures are termed pyrometers (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrometer).</hi>
                    Thermometry has been treated theoretically under <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat</hi>
                    (see vol. xi. p. 558 <hi rend="italic">sqf.</hi> It here remains to trace the
                    history of thermometers, and to describe the principal forms in use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The honour of inventing the thermometer has been
                    given to several natural philosophers of the 16th century; the claims of Robert
                    Fludd are more tangible than those of Drebbel and Santorio, but the instrument
                    invented by Galileo before 1597 seems best entitled to be considered the
                    precursor of accurate thermometers. All the early instruments were air
                    thermoscopes, and, until the variations of atmospheric pressure were discovered,
                    their use was only deceptive. Galileo’s thermometer (fig. 1) consisted of a
                    glass bulb containing air, terminating below in a long glass tube which dipped
                    into a vessel containing a coloured fluid. The variations of volume of the
                    enclosed air caused the fluid to fall or rise in the tube, to which an arbitrary
                    scale was attached. The great step in advance of inventing the alcohol
                    thermometer is also due to Galileo, but the date (probably 1611 or 1612) is not
                    precisely known. Rinieri certainly had alcohol thermometers made before 1647,
                    and they are referred to as familiarly known in the oldest memoirs of the
                    Accademia del Cimento (1667). In form they resembled those now in use; they had
                    large spherical (or, occasionally, cylindrical or helical) bulbs, and the
                    degrees intended to represent thousandths of the volume of the reservoir were
                    marked with beads of enamel fused on to the stem (fig. 2). All the Florentine
                    instruments were graduated in the same way, but the scale was arbitrary, and the
                    recorded readings were accordingly supposed for a long time to be useless. In
                    1829 the fortunate discovery by Antinori of a number of those early Florentine
                    thermometers enabled their scale to be ascertained and translated into known
                    degrees. The temperature of melting ice was marked by them as 13 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5, while 50 corresponded with 55° C. No means of
                    comparing observations made by thermometers of different manufacture existed
                    until certain fixed points of universal accessibility were discovered. The
                    thermal conditions of freezing water were studied with great care, but natural
                    congelation was generally supposed to take place at variable temperatures, until
                    Fahrenheit proved that, however much water could be cooled down without
                    freezing, the temperature when ice began to form was always the same. Hooke, in
                    1665 <hi rend="italic">ÇMicrographia,</hi> p. 38), describes the manufacture and
                    graduation of comparable spirit thermometers with the freezing point of water as
                    the zero of their scales, and he evidently recognized it as fixed. Halley in
                    1693 stated that the temperature of boiling water is constant, and this was
                    again proved by Amontons in 1702. In 1694 Renaldeni of Padua proposed to
                    graduate thermometers by taking as standards of temperature mixtures of definite
                    volumes of ice-cold and boiling water. This method, although theoretically
                    admirable (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat,</hi> vol. xi. p. 559), is defective in
                    practice. Seven years later Newton proposed anonymously <hi rend="italic">{Phil.
                    Trans.,</hi> 1701, vol. xxii. p. 824) a thermometer scale on which the
                    temperature of freezing water was 0°, and that of the blood of a healthy man
                    12°. Continuing the graduation of a linseed-oil thermometer above this point, he
                    found that water boiled at 34°. Fahrenheit in 1714 took as fixed points the
                    temperature of the human body and that of a mixture of ice and sal ammoniac or
                    common salt. In 1721 he made a mercury thermometer according to Halley’s
                    suggestion of 1693, and by means of it he proved the dependence of the boiling
                    point on pressure. It was not until after Fahrenheit’s death that the freezing
                    and boiling points of λvater were universally accepted as fixed points on the
                    thermometric scale. The thermometer has remained unchanged in its main features
                    since the middle of the 18th century. Mercury has been found the most convenient
                    fluid for ordinary use, in spite of the advantages <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Heat,</hi> vol. xi. p. 561 <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi> presented by lighter and
                    more volatile liquids. Graduation of thermometers, by marking off volumes of the
                    stem equal to a given fraction of the capacity of the bulb, although
                    reintroduced by Réaumur in 1730, has now been entirely discontinued.</p>
                <p>The idea of a self-registering thermometer early presented itself. Many forms
                    were devised by natural philosophers and instrument-makers. That of Sixe, in
                    1782, a precursor of which, dating from the 17th century, is preserved amongst
                    the instruments of the Florentine Academy, was the most successful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scales.—</hi> The absolute zero of temperature is the logical
                    beginning of a thermometric scale, but some point easy of reference is
                    desirable, and this is found in the temperature at which ice melts and water
                    freezes. The second accepted fixed point is that at which distilled water boils
                    under the pressure of 760 millimetres (29’92 in.) of mercury. For the division
                    of the space between the two fixed points into degrees of convenient length only
                    three of the innumerable methods proposed have survived, and one of these, the
                    centigrade, is rapidly becoming universal. The oldest system, that of
                    Fahrenheit, dates from 1724. It is used for meteorological purposes, and
                    popularly, in Great Britain, the British colonies, and the United States. The
                    freezing point is marked 32° and the boiling point of water 212°. At first
                    Fahrenheit employed a scale of 180 degrees; the zero was placed at “temperate”
                    (9° C.); 90° at “blood-heat,” the point to which the alcohol rose when the
                    thermometer was placed under the arm of a healthy man; and - 90° at the
                    temperature of a mixture of ice and salt, then believed to be the greatest
                    possible cold. In 1714 Fahrenheit changed his scale at the suggestion of the
                    Danish astronomer Roemer, placed 0° at his “absolute zero,” and divided the
                    space between that and the warmth of the human body into 24 degrees. The
                    freezing point of water thus became 8°. For convenience, these long degrees were
                    divided into quarters, which were afterwards termed degrees; thus the freezing
                    point became 32° and blood heat 96°. A mercury thermometer graduated in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n306/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0306-0289"/> this way, with divisions of equal length
                    continued above blood heat, registered 212° in boiling water. Thus the
                    Fahrenheit scale came from a duodecimal reckoning.</p>
                <p>De Lisle, in 1724, introduced a scale in which the boiling point of water was
                    marked 0° and the temperature of the cellars of the Paris Observatory 100°. He
                    afterwards adopted the freezing point of water as his upper fixed point, and
                    called it 150°. This scale was used for many years in Russia, but is now
                    obsolete.</p>
                <p>In 1730 Réaumur made alcohol thermometers with their zero at the freezing point
                    of water, and degrees of one-thousandth of the volume of the bulb. On some of
                    these the boiling point of water was 80°; but the instruments were defective in
                    principle and very unequal in their indications. Deluc introduced mercury
                    thermometers graduated from 0° in melting ice to 80° in boiling water, and
                    these, with Réaumur’s name attached, are in use for popular purposes in Germany,
                    Holland, and other parts of the Continent.</p>
                <p>Celsius adopted a centesimal scale in 1742. The boiling point was marked 0° and
                    the freezing point of water 100°. Linnaeus introduced the mode of reckoning from
                    0° in melting ice to 100° in boiling water, which is now known as the
                    centigrade, and is used universally in laboratories, and in all except
                    English-speaking countries for every scientific purpose.</p>
                <p>Fahrenheit’s scale is convenient for meteorological work on account of its short
                    degrees, admitting of great accuracy in reading and compactness in recording,
                    and on account of its low zero, which makes it possible in temperate climates to
                    dispense with negative quantities. On the other hand, the centigrade scale is on
                    the whole so convenient, its use is so nearly universal, and the advantage of a
                    uniform system is so great that it must ultimately be adopted for all
                    purposes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The process of
                    converting readings of any one of the three existing scales into those of any
                    other is a simple matter of proportion. They stand in the ratio of 80: 100: 180
                    (32 being subtracted from Fahrenheit temperatures before the calculation is
                    made, and added to the result when converting from Réaumur or centigrade into
                    Fahrenheit). An easy rule for changing centigrade readings into Fahrenheit
                    mentally is—multiply the centigrade temperature by 2, subtract one-tenth of the
                    product, and add 32: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 10“ C. =20 -2 + 32 = 50° F.
                    These rules are only to be applied to thermometers made with all modem
                    precautions. When the boiling point was determined by immersing the bulb of the

                    degrees of the same length; and any number of air thermometers so made will
                    agree amongst themselves at every temperature. The principle of air thermometers

                    for thermometric purposes, possesses numerous advantages, and on account of its
                    low freezing point it is always used for observations in polar regions. Alcohol
                    thermometers are graduated by fixing the freezing point in melting ice and by
                    comparison with a mercury or air thermometer at several higher and lower
                    temperatures. Recently low-temperature thermometers have been verified at Kew in
                    melting mercury at the temperature of - 40. The law of expansion of alcohol in
                    glass at low temperatures is not known with such precision as to make the
                    minimum indications of Arctic expeditions entirely trustworthy. The graduation
                    of ordinary minimum alcohol thermometers used for meteorological purposes is
                    effected by comparison with mercury standards, and their indications, so far as
                    this source of uncertainty is concerned, may consequently be relied on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mercury in Glass Thermometer.</hi> —The simplest form is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Weight Thermometer,</hi> a large glass bulb terminating in a
                    capillary tube, and filled with a known weight of mercury at 0° 0. The weight of
                    mercury that escapes when the apparatus is heated to</p>
                <p>100° is determined, and the temperature of any enclosure is then ascertained by
                    placing in it the thermometer filled at zero, and weighing the liquid that runs
                    out. Thermometers on this principle were used by Régnault in his celebrated
                    researches on steam.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Standard Thermometers.—</hi> The tube is sometimes made with
                    elliptical bore to ensure visibility of the mercury column, but it is usually
                    circular in section. The internal diameter must be as nearly as possible
                    uniform. This is tested by a preliminary calibration in which a short thread of
                    mercury is measured in different parts of the tube. The length of stem and the
                    range of the thermometer having been decided upon, the size of the bulb is
                    calculated from the known expansibility of mercury and the section of the bore.
                    The bulb is made as nearly as possible the required size, either by blowing it
                    from a tube or preferably by forming it of a glass cylinder, and attached to the
                    stem. The bulb is usually cylindrical in form and it must be uniform in
                    thickness. The utmost care requires to be exercised to keep the bulb and stem
                    dry and clean and to fill them with pure mercury recently distilled. The mercury
                    is boiled in the thermometer for some time to drive out all traces of air and
                    moisture, and the point of the stem is sealed off. If the thermometer is not
                    intended to measure temperatures up to the boiling point of mercury, an
                    expansion should be made at the top of the tube to prevent bursting from
                    accidental overheating. Under <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat</hi> (vol. xi. p. 561)

                    of mercury for several days as recently practised at Kew, renders the
                    thermometer much less liable to suffer change of zero by the lapse of time or by
                    heating to any lower temperature. All instruments of precision should be treated
                    in this way, or kept for several years after they have been filled and sealed
                    before they are graduated.</p>
                <p>The first fixed point on the scale is marked at the place where the mercury
                    stands when the thermometer is buried in melting ice from which the water is
                    allowed to drain away, the second at the place where the mercury stands when the
                    thermometer is immersed in steam of water boiling freely under the pressure of
                    760 mm. (29’92 inches) of mercury corrected to 0° C. The space between these may
                    be graduated either in arbitrary equidistant divisions, as it is best to do in
                    delicate instruments, or in degrees of any scale. Each degree centigrade is
                    ¹∕₁₀₀ of the volume of the tube between the freezing and boiling points; if the
                    tube is quite uniform in bore the degrees will be of equal length and may be
                    marked off correctly by a dividing engine. If the preliminary calibration showed
                    the tube to vary in diameter, the degree marks are often adjusted to correspond
                    to intervals of equal volume. It is better in all cases, whether degrees or
                    arbitrary divisions are adopted, to have them of equal length and correct the
                    readings by the calibration curve. The scale may be continued above and beneath
                    the fixed points in degrees or divisions of the same length.</p>
                <p>Calibration consists in measuring the internal volume of the thermometer tube by
                    means of a thread of mercury detached from the main column. There are several
                    ways of doing this, for particulars of which reference may be made to the

                    physical researches thermoelectric junctions are more often used than
                    thermometers for measuring very small differences of temperature.</p>
                <p>For ordinary work in a chemical or physical laboratory thermometers are used
                    which can be read easily to one-tenth of a degree centigrade, and have a range
                    from 0° to 100°, or in some cases to 350° C. They are always either engraved on
                    the stem or graduated on an included scale (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat,</hi>
                    figs. 4, 5), and are not mounted on frames of any kind. It is not necessary to
                    calibrate such thermometers; but they should be compared with a standard at
                    several temperatures and frequently verified in melting ice and steam of boiling
                    water.</p>
                <p>Zincke’s chemical thermometer for high temperature has a scale commencing at 100°
                    C. In Geissler ’ s nitrogen thermometer the range is extended by raising the
                    boiling point of the included mercury, the upper part of the tube being filled
                    with rarefied nitrogen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Meteorological.—</hi> The thermometer was early applied to the
                    study of differences of climate, and this is still one of its most important
                    uses. The wet and dry bulb thermometers placed in the shade give the temperature
                    and humidity (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygrometry)</hi> of the surrounding air,
                    but “shade” and “surrounding air” require to be defined. Shade is intended to
                    exclude rain and prevent all radiation; and the surrounding air is that of the
                    atmosphere in the neighbourhood of the thermometer outside any shelter that may
                    be used. The simplest way of observing is to hang up a thermometer in the shadow
                    of some rather distant object and leave it until it acquires a steady
                    temperature; but this method has been found impracticable and does not give very
                    exact results.</p>
                <p>In different countries different patterns of thermometer shelter are employed and
                    exposure takes place at a different height above the ground. Results so obtained
                    cannot be critically compared, and the relative mean temperatures of the
                    atmosphere in different countries are only known to within one or two degrees.
                    The Stevenson double-louvred screen (see vol. xvi. p. 115), a box open below,
                    provided with a solid roof, is used at all meteorological stations in Great
                    Britain. It is placed 4 feet from the ground, and painted white outside and
                    inside. The results derived from its use are comparable, because the conditions
                    in which it is employed are the same, but the general introduction of a double
                    roof would greatly add to its efficiency. Exposure outside windows or in wall
                    boxes is the rule in Austria. In France the Renou screen is largely used; it is
                    a flat roof one square metre in extent, and double; the thermometers are hung
                    under it two metres from the ground. A similar roof, but of much larger size, is
                    employed in Australia, in combination with a metal thermometer-box. A metallic
                    box, constructed of double louvres with an air-space between, finds favour in
                    Spain. In Russia and Switzerland Wild’s shelter is extensively employed. The
                    thermometers are enclosed in a case composed of two or three concentric zinc
                    cylinders perforated to admit air, and placed 11 feet above the ground. They are
                    protected by a large shelter of wood, the south wall and roof of which are
                    double and made of solid boards, between which air circulates; the east and west
                    sides are louvred, and the north side entirely open. A similar shelter is used
                    in Canada, to cover a box of single sheet-iron louvres in which the thermometers
                    are placed 4⅛ feet from the ground. Various systems of exposure were authorized
                    in the United States until 1885. It was then decided, as the result of
                    experiments<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>H. A. Hazen,

                    pattern of shelter be adopted by the Signal Service. It is a single-louvred

                    and a double roof. The louvres are provided with an upright flange on their
                    inner side, designed to keep rain from the thermometers. The bottom of the
                    shelter is to be fixed either 9 feet above a roof or 16 feet above grass.</p>

                    devised a series of thermometer boxes on a new principle, radiation being taken
                    advantage of to produce a constant draught over the thermometer bulbs by the use
                    of a long blackened chimney. These give admirable results. Very small and bright
                    objects are little affected by radiation: hence thermometers with bulbs of small
                    diameter and coated with a bright deposit of gold or silver have been used
                    without screens. The air temperature has also been calculated by means of a
                    formula from the readings of two similar thermometers, the bulbs of which are
                    unequally affected by radiation. Some form of sling thermometer should always be
                    used for observations at sea; the Board of Trade screen generally employed is
                    thoroughly objectionable, and can only give moderately good results by the

                <p>As a rule, thermometers for meteorological purposes are made with spherical
                    bulbs, although cylindrical reservoirs present certain advantages. To ensure
                    perfect uniformity in registration, the bulbs should all be as nearly as
                    possible of one size, constructed of one kind of glass, and the mounting
                    perfectly uniform. Better-class instruments have the bulb clear of the frame,
                    and the stem attached to a slab of metal, of porcelain, or of glass backed by
                    wood; but sometimes they are simply fixed to a boxwood scale. In all cases they
                    should be graduated on the stem, and compared with a standard, but in view of
                    the uncertainty of the methods of thermometer exposure great delicacy is
                    undesirable.</p>

                    horizontally; the column pushed before it a small steel index, which was left at
                    the highest point reached. It is little used now. The maximum thermometers in
                    common use for meteorologicai purposes are Negretti &amp; Zambra’s and
                    Phillips’s. The former is a modified outflow thermometer. It is made with a
                    constriction in the tube near the bulb, past which the mercury easily expands,
                    but cannot return when the temperature falls, as the column breaks at the
                    narrowed point when the fluid in the bulb begins to contract. The thermometer
                    acts horizontally, but Everett devised a modification which is hung bulb
                    uppermost, and the mercury, as it passes the constriction, falls down and stands
                    as a column in the inverted tube. The thermometer is set by swinging <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n308/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0308-0291"/> it. Phillips’s maximum, claimed also by
                    Walferdin, has a portion of the mercury thread separated from the rest by a
                    minute bubble of air. It is placed horizontally, and, as temperature increases,
                    the detached portion of mercury is pushed forward and is not withdrawn when the
                    main column retreats toward the bulb on cooling. It is set for a new observation
                    by bringing it into a vertical position and tapping it slightly. By reducing the
                    length of the index and the bore of the stem this thermometer may be made
                    suitable for use in any position without altering its register. Walferdin’s
                    outflow maximum thermometer is a modification of that of Lord Charles
                    Cavendish<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Phil. Τrans.,</hi> i., 1757, p. 300. Henry Cavendish’s register

                    type of a number of similar instruments. It is set by filling the stem entirely
                    with mercury from a lateral chamber at the top (fig. 4). The instrument is
                    placed vertically, and as temperature rises mercury overflows into the
                    reservoir. To be read, the thermometer is brought back to its original
                    temperature, then the number of degree spaces left vacant at the top of the tube
                    shows the excess of maximum temperature above that at the time of setting.</p>
                <p>The minimum thermometer in most frequent use is that of John Rutherford, invented
                    in 1790. It is a spirit thermometer, preferably filled with amyl alcohol to
                    reduce risk of distillation, in the column of which a small porcelain index is
                    included. The instrument is hung horizontally, and, as temperature falls, the
                    index is drawn back by the surface tension of the fluid. When temperature rises,
                    the liquid flows past the index easily, leaving it at the lowest point attained.
                    Baudin invented a modification called the <hi rend="italic">thermomètre à
                    marteau</hi> in 1862; it acts vertically, the index being fixed by a spring, as
                    in Sixe’s thermometer, and set by a long glass needle included in the stem,
                    which, when the instrument is inverted, falls on the index and drives it to the
                    surface of the alcohol. The mercurial minimum of Casella is an instrument of
                    great delicacy and beauty, extremely difficult to make, and requiring careful
                    handling in its use. A side tube of wide bore <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> (fig. 5)
                    is joined to the stem of an ordinary mercurial thermometer near the bulb. This
                    tube terminates in a small chamber <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> cut off by a
                    perpendicular glass diaphragm which is perforated by a hole of greater diameter
                    than the thermometer stem. When set, the mercury in the stem indicates the
                    actual temperature, and the chamber is empty. On the principle of Balfour

                    when the instrument is heated the mercury remains stationary in the stem but

                    Several of their reversing thermometers (see under <hi rend="italic">Deep-Sea
                    Thermometers)</hi> are pivoted on a frame, and held upright by catches which are
                    withdrawn in turn at definite intervals by an electrical arrangement regulated
                    by a clock. Each instrument, when it reverses, preserves the record of
                    temperature at that moment until it is set again.</p>
                <p>No thoroughly satisfactory self-registering maximum or minimum thermometer has
                    yet been produced. In all existing forms the indications are liable to be
                    disturbed by shaking. Where alcohol is the fluid used, it is apt to volatilize
                    and accumulate at the top of the tube, so registering a much lower temperature
                    than actually occurs. It is extremely difficult also to free alcohol
                    thermometers from air, which gradually escapes from solution in the fluid and
                    renders the instrument untrustworthy or even useless.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Radiation Thermometers.—</hi> The intensity of solar radiation
                    is measured by the pyrheliometer, which usually consists of a body heated by the
                    sun’s rays and a thermometer to measure the rise of temperature. In meteorology
                    radiation is measured by thermometers simply exposed with blackened bulbs.
                    Results of the utmost diversity are given by different methods. As there is no
                    means of determining the true measure of radiation, all that can be done is to
                    have the instruments whose indications are to be compared constructed and
                    exposed in the same way. The usual form, as suggested by Herschel, is a maximum
                    thermometer with a spherical bulb half an inch in diameter coated with lampblack
                    and placed in the centre of a spherical vessel of clear glass, 2⅜ inches in
                    diameter, and exhausted of air. The state of the vacuum may be shown by
                    including a small mercurial manometer, or a radiometer, or by soldering in
                    platinum electrodes through which a discharge can be made in the interior. It is
                    not essential that the vacuum be very perfect; some observers prefer to employ a
                    globe filled with dry air. For separate instruments to be comparable,

                    thickness and size (a difference of 8 per cent, in diameter produces variations
                    of several degrees), blackened sufficiently to absorb all radiation falling on
                    them, and placed accurately in the centre of perfectly spherical enclosures,
                    which must also be of equal diameter. The stem should be as small as possible in
                    proportion to the bulb; and before being used for comparative purposes all
                    radiation thermometers should be compared with an arbitrary standard by daily
                    exposure for several weeks to sunshine.</p>
                <p>Minimum radiation thermometers, intended to measure radiation from the earth at
                    night, are usually filled with alcohol, and much ingenuity has been expended on
                    increasing their delicacy. The bulbs are made very large relatively to the bore,
                    and constructed so as to expose a great surface, the reservoir being often
                    helical, 1enticular, annular, spoon-shaped, forked, or even like a gridiron.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Earth Thermometers.—</hi> Saussure introduced the use of
                    sluggish thermometers packed in non-conducting material for taking the

                    into an iron tube which has previously been sunk to the required depth. It may
                    be withdrawn and read without changing its record. The underground temperature

                    rock in 1837, and broken accidentally in 1876. They are placed with their bulbs
                    at depths of 25, 12, 6, 3 feet beneath the surface respectively, and one has its
                    bulb just covered. The readings of the intermediate thermometers supply data for
                    correcting the long columns of alcohol in the deeper ones for the different
                    temperatures of their different parts. Allowance may be made for this effect
                    without calculation by utilizing the principle applied by Sainte-Claire Deville
                    to pyrometers. A second stem, similar in every way to that of the thermometer,
                    nearly filled with the same fluid, but hermetically sealed at the lower end, is
                    fixed beside the thermometer stem. The fluctuations it shows are due solely to
                    causes affecting the stem and not the bulb of the thermometer, and they are
                    eliminated from the readings of the latter by taking account only of the
                    difference of level of the fluid in the two tubes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Deep-Sea Thermometers.—</hi> The earliest observations of
                    warmth beneath the surface were made by raising samples of water in a valved box
                    and noting the temperature when it was brought on board. Saussure, in addition
                    to this, used sluggish thermometers, which he left immersed for several hours
                    before reading. His latest thermometer for sea-work was filled with alcohol, and
                    had a bulb more than an inch in diameter, which was imbedded in a mass of wax
                    and enclosed in a stout wooden case. It attained the temperature of its
                    surroundings very slowly, preserved it for a long time, and gave, in his hands,
                    thoroughly trustworthy results. On the introduction of registering thermometers
                    these were used, but the unsuspected magnitude of the effect of pressure at
                    great depths made the earlier records entirely misleading.</p>

                    the name of Miller-Casella thermometers, were of the form shown in fig. 6. The

                    which pushes one or other before it as the temperature is rising or falling, and
                    leaves them at points denoting the highest and lowest temperatures passed
                    through. The indexes are set by a magnet. The “Challenger” thermometers, which
                    were not graduated on the stems, were secured side by side with porcelain
                    temperature scales to vulcanite frames and placed in copper cases perforated to
                    allow a circulation of water. Tait investigated the whole subject of pressure
                    corrections after the return of the expedition, and found that the high result
                    obtained by a previous experimenter was due mainly to heat developed by
                    compression of the vulcanite, which affected the thermometer in the press, but
                    would not do so at sea. The correction which had to be applied was rather less
                    than ¹∕₇ of a degree Fahr. per mile of depth.<note anchored="true"

                    very ingenious arrangement of outflow thermometers, which were inverted by a
                    weight slipping down the line, and registered as they were being drawn up. His
                    instruments were accurate, but very delicate and troublesome to manage. Within
                    the last few years Negretti and Zambra have patented several forms of modified
                    outflow thermometers. The first instrument of the kind was complicated and
                    unmanageable, but that now before the public is both simple and convenient. It
                    consists of a mercury thermometer with a cylindrical bulb and a stem AC (fig. 7)
                    of wide bore terminating in a small pyriform aneurism. The stem is contracted
                    and contorted just above the bulb, and when the instrument is turned upside down
                    the mercury column breaks at this point and flows down into the tube, which is
                    graduated in the inverted position. To protect it from pressure the thermometer
                    is hermetically sealed in a strong glass tube, the portion of which surrounding
                    the bulb contains a quantity of mercury secured by a ring of india-rubber
                    cement. When the thermometer is made to turn over at any depth in water of any
                    temperature, the record remains nearly unaltered, and, until set for a new
                    observation, enables the actual temperature at the instant of reversal to be
                    ascertained at any subsequent time and in any other place. The detached column
                    standing in the tube changes its length slightly by change of temperature. A
                    series of experiments with twelve instruments has shown that for 60° F. change
                    of temperature there is a difference of one degree in the reading of the
                    inverted thermometer. Hence a correction must be applied in all cases where the
                    temperature at which the thermometer is read differs more than a few degrees
                    from that at which it was inverted, contrary to the opinion of the German
                    observers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    temperature by which it should be corrected is obviously that given by the
                    wet-bulb in air. In view of the great range of temperature experienced in
                    deep-sea work in the tropics, the size of the little overflow cell B, which
                    prevents mercury from the bulb from entering the tube must be considerably
                    increased before the thermometer can be used with safety for such purposes. The
                    Negretti and Zambra thermometer acquires the temperature of its surroundings
                    very rapidly (two or three minutes are usually sufficient); it can be read
                    easily to tenths of a degree Fahr.; and, above all, it ascertains temperature at
                    exact points of depth, and has thus revealed layers of remarkably varying

                    the neighbourhood of the boiling point of water and divided on the stem into

                    consequently the altitude, is obtained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Clinical Thermometers.—</hi> The first use to which
                    thermometers were applied was the study of the temperature of the blood in
                    fevers; and the constancy of the temperature of the healthy human body was for a
                    century considered sufficient to entitle it to the position of a fixed point in
                    graduating thermometers. The increased importance now attached to temperature in
                    disease has led to the production of many forms of clinical thermometer. The
                    large instruments intended to be read <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> are now
                    entirely superseded by small maximum self-registering thermometers. Graduation
                    is carried to one-fifth of a degree, and the usual range is about 25 degrees
                    Fahr., —from 85° or 90° to 110° or 115°. Olive-shaped bulbs have been used, but
                    a cylindrical form is most common. There should be an arrangement like that
                    suggested for hypsometers to enable the freezing point to be verified. Casella’s
                    thermometer on Phillips’s system has a small expansion on the stem, followed by
                    a contraction, to prevent the index following the rest of the mercury into the
                    bulb when the instrument is not in use. The “half-minute thermometer” is quick
                    in action; it has a bulb of very small diameter and an extremely fine bore, the
                    mercury thread being rendered visible by Hicks’s arrangement of a lens-fronted
                    stem. Immisch’s avitreous thermometer is recommended for clinical use on account
                    of its small size, convenient shape, and non-liability to get out of order.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Thermometers for Technical Purposes.—</hi> These are made in an
                    infinite variety of forms, adapted to the various processes of manufacture and
                    industry. The scale is often dispensed with in these instruments, a movable
                    pointer being fixed at the point at which the mercury is to be kept. Air or
                    steam thermometers (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrometer)</hi> are rapidly
                    superseding mercury instruments for all temperatures above the boiling point of
                    water. The cheap German paper-scale thermometers are largely used, fitted in
                    wooden cases, <pb break="no"

                    brewing purposes. Alarm thermometers are often employed, in which electric
                    contact is made and a bell rung when the temperature exceeds or falls short of a
                    certain limit. Thermostats of various forms are made use of, in which a
                    thermometer, by the position of the mercury in the stem, regulates the
                    gas-supply of a burner and thus the heat of an enclosure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metallic Thermometers.—</hi> Thermometers depending on change
                    in length or form of composite metal bars, such as Crighton’s zinc-iron bar and
                    Bréguet’s silver-gold-platinum spiral (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrometer),</hi>
                    are converted into registering instruments by the addition of two light pointers
                    pushed forward by the index needle as it travels round the graduated arc to
                    either side and left at their extreme points. Jürgensen in 1841 constructed a
                    chronometer, the balance wheel of which was arranged so as to exaggerate the
                    effects of change of temperature and thus to affect the rate. It furnished a
                    very close approximation to the mean temperature between the intervals of
                    rating, and was approved by Arago for use in observations. Hermann and Pfister’s

                    given satisfactory results at the Zurich observatory. It is a flat spiral of
                    brass and steel, which unrolls and coils up according to changes of temperature,
                    moving an index on a divided horizontal circle and marking the maximum and
                    minimum by light pointers. In order to secure regular results, the instrument
                    must be annealed by heating for some time in boiling linseed oil.</p>
                <p>Several instruments known popularly as metallic thermometers depend on a
                    different principle, that of the change of form in a thin metallic enclosure
                    containing liquid.</p>
                <p>Immisch’s avitreous thermometer (fig. 9) is an example. A minute Bourdon’s tube
                    is fixed at one end, and the other bears on the short arm of a lever, the long
                    arm of which acts by a rack on the pinion forming the axis of the pointer. It is
                    only one inch in diameter and extremely accurate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Thermographs.—</hi> The first form of thermograph, due to
                    Wheatstone, was an electrical apparatus. It has recently been improved by Van
                    Rysselberghe, in whose hands it has assumed the following form. The thermometer
                    is of rather wide bore and open above. At intervals of quarter of an hour a wire
                    is moved gradually down the tube by a clock until it touches the mercury; an
                    electric circuit is thus completed, and causes an indentation by a diamond point
                    which moves in the same way as the wire down a rotating cylinder covered with
                    thin sheet copper or zinc. The metal sheet is renewed at each revolution of the
                    cylinder, and it is sufficient to join the indented points with a graver to have
                    a plate from which any number of copies of the record may be printed. Cripp’s
                    thermograph records hourly on a revolving cylinder. It consists essentially of a
                    mercury thermometer coiled into a flat spiral and suspended on a horizontal
                    axis. Any change of temperature displaces the centre of gravity of the system,
                    and the instrument rotates through an arc, moving a pencil as it does so. A
                    perfectly continuous record is produced by the photographic thermograph. Wet and
                    dry bulb thermometers are so arranged that a beam of light passes through an
                    air-speck, which separates part of the mercury thread, or through the vacant
                    part of the tube, and falls on a rotating cylinder covered with photographic
                    paper on which it traces the curve of temperature fluctuation. This apparatus is
                    probably the most perfect of its kind. In Bowketfs thermograph the change of
                    form of a curved tube containing oil moves a pencil radially over a card turned
                    horizontally by a clock. The resulting curve is referable to polar instead of
                    rectangular coordinates; the radius measures temperature, the angle time.
                    Richard s thermograph is also actuated by means of a sealed metallic capsule
                    containing fluid. It draws a continuous curve in ink on a revolving drum on
                    which one sheet lasts for seven days. This instrument is largely employed in
                    observatories to check eye-observations, and is peculiarly adapted for use in
                    positions to which access can only be had occasionally. It is made in many
                    forms, one of which is specially adapted for marine work, the sealed capsule
                    being rolled into the form of a cylinder and exposed to the water on both
                    surfaces. (H. R. Μ.)</p>
