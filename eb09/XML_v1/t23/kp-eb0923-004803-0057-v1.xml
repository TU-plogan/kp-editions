                <p><label type="entry">TANTALUS</label>, a hero of ancient Greek myth and legend. He
                    was a son of Zeus and Pluto (“Wealth”), and became the father of Pelops,
                    Proteus, and Niobe. He dwelt in splendour on Mount Sipylus near Smyrna, and was
                    admitted to the table of the gods themselves. But he abused the divine favour by
                    revealing to mankind the secrets he had learned in heaven, or by killing his son
                    Pelops and serving him up to the gods at table. Another story was that he stole
                    nectar and ambrosia from heaven and gave them to men. According to others,
                    Pandareus stole a golden dog which guarded the temple of Zeus in Crete, and gave
                    it to Tantalus to take care of. But, when Pandareus demanded the dog back,
                    Tantalus denied that he had received it. Therefore Zeus turned Pandareus into a
                    stone, and flung down Tantalus with Mount Sipylus on the top of him. The
                    punishment of Tantalus in the lower world was famous. He stood up to his neck in
                    water, which fled from him when he tried to drink of it; and over his head hung
                    fruits which the wind wafted away whenever he tried to grasp them. From this
                    myth is derived the English word “tantalize.” Another story is that a rock hung
                    over his head ready to fall and crush him. The tomb of Tantalus on Mount Sipylus
                    was pointed out in antiquity, and has been in modern times identified by Texier
                    with the great cairn beneath Old Magnesia; but Prof. W. M. Ramsay inclines to
                    identify it with a remarkable rock-cut tomb beside Magnesia. The story of
                    Tantalus contains a reminiscence of a semi-Greek kingdom which had its seat at
                    Sipylus, the oldest and holiest city of Lydia, and one of the chief birthplaces
                    of early Greek civilization. Of this ancient city the remains are still visible
                    on the northern slope of Mount Sipylus, and about 4 miles east of Magnesia. They
                    consist of sepulchral mounds, rock-cut tombs, and a small acropolis perched on
                    an almost inaccessible crag which juts out from the nearly perpendicular
                    limestone wall of Mount Sipylus. There was a tradition in antiquity that the
                    city of Tantalus had been swallowed up in a lake on the mountain; but the legend
                    may, as Prof. W. M. Ramsay thinks, have been suggested by the vast ravine which
                    yawns beneath the acropolis.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Legends of submerged cities and castles are common in
                    different parts of Europe. It has been suggested that they are confused
                    recollections of the ancient villages built on piles in lakes (Wood-Martin, <hi

                    is too small ever to have been the seat of a great empire; rather, like Pessinus
                    and other great religious centres of Asia Minor, it may have been “the seat of a
                    priestly suzerainty maintained over the <hi rend="italic">hiero-douloi</hi>
                    [sacred slaves] of the surrounding district.” Connected as the city was on the
                    one hand with the sea, and on the other with the capital of the ancient kingdom
                    of Phrygia by means of the “royal road,” it was a natural meeting-place for
                    Greek and Oriental culture. A comparison of the art of Phrygia with the early
                    art of Mycenae and Olympia has fully confirmed the legend which connects the
                    family of Tantalus with the Peloponnesus.</p>
