                    (1818-1883), the descendant of an old Russian family, was born at Orel, in the
                    government of the same name, in 1818. His father, the colonel of a cavalry
                    regiment, died when our author was sixteen years of age, leaving two sons,
                    Nicholas and Ivan, who were brought up under the care of their mother, the
                    heiress of the Litvinoffs, a lady who owned large estates and many serfs. Ivan
                    studied for a year at the university of Moscow, then at St Petersburg, and was
                    finally sent in 1843 to Berlin. His education at home had been conducted by
                    German and French tutors, and was altogether foreign, his mother only speaking
                    Russian to her servants, as became a great lady of the old school. For his first
                    acquaintance with the literature of his country the future novelist was indebted
                    to a serf of the family, who used to read to him verses from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rossiad</hi> of Kheraskoff, a once-celebrated poet of last
                    century. Tourguenieff’s early attempts in literature, consisting of poems and
                    trifling sketches, may be passed over here; they were not without indications of
                    genius, and were favourably spoken of by Bielinski, then the leading Russian
                    critic, for whom Tourguenieff ever cherished a warm regard. Our author first
                    made a name by his striking sketches “The Papers of a Sportsman” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Zapiski Okhotnika),</hi> in which the miserable condition of the
                    peasants was described with startling realism. The work appeared in a collected
                    form in 1852. It was read by all classes, including the emperor himself, and it
                    undoubtedly hurried on the great work of emancipation. Tourguenieff had always
                    sympathized with the <hi rend="italic">muzhiks;</hi> he had often been witness
                    of the cruelties of his mother, a narrow-minded and vindictive woman. In some
                    interesting papers recently contributed to the “European Messenger” (<hi
                    rend="italic">Viestnik Europî)</hi> by a lady brought up in the household of Mme
                    Tourguenieff, sad details are given illustrative of her character. Thus the dumb
                    porter of gigantic stature, drawn with such power in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mumu,</hi> one of our author’s later sketches, was a real person. We are,
                    moreover, told of his mother that she could never understand how it was that her
                    son became an author, and thought that he had degraded himself. How could a
                    Tourguenieff submit himself to be criticized?</p>
                <p>The next production of the novelist was “A Nest of Nobles” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Duorianskoe Gniezdo),</hi> a singularly pathetic story, which greatly
                    increased his reputation. This appeared in 1859, and was followed the next year
                    by “On the Eve” <hi rend="italic">(Nakanune),—</hi> a tale which contains one of
                    his most beautiful female characters, Helen. In 1862 was published “Fathers and
                    Children” <hi rend="italic">(Otzi i Dieti),</hi> in which the author admirably
                    described the nihilistic doctrines then beginning to spread in Russia, he
                    himself inventing the word nihilism, which seems likely to become permanent. In
                    1867 appeared “Smoke” <hi rend="italic">(Dim),</hi> and in 1877 his last work of
                    any length, “Virgin Soil” <hi rend="italic">(Nov).</hi> Besides his longer
                    stories, many shorter ones were produced, some of great beauty and full of
                    subtile psychological analysis, such as <hi rend="italic">Rudin, “</hi> The
                    Diary of a Useless Man” <hi rend="italic">(Dnevnik Lishnago Chelovieka),</hi>
                    and others. These were afterwards collected into three volumes. The last works
                    of the great novelist were “Poetry in Prose” and “Clara Milich,” which appeared
                    in the pages of the “European Messenger.”</p>
                <p>Tourguenieff, during the latter part of his life, did not reside much in Russia;
                    he lived either at Baden Baden or Paris, and chiefly with the family of the
                    celebrated singer Viardot Garcia, to the members of which he was much attached.
                    He occasionally visited England, and in 1879 the degree of D.C.L. was conferred
                    upon him by the university of Oxford. He died at Bougival, near Paris, on
                    September 4, 1883; according to his wish, his remains were taken to St
                    Petersburg, and buried in the Volkoff cemetery, near those of the critic
                    Bielinski.</p>
                <p>Unquestionably Tourguenieff may be considered one of the greatest novelists of
                    our own or any other times, and worthy to be ranked with Thackeray, Dickens, and
                    George Eliot: with the genius of the last of these he has many affinities. His
                    studies of human nature are profound, and he has the wide sympathies which are
                    essential to genius of the highest order. A melancholy, almost pessimist,
                    feeling pervades his writings, but perhaps this is always found in those who
                    have truly listened to the “still, sad music of humanity.” This morbid
                    self-analysis seems natural to the Slavonic mind, and Tourguenieff has given
                    abundant proof of possessing it. The closing chapter of “A Nest of Nobles” is
                    one of the saddest and at the same time truest pages in the whole range of
                    existing novels.</p>
                <p>The writings of Tourguenieff have been made familiar to persons unacquainted with
                    Russian by French translations. There are some versions in English, but the only
                    two worthy of notice are the translation of the “Nest of Nobles” under the name
                    of “Lisa,” by Mr Ralston, and “Virgin Soil,” by the late Mr Ashton Dilke.</p>
