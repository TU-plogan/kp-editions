                <p><label type="entry">THALES <hi rend="smallcaps">of Miletus</hi></label> (640-546
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> son of</p>
                <p>Examyus and Cleobuline, is universally recognized as the founder of Greek
                    geometry, astronomy, and philosophy. He is said by Herodotus and others to have
                    been of Phoenician extraction, but the more common account (see Diogenes
                    Laertius) is that he was a native Milesian of noble birth. Zeller thinks that
                    his ancestors belonged to the Cadmean tribe in Boeotia, who were intermingled
                    with the Ionians of Asia Minor, and thus reconciles the conflicting statements.
                    The nationality of Thales is certainly Greek and not Phoenician. The high
                    estimation in which he was held by his contemporaries is shown by the place he
                    occupied as chief of the seven “wise men” of Greece; and in later times amongst
                    the ancients his fame was quite remarkable. It is well known that this name
                    (σoφos) was given on account of practical ability; and in accordance with this
                    we find that Thales had been occupied with civil affairs, and indeed several
                    instances of his political sagacity have been handed down. Of these the most
                    remarkable is the advice, praised by Herodotus, which he gave to his
                    fellow-countrymen “before Ionia was ruined,”—“that the Ionians should constitute
                    one general council in Teos, as the most central of the twelve cities, and that
                    the remaining cities should nevertheless be governed as independent states”
                    (Herod., i. 170). It is probable, however, that in the case of Thales the
                    appellation “wise man,” which was given to him and to the other six in the

                    celebrated prediction of the eclipse of the sun, which took place on May 28 <hi

                    was of the highest importance, has given rise to much discussion. The account of
                    it as given by Herodotus (i. 74) contains two statements (1) the fact that the
                    eclipse did actually take place during a battle between the Medes and the
                    Lydians, that it was a total eclipse (Herodotus calls it a “night battle ”),
                    that it caused a cessation of hostilities and led to a lasting peace between the
                    contending nations; (2) that Thales had foretold the eclipse to the Ionians, and
                    fixed the year in which it actually did take place. Various dates—ranging from
                    625 B.c. to 583 B.c.—have been assigned by different chronologists to this
                    eclipse; but, since the investigations of Airy,<note anchored="true"

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> has been generally accepted. This date agrees
                    nearly with that given by Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H. H.,</hi> ii. 12). The
                    second part of the statement of Herodotus—the reality of the prediction by
                    Thales—has been frequently called in question, chiefly on the ground that, in
                    order to predict a solar eclipse with any chance of success, one should have the
                    command of certain astronomical facts which were not known until the 3d century
                    B.c., and then merely approximately, and only employed with that object in the
                    following century by Hipparchus. The question, however, is not whether Thales
                    could predict the eclipse of the sun with any chance of success—much less
                    whether he could state beforehand at what places the eclipse would be visible,
                    as some have erroneously supposed, and which of course would have been quite
                    impossible for him to do, but simply whether he foretold that there would be a
                    solar eclipse in that year, as stated by Herodotus. Now as to this there is
                    quite a remarkable unanimity in the testimony of the ancients, and the evidence
                    is of the strongest kind, ascending to Herodotus, and, according to the account
                    of Diogenes Laertius, even to Xenophanes, who was an Ionian, and not much later
                    than Thales. Further, <pb break="no"

                    observatories in most of the large cities in the valley of the Euphrates, and
                    that professional astronomers regularly took observations of the heavens, copies
                    of which were sent to the king of Assyria; and from a cuneiform inscription

                    that time the epochs of eclipses of both sun and moon were predicted as
                    possible—probably by means of the cycle of 223 lunations or Chaldaean Saros—and
                    that observations were made accordingly.</p>
                <p>The wonderful fame of Thales amongst the ancients must have been in great part
                    due to this achievement, which seems, moreover, to have been one of the chief
                    causes that excited amongst the Hellenes the love of science which ever
                    afterwards characterized them. Thales seems not to have left any writings behind
                    him, though as to this there appears to be some doubt (see Diog. Laer., i. 23).
                    Many anecdotes, amusing rather than instructive, are related of him, which have
                    been handed down by Diogenes Laertius and other writers. From some of them it
                    would appear that he was engaged in trade, which is indeed expressly stated by
                    Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Solon,</hi> c. 2). It is probable that in the
                    pursuit of commerce he was led to visit Egypt. Of. the fact that Thales visited
                    Egypt, and there became acquainted with geometry, there is abundant evidence.
                    Hieronymus of Rhodes (ap. Diog. Laer., i. 27) says, “he never had any teacher
                    except during the time when he went to Egypt and associated with the
                    priests.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>But the characteristic feature of the work of Thales was that to the knowledge
                    thus acquired he added the capital creation of the geometry of lines, which was
                    essentially abstract in its character. The only geometry known to the Egyptian
                    priests was that of surfaces, together with a sketch of that of solids, a
                    geometry consisting of some simple quadratures and elementary cubatures, which
                    they had obtained empirically. Thales, on the other hand, introduced <hi
                    rend="italic">abstract</hi> geometry, the object of which is to establish
                    precise relations between the different parts of a figure, so that some of them
                    could be found by means of others in a manner strictly rigorous. This was a
                    phenomenon quite new in the world, and due, in fact, to the abstract spirit of
                    the Greeks.</p>
                <p>The following discoveries in geometry are attributed to Thales :— (1) the circle
                    is bisected by its diameter (Procl., <hi rend="italic">οp. dt.,</hi> p. 157);
                    (2) the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are equal (Id., p. 250); (3)
                    when two straight lines cut each other the vertically opposite angles are equal
                    (Id., p. 299); (4) the angle in a semicircle is a right angle;<note

                    meaning of the statement of Pamphila (temp. Nero), ap. Diog. Laert., i. 24, that

                    circle.</p></note> (5) the theorem Euclid i. 26 is referred to Thales by
                    Eudemus(Procl., <hi rend="italic">οp. cit.,</hi> p. 352). Two applications of
                    geometry to the solution of practical problems are also attributed to him :— (1)
                    the determination of the distance of a ship at sea, for which he made use of the
                    last theorem; (2) the determination of the height of a pyramid by means of the
                    length of its shadow: according to Hieronymus of Rhodes (Diog. Laert., i. 27)
                    and Pliny (Λ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> xxxvi.
                    12), the shadow was measured at the hour of the day when a man’s shadow is the
                    same length as himself. Plutarch, however, states the method in a form requiring
                    the knowledge of Euclid vi. 4, but without the restriction as to the hour of the
                    day <hi rend="italic">{Sept. Sap. Cοηviv.,</hi> 2). Further, we learn from
                    Diogenes Laertius (i. 25) that he perfected the things relating to the scalene
                    triangle and the theory of lines. Proclus, too, in his summary of the history of
                    geometry before Euclid, which he probably derived from Eudemus of Rhodes, says
                    that Thales, having visited Egypt, first brought the knowledge of geometry into
                    Greece, that he discovered many things himself, and communicated the beginnings
                    of many to his successors, some of which he attempted in a more abstract manner
                    <hi rend="italic">{κaθολικ&lt;iτeροv)</hi> and some in a more intuitional or
                    sensible manner <hi rend="italic">(aισθητικωτeροd) {οp. dh,</hi> p. 65).</p>
                <p>From these indications it is no doubt difficult to determine what Thales brought
                    from Egypt and what was due to his own invention. This difficulty has, however,
                    been lessened since the translation and publication of the papyrus Rhind by
                    Eisenlohr;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ein mathematisches Handbuch der alten Aegypter,</hi> Leipsic,

                    in the last passage quoted above from Proclus, reference is made to the two
                    forms of his work,— <hi rend="italic">alσθηnκωreροv</hi> pointing to what he
                    derived from Egypt or arrived at in an Egyptian manner, while <hi rend="italic"
                    >κaθολικ&lt;iτepοv</hi> indicates the discoveries which he made in accordance
                    with the Greek spirit. To the former belong the theorems (1), (2), and (3), and
                    to the latter especially the theorem (4), and also, probably, his solution of
                    the two practical problems. We infer, then, [1] that Thales must have known the
                    theorem that the sum of the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right
                    angles. This inference is made from (4) taken along with (2). No doubt we are
                    informed by Proclus, on the authority of Eudemus, that the theorem Euclid i. 32
                    was first proved in a general way by the Pythagoreans (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pythagoras,</hi> vol. xx. p. 140); but, on the other hand, we learn from
                    Geminus that the ancient geometers observed the equality to two right angles in
                    each kind of triangle—in the equilateral first, then in the isosceles, and
                    lastly in the scalene (Apoll., <hi rend="italic">Cοniea,</hi> ed. Halleius, p.
                    9), and it is plain that the geometers older than the Pythagoreans can be no
                    other than Thales and his school. The theorem, then, seems to have been arrived
                    at by induction, and may have been suggested by the contemplation of floors or
                    walls covered with tiles of the form of equilateral triangles, or squares, or
                    hexagons. [2] We see also in the theorem (4) the first trace of the important
                    conception of geometrical loci, which we, therefore, attribute to Thales. It is
                    worth noticing that it was in this manner that this remarkable property of the
                    circle, with which, in fact, abstract geometry was inaugurated, presented itself
                    to the imagination of Dante :—</p>
                <p>“O se del mezzo cerchio far si puote</p>
                <p>Triangol si, ch’un retto non avesse."— <hi rend="italic">Par.,</hi> c. xiii.
                    101.</p>
                <p>[3] Thales discovered the theorem that the sides of equiangular triangles are
                    proportional. The knowledge of this theorem is distinctly attributed to Thales
                    by Plutarch, and it was probably made use of also in his determination of the
                    distance of a ship at sea.</p>
                <p>Let us now consider the importance of the work of Thales.</p>
                <p>I. In a scientific point of view: (a) we see, in the first place, that by his two
                    theorems he founded the geometry of lines, which has ever since remained the
                    principal part of geometry; (5) he may, in the second place, be fairly
                    considered to have laid the foundation of algebra, for his first theorem
                    establishes an equation in the true sense of the word, while the second
                    institutes a proportion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>II. In a philosophic point of view: we see that in these two theorems of Thales
                    the first type of a natural law, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the expression of
                    a fixed dependence between different quantities, or, in another form, the
                    disentanglement of constancy in the midst of variety—has decisively arisen.<note

                    III. Lastly, in a practical point of view: Thales furnished the first example of
                    an application of theoretical geometry to practice,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> p.
                    294.</p></note> and laid the foundation of an important branch of the same—the
                    measurement of heights and distances. For the further progress of geometry see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Pythagoras.</hi></p>
                <p>As to the astronomical knowledge of Thales we have the following notices :—(1 )
                    besides the prediction of the solar eclipse, Eudemus attributes to him the
                    discovery that the circuit of the sun between the solstices is not always

                    constellation of the Lesser Bear to his countrymen, and instructed them to steer

                <p>Whilst in virtue of his political sagacity and intellectual eminence Thales held
                    a place in the traditional list of the wise men, on the strength of the
                    disinterested love of knowledge which appeared in his physical speculations he
                    was accounted a “philosopher” <hi rend="italic">(φιλόσοφος).</hi> His
                    “philosophy” is usually summed up in the dogma “water is the principle, or the
                    element, of things but, as the technical terms “principle” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(aρχh)</hi> and “element” <hi rend="italic">(στoιχeωv)</hi> had not yet come
                    into use, it may be conjectured that the phrase “all things are water” <hi
                    rend="italic">(πάντα ΰδωρ eστl)</hi> more exactly represents his teaching.
                    Writings which bore his name were extant in antiquity; but, as Aristotle, when
                    he speaks of Thales’s doctrine, always depends upon tradition, there can be
                    little doubt that they were forgeries.</p>
                <p>From Aristotle we learn (1) that Thales found in water the origin of things; (2)
                    that he conceived the earth to float upon a sea of the elemental fluid; (3) that
                    he supposed all things to be full of gods; (4) that in virtue of the attraction
                    exercised by the magnet he attributed to it a soul. Here our information ends.
                    Aristotle’s suggestion that Thales was led to his fundamental dogma by
                    observation of the part which moisture plays in the production and the
                    maintenance of life, and Simplicius’s, that the impressibility and the binding
                    power of water were perhaps also in his thoughts, are by admission purely
                    conjectural. Simplicius’s further suggestion that Thales conceived the element
                    to be modified by thinning and thickening is plainly inconsistent with the
                    statement of Theophrastus that the hypothesis in question was peculiar to
                    Anaximenes. The assertion preserved by Stobaeus that Thales recognized, together
                    with the material element “water,” “mind,” which penetrates it and sets it in
                    motion, is refuted by the precise testimony of Aristotle, who declares that the
                    early physicists did not distinguish the moving cause from the material cause,
                    aud that before Hermotimus and Anaxagoras no one postulated a creative
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>It would seem, then, that Thales sought amid the variety of things a single
                    material cause; that he found such a cause in one of the forms of matter most
                    familiar to him, namely, water, and accordingly regarded earth and all that it
                    contains as water variously metamorphosed; and that, asking himself no questions
                    about the manner of its transformation, he was content “to see in the forces of
                    nature present deities” (Zeller).</p>
                <p>The doctrine of Thales was interpreted and developed in the course of three
                    succeeding generations. First, Anaximander chose for what he called his
                    “principle” (αρχή), not water, but a corporeal element intermediate between fire
                    and air on the one hand and water and earth on the other. Next, Anaximenes,
                    preferring air, resolved its transformations into processes of thinning and
                    thickening. Lastly, Heraclitus asserted the claims of fire, which he conceived
                    to modify itself, not occasionally, but perpetually. Thus Thales recognized
                    change, but was not careful to explain it; Anaximander attributed to change two
                    directions; Anaximenes conceived the two sorts of change as rarefaction and
                    condensation; Heraclitus, perceiving that, if, as his predecessors had tacitly
                    assumed, change was occasional, the interference of a moving cause was
                    necessary, made change perpetual. But all four agreed in tracing the variety of
                    things to a single material cause, corporeal, endowed with qualities, and
                    capable of self-transformation. A new departure was taken by the Eleatic
                    Parmenides (see vol. xviii. p. 315), who, expressly noting that, when Thales and
                    his successors attributed to the supposed element changing qualities, they were
                    untrue to the principle of monism, required that the superficial plurality of
                    nature should be strictly distinguished from its fundamental unity. Hence,
                    whereas Thales and his successors had confounded the One, the element, and the
                    Many, its modifications, the One and the Not-One or Many became with Parmenides
                    matters for separate investigation. In this way two lines of inquiry originated.
                    On the one hand Empedocles and Anaxagoras, abandoning the pursuit of the One,
                    gave themselves to the scientific study of the Many; on the other Zeno,
                    abandoning the pursuit of the Many, gave himself to the dialectical study of the
                    One. Both successions were doomed to failure; and the result was a scepticism
                    from which the thought of Greece did not emerge until Plato, returning to
                    Parmenides, declared the study of the One and the Many, jointly regarded, to be
                    the true office of philosophy. Thus, meagre and futile as the doctrine of Thales
                    was, all the Greek schools, with the solitary exception of that of Pythagoras,
                    took their origin from it. Not in name only, but also in fact, Thales, the first
                    of the Ionian physicists, was the founder of the philosophy of Greece.</p>
