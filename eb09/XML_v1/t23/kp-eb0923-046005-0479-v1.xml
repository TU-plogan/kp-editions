                <p><label type="entry">TORTURE</label>. It is proposed to treat in this place not so
                    much the innumerable modes of inflicting pain which have been from time to time
                    devised by the perverted ingenuity of man as the subject of legal torture as it
                    existed in the civilized nations of antiquity and of modern Europe, that is to
                    say, torture inflicted with more or less appearance of legality by a responsible
                    executive or judicial authority. From this point of view torture was always
                    inflicted for one of two purposes—(1) as a means of eliciting evidence from a
                    witness or from an accused person either before or after condemnation, (2) as a
                    part of the punishment. Torture, as a part of the punishment, may be regarded as
                    including every kind of bodily or mental pain beyond what is necessary for the
                    safe custody of the offender (with or without enforced labour) or the
                    destruction of his life,—in the language of Bentham, an <hi rend="italic"
                    >afflictive</hi> as opposed to a <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> punishment. Thus
                    the unnecessary sufferings endured in English prisons before the reforms of

                <p>The opinions of the best authorities have been in theory almost unanimously
                    against the use of torture, even in a system where it was as completely
                    established as it was in Roman law. “Tormenta,” says Cicero,<note

                    Su2lα,</hi> c. 28.</p></note> in words which it is almost impossible to
                    translate satisfactorily, “gubernat dolor, regit quaesitor, flectit libido,
                    corrumpit spes, infirmat metus, ut in tot rerum angustiis nihil veritati loci
                    relinquatur.” Seneca says bitterly, “it forces even the innocent to lie.” St
                    Augustine<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">De Civ. Dei,</hi> bk. xix. c. 6.</p></note> recognizes the fallacy
                    of torture. “If,” says he, “the accused be innocent, he will undergo for an
                    uncertain crime a certain punishment, and that not for having committed a crime,
                    but because it is unknown whether he committed it.” At the same time he regards
                    it as excused by its necessity. The words of Ulpian, in the <hi rend="italic"

                    impressive. “The torture <hi rend="italic">(quaestid)</hi> is not to be regarded
                    as wholly deserving or wholly undeserving of confidence; indeed, it is
                    untrustworthy, perilous, and deceptive. For most men, by patience or the
                    severity of the torture, come so to despise the torture that the truth cannot be
                    elicited from them; others are so impatient that they will lie in any direction
                    rather than suffer the torture; so it happens that they depose to contradictions
                    and accuse not only themselves but others.” Montaigne’s<note anchored="true"

                    beheaded or hanged will not restrain should be any more awed by the imagination
                    of a languishing fire, burning pincers, or the wheel.” Montesquieu<note

                    condemning it, but without giving reasons, and eulogizing England for doing
                    without it. The system was condemned by Bayle and Voltaire with less reserve.

                    subject. The influence of Beccaria in rendering the use of torture obsolete was
                    undoubtedly greater than that of any other legal reformer. The great point that
                    he makes is the unfair incidence of torture, as persons’ minds and bodies differ
                    in strength. Moreover, it is, says he, to confound all relations to expect that
                    a man should be both accuser and accused, and that pain should be the test of
                    truth, as though truth resided in the muscles and fibres of a wretch under
                    torture. The result of the torture is simply a matter of calculation. Given the
                    force of the muscles and the sensibility of the nerves of an innocent person, it
                    is required to find the degree of pain necessary to make him confess himself
                    guilty of a given crime. Bentham’s<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> vol. vii. p. 525.</p></note>
                    objection to torture is that the effect is exactly the reverse of the intention.
                    “Upon the face of it, and probably enough in the intention of the framers, the
                    object of this institution was the protection of innocence; the protection of
                    guilt and the aggravation of the pressure upon innocence was the real fruit of
                    it.” The apologists of torture, even among jurists, are not numerous. In fact,
                    theoretical objections to it are often urged by the authors of books of
                    practice, as by Damhouder, Von Rosbach, Von</p>

                    the former only upon slaves and freedmen or infamous persons—such as
                    gladiators—and where the truth could not be otherwise elicited, as in cases

                    with the empire (according to Dion Cassius under Tiberius) a free man became
                    liable to it if accused of a crime, though not as a witness. If a Christian, of
                    however high a condition, he was subject to torture during the period between
                    the edict of Diocletian in 303 and the edict of toleration of Galerius in 311.
                    This short period excepted, the liability of a free man depended upon two
                    conditions, the nature of the accusation and the rank of the accused. On an
                    accusation of treason every one, whatever his rank, was liable to torture, for

                    persons were protected by the dignity of their position or their tender age. The

                    was to be chained in prison before trial, nor could a prisoner be tortured while
                    awaiting trial. The rules as to the torture of slaves were numerous and precise.
                    It was a maxim of Roman law that torture of slaves was the most efficacious
                    means of obtaining truth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Cod.,</hi> i. 3, 8.</p></note> They could be tortured
                    either as accused or as witnesses, but against their masters only in accusations
                    of treason, adultery, frauds on the revenue, coining, and similar offences
                    (which were regarded as a species of treason), attempts by a husband or wife on
                    the life of the other, and in cases where a master had bought a slave for the
                    special reason that he should not give evidence against him. The privilege from
                    accusations by the slave extended to the master’s father, mother, wife, or
                    tutor, and also to a former master. On the same principle a freedman could not
                    be tortured against his patron. The privilege did not apply where the slave was
                    joint property, and one of his masters had been murdered by the other, or where
                    he was the property of a corporation, for in such a case he could be tortured in
                    a charge against a member of the corporation. Slaves belonging to the
                    inheritance could be tortured in actions concerning the inheritance. The adult
                    slaves of a deceased person could be tortured where the deceased had been
                    murdered. In a charge of adultery against a wife, her husband’s, her own, and
                    her father’s slaves could be put to the torture. A slave manumitted for the
                    express purpose of escaping torture was regarded as still liable to it. Before
                    putting a slave to torture without the consent of his master, security must be
                    given to the master for his value. The master of a slave tortured on a false
                    accusation could recover double his value from the accuser. The undergoing of
                    torture had at one time a serious effect upon the after-life of the slave, for
                    in the time of Gaius a slave who had been tortured could on manumission obtain
                    no higher civil rights than those of a <hi rend="italic">dediticius.</hi><note

                    the discretion of the judge, but it was to be so applied as not to injure life
                    or limb. The examination was not to begin by torture; other proofs must be
                    exhausted first. The evidence<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The evidence on which the accused might be tortured was
                    expressed in Roman law by the terms <hi rend="italic">argumentum</hi> and <hi

                    must have advanced so far that nothing but the confession of the slave was
                    wanting to complete it. Those of weakest frame and tenderest age were to be
                    tortured first. Except in treason, the unsupported testimony of a single witness
                    was not a sufficient ground for torture. The voice and manner of the accused
                    were to be carefully observed. A spontaneous confession, or the evidence of a
                    personal enemy, was to be received with caution. Repetition of the torture could
                    only be ordered in case of inconsistent depositions or denial in the face of
                    strong evidence. There was no rule limiting the number of repetitions. Leading
                    questions were not to be asked. A judge was not liable to an action for anything
                    done during the course of the examination. An appeal from an order to torture
                    was competent to the accused, except in the case of slaves, when an appeal could
                    be made only by the master.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    ecclesiastical tribunals would be accusations of heresy or Judaism—a specially
                    revolting form of heresy to mediaeval Christians—this theory practically
                    equalized all persons for the purpose of torture, in accordance with the
                    doctrine that in treason all were equal. The church generally secured the almost
                    entire immunity of its clergy, at any rate of the higher ranks, from torture by
                    civil tribunals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    >semiplena probatio</hi> existed against the accused,—that is, so much evidence
                    as to raise a grave and not merely a light presumption of guilt, often used for
                    the evidence of one eye or ear witness of a fact. If the accused confessed
                    during torture, and afterwards confirmed the confession, he was punished as

                    subjected to extraordinary punishment. One or two inquisitors, or a commissioner

                    occurrence of certain cases of abuse of torture, a decree of Philip II. was
                    issued, in 1558, forbidding the administration of torture without an order from
                    the council. But this decree does not appear to have been fully observed. By the
                    edict of the inquisitor-general Valdes, in 1561, torture was to be left to the
                    prudence and equity of the judges. They must consider motives and circumstances
                    before decreeing torture, and must declare whether it is to be employed <hi

                    not to be questioned on a particular fact, but was to be allowed to say what he
                    pleased. Torture was not to be decreed until the termination of the process, and
                    after defence heard, and the decree was subject to appeal, but only in doubtful
                    cases, to the Council of the Supreme. It was also only in doubtful cases that
                    the inquisitors were bound to consult the council; where the law was clear (and
                    of this they were the judges) there need be no consultation, and no appeal was
                    allowed. The judges, the registrar, and the executioners were the only persons
                    allowed to be present at the torture. They were to be careful that the jailer
                    suggested nothing to the accused during the torture. On ratification twenty-four
                    hours afterwards of a confession made under torture, the accused might be
                    reconciled, if the inquisitors believed him to be sincerely repentant. If
                    convicted of bad faith, he might be relaxed, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    delivered to the secular power to be burned. The inquisitors had a discretion to
                    allow the accused to make the canonical purgation by oath instead of undergoing
                    corporal torture, but the rule which allows this to be done at the same time
                    discountenances it as fallacious. It is remarkable that the rules do not allow
                    much greater efficacy to torture. They speak of it almost in the terms of Roman
                    law as dangerous and uncertain, and depending for its effects on physical
                    strength.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The rules will

                    the Inquisition, and in 1816 a papal bull decreed that torture should cease,

                    conferred on inquisitors by the dean and chapter of Santiago. See <hi

                    The rules in themselves were not so cruel as the construction put upon them by
                    the inquisitors. For instance, by Torquemada’s instructions torture could not be
                    repeated unless in case of retractation. This led to the subtlety of calling a
                    renewed torture a continuation, and not a repetition.<note anchored="true"

                    an inquisitor to a licentiate ordering the torture of an accused person, and
                    protesting that, in case of death or fracture of limbs, the fact is not to be

                <p>As the practice of torture, both by the civil and ecclesiastical power, became
                    more systematized, it grew to be the subject of casuistical inquiry by
                    churchmen, to an extent far exceeding the scanty discussion of the question in
                    the text of the canon law. It will be sufficient here to cite as an example the
                    treatment of it by Liguori, who incorporates the opinions of many of the Spanish
                    casuists. On the whole, his views appear to be more humane than the prevailing
                    practice. The object of torture he defines very neatly as being to turn <hi

                    of which deal with the nature of the sin of which the accused and the judge are
                    guilty in particular instances. A judge sins gravely if he does not attempt all
                    milder means of discovering truth before resorting to torture. He sins in a
                    criminal cause, or in one of notable infamy, if he binds the accused by oath to
                    tell the truth before there is proof against him. It is the same if without oath
                    he uses threats, terror, or exhibition of torments to confound the witness.<note

                    that it never recognized torture as legal One, perhaps the chief, reason for
                    this position taken by the law is the difference of the nature of the procedure
                    in criminal cases from that in general use in Continental countries. To use
                    words more familiar in foreign jurisprudence, the English system is <hi
                    rend="italic">accusatorial</hi> as distinguished from <hi rend="italic"
                    >inquisitorial.</hi> The common law of England has always shown itself averse to
                    the inquisitorial system, and so (at least in theory) to the torture which may
                    be regarded as an outcome of the system whose one end was to obtain a confession
                    from the accused. The tendency of the small amount of statute law bearing on the
                    subject is in the same direction. It was provided by Magna Charta, § 29, “that
                    no free man should be destroyed in any way unless by legal judgment of his
                    equals or by the law of the land.” On this Sir E. Coke comments, “No man
                    destroyed, &amp;c., that is, forejudged of life or limb, disinherited, or put to
                    torture or death.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Inst.,</hi> 485.</p></note> The Act of 27 Hen. VIII. c. 4 enacted
                    that, owing to the frequent escape of pirates in trials by the civil law, “the
                    nature whereof is that before any judgment of death can be given against the
                    offenders they must plainly confess their offence (which they will never do
                    without torture or pains),” such persons should be tried by jury before
                    commissioners under the Great Seal. Finally, the Bill of Rights provided that
                    cruel and unusual punishments ought not to be inflicted. The opinions of the
                    judges have been invariably against torture in theory, however much some of them
                    may have been led to countenance it in practice. The strongest authority is the
                    resolution of the judges in Felton’s case (1628), “that he ought not by the law
                    to be tortured by the rack, for no such punishment is known or allowed by our
                    law.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    task.</p></note> and Sir E. Coke. The latter says,—“As there is no law to

                    remarked that torture of the former kind was invariably ordered by the crown or
                    council, or by some tribunal of extraordinary authority, such as the Star
                    Chamber, not professing to be bound by the rules of the common law. In only two

                    council. Some of the more important instances are the following. In 1542 the

                    proceeded on a confession extorted by threats of the “pynebankis.” In 1567 four

                    ordained the committee appointed for the examination of prisoners to intimate to
                    Colonel Sibbald that if his examination were not satisfactory the parliament
                    would ordain him to be tortured. The judges, in 1689, were empowered by the
                    estates to torture Chiesly of Dalrye, charged with the murder of the Lord
                    President Lockhart, in order to discover accomplices. In the same year the use
                    of torture without evidence or in ordinary cases was declared illegal in the
                    Claim of Right. The careful wording of this will be noticed: it does not object
                    to torture altogether, but reserves it for cases where a basis of evidence had
                    already been laid, and for crimes of great gravity, thus admitting the dangerous
                    principle, founded on Roman law, that the importance of the crime is a reason
                    for departing from the ordinary rules of justice. However great the crime, it is
                    no more certain than in the case of a crime of less gravity that the person
                    accused was the person who committed it. A warrant issued in the same year to
                    put to the torture certain persons accused of conspiring against the Government,
                    and also certain dragoons suspected of corresponding with Lord Dundee. In 1690
                    an Act passed reciting the torture of William Carstares, a minister, in 1683,
                    and reestablishing<pb break="no"

                    man accused of rape and murder. In 1708 torture in Scotland was finally

                    both in witchcraft and in torture. The Act of 1649 already cited shows that the
                    principle survived him. Under the government of the dukes of Lauderdale and York
                    torture as a practice in charges of religious and political offences reached its
                    height. "The privy council was accustomed to extort confessions by torture; that
                    grim divan of bishops, lawyers, and peers sucking in the groans of each
                    undaunted enthusiast, in hope that some imperfect avowal might lead to the

                    and for their own purposes. There are several instances in the register of the

                    Want of space unfortunately prevents a detailed examination of the law of other
                    countries, but that of Italy may fairly be taken as the type of a system which
                    reached at its maturity a certain revolting completeness of which it is
                    difficult to speak with patience. The law as it existed in Italy is contained in
                    a long line of authorities, chiefly supplied by the school of Bologna, beginning
                    with the <hi rend="italic">glossatores</hi> and coming down through the <hi
                    rend="italic">post-glossatores,</hi> until the system attained its perfection in
                    the vast work of Farinaccius, written early in the 17th century, where every
                    possible question that could arise is treated with elaborate minuteness. The
                    writings of jurists were supplemented by a large body of legislative enactments
                    in most of the Italian states, extending from the constitutions of the emperor
                    Frederick II. down to the last century. It is not until Bartolus (1314-1357)
                    that the law begins to assume a definite and complete form. In his commentary on
                    book xlviii. of the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> he follows Roman law closely,
                    but introduces some further refinements: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> though
                    leading questions may not be asked in the main inquiry they are admissible as
                    subsidiary. There is a beginning of classification of <hi rend="italic"
                    >indicia.</hi> A very full discussion of the law is contained in the work on

                    his own admission, as the inventor of the torture of keeping without sleep. He
                    defines the question as <hi rend="italic">inqτιisitio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >veritatis</hi><hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">tormenta et</hi><hi

                    mental as well as the physical elements in torture. It was to be used only in
                    capital cases and atrocious crimes. The works of Farinaccius and of Julius
                    Clarus nearly a century later were of great authority from the high official
                    positions filled by the writers. Farinaccius was procurator-general to Pope Paul
                    V., and his discussion of torture is one of the most complete of any.<note

                    columns. The length at which the subject is treated is one of the best proofs of
                    the science to which it had been reduced. The chief feature of the work is the
                    minute and skilful analysis of <hi rend="italic">indicia, fama,
                    praesumptio,</hi> and other technical terms. Many definitions of <hi
                    rend="italic">indicium</hi> are suggested, the best perhaps being <hi

                    rend="italic">indicium</hi> is required. But this rule does not apply where it
                    is inflicted for discovering accomplices or for discovering a crime other than
                    that for which it was originally inflicted. Torture may be ordered in all
                    criminal· cases, except small offences, and in certain civil cases, such as
                    denial of a <hi rend="italic">depositum,</hi> bankruptcy, usury, treasure trove,
                    and fiscal cases. It may be inflicted on all persons, unless specially exempted
                    (clergy, minors, &amp;c.), and even those exempted maybe tortured by command of
                    the sovereign. There are three kinds of torture, <hi rend="italic"
                    >levis,</hi><hi rend="italic">gravis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >gravissima,</hi> the first and second corresponding to the ordinary torture of
                    French writers, the last to the extraordinary. The extraordinary or <hi
                    rend="italic">gravissima</hi> was as much as could possibly be borne without
                    destroying life. An immense variety of tortures is mentioned, the most usual
                    being the tying of one hand only with the cord. The judge could not begin with
                    torture; it was only a <hi rend="italic">subsidium.</hi> If inflicted without
                    due course of law, it was void as a proof. The judge was liable to penalties if
                    he tortured without proper <hi rend="italic">indicia,</hi> if a privileged
                    person, or if to the extent that death or permanent illness was the result. An
                    immense variety of tortures is mentioned, and the list tended to grow, for, as
                    Farinaccius says, judges continually invented new modes of torture to please
                    themselves. Numerous casuistical questions are treated at length. Could a priest
                    reveal an acknowledgment of an intended crime made to him in confession? What
                    kinds of reports or how much hearsay evidence constituted fame? How far was a
                    confession allowed to be extorted by blandishments or false promises on the part
                    of the judge? Were there three or five grades in torture? Julius Clarus of
                    Alessandria was a member of the council of Philip II.<note anchored="true"

                    extent he follows Farinaccius. He puts the questions for the consideration of
                    the judge with great clearness. They are—whether (1) a crime has been committed,
                    (2) the charge is one in which torture is admissible, (3) the fact can be proved
                    otherwise, (4) the crime was secret or open, (5) the object of the torture is to
                    elicit confession of crime or discovery of accomplices. He admits the tremendous
                    power given to a judge of torturing a witness should he suspect that the latter
                    knows the truth and is concealing it. An accuser may not be racked with the
                    accused in order to test his sincerity. The clergy can be tortured only in
                    charges of treason, poisoning, and violation of -tombs. On the great question
                    whether there are three or five grades, he decides in favour of five, viz.,
                    threats, taking to the place of torment, stripping and binding, lifting on the
                    rack, racking. Other Italian writers of less eminence have been referred to for
                    the purposes of this article. The burden of their writings is practically the
                    same, but they have not attained the systematic perfection of Farinaccius.

                    Venice, Decianus, Follerius, and Tranquillus Ambrosianus, whose works cover the
                    period from the 13th to the end of the 17th century. The law depended mainly on
                    the writings of the jurists as interpreters of custom. At the same time in all
                    or nearly all the Italian states the customary law was limited, supplemented, or
                    amended by legislation. That a check by legislative authority was necessary
                    appears from the glimpses afforded by the writings of the jurists that the
                    letter of the law was by no means always followed.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For instance, Paris de Puteo illustrates the
                    extra-legal cruelties sometimes practised by asserting that he saw a judge seize

                    to extort a confession.</p></note> The earliest legislation after the Roman law

                <p>Several instances of the torture of eminent persons occur in Italian history. The

                    poison. An analysis of the case was undertaken by Verri<note anchored="true"

                    puts in a clear light some of the abuses to which the system led in times of
                    popular panic. Convincing arguments are urged by Manzoni, after an exhaustive
                    review of the authorities, to prove the groundlessness of the charge on which
                    two innocent persons underwent the torture of the <hi rend="italic">canape,</hi>
                    or hempen cord (the effect of which was partial or complete dislocation of the
                    wrist), and afterwards suffered death by breaking on the wheel. The main
                    arguments, shortly stated, are these, all based upon the evidence as recorded,
                    and the law as laid down by jurists. (1) The unsupported evidence of an
                    accomplice was treated as an <hi rend="italic">indicium</hi> in a case not one
                    of those exceptional ones in which such an <hi rend="italic">indicium</hi> was
                    sufficient. The evidence of two witnesses or a confession by the accused was
                    necessary to establish a remote <hi rend="italic">indicium,</hi> such as lying.
                    (2) Hearsay evidence was received when primary evidence was obtainable. (3) The
                    confession made under torture was not ratified afterwards. (4) It was made in
                    consequence of a promise of impunity. (5) It was of an impossible crime.</p>

                    iron collar, the bilboes, the thumbscrew, and the scavenger’s daughter. There is
                    also a model of one of the forms of the rack. (J. Wf.)</p>
