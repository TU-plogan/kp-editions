                <p><label type="entry">TORRIGIANO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pietro (c</hi></label>.
                    1470-1522), a Florentine sculptor, was, according to Vasari, one of the group of
                    talented youths who studied art under the patronage of Lorenzo the Magnificent
                    in Florence. Ben. Cellini, reporting a conversation with Torrigiano, relates
                    that he and Michelangelo, while both young, were copying the frescos in the
                    Carmine chapel, when some slighting remark made by Michelangelo so enraged the
                    violent temper of Torrigiano that he struck him on the nose, and thus caused
                    that disfigurement which is so conspicuous in all the portraits of Michelangelo.
                    Soon after this Torrigiano visited Rome, and helped Pinturicchio in modelling
                    the elaborate stucco decorations in the Appartamenti Borgia for Alexander VI.
                    After some time spent as a hired soldier in the service of different states,
                    Torrigiano was invited to England to execute the magnificent tomb for Henry VII.
                    and his queen which still exists in the lady chapel of Westminster Abbey. This
                    appears to have been begun before the death of Henry VII. in 1509, but was not
                    finished till 1517. It consists of two colossal recumbent effigies in gilt
                    bronze on an altar-tomb of black marble, decorated with very graceful medallions
                    of the patron saints of Henry and his wife, and other enrichments in bronze. The
                    two effigies are well modelled, and have life-like but not too realistic
                    portraits. After this Torrigiano received the commission for the altar, retable,
                    and baldacchino which stood at the west, outside the screen of Henry VII.’s
                    tomb. The altar had marble pilasters at the angles, two of which still exist,
                    and below the <hi rend="italic">meηsa</hi> was a life-sized figure of the dead
                    Christ in painted terra-cotta. The retable consisted of a large relief of the
                    Resurrection. The baldacchino was of marble, with enrichments of gilt bronze;
                    part of its frieze still exists, as do also a large number of fragments of the
                    terra-cotta angels which surmounted the baldacchino and parts of the large
                    figure of Christ. The whole of this work was destroyed by the Puritans in the

                    Torrigiano to make him a magnificent tomb, somewhat similar to that of Henry

                    Florentine is called “Peter Torrysany.” For Henry VII.’s tomb he contracted to
                    receive £1500, for the altar and its fittings £1000, and £2000 for Henry VIII.’s
                    tomb. Other works attributed from internal evidence to Torrigiano are the tomb
                    of Margaret of Richmond, mother of Henry VIL, in the south aisle of his chapel,
                    and a terra-cotta effigy in the chapel of the Rolls.</p>
                <p>While these royal works were going on, Torrigiano visited Florence in order to
                    get skilled assistants. He tried to induce Ben. Cellini to come to England to
                    help him, but Cellini refused, partly from his dislike to the brutal and
                    swaggering manners of Torrigiano, and also because he did not wish to live among
                    “such beasts as the English.” The latter part of Torrigiano’s life was spent in
                    Spain, especially at Seville, where some terra-cotta sculpture by him still
                    exists. His violent temper got him into <pb break="no"
