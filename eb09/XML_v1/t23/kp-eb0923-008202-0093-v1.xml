                    1300-1361), was born about the year 1300 in Strasburg, where his father was a
                    wealthy burgher. It is probable that he entered the Dominican convent in his
                    native city about the year 1313, while Meister Eckhart was still professor of
                    theology (1312— 1320) in the monastery school. From Strasburg he went to the
                    Dominican college of Cologne, and some believe that his superiors sent him a few
                    years later to St James’s College, Paris. After his theological education was
                    finished he returned to Strasburg. In 1324 the pope placed under an interdict
                    these parts of Germany, including Strasburg, which supported the excommunicated
                    emperor Louis of Bavaria. It was one of the privileges of the Dominican and
                    Franciscan orders to be allowed to perform religious services when the secular
                    and all other regular clergy were silenced by an interdict. The Dominican order,
                    however, had taken the side of Frederick, and in most places refused to say
                    mass; but in Strasburg they remained in the deserted city, kept their churches
                    open, and administered to the citizens the consolations of religion. It is
                    supposed that this conduct of the Strasburg Dominicans was due to the influence
                    of Tauler. In 1339 the heads of the order interfered, and commanded the monks to
                    close their churches. The town council in return banished the Dominicans from
                    the city. Tauler, with some of his brethren, found refuge in Basel, although
                    that city, like Strasburg, sided with the emperor. During these years Basel was
                    the headquarters of the “Friends of God” <hi rend="italic">(Gottesfreunde,</hi>
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mysticism,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 133), and Tauler was
                    brought into intimate relations with the members of that pious mystical
                    fellowship. He returned to Strasburg probably in the year 1346. It is somewhat
                    difficult to trace his later life. The Black Death came to Strasburg in 1348,
                    and it is more than probable that, when the city was deserted by all who could
                    leave it, Tauler remained at his post, encouraging by sermons and personal
                    visitations his terror-stricken fellow-citizens. His correspondence with
                    distinguished members of the <hi rend="italic">Gottesfreunde,</hi> especially
                    with Margaretha Ebner, and the fame of his preaching and other work in
                    Strasburg, had made him known throughout a wide circle of pious people. He seems
                    to have made preaching journeys, in the later years of his life, to Cologne and
                    to other places in the Rhineland. He died in the year 1361.</p>
                <p>It is somewhat difficult to form an estimate of the religious life and opinions
                    of Tauler. Foι ’ many years the chief modern authority upon the subject was the
                    late Prof. C. Schmidt of Strasburg, whose views had been introduced into England
                    in Miss Winkworth’s book upon Tauler. According to Schmidt, Tauler ’ s religious
                    life divides into two parts, before and after what may be called his second
                    conversion. In the first period Eckhart rules his religious life; in the second
                    he is under the influence of the mysterious “Friend of God in the Oberland,”
                    whom Schmidt asserts to be Nicholas of Basel. Denifle doubts the historical
                    character of this episode and the genuineness of the book, while Preger admits
                    the fact of the conversion, but refuses to identify the mysterious stranger with
                    Nicholas of Basel.</p>
                <p>It is still more difficult to determine the precise nature of the theological
                    opinions of Tauler. Denifle maintains that the only genuine remains of Tauler
                    are the eighty well-known <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> included in the
                    earliest edition and four others in two manuscripts, all of which bear Tauler’s
                    name; Preger seems inclined to admit in addition the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sermons</hi> in the account of Tauler’s conversion; both critics exclude the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Book of Spiritual Poverty.</hi> Schmidt, on the other
                    hand, while admitting the authenticity of all the above-named sermons, calls the
                    <hi rend="italic">Book of Spiritual Poverty</hi> Tauler’s masterpiece.</p>
                <p>If we take the <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> by themselves, then Tauler’s
                    teachers in theology were the Pseudo-Dionysius, Augustine, Gregory, Bernard, the
                    two abbots of St Victor, Thomas Aquinas, and, above all, Theodoric of Freiburg
                    and Meister Eckhart. His theology will represent the purest and highest type of
                    German mysticism (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mysticism),</hi> and, by insisting
                    upon personal relationship to God, freedom from the thraldom of authority, and
                    the worthlessness of mere good works without the renewal of the inward life,
                    will represent a tendency in theology which found full expression in the
                    reformation of the 16th century. If, on the other hand, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Book of Spiritual Poverty</hi> be included among the genuine writings of
                    Tauler, then undoubtedly his views have more distinct connexion with that
                    doctrine of the appropriation of the benefits of Christ’s work of redemption by
                    an <hi rend="italic">imitatio Christi</hi> finding expression in a life of
                    evangelical poverty which is such a characteristic of the religious life of the
                    century to which he belonged. The problem is a very difficult one, and it may be
                    questioned whether we are yet in a position to solve it. Denifle is undoubtedly
                    correct in his statement that we need critical texts of 14th-century mystical
                    writers, and that very great uncertainty exists with reference to the authors of
                    the individual mystical writings of that period. It may be added that it is very
                    probable, when the organization and method of work among the “Friends of God”
                    are taken into consideration, that many mystical books of devotion were the
                    work, not of one, but of several authors, and that the conditions of the problem
                    concerning the authenticity of Tauler’s writings are not unlike those which
                    exist among the books and tracts ascribed to Wickliffe. This at all events may
                    be safely asserted, that Tauler’s sermons are among the noblest in the German
                    language. They are not so emotional as Suso’s, nor so speculative as Eckhart’s,
                    but they are intensely practical, and touch on all sides the deeper problems of
                    the moral and spiritual life.</p>
                <p>Tauler’s <hi rend="italic">Sermons -were</hi> printed first at Leipsic in 1498,
                    and reprinted with additions from Eckhart and others at Basel (1521, 1522) and.
                    at Cologne (1543). There is a recent edition by Julius Hamberger, Frankfort,
                    1864. See Denifle, <hi rend="italic">Das Buch von geistlicher Armuth,1877</hi>;
