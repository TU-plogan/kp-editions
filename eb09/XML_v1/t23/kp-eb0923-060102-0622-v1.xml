                <p><label type="entry">TSETSE FLY</label><hi rend="italic">(Glossina
                    morsitans).</hi> The tsetse fly, so much dreaded by the traveller in South
                    Africa, belongs to the sub-family <hi rend="italic">Muscinae</hi> and is closely
                    allied to <hi rend="italic">Stomoxys.</hi> It is scarcely larger than the common
                    house fly, which it resembles in its general shape. It can, however, be easily
                    distinguished by its colour and the position of its wings. These are longer than
                    the abdomen, and when at rest they project behind it, overlapping one another at
                    their tips. This gives the fly a longer and narrower outline than that of the
                    house fly. The colour is somewhat like that of the honey bee: the thorax is
                    chestnut brown with four longitudinal black stripes, the abdomen light yellow
                    with transverse bars of dark brown on its dorsal surface.</p>
                <p>The proboscis, with which the fly inflicts its sting, is grooved and contains two
                    long styles; and it is guarded by a pair of setose palps. At the base of the
                    proboscis is a dilated horny bulb, and in this swelling it is supposed that the
                    poison is secreted. The bite of the tsetse is innocuous to man and is not more
                    painful than that of a gnat. Large game, goats, and apparently all animals
                    whilst suckling, are also unaffected by it. But to the horse, ox, and dog it is
                    fatal. The poison may take effect after a few days, or the animal may remain
                    apparently unaffected for some months; but eventually symptoms of poisoning
                    appear. These symptoms seem to be rather variable; as a rule swellings arise
                    under the jaws and around the navel, the eyes and nose begin to run, and,
                    although the animal continues to graze, it becomes more and more emaciated,
                    suffers violently from purging, and at length succumbs to extreme exhaustion.
                    Post-mortem examination shows that the muscles, and especially the heart, are in
                    a very soft and flabby condition. The lungs and liver are affected, the gall
                    bladder distended with bile. The fat is of a greenish yellow colour and oily
                    consistency, the blood small in quantity and very thin, with hardly any power of
                    staining. At present no cure is known for the bite, nor does inoculation seem to
                    afford any protection. The fly is said to avoid animal excreta, and in some
                    parts a paste composed of milk and manure is smeared on cattle which are about
                    to pass through the “fly-belts.” This affords a certain amount of protection.
                    Lion’s fat is used in the same way, and is said to be efficacious.</p>
                <p>The fly is found as a rule in the neighbourhood of water, and its habitat is
                    usually sharply defined. Often it occurs on one side of a stream but not on the
                    other. The limits of the “fly-belts” are well known to the natives, and
                    travellers can ensure comparative safety to their cattle by passing through
                    these districts after sundown. The northern limits of the area inhabited by the
                    tsetse are not known. It is found throughout the valley of the Limpopo river,
                    but does not come much south of this, except in the eastern borders of the
                    Transvaal. Here it extends far south of Delagoa Bay, and infests the Lobombo
                    Mountains and the Amatonga country, reaching to the confines of Santa Lucia Bay.
                    It appeal’s to be gradually retreating northwards, following the big game.</p>
