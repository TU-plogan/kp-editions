                    ancient city in the fertile plain of Cilicia, lay on both sides of the Cydnus,
                    whose cool and swift waters were the pride of the city (Dio Chrys., vol. ii. p.
                    2, Reiske’s ed. <hi rend="italic">; Vita Apollon.,</hi> i. 7), and bore traffic
                    to and from the port of Rhegma. In the time of Xenophon <hi rend="italic"
                    >(A</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ι</hi><hi rend="italic">nαb.,</hi> i. 2.
                    23) Tarsus was already great and flourishing, and was the residence of the
                    vassal king of Cilicia. Its civilization at this time seems to have been mainly
                    Semitic, as was to be expected from the geographical relations of Cilicia, which
                    have generally associated its history with that of Syria. We have coins of
                    Tarsus (1Ι∏) of the Persian period, bearing Aramaic inscriptions; and the
                    deities of the town, known in later times as Heracles, Perseus, Apollo, Athena
                    (Dio Chr., ii. 22), seem to have been akin to those of the Phoenicians and
                    Syrians (see below). The Semitic influence was doubtless very ancient; indeed,
                    the Assyrians invaded Cilicia in the 9th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    at which date Tarsus is perhaps mentioned on the monuments under the name of
                    Tarzi (Schrader, <hi rend="italic">Keilinschr. und Gesch.,</hi> 1878, p. 240;
                    the reading is not certain). After Tarsus was Hellenized the citizens learned to
                    boast that they were Argives sprung from the companions of Triptolemus (Strabo,
                    xiv. 5. 12; Dio Chr., ii. 20), and the town became the seat of a famous school
                    of philosophy which was frequented almost exclusively by natives, but sent forth
                    teachers as far as Rome itself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>To Strabo s list must be added Zeno, the successor of
                    Chrysippus.</p></note> More than one of these philosophers, notably Athenodorus
                    the teacher of Augustus, and Nestor the teacher of Marcellus, held the chief
                    magistracy of the city. Athenodorus and his predecessors were Stoics, but Nestor
                    was an Academic (Strabo, xiv. 5. 14),<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that with which Paul would probably have come in contact if he gave heed to the
                    Greek wisdom of his native city. Presumably, however, he formed no higher
                    opinion of the culture of Tarsus than did his contemporary Apollonius of Tyana,
                    whose testimony as to the character of the citizens (<hi rend="italic">Vit.
                    Λp.,</hi> i. 7) is confirmed by Dio Chrysostom. Tarsus had made rapid material
                    progress since Cilicia became Roman (66 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> It was
                    the capital of a rich province, and had received freedom from Antony, and from
                    Augustus the dignity of a metropolis and important immunities for its commerce
                    (Dio Chr., ii. 36). The inhabitants were vain, effeminate, and luxurious, more
                    like Phoenicians than Greeks. Their sensuous Eastern religion in these golden
                    days of affluence had more attraction for them than the grave philosophy of the
                    Porch; and the legend supposed to be graven on the statue of Sardanapalus, at
                    the neighbour city of Anchiale, “let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die,”
                    which Paul quotes in 1 Cor. XV. 32, might have been the motto of the mass of the
                    townsmen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Athenaeus, v.
                    p. 215, tells of an Epicurean philosopher, Lysias, who, becoming priest of
                    Heracles, became tyrant of the city, taxing the rich to provide largesses for
                    the poor. The fact is probable, the date quite uncertain.</p></note> At Tarsus
                    the emperor Tacitus died, and Julian was buried. The city was deserted and lay
                    waste during the frontier wars of Greeks and Arabs in the first century of
                    Islam; a Moslem general, who saw the ruins, estimated its former population at
                    100,000 (Beladhori, p. 169). It was rebuilt and settled as a military colony and
                    frontier post by Hârùn al-Rashid in 787 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and
                    became a starting point of forays against the Christians. On such a campaign the
                    caliph Ma’mùn died, and was buried at Tarsus (833), having caught a fever, like
                    Alexander the Great, by bathing in the cold Cilician waters. Tarsus was
                    temporarily recovered to Christendom by Nicephorus Phocas, and again by the
                    crusaders under Baldwin. Finally it remained in the hands of the Turks.</p>
                <p>The Heracles of Tarsus was the Cilician god Sandan. Dio Chrysostom calls him the
                    <hi rend="italic">αρχηy6s</hi> of the Tarsians (ii. 23), and he may be
                    identified with the Baal of Tarsus named on the coins already spoken of. He was
                    worshipped by the periodical erection of “a very fair pyre” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ibid.</hi>), a rite presumably analogous to that described in the <hi
                    rend="italic">De Beα Syria,</hi> ch. 49; and the remarkable ruin of Dönük-tash,
                    a vast court with massive walls enclosing two lofty platforms of concrete,
                    probably marks the site of his sanctuary (see Perrot and Chipiez, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist, de l’Art,</hi> iv. 536 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and
                    Langlois, <hi rend="italic">Voyage dans la Cilicie,</hi> p. 265 s⅛ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>.). A tradition making Sandan the founder of Tarsus is
                    given by Ammianus (xiv. 8. 3); and, as the Greeks appear to have taken elements
                    of the myth of Sandan (including the pyre) into their legend of Sardanapalus,
                    this explains the current story that Sardanapalus founded Anchiale-and Tarsus in
                    one day (Arrian, ii. 5, 2; Athen., xii. p. 529 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">p</hi> On Sandan, see K. O.
                    Müller, in <hi rend="italic">Rhein. Mus.,</hi> 1829, and E. Meyer, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Z. B. Μ. G.,</hi> 1877, p. 736 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> Another
                    account in Ammianus makes Perseus the founder of Tarsus, and it appears from Dio
                    Chr. that he was almost or quite as much honoured. The footprint of Pegasus was
                    shown at Tarsus (Avienus, 1031 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; comp. Dio, ii. 24),
                    and his <hi rend="italic">τapσos</hi> (wing?) was said to have fallen there
                    (Alex. Polyh. in Steph. Byz., s.τ.). This worship reappears at Joppa. Apollo
                    “with the trident” had a sacred sword at Tarsus, which could be cleansed only by
                    the water of the Cydnus (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Bef. Orac.,</hi> 41), and is
                    probably the same as the <hi rend="italic">harpe</hi> shown on coins of
                    Hadrian’s time; if so, he is presumably a differentiated form of Perseus.</p>

                <p>The worship of Athena may be connected with the statement of Athenodorus (the
                    famous philosopher of Tarsus) that the ancient name of the city was Parthenia
                    <hi rend="italic">{Fr. Hist. Gr.,</hi> iii. 487); Abydenus in Eusb., <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrom,</hi> p. 35, ed. Schöne) ascribes the foundation of her
                    temple with its brazen columns and of the city itself to Sennacherib. Thus with
                    the Baal of Tyre there was worshipped an unmarried goddess, as in so many
                    shrines of Syria and Asia Minor. Dio Chi*., ii. 2, speaks also of Titans as
                    lords of the city. The reference is to Japetus (Japhet?), grandfather of Cydnus
                    (Athenodorus, <hi rend="italic">ut sup.).</hi></p>
