                <p><label type="entry">TARTARS</label> (more correctly <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tatars,</hi> but Tartars is the form generally current), a name given to nearly
                    three million inhabitants of the Russian empire, chiefly Moslem and of Turkish
                    origin. The majority—in European Russia—are remnants of the Mongol invasion of
                    the 13th century (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mongols),</hi> while those who
                    inhabit Siberia are survivals of the once much more numerous Turkish population
                    of the Ural-Altaic region, mixed to some extent with Finnish and Samoyedic
                    stems, as also with Mongols. The name is derived from that of the Ta-ta Mongols,
                    who in the 5th century inhabited the northeastern Gobi, and, after subjugation
                    in the 9th century by the Tungus Kidans, migrated southward, there founding the
                    Mongolian empire under <hi rend="smallcaps">Jenghiz Khan</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{q.v.).</hi> Under the leadership of his grandson (Batu) they moved westwards,
                    driving with them many stems of the Turkish Ural-Altaians towards the plains of
                    Russia. The ethnographical features of the present Tartar inhabitants of
                    European Russia, as well as their language, show that they contain no admixture
                    (or very little) of Mongolian blood, but belong to the Turkish branch of the
                    Ural-Altaic stock, necessitating the conclusion that only Batu, his warriors,
                    and a limited number of his followers were Mongolians, while the great bulk of
                    the 13th-century invaders were Turks. On the Volga they mingled with remnants of
                    the old Bulgarian Turkish empire, and elsewhere with Finnish stems, as well as
                    with remnants of the ancient Italian and Greek colonies in Crimea and Caucasians
                    in Caucasus. The name of Tatars, or Tartars, given to the invaders, was
                    afterwards extended so as to include different stems of the same Turkish branch
                    in Siberia, and even the bulk of the then little known inhabitants of the high
                    plateau of Asia and its north-western slopes, which was described under the
                    general name of Tartary. This last name has almost disappeared from geographical
                    literature, but the name Tartars, in the above limited sense, remains in full
                    use.</p>
                <p>The present Tartar inhabitants of the Russian empire form three large
                    groups,—those of European Russia and Poland, those of Caucasus, and those of
                    Siberia. The discrimination of the separate stems included under the name is
                    still far from completion. The following subdivisions, however, may be regarded
                    as established. (1) The Kazan Tartars, descendants of the Kiptchaks settled on
                    the Volga in the 13th century, where they mingled with survivors of the Bulgar
                    Turks and partly with Finnish stems. They number about half a million in the
                    government of Kazan, about 100,000 in each of the governments of Ufa, Samara,
                    and Simbirsk, and about 300,000 in Vyatka, Saratoff, Tamboff, Penza,
                    Nijni-Novgorod, Perm, and Orenburg; some 15,000 belonging to the same stem have
                    migrated to Ryazan, or have been settled as prisoners in the 16th and 17th
                    centuries in Lithuania (Vilna, Grodno, and Podolia); and there are some 2000 in
                    St Petersburg. In Poland they constitute 1 per cent, of the population of the
                    district of l·’tock. The Kazan Tartars speak a pure Turkish dialect; they are
                    middle-sized, broad-shouldered, and strong, and mostly have black eyes, a
                    straight nose, and salient cheek bones. They are Mohammedans; polygamy is
                    practised only by the wealthier classes and is a waning institution. Excellent
                    agriculturists and gardeners, very laborious, and having a good reputation for
                    honesty, they live on the best terms with their Russian peasant neighbours. It
                    may be added that, according to Μ. Yuféroff <hi rend="italic">{Étude éthn. mir
                    les Bachkirs,</hi> 1881), those Bashkirs who live between the Kama, Ural, and
                    Volga are not of Finnish origin, but in virtue of their history, language,
                    anthropological features, and customs must be regarded as Tartars. (2) The
                    Astrakhan Tartars (about 10,000) are, with the Mongol Kalmucks, all that now
                    remains of the once so powerful Astrakhan empire. They also are agriculturists
                    and gardeners; while some 12,000 Kundrovsk Tartars still continue the nomadic
                    life of their ancestors. (3) The Crimean Tartars, who occupied the Crimea in the
                    13th century, have preserved the name of their leader, Nogai. During the 15th,
                    16th, and 17 th centuries they constituted a rich empire, which prospered until
                    it fell under Turkish rule, when it had to suffer much from the wars fought
                    between Turkey and Russia for the possession of the peninsula. The war of 1853
                    and the laws of 1860-63 and 1874 caused an exodus of the Crimean Tartars; they
                    abandoned their admirably irrigated fields and gardens and moved to Turkey, so
                    that now their number falls below 100,000. Those of the south coast, mixed with
                    Greeks and Italians, are well known for their skill in gardening, their honesty,
                    and their laborious habits, as well as for their fine features, presenting the
                    Tartar type at its best. The mountain Tartars closely resemble those of
                    Caucasus, while those of the steppes—the Nogais—are decidedly of a mixed origin
                    from Turks and Mongolians.</p>
                <p>The Tartars of Caucasus, who inhabit the upper Kuban, the steppes of the lower
                    Kuma and the Kura, and the Araxes, number about 1,350,000. Of these (4) the
                    Nogais on the Kuma show traces of an intimate mixture with Kalmucks. They are
                    nomads, supporting themselves by cattle-breeding and fishing; few are
                    agriculturists. (5) The Karatchais (18,500) in the upper valleys about Elburz
                    live by agriculture. (6) The mountain Tartars (about 850,000), divided into many
                    tribes and of an origin still undetermined, are scattered throughout the
                    provinces of Baku, Erivan, Tiflis, Kutais, Daghestan, and partly also of Batum.
                    They are certainly of a mixed origin, and present a variety of ethnological
                    types, all the more so as all who are neither Armenians nor Russians, nor belong
                    to any distinct Caucasian tribe, are often called Tartars. As a rule they are
                    well built and little behind their Caucasian brethren. They are celebrated for
                    their excellence as gardeners, agriculturists, cattletenders, and artisans.
                    Although most fervent Shi'ites, they are on very good terms both with their
                    Sunnite and with their Russian neighbours. Polygamy is rare with them, and their
                    women go to work unveiled.</p>
                <p>The Siberian Tartars, mostly mixed with Finnish stems, are the most difficult to
                    classify. They occupy three distinct regions,—a strip running west to east from
                    Tobolsk to Tomsk, the Altai and its spurs, and South Yeniseisk. They originated
                    in the agglomerations of Turkish stems which in the region north of the Altai
                    succeeded the Ugro-Samoyedic civilization (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Siberia),</hi> and reached a relatively high degree of culture between the 4th
                    and the 8th centuries, but were subdued and enslaved by the Mongols. In the
                    meantime the following subdivisions of the Siberian Tartars may be accepted. (7)
                    The Baraba Tartars, who take their name from one of their stems (Barama), number
                    about 50,000 in the government of Tobolsk and about 5000 in Tomsk. After a
                    strenuous resistance to Russian conquest, and much suffering at a later period
                    from Kirghiz and Kalmuck raids, they now live by agriculture, either in separate
                    villages or along with Russians. (8) The Tcholyτn or Tchulym Tartars on the
                    Tcholym and both the rivers Yus speak a Turkish language with many Mongolian and
                    Yakut words, and are more like Mongols than Turks. In last century they paid a
                    tribute for 2550 arbalètes, but they now are rapidly becoming fused with
                    Russians. (9) The Abakan or Minusinsk Tartars occupied the steppes on the Abakan
                    and Yus in the 17th century, after the withdrawal of the Kirghizes, and
                    represent a mixture with Koibals (whom Castrén considers as partly of Ostiak and
                    partly Samoyedic origin) and Beltirs—also of Finnish origin. Their language is
                    also mixed. They are known under the name of Sagais, who numbered 11,720 in
                    1864, and are the purer Turkish stem of the Minusinsk Tartars, Koibals, and
                    Kyzyl or Red Tartars. Formerly Shamanists, they now are, nominally at least,
                    adherents of the Greek Orthodox Church, and support themselves mostly by
                    cattle-breeding. Agriculture is spreading but slowly among them; they still
                    prefer to plunder the stores of bulbs of <hi rend="italic">Lilium Martagon,
                    Paeonici, and Brythroniιιm Dens canis</hi> laid up by the steppe mouse <hi
                    rend="italic">{Mus socialis').</hi> The Soyotes, or Soyons, of the Sayan
                    Mountains, who are Finns mixed with Turks, the Uryankhes of north-west Mongolia,
                    who are of Turkish origin but follow Buddhism, and the Karagasses, also of
                    Turkish origin but much like the Kirghizes, and reduced now to a few hundreds,
                    are akin to the above. (10) The Tartars of the northern slopes of the Altai
                    (nearly 20,000 in number) are of Finnish origin. They comprise some hundreds of
                    Kumandintses, the Lebed Tartars, the Tchernevyie or Black-Forest Tartars, and
                    the Shors (11,000), descendants of the Kuznetsk or Iron-Smith Tartars. They are
                    chiefly hunters, passionately loving their <hi rend="italic">taiga,</hi> or wild
                    forests, and have maintained their Shaman religion and tribal organization into
                    <hi rend="italic">suoks.</hi> They live partly also on cedar-nuts and honey
                    collected in the forests. Their dress is that of their former rulers, the
                    Kalmucks, and their language contains many Mongolian words. (11) The Altai
                    Tartars, or “Altaians,” comprise—(α∙) the Mountain Kalmucks (12,000), to whom
                    this name <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n80/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0080-0071"/> has been given by mistake, and who have nothing
                    in common with the Kalmucks except their dress and mode of life, while they
                    speak a Turkish dialect, and (δ) the Teleutes, or Telenghites (5800), a
                    remainder of a formerly numerous and warlike nation who have migrated from the
                    mountains to the lowlands, where they now live along with Russian peasants.</p>
                <p>Finally, there are a number of Tartars in Turkestan and Central Asia. Without
                    including under this name the ·.Sarts and the Kuramintses of Turkestan, still
                    less the Kirghiz-Kazaks, it may be reckoned that there are still nearly 30,000
                    survivors of the Uigurs in the valley of the Ili, about Kuldja, and in the Khami
                    oasis.</p>
                <p>As is evident from the above, although the name Tartars originated in an
                    indiscriminate application of the word to the Turkish and Mongolian stems which
                    invaded Europe six centuries ago, and its gradual extension to the Turkish stems
                    mixed with Mongolian or Finnish blood in Siberia, it still represents an
                    aggregate of characters which warrant at least a provisional use of this genetic
                    name, if those to whom it is given are properly subdivided. It embodies stems
                    which, although widely distinct, still have some common ethnographical and
                    philological features, besides being to some extent of like origin and
                    history.</p>
                <p>The literature of the subject is very extensive, and bibliographical indexes may
                    be found in the <hi rend="italic">Geographical Dictionary</hi> of P. Semenoff,
                    appended to the articles devoted respectively to the names given above, as also

                    well-known works of Castrén, which are a very rich source of information on the
