                    Adolf</hi></label> (1802-1872), one of the chief revivers of Aristotelian study
                    in the present century, was born on November 30, 1802, at Eutin, near Lübeck. He
                    received his education at the gymnasium of his native town and at the
                    universities of Kiel, Leipsic, and Berlin, displaying from his earliest years an
                    extraordinary industry and thirst for knowledge. He was introduced to philosophy
                    by König, the rector of the gymnasium a Kantian; and at Kiel he came under the
                    influence of Reinhold and Von Berger, to the latter of whom, a follower of
                    Schelling, some of his own most characteristic views may be traced. At Berlin he
                    heard Hegel and Schleiermacher; but his university studies lay chiefly in the
                    direction of classics and classical philology under Wachsmuth, Hermann, and
                    Boeckh. The combination of the philosopher and the philologist, together with a
                    definitely historical turn of mind, is what is most distinctive of all
                    Trendelenburg’s work. He became more and more attracted to the study of Plato
                    and Aristotle, and his doctor’s dissertation, published in 1826, was an attempt
                    to reach through Aristotle’s criticisms a more accurate knowledge of the
                    Platonic philosophy <hi rend="italic">(Platonis de Ideis et Numeris Doctrina ex
                    Aristotele Illustrata).</hi> Recognizing the sphere in which his best life-work
                    could be done, he declined the offer of a classical chair at Kiel, and accepted
                    instead a post as tutor to the son of Herr von Nagler, postmaster-general, and
                    an intimate friend of Altenstein, the enlightened minister of education in
                    Prussia. He held this position for seven years (1826-33), occupying his leisure
                    time with the preparation of a critical edition of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Anima,</hi> and conscientiously extending his knowledge in all directions.
                    His acquaintance with Karl Ferdinand Becker, the philologist and scientific
                    grammarian, was of importance for his own views on the origin of the logical
                    categories and the relation of thought to language. In 1833 Trendelenburg was
                    appointed extraordinary professor in Berlin, and four years later he was
                    advanced to an ordinary professorship. During nearly forty years he proved
                    himself markedly successful as an academical teacher, treating in turn all the
                    usual philosophical disciplines, besides holding more select classes for the
                    study of Aristotle with advanced students. During the greater part of that time
                    he had also to examine in philosophy and pedagogics all candidates for the
                    scholastic profession in Prussia. He died on the 24th of January 1872.</p>

                <p>It was with a view to the philosophical preparation in the gymnasia that he
                    published (1836) his <hi rend="italic">Elementa Logices Aristo-telicae.</hi>
                    This useful little book contains a selection of passages from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Organon,</hi> giving in a connected form the substance of
                    Aristotle’s logical doctrine. The Greek text is furnished with a Latin
                    translation and notes, and at a later date Trendelenburg supplemented this book
                    with further explanations for the use of teachers <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Erläuterungen zu den Elementen der aristotelischen Logik,</hi> 1842). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Elementa</hi> has passed through eight editions, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Erläuterungen</hi> through three. In 1840 appeared the first of
                    his important works, which, under the modest title of <hi rend="italic">Logische
                    Untersuchungen,</hi> develops a coherent philosophical theory, besides acutely
                    criticizing other standpoints, and in particular the then dominant Hegelian
                    system. The <hi rend="italic">Logische Untersuchungen</hi> were, indeed, an
                    important factor in the reaction against Hegel which set in about that time in
                    Germany. Two articles written by Trendelenburg in the controversy which ensued
                    were republished separately, under the title <hi rend="italic">Die logische
                    Frage in Hegel's System</hi> (1843). A second and enlarged edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Logische Untersuchungen</hi> appeared in 1862, and a third in
                    1870. In 1846 he published the first volume of his “Historical Contributions to
                    Philosophy” (<hi rend="italic">Historische Beiträge zur Philosophie),</hi>
                    containing a history of the doctrine of the categories, which forms a pendant to
                    his own elaboration of the same subject in the <hi rend="italic">Logische
                    Untersuchungen.</hi> A second volume of the “Historical Contributions” appeared
                    in 1855, and a third in 1867, consisting of detached essays on points of
                    interest in the history of philosophy. A number of these are papers originally
                    read before the Prussian Academy of the Sciences, of which Trendelenburg was
                    made a member in 1846. He was secretary of the philosophico-historical section
                    from 1847 till 1871, and devoted much of his valuable time to the duties
                    devolving upon him. A number of his papers dealing with non-philosophical—mainly
                    with national and educational—subjects have been collected in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Kleine Schriften</hi> (2 vols., 1871). In 1860 the second of his
                    larger works appeared, <hi rend="italic">Naturrecht auf dem Grunde der
                    Ethik</hi> (second enlarged edition, 1868). In 1865 Trendelenburg became
                    involved in a controversy with Kuno Fischer on the interpretation of Kant’s
                    doctrine of space, which was carried on with no little acrimony for a number of
                    years. The war of 1870 drew from him a short treatise on the defects of
                    international law,— <hi rend="italic">Lücken im Völkerrecht.</hi> He had always
                    had a deeply patriotic interest in the political development of Prussia, and
                    through Prussia of Germany, and in the stormy times after 1848 had even acted
                    for a short period as deputy to the Prussian chamber.</p>
                <p>Trendelenburg’s philosophizing is conditioned throughout by his loving study of
                    Plato and Aristotle, whom he regards not as opponents but as building jointly on
                    the broad basis of idealism. His own standpoint may almost be called a modern
                    version of Aristotle thus interpreted. While denying the possibility of an
                    absolute method and an absolute philosophy, as contended for by Hegel and
                    others, Trendelenburg was emphatically an idealist in the ancient or Platonic
                    sense; his whole work was devoted to the demonstration of the ideal in the real.
                    But he maintained that the procedure of philosophy must be analytic, rising from
                    the particular facts to the universal in which we find them explained. We divine
                    the system of the whole from the part we know, just as from a torso we may
                    reconstruct a work of art; but the process of reconstruction must, in the case
                    of philosophy, remain approximative. Our position forbids the possibility of a
                    final system. Instead, therefore, of constantly beginning afresh in speculation,
                    it should be our duty to attach ourselves to what may be considered the
                    permanent results of historic development. The classical expression of these
                    results Trendelenburg finds mainly in the Platonico-Aristotelian system. The
                    philosophical question is stated thus—How are thought and being united in
                    knowledge? how does thought get at being? and how does being enter into thought?
                    Proceeding on the principle that like can only be known by like, Trendelenburg
                    next reaches a doctrine peculiar to himself (though based upon Aristotle) which
                    plays a central part in his speculations. Motion is the fundamental fact common
                    to being and thought; the actual motion of the external world has its
                    counterpart in the constructive motion which is involved in every instance of
                    perception or thought. From motion he proceeds to deduce time, space, and the
                    categories of mechanics and natural science. These, being thus derived, are at
                    once subjective and objective in their scope. It is true matter can never be
                    completely resolved into motion, but the irreducible remainder may be treated
                    like the <hi rend="italic">πρώτη ὓλη</hi> of Aristotle as an abstraction which
                    we asymptotically approach but never reach. The facts of existence, however, are
                    not adequately explained by the mechanical categories. The ultimate
                    interpretation of the universe can only be found in the higher category of End
                    or final cause. Here Trendelenburg finds the dividing line between philosophical
                    systems. On the one side stand those which acknowledge none but efficient
                    causes,—which make force prior to thought, and explain the universe, as it were,
                    <hi rend="italic">a tergo.</hi> This may be called, typically, Democritism. On
                    the other side stands the " organic” or teleological view of the world, which
                    interprets the parts through the idea of the whole, and sees in the efficient
                    causes only the vehicle of ideal ends. This may be called in a wide sense
                    Platonism. Systems like Spinozism, which seem to form a third class, neither
                    sacrificing force to thought nor thought to force, yet by their denial of final
                    causes inevitably fall back into the Democritic or essentially materialistic
                    standpoint, leaving us with the great antagonism of the mechanical and the
                    organic systems of philosophy. The latter view, which receives its first support
                    in the facts of life, or organic nature as such, finds its culmination and
                    ultimate verification in the ethical world, which essentially consists in the
                    realization of ends. Trendelenburg’s <hi rend="italic">Naturrecht</hi> may,
                    therefore, be taken as in a manner the completion of his system, his working out
                    of the ideal as present in the real. The ethical end is taken to be the idea of
                    humanity, not in the abstract as formulated by Kant, but in the context of the
                    state and of history. Law is treated throughout as the vehicle of ethical
                    requirements. In Trendelenburg’s treatment of the state, as the ethical organism
                    in which the individual (the potential man) may be said first to emerge into
                    actuality, we may trace his nurture on the best ideas of Hellenic antiquity. (A.
