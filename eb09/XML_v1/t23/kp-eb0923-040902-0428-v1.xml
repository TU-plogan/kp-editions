                    >Garofalo,</hi> a painter of the Ferrarese school. He was born in 1481 at
                    Garofolo, in the Ferrarese territory, and constantly used the gillyflower <hi
                    rend="italic">(garofalo)</hi> as a symbol with which to sign his pictures. He
                    took to drawing in childhood, and was put to study under Domenico Panetti (or
                    Laneto), and afterwards at Cremona under his maternal uncle, Niccolò Soriani, a
                    painter of credit, who died in 1499: he also freαuented the school of Boccaccio

                    months with Giovanni Baldini, acquiring a solid style of draughtsmanship, and
                    finally to Mantua, where he remained two years with Lorenzo Costa. He then
                    entered the service of the marquis Francesco Gonzaga. Afterwards he went to
                    Ferrara, and worked there four years, showing diligence and delicacy without
                    much severity or elevation of style. Attracted by Raphael’s fame, and invited by
                    a Ferrarese gentleman, Geronimo Sagrato, he again removed to Rome, and found the
                    great painter very amicable; here he stayed two years, rendering some assistance
                    in the Vatican frescos. From Rome family affairs recalled him to Ferrara; there
                    Duke Alphonso I. commissioned him to execute paintings, along with the Dossi, in
                    the Villa di Belriguardo and in other palaces. Thus the style of Tisio partakes
                    of the Lombard, the Roman, and the Venetian modes. He painted extensively in
                    Ferrara, both in oil and in fresco, two of his principal works being the
                    Massacre of the Innocents (1519), in the church of S. Francesco, and the
                    Betrayal of Christ (1524), accounted his masterpiece. For the former he made
                    clay models for study and a lay figure, and executed everything from nature.
                    Both in the Ferrarese territory and in Rome his pictures of small dimensions are
                    very numerous. He continued constantly at work until in 1550 blindness overtook
                    him,—an affliction which he bore with patience, being a man of pleasant friendly
                    disposition and of devout feeling. In the later years of his work he painted on
                    all feast-days in monasteries for the love of God. He had married, at the age of
                    forty-eight and died at Ferrara on 6th (or Ì6th) September 1559, leaving two
                    children.</p>
                <p>Garofalo combined sacred inventions with some very familiar details. A certain
                    archaism of style, along with a strong glow of colour, suffices to distinguish
                    from the true method of Raphael even those pictures in which he most closely
                    resembles the great master, and this is sometimes <hi rend="italic">very</hi>
                    closely. He was a friend of Giulio Romano, Giorgione, Titian, and Ariosto; in a
                    picture of Paradise he painted this poet between St Catherine and St Sebastian.
                    In youth he was fond of lute-playing and also of fencing. He ranks as the best
                    of the Ferrarese painters; his leading pupil was Girolamo Carpi. The Adoration
                    of the Magi, in the church of St George near Ferrara, and a Peter Martyr, in the
                    Dominican church, Ferrara (sometimes assumed to have been done in rivalry of
                    Titian), are among his principal works not already mentioned. The Palazzo Chigi
                    and the Palazzo Borghese contain numerous examples, and the London National
                    Gallery four, one of them being a Madonna and Christ enthroned, with St Francis
                    and three other saints.</p>
