                    town of Algeria, chef-lieu of an arrondissement in the department of Oran, lies
                    86 miles S.W. of Oran, 2625 feet above the sea, on a terrace on the northern
                    slope of a range of rocky hills (3430 feet). Its white minarets, towers, and
                    battlements rise picturesquely above the surrounding verdure, which is nourished
                    by numerous springs, and even in ancient days gave rise to the Roman name <hi
                    rend="italic">Pomaria.</hi> The various quarters are grouped around the
                    principal mosque,—the Jewish to the southwest, the Moorish to the south-east,
                    that of the merchants to the north-east, while the new town with the civic
                    buildings lies to the north-west. Of the sixty-four mosques which existed at the
                    period of the French conquest, several have disappeared. The great mosque has a
                    minaret adorned with marble columns, and cased with mosaic of the most varied
                    designs; a fountain of alabaster stands in the alabaster-paved inner court; and
                    seventy-two columns support the pointed arches of the interior. The mosque of
                    Abul Hasan, now used as a French and Arab school, has two series of arches,
                    which rest on alabaster pillars, and the courts are ornamented by sculptures of
                    great beauty and richness; the delicately carved cedar ceiling bears traces of
                    polychromatic painting. The mosque of El-Halawi is specially interesting for the
                    sculptured capitals of its magnificent alabaster columns. Tlemcen, besides
                    numerous other mosques, possesses a fine modern Roman Catholic church in the
                    Byzantine style and five synagogues. The military authorities occupy the Mehuar
                    or citadel, built in 1145, which separates the Jewish and Moorish quarters, and
                    was formerly the palace of the rulers of Tlemcen. Only the mosque and the
                    battlemented wall, flanked by two towers, remain of its former magnificence.
                    Among the antiquities preserved in the museum is the epitaph of Boabdil, the
                    last king of Granada, who died atTlemcen in 1494. The vast basin under the old
                    walls, now used as a reservoir (720 feet in length, 490 in width, and 10 in
                    depth), was apparently made for naval exhibitions by the sovereigns of Tlemcen.
                    The barracks of the Spahis occupy all that remains of Kissaria, a settlement of
                    European merchants from Pisa, Genoa, Catalonia, and Provence. Leather, saddles,
                    Turkish slippers, arms, and woollen goods are manufactured in Tlemcen; the
                    production of oil and flour and marketgardening occupy Europeans and natives;
                    good tobacco is also grown. There is an active trade in cattle, wool, grain, and
                    fruit. A railway (37 miles) is being built (1887) to connect Tlemcen with
                    Rahgun, its port. In 1886 the population (natives, Europeans, and Jews) was
                    19,745 (26,395 in the commune).</p>
                <p>The town was originally at Agadir (<hi rend="italic">Pvrnαriα},</hi> to the east
                    of the present site, where Roman inscriptions have been found. At the time of
                    the Arab invasion the district was held by the Beni Ifren tribe of Zenáta
                    Berbers, who ultimately founded here the sovereignty of the Beni Ya'lá
                    (1002-1080). In 1080 the Almoravid king, after besieging and sacking the place,
                    built a new town on the site of his camp. His successors reigned sixty-five
                    years, when, after holding Agadir four years against the enemy, they were
                    overcome by the Almohades, who massacred the inhabitants, rebuilt, enlarged, and
                    repeopled the ruined town, and surrounded Tlemcen and Agadir with a common wall.
                    Tlemcen now flourished greatly under the 'Abd al-Wãd, also a Zenáta dynasty, who
                    ruled first for the Almohades and after 1242 as nominal vassals of the Hafsites
                    of Tunis. In 1337.their power was temporarily extinguished by the Merinids, who
                    built the town of Mansura, west of Tlemcen. They left some fine monuments of the
                    period of their ascendency, which lasted twenty-two years. Once more, under the
                    'Abd al-Wãd, from 1359 to 1553, Tlemcen enjoyed prosperity, when it had a
                    population of 125,000, an extensive trade, a brilliant court, a powerful army,
                    and its finest buildings were reared. The Spanish occupation of Oran struck a
                    fatal blow at the European commerce of the town, which gradually lost all its
                    territory to the Turks after they had seized Algiers. When the French entered
                    Algeria the sultans of Morocco were worsted by the Kuluglis in their attempt to
                    hold the town. In 1834, and again in 1837, Abd el-Kader sought to re-establish
                    the ancient empire of Tlemcen, but the French definitely took possession in
                    January 1842.</p>
