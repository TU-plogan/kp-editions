                <p><label type="entry">HOLLAND</label> is the most usual English name of the country
                    which is nationally designated the Kingdom of the Netherlands <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Koningrijk</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic">Nederlaηderi).</hi>
                    The word, which is popularly explained as if it were Hollowland, and referred to
                    the same physical fact which has given rise to the terms Netherlands and the Low
                    Countries, appears in an older form as Holtland, and is thus evidently
                    equivalent to Wood-land. In French the usual expression is Pays-Bas, and in
                    German Niederlande.</p>
                <p>There is no country in Europe in which the character of the territory has
                    exercised so great an influence on the inhabitants as in the Netherlands; and,
                    on the other hand, no people has so extensively modified the condition of its
                    territory as the Dutch. In a description of Holland, consequently, the greatest
                    importance must be attached to the physical conformation of the country as it
                    was and is; and most of the peculiarities of the political and social condition
                    of the people must be considered in conuexion with this conformation.</p>
                <p>The size of Holland, being subject to perpetual diminution and increase, cannot
                    be indicated by a definite figure except as at some definite period; on the one
                    hand, there is loss of area still going on in consequence of the erosion of the
                    coasts, and, on the other hand, this is more than counterbalanced by a continual
                    acquisition of new ground due more especially to “impoldering ’’and draining
                    operations. In 1833 the surface of the Netherlands was only 2,270,959 hectares
                    (5,611,860 acres, 8768 square miles); on the 20th Oct. 1877, at the time of the
                    conclusion of the cadastral survey, it was 3,297,268 hectares (8,148,020 acres,
                    12,731 square miles).</p>
                <p>The kingdom extends from 53° 32' 2Γ ’ (Groningen Cape on Rottum Island) to 50°
                    45' 49" N. lat. (Mesch in the province of Limburg), and from 3° 23' 27" (Sluis
                    in the province of Zealand) to 7° 12' 20" E. long. (Langak-kerschans in the
                    province of Groningen). The greatest length from north to south, viz,, that from
                    Rottum Island to Eysden near Maestricht is estimated at 164 miles, and the
                    greatest breadth from south-west to north-east, or from Zwin near Sluis to
                    Losser in Overyssel at 144 miles. If the Zuyder Zee, the parts of Prussia which
                    encroach on the eastern side, and the projecting portions of Limburg and Zealand
                    are disregarded, the general form is almost an oblong. With the exception of
                    Greece and Great Britain, no country of Europe has so many inlets of the sea as
                    Holland.</p>
                <p>The Netherlands are bounded on the E. by the Prussian provinces of Hanover,
                    Westphalia, and the province of the Rhine, and on the S. by the Belgian
                    provinces of Liége, Limburg, Antwerp, and East and West Flanders. A purely
                    geographical boundary is formed to the W. and the N. by the North Sea, at the
                    N.E. corner by the Dollart, and from Stevensweert southward to the extreme
                    corner of Limburg (near Eysden) by the Maas or Meuse.<note anchored="true"

                    left bank of the river, measured, according to the treaty with Belgium, 19th
                    April 1839, art. <hi rend="italic">4,</hi> by an average radius of 1200 Dutch
                    fathoms (7874 feet) from the outer glacis of the fortress.</p></note> Natural
                    ethnographic frontiers, such as occur where two neighbouring peoples of
                    different origin, race, character, customs, and language are sharply marked off
                    from each other, do not exist in the case of the Netherlands. The Low German
                    element, indeed, of which the Netherlands form as it were the kernel, spreads
                    beyond Dutch limits both north-east along the coast of the German Ocean and
                    south-west into Belgium.</p>
                <p>As regards the seaward boundary—the coasts, rivermouths, and islands—it is
                    necessary, for a just comprehension of its character and of its influence on the
                    formation of the soil, to bear in mind that the coasts of the Netherlands shared
                    in the general vicissitudes of the southern shores of the German Ocean at the
                    time when the English Channel was still closed. Three periods may be
                    distinguished in the history of these changes. During the first a row of dunes
                    was formed on the sandy tongue of land which, beginning at Ostend, cut off and
                    formed into an inland lake a portion of the German Ocean, at that time washing
                    the diluvial strata; these are still indicated along the Dutch and the German
                    coasts by a series of dune-formations, sandbanks, and islands. In the second
                    period the separation between ocean and lake was still maintained, the
                    river-water gained the upper hand over the sea-water in the lake, the matter
                    brought down by the river began to settle, and the morasses and beds of
                    marsh-plants, reeds, and rushes <hi rend="italic">{derrie)</hi> were formed
                    which are now found above the old sand beds and below the present clay beds.
                    When in the third period the coasts subsided, the dunes were here and there
                    carried away by the rise of the waters, portions of the land were submerged,
                    and, mud being extensively piled up by the sea, the fertile clay <hi
                    rend="italic">(zeekleι)</hi> of the maritime provinces was formed, and at the
                    same time the mouths of the rivers were changed in position. And all this took
                    place on a still greater scale when the limestone rocks which united Calais and
                    Dover at last gave way and the great ocean with its heavier incidence of billows
                    and tides drove into the smaller sea. According to Dr Hartogh Heys van
                    Zouteveen,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Algeτneene Stαtistiek van Nederland,</hi> p. 61.</p></note>
                    150,000 hectares (370,670 acres) of land were lost on the coast of the German
                    Ocean, 385,000 hectares (951,390 acres) on the Zuyder Zee and the Wadden, 8432
                    hectares (20,836 acres) in the Dollart, 10,000 hectares (24,711 acres) in the
                    Biesbosch, and about 27,000 hectares (66,720 acres) more in other parts.
                    According to Dr Staring, the province of Groningen, even during the 18th and
                    19th centuries, has been harassed with inundations once in every 155 years,
                    Utrecht and North Holland south of the Y once in 83 years, South Holland once in
                    55 years, Friesland, Overyssel, North Holland north of the Y, and the coast of
                    North Brabant every 40 years; while the Netherlands in general have been visited
                    by such disasters in 1702, 1715, 1717, 1741, 1755, 1756, 1791, 1808, 1809, and
                    1825, or on an average once in every eleven years. In this last period, however,
                    of the history of the land the lordship of man ultimately began to make itself
                    felt. The formation of the first dykes to prevent inundations was quickly
                    followed by the construction of a connected system of earthen ramparts, behind
                    which the country lies secure, while at the same time hundreds of thousands of
                    acres of fertile land have been recovered from the sea. The area gamed from 1833
                    to 1877 has been already stated. The following table shows the amount reclaimed
                    by endyking down to the dates given :—</p>

                <p>To return to the present condition of the seaboard of the Netherlands,—it follows
                    from what has been said <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n71/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0071-0060"/> that it consists (1) of coasts still protected by
                    dunes or fringed with sandbanks and islands indicating the direction of ancient
                    lines of dunes; (2) of low coasts of seaclay provided with dykes which in more
                    than one quarter have been repeatedly extended so as to enclose land conquered
                    from the sea (the sea-polders); and finally (3) of some high diluvial strata
                    which rise far enough above the level of the sea to make dykes unnecessary. The
                    dunes follow the west and north-west coast almost without a break, except in a
                    few quarters where they have been removed and their place supplied by dykes or
                    rubble, as in North Holland between Huisduinen and Nieuwe Diep and between Kamp
                    and Fetten, in South Holland on Voorne, and in Zealand on Schouwen and
                    Walcheren, where the famous Westkappel dyke unites the village of Westkappel
                    with the watering-place of Dornburg. The breadth of the line of dunes naturally
                    varies greatly—from 600 to 7000 feet; and there is a similar variety in the
                    height of the individual dunes proper, called dune-hills <hi rend="italic"
                    >(duinheuvels)</hi> as compared with the dune pans <hi rend="italic"
                    >(dιdnpanιιen)</hi> or depressions. The elevation of the High Blinkert near
                    Haarlem (196 feet) is an extreme exception, for the average is not more than 50
                    or 60 feet even in the case of the high dunes which lie nearest the shore and
                    are known as “sea-runners” <hi rend="italic">(zeelooper)</hi> or the
                    “shore-ridge” <hi rend="italic">(strandreeks).</hi> The dunes show a tendency,
                    except where the Dutch prevent it by planting wood or sand-oats, to wear away on
                    the side towards the sea, and to “overstuiven” or drift off on the landward
                    side. There is, indeed, a general degradation of the coast, and à recession
                    towards the east, corresponding to the subsidence which may be observed along
                    the German seaboard, and probably traceable also, in part at least, to the
                    Channel current, which at mean tide has a velocity of 14 or 15 inches per
                    second, and especially during strong west or north-west winds carries off large
                    quantities of material. This alteration of coast-line appears at Loosduinen,
                    where the moor or fenland formerly developed behind the dunes now crops out on
                    the shore amid the sand, being pressed to the compactness of lignite by the
                    weight of the sand drifted over it. Again, the remains of the Roman camp at
                    Brittenburg or Huis te Britten, which originally lay within the dunes and, after
                    being covered by them, emerged again in 1520, were, in 1694, 1600 paces out to
                    sea, opposite Katwijk; while, besides Katwijk itself, several other villages of
                    the west coast, as Dornburg, Scheveningen, Egmond, have continually to be
                    removed further inland. Two things special to Holland are worthy of particular
                    notice, the artificial formation of dunes, as at Koegras, Callantsoog, Petten,
                    Katwijk, Scheveningen, and Zandvoort, and the carrying away of the sand <hi
                    rend="italic">(afzan-derij,</hi> “offsanding <hi rend="superscript"> ,1</hi>) by
                    ship or rail, as in the “Westland,” for example, to the south of the Hague, to
                    serve elsewhere for engineering operations and the improving of the soil.
                    Mingled with marsh-earth the sand forms a soil suited to the culture of
                    flower-bulbs; with clay it produces that excellent soil for vegetable gardens
                    for which the Westland is so famous. It must be further remarked that both the
                    “dune pans,” which are naturally marshy through their defective drainage, and
                    the “geest” grounds—that is, the grounds along the foot of the downs—have been
                    in various places either planted with wood or turned into arable and pasture
                    land; while the numerous springs at the base of the dunes rise at such a height
                    above the ordinary level of the country that the water is conveyed by canals to
                    the great cities, and an improvement is thus effected at once in the
                    agricultural condition of the coast-land and in the sanitary condition of the
                    cities.</p>
                <p>The sea-dykes are found along the northern coasts, the coasts of the provinces
                    which border on the Zuyder Zee, and the coasts of the islands of Zealand and
                    South Holland so far as they are not protected by dunes. Only in a few places,
                    it will be seen, are the sea-dykes unnecessary; as for example, in Friesland
                    between Stavoren and Olde Mirdum (the bold and steep Roυde and Mirduιn cliffs)
                    and near Doornspijk, 3 miles south of Elburg, where there are high grounds which
                    stretch 6 miles to the south-west of Harderwijk. The earthen dykes are protected
                    by stoneslopes and by piles, and at the more dangerous points also by
                    “zinkstukken” (sinking pieces), artificial structures of bulrushes, reeds, and
                    branches, laden with stones, and measuring some 400 yards in circuit, by means
                    of which the current is to some extent turned aside. The Westkappel dyke already
                    mentioned is 12,468 ft. long and 23 high, has a seaward slope of 300 ft., and is
                    protected by rows of piles and basalt blocks. On its ridge, 39 ft. broad, there
                    is not only a roadway but a service railway. When it is remembered that the
                    woodwork is infested by the pile worm (<hi rend="italic">Teredo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">navalis),</hi> tlιe ravages of which were discovered in 1731, the
                    enormous expense incurred in the construction and maintenance of the 1550 miles
                    of sea-dykes now existing may be imagined. The cost of construction is not
                    overestimated at 150,000,000 guilders or £12,500,000.</p>
                <p>The Dutch islands may be divided into two main classes —(1) those surrounded on
                    all sides by the German Ocean or its inlets, and (2) those surrounded entirely
                    or in great part by river arms, and separated by these from the mainland or from
                    each other. The first division again comprises two groups—(a) the islands Texel,
                    Vlieland, Terschelling, Amelιnd, Schiermonnikoog, and Rottum, which stretch in a
                    long arc from the north point of North Holland to the mouth of the Ems, and
                    indicate the old coast-line, so that they belong to the same
                    physico-geographical group with the islands along the German coast; and (5) the
                    islands Wieringen, Marken, Urk, and Schokland, which are the relics of the
                    stretch of country formerly comprising the present bed of the Zuyder Zee. In the
                    second class are to be reckoned the delta of the river Yssel (Camper Island) and
                    the islands belonging to the contiguous deltas of the Rhine, the Meuse, and the
                    Scheldt, including the island of Betuwe between the Rhine and the Waal and the
                    archipelago of South Holland and Zealand.</p>
                <p>As the river mouths of Holland must also be regarded as gulfs or inlets of the
                    sea, they may be noticed here. The average breadth of the Haringvliet at
                    Helvoetsluys is 8860 ft. and at Goedereede 18,045; that of the West Scheldt at
                    Ter Neuzen 15,420 ft., and at Flushing (Vlissingen) 13,780; that of the East
                    Scheldt at the harbour of Goes 13,780, and at the harbour of Zierikzee 13,450;
                    and that of the Roompot 21,650 to 29,530 ft.</p>
                <p>The varying characteristics of the coasts in different places give rise to
                    correspondingly different industries. As regards trade and navigation, the west
                    coasts with their shallows and sandbanks can be approached only by small vessels
                    of light draught (visscherspinken) unless where access is afforded by the inlets
                    of the sea, especially the mouth of the West Scheldt at Flushing, that of the
                    East Scheldt at Zierikzee, the Brouwershaven inlet between the islands of
                    Schouwen and Goeree, the Goeree inlet at Helvoetsluys, the Marsdiep at the
                    Helder, and the mouth of the Ems at Delfzijl, or where a way has been opened up
                    by engineering works as at Rotterdam and Amsterdam (by the new waterway to the
                    sea and the canal to Ymuiden). As we proceed from south-west to north-east the
                    places along the coast become less and less important: in the provinces of

                    islands Rottum, Schiermonnikoog, and Ameland are usually left in great measure
                    dry at ebb-tide.</p>
                <p>The elevation of the surface of the country ranges from about 650 ft. above to 16
                    or 20 ft. below the Amsterdam zero, which marks the mean high-water level in the
                    Y in front of the city. The circumstance that so much of it is below the
                    sea-level necessarily exercises a very important influence on the drainage, the
                    climate, and the sanitary condition of the country, as well as on its defence by
                    means of inundation. From the history of the formation of the soil already
                    given, and from the course of the rivers, it may be gathered that the low
                    grounds are in the west, and the higher in the south and east. According to the
                    relief map published by the minister of war (scale 1: 600,000), the provinces of
                    North and South Holland, the western portion of Utrecht as far as the Vaart
                    Rhine, Zealand, except the southern part of Zealand-Flanders, and also the north
                    west corner of North Brabant, all lie, with the exception of the dunes, below
                    the Amsterdam zero; while the eastern portion of the country, except a small
                    strip along the Zuyder Zee in the provinces of Guelderland, Overyssel, and
                    Friesland, as well as the lands in the neighbourhood of the Dollart, is situated
                    above it. The regular slope of the ground from south-east to north west, and the
                    position of the highest and the lowest points, are indicated by the same
                    authority. At Vaals, in the extreme south-east, the altitude is 656 ft., at

                <p>Of equal importance with the relief of the country is the geological composition
                    of the soil. It is evident from the history of the origin of the land that
                    Quaternary formations—alluvium and diluvium—must be well represented. In fact
                    they constitute no less than 99’9 per cent, of the surface of the Netherlands,
                    only ’ 1 per cent, thus remaining for all the older formations—the Tertiary and
                    the Secondary, including the extremely limited Jurassic.</p>
                <p>To the alluvial strata belong, in the first place, the fen (veen) strata, which
                    are subdivided into low fens, high fens, marsh fens, and the “dalgronden” or
                    “reclaimed high fens.” The low fens, which are found in Groningen, Friesland,
                    Overyssel, North and South Holland, and North Brabant (about the Langstraat),
                    have been formed of aquatic plants, and, in the upper layers, of moss; their
                    elevation is that of the mean sea-level; from them the “short turf,” the best
                    quality of peat, is obtained by dredging, and, when the standing water which
                    collects after the peat has been dug out has been drained off, they may be
                    turned into very productive arable land. The subsoil, on which the fertility
                    then depends, consists usually of clays and alluvial sand or dune strata, rarely
                    of diluvial sand strata. These low fens extend to no less than 904,597 acres, or
                    about 11 per cent, of the surface. The high fens, of which the greater part have
                    been “disfenned” or stripped of peat, are found in Groningen, Friesland,
                    Drenthe, Overyssel, and the “Peel” or Marsh of North Brabant, in the more
                    elevated plains or valleys. They have been formed of trees, heath-plants, and
                    moss, and furnish the softer, inferior kind of peat, the “long turf.” As the
                    removal of the peat has been followed by the construction of canals to carry off
                    the standing water, the high fens are of course free from marshes, but, resting
                    as they do almost everywhere on diluvial gravel and sand, they do not furnish so
                    fertile a soil as the low fens. They comprise 226,107 acres, or only about 2‘8
                    per cent, of the surface of the country. The marsh fens are composed almost
                    exclusively of a few species of sedge or carex, and constitute, not only in
                    their method of formation, but also in their character and situation, the
                    transition between the high and the low fens. They are widely scattered,
                    especially along small streams which carry off water mingled with fenny
                    materials, and are nowhere more numerously represented than in Drenthe, wher <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> e all the drainage is of this character. The marsh
                    fens occupy 168,551 acres, considerably less than the high fens. The
                    “dalgronden” are formed where regular peat-fields are laid out along specially
                    constructed canals, and the denuded surface is usually grubbed up for arable or
                    pasture land, or on rare occasions planted with wood. They comprise about
                    207,576 acres, and naturally increase in proportion to the decrease of the high
                    fens. We shall return to these “dalgronden” in connexion with the canals.
                    Besides the fens, the clay lands and certain of the sand-strata belong to the
                    alluvium. The clays—which furnish the richest arable soils, the most luxuriant
                    meadowland, and in some places the material for bricks and earthenware—may be
                    divided into the sea-clay, the river-clay, the stream-clay or green earth, and
                    the old sea-clay of the districts recovered from the water. The exceptionally
                    fertile sea-clay in the provinces of Groningen, Friesland, North and South
                    Holland, and Zealand occupies no less than 1,676,860, or about 20 per cent, of
                    the surface, while the river-clay, naturally situated along the banks of the
                    larger rivers, takes up 854,284 acres, or about 10 per cent. The boundary
                    between the sea-clay and the river-clay is formed in the case of these rivers by
                    the maximum high-water line. The streamclay or green earth, which is found, as
                    the former name implies, on the banks of the smaller rivers or streams, is
                    formed of course on a much smaller scale, and consists of a stratum on an
                    average from 3 to 5 feet thick, resting almost exclusively on the sand diluvium,
                    from which it is occasionally separated by a fenny stratum. It occurs in the
                    east, of Drenthe, Overyssel, and Guelderland, along the small tributaries of the
                    Vecht, along the Vecht, Regge, and Schipbeek in Overyssel, and in like manner in
                    North Brabant along the Dommel, Aa, Mark, and other unimportant streams. The
                    green earth not unfrequently contains iron ore; from this the metal is extracted
                    in Overyssel and Guelderland, and it is asserted that in thirty years the
                    natural processes replace the excavated mineral. The stream deposits occupy
                    about 2 per cent, of the surface—157,187 acres. Finally the old sea-clay of the
                    reclaimed districts covers 127,518 acres, or 1⅜ per cent, of the surface. As
                    already stated, the subsoil of the low fens is not everywhere clay. It is so in
                    the main in the provinces of North and South Holland, where the drainage
                    operations were consequently much more remunerative than in Friesland, and in
                    the east of Utrecht, where the fens rested upon sand. Estimating the total area
                    of the recovered districts at 197,690 acres, about five-eighths of this consists
                    of old sea-clay; and these portions, such as the Haarlem lake grounds, the
                    Beemster and Purmer polders in North Holland, and the Nieuwkoop and Zuidplas
                    polders in South Holland, are reckoned among the richest and most fertile. How
                    these low-lying areas have been endyked and drained, surrounded by canals and
                    kept dry by gigantic steam-pumps, has been explained under the heading <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Haarlem Lake.</hi></p>
                <p>The alluvial sand-strata (to be distinguished from the diluvial sand) may be
                    divided into (1) sand-drifts, (2) river-sand, riverdowns, and “heibanen,” and
                    (3) old sea-sand and the sea-dunes with the geest-grounds. The last of these
                    classes has already been considered in dealing with the sea-coast. The rivers
                    bring down their sand as well as their gravel, not so much from the more
                    elevated districts as from the diluvial valleys in which they have excavated
                    their channels. The beds of the rivers themselves consist likewise of sand,
                    mingled here and there with gravel or rolled and polished pebbles, and, where
                    the current is not too strong, covered with a layer of clay. If sand has been
                    accumulated, on the shore, the wind soon transforms it after the retreat of the
                    river into hillocks or river-dunes. When these contain a proportion of clay they
                    are more fertile than the sea-dunes. They occur on both sides of the Guelderland
                    Yssel (between Zalk and Oest), and on the Waal below Hulhuizen and opposite
                    Rossum; and various eminences in other parts of the country, such as
                    Agnietenberg near Zwolle, and the heights near Deventer, near Grafthorst
                    opposite Kämpen, and along the Meuse between Venlo and Mook, must be considered
                    as of similar origin. “Heibanen,” i.e., heath-tracks, so called on account of
                    their sterility, are beds of river gravel easily distinguished from the diluvial
                    gravel by the smooth, worn, and uniform appearance produced ages ago by the
                    action of the current. They are found, for example, in the Betuwe, about
                    Avezaat, and between Lienden and Waddenoijen. Sand-drifts are dune formations
                    originated by the action of the wind on the diluvial sand, where in one way or
                    other it has been stripped of the heath-crust. They extend to 179,220 acres, or
                    about 2∣ per cent, of the surface. The fen strata occupy in all 1,508,300 acres,
                    or 18⅜ per cent.; the clay strata 2,815,850 acres, or about 35 per cent.; the
                    alluvial sand strata 475,477 acres, or about 6 per cent.; and the whole alluvium
                    4,799,627 acres, or 59 per cent.</p>
                <p>The diluvial or sand and gravel strata of the Netherlands are far from being of
                    such economic importance as the alluvial strata. The agricultural
                    products—mainly buckwheat and rye—are neither so abundant nor so valuable as the
                    wheat and rape-seed of the clay soils; and neither stock-breeder nor
                    dairy-farmer obtains so satisfactory results. The boundary of the diluvial
                    strata maybe roughly indicated by a line running through Winschoten, Groningen,
                    Dokkum, Leeuwarden, Heerenveen, Steenwijk, Zwolle, Elburg, the coast of the
                    Zuyder Zee, Naarden, Utrecht, Rhenen, Bois-le-Duc, Breda, Bergen-op-Zoom, and
                    Antwerp. South and east of this line lies the diluvium, for the most part on the
                    surface, except in the places already mentioned where the fens, the river-clay,
                    the stream deposits, and the sand-drifts are situated, or in the extreme south
                    and east where the older strata make their appearance. To the north and west of
                    the line the only diluvial strata are those of the Zuyder Zee islands: in Texel,
                    Wieringen, and Urk the soil is of diluvial origin; and this probably holds true
                    also in whole or in part in Vlieland, Ameland, and Terschelling.</p>
                <p>The diluvial formations are subdivided into gravel-strata and sand-strata. To the
                    former belong (1) the Scandinavian, diluvium, in which occur granites and chalk
                    flints derived from Scandinavia, situated to the north of the Overyssel
                    Vecht(that is, in Groningen, Drenthe, the south-west of Friesland, and the
                    islands); (2) the mixed diluvium, which, besides the Scandinavian gravel
                    contains stone-grit from Munster, the Teutoburger Wald, and the districts along
                    the Rhine (it is situated between the Vecht and the Rhine, in Overyssel,
                    Utrecht, the Gooiland,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A
                    district formerly called Naardingeτland, on the southern shores of the Zuyder
                    Zee, including Naarden, Bussum, Huizen, Blaricum, Laren, Hilversum, and
                    Muiderberg.</p></note> and Guelderland); (3) the Rhine diluvium, destitute of
                    granite, but with many fragments of white quartz, basalt, and other kinds of
                    stone from the mountains along the river between Bonn and Coblentz (it lies
                    between the Waal and the Meuse); (4) the Meuse diluvium, containing materials
                    brought from the mountains higher up the stream; and finally (5) the Limburg
                    flint diluvium, like the preceding variety destitute of any plutonic or volcanic
                    rocks, but nevertheless consisting almost exclusively of flints occurring in the
                    neighbouring chalk formation.</p>
                <p>The sand-diluvium, which is of later date than the gravel, is found in great
                    level stretches at the foot of the hills of diluvial gravel, and contains no
                    pebbles or coarse gravel. It also occurs in the maritime provinces under all the
                    marine and fluvial formations. According to some authorities it owes its origin
                    to the influence of rain, or frost, or wind; according to others it has been
                    formed by the sea like the Kempen sand and that of the dunes, and then
                    transported by the south-westerly currents.</p>

                <p>In the diluvium must also be included the loess, which occupies a large
                    proportion of the province of Limburg. The whole diluvium comprises 3,308,330
                    acres, or about 40⅜ per cent, of the country, distributed thus:—Scandinavian 4⅜
                    per cent., mixed diluvium 4⅜, Rhine and Meuse diluvium and Limburg flint
                    diluvium 1, loess 1⅜, and lastly the sand diluvium, which includes the diluvial
                    riverbanks, 2,376,770 acres, or about 29 per cent.</p>
                <p>The older formations, which occupy a very limited area, occur in the east of
                    Guelderland and Overyssel, in the south of Limburg, and in Zealand-Flanders.
                    That they also form the substratum elsewhere, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in
                    Zealand and Brabant, is not improbable. The area of the Tertiary strata is 3425,
                    and of the Secondary 3746 acres.</p>
                <p>As regards the capabilities of the soil, Holland does not hold an exceptionally
                    favourable position,—34 per cent of the country consisting of good and about 2
                    per cent, of inferior clay land, while more than 45 per cent, is poor and
                    partially reclaimed sand, and fully 18 ’ 5 per cent, is covered with fens. The
                    following figures show the account to which the soil is actually turned :—64 ’ 3
                    per cent, consists of arable and pasture land, gardens, hay-fields, and
                    orchards; 6 per cent, is occupied by water and roads; 7 per cent, is woodland; 0
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 is covered with buildings; and the rest, or 22
                    per cent, must consequently be assigned to the waste lands, shores, and dunes,
                    the reed-beds, heaths, and fens. The extent of this uncultivated area is of
                    course being gradually diminished by the more general employment of improved
                    methods of drainage, by prevention of the progress of the sand-drifts, by
                    reclamation of the fens, by the extension of facilities for the carriage of
                    manures, and by the parcelling out of the mark-lands or commons which are now
                    used only as public pastures or for the digging of turf <hi rend="italic"
                    >(plaggen).</hi> The distribution of the cultivated lands in the several
                    provinces is considered below in connexion with the density of the
                    population.</p>
                <p>The Netherlands are watered by three main rivers—the Rhine, the Meuse or Maas,
                    and the Scheldt or Schelde, besides a great number of smaller streams. How the
                    Rhine breaks up into Rhine and Waal, Rhine and Yssel, Crooked Rhine and Lek, Old
                    Rhine and Vecht, and finally reaches the sea at Katwijk, may be seen from the
                    map; and also how the Meuse at Gorcum forms a junction with the Waal, flowing on
                    to Dort under the name of the Merwede, and thence continuing to the sea between
                    the South Holland Islands and South Holland, under the names of the North, the
                    Old, and the New Meuse. There too may be traced the course of the Scheldt, with
                    its broad mouths bounding the Zealand Islands and separating them from the
                    mainland of Flanders, or that of the Yssel by Deventer, Zutphen, and Kämpen to
                    the Zuyder Zee. These great rivers render very important service as water-ways,
                    as the following statistics may show :—</p>

                    water during the summer. As a drawback to the services rendered by the rivers
                    must be mentioned the damage inflicted by their inundations and ice-drifts, for
                    protection against which river-dykes were constructed as early as the days of
                    the Romans, and, in the lower reaches, more especially in the course of the
                    llth, 12th, and 13th centuries. It is only in a few places—for example, on the
                    right-hand side of the Rhine—that elevated banks are found. Elsewhere between
                    the dykes and the stream lie “forelands" or “outwerders,” which are usually
                    submerged in winter. That the rivers cannot at all times, any more than the sea,
                    be kept under control by the dykes is shown by the floods of 1775, 1776, 1784,
                    1799, 1809, 1820^ 1861, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The smaller streams are often of great importance. Except where they rise in the
                    fens, they call into life a strip of fruitful verdure in the midst of the barren
                    sand, and thus lead to the existence of many villages. The low-lying spaces at
                    the confluences, being readily laid under water, have been not unfrequently
                    chosen as sites for fortresses. As a matter of course, the streams are also
                    turned to account in connexion with the canal system,—the Holland Yssel, the
                    Gouwe, the Rotte, the Schie, the Spaarne, the Zaan, the Amstel, the Dieze, the
                    Amer, the Mark, the Vecht, the Zwarte Water (Black-water), the Kuinder, and the
                    numerous Aas in Drenthe and Groningen being the most important in this respect.
                    Largely by means of these natural water-ways the Dutch have formed for
                    themselves a network of canals, small and great, the united length of which
                    amounts to 1522 miles. The canals differ greatly in character in the different
                    provinces. In North Brabant and Limburg the Zuid Willemsvaart (South William’s
                    canal) unites Maestricht <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Weert and Helmond with Bois
                    le Duc •(’s Hertogenbosch), communicates by aside branch with Eindhoven, and has
                    a connexion with the canal from Maestricht to Liège. In Zealand the canals give
                    the towns of the interior communication with the sea or the river mouths; for
                    example, canals lead respectively from Terneuzen to Sas van Gent and to Ghent,
                    from Middleburg to Veere and from Middleburg to Flushing, from Goes to the
                    Eastern Scheldt, and from Zierikzee also to the Eastern Scheldt. The canal from
                    Hansweert to Wenιeldinge has been cut to allow ships to pass between the East
                    and the West Scheldt. In South Holland many canals serve the like purpose; thus
                    the Voorn canal unites the Haringvliet with the New Meuse, which does not allow
                    the passage of large vessels above Briel; and similarly on account of the many
                    banks and shallows in front of Helvoetsluys a new waterway has been opened up to
                    Rotterdam by widening the channel of the Scheur north of Rozenburg, and cutting
                    across the Hoek van Holland. The Goeree inlet unites that place with the
                    Haringvliet. Of a different character is the Zederik canal, which unites the
                    principal river of central Holland—the Lek—(at Vianen) by means of the Linge
                    with the Merwede (at Gorcum). As Rotterdam has its new water-way, so in North
                    Holland Amsterdam is connected with Nieuwe Diep by the canal <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Purmerend and Alkmaar; and, this canal being too shallow for the
                    largest class of vessels in cargo, the canal to Ymuiden has been constructed
                    across Holland-op-zyn-smalst (t.e., Holland at its narrowest). Amsterdam is
                    further connected with the Vecht by the Keulsche Vaart, and with the Lek and the
                    Zederik canal <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Utrecht by the Vaart Rhine. In the
                    province of Guelderland Nijkerk inlet unites that town with the sea, and
                    Apeldoorn communicates with Hattem north-east through the Grift canal and
                    south-east with the Yssel through the Dieren canal. A totally different
                    character belongs to the canals in the east and north-east of the country,
                    where, in the absence of great rivers, they form the only water-ways which
                    render possible the drainage of the fens and the export of peat, and unite the
                    lesser streams with each other. Thus in Overyssel the Willemsvaart connects
                    Zwolle and the Zwarte Water with the Yssel, the Dedemsvaart connects the Vecht
                    with the Zwarte Water near Hasselt, and a canal connects Almelo with Zwolle. In
                    Drenthe the Smildervaart <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n75/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0075-0064"/> or Drenther Hoofdvaart unites Assen with Meppel,
                    and receives on the eastern side the drainage canals of the Drenthe fens (the
                    Orange canal, the Beilerstroom, and the Hoogeveen Vaart), while the North
                    Willemsvaart unites Assen with Groningen. In the province of Groningen the chief
                    town communicates with Delfzijl and the Dollart both by the Damsterdiep and by
                    the new ship canal, while the canal to Wιnschoten brings it into connexion with
                    the flourishing fen colonies, such as Wildervank and Veendanι, which have sprung
                    up in the east of the province and in Drenthe. In Friesland, finally, there are
                    three ship canals :—that from Harlingen to the Lauwer Zee <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Franeker, Leeuwarden, and Dokkum; that from Leeuwarden to the Lemmer,
                    whence there is a busy traffic with Amsterdam; and that from Stroobos in the
                    east of the province (in connexion with Groningen) to Stavoren in the southwest.
                    It would be superfluous to enumerate the barge canals by which almost all the
                    large towns communicate with each other; and it is equally unnecessary to
                    mention all the lakes, which exist in great numbers, especially in Friesland and
                    Groningen, and are connected with rivers or streamlets. Those of Friesland are
                    of note for the abundance of their fish and their beauty of situation, on which
                    last account the Uddelermeer in Guelderland is also celebrated. The Roekanje
                    Lake near Briel is remarkable for the strong chalky solution which covers even
                    the growing reeds with a hard crust. Many of the lakes are nothing more than
                    deep pits or marshes from which the peat has been extracted.</p>

                    in the north to nine hours, and there is a correspondingly wide range of
                    temperature; it also belongs to the region of variable winds. The following

                <p>How largely the westerly winds predominate is shown by the following statistics.
                    On an average of ten years 5 per cent, of the winds were N., 5 N.N.W., 7 N.W., 6
                    W.N.W., 7 W., 10 W.S.W., 12 S.W., 7 S.S.W. (total 59 per cent.), and 7 S., 5

                <p>It cannot be said that the climate is particularly good; indeed to strangers it
                    is rather the reverse of pleasant. Fevers, colds, and, when proper precautions
                    are not taken, chest disease and consumption, are results of the changeableness
                    of the weather, which may alter completely within a single day. The heavy
                    atmosphere likewise, and the necessity of living within doors or in confined
                    localities, cannot but exercise an influence on the character and temperament of
                    the inhabitants. Only of certain districts, however, can it be said that they
                    are positively unhealthy; to this category belong some parts of Holland,
                    Zealand, and Friesland, where the inhabitants are exposed to the exhalations
                    from the marshy ground, and the atmosphere is burdened with the sea-fogs. To
                    what extent the healthiness of the different provinces varies may be seen from
                    the following table of the annual death-rate for the twenty-five y ears from
                    1840to1865 :—·</p>

                <p>That the density of the population must, apart from other causes, increase
                    through the acquisition and cultivation of new land, and that it visibly differs
                    very greatly according to the difference of the soil in the different provinces,
                    may be seen from the following table, wherein the increase of the percentage of

                <p>The greater density of population in the Holland provinces as compared with
                    Drenthe cannot be explained, however, merely by the character of the soil; the
                    variety of industries and the great number of large towns contribute to the
                    inequality. All the towns with 100,000 inhabitants and upwards (Amsterdam,
                    Rotterdam, and the Hague) are situated in the provinces of Holland; of the 36
                    communes with more than 10,000, 9 are in Holland, none in Drenthe; of the 35
                    communes between 10,000 and 4000, 9 are in Holland and 2 in Drenthe. The reason
                    why in the west, and especially in the district between Amsterdam and Rotterdam,
                    there is such a clustering of large towns, only surpassed in a few parts of
                    England and Belgium, is to be found in the facilities there afforded for earning
                    a subsistence. Holland is emphatically a country of large towns. According to
                    the census of 1869 there were forty∙four which had a population of upwards of
                    5000. The greatest of all was Amsterdam, with 256,154 inhabitants; and next in
                    order came Rotterdam, with 113,734. Two others had upwards of 50,000, the Hague
                    and Utrecht, respectively 81,881 and 57,085; Arnheim, Leyden, Haarlem,
                    Groningen, and Maestricht were all above 25,000; and Bois-le-duc, Delft, Dort,
                    and Leeuwarden above 20,000. The five towns of Nimeguen, Gouda, Helder,
                    Deventer, and Zwolle had each between 15,000 and 20,000; and Breda, Zutphen,
                    Zaandam, Amersfoort, and Kempen were all above 10,000, though less than 15,000.
                    Since that date many of these have considerably increased in size. In 1879
                    Amsterdam had about 300,000 inhabitants, Rotterdam 140,000, the Hague 100,000,
                    and Utrecht 70,000.</p>
                <p>As the density of the population varies within the narrow limits of the
                    Netherlands, so varies likewise the origin of the people. Although
                    ethnographically the whole population belongs to the Indo-Germanic family, or
                    more definitely to the Teutonic branch of it, the descendants of the Frisians
                    may be clearly distinguished in the north-west. The mouths of the Meuse separate
                    these from the descendants of the Franks, who pushed eastward across the Meuse
                    but never settled beyond the Waal, while the territory of the Saxons, who came
                    later from the east, extends no further than to the Utrecht Vecht. The
                    descendants of the Saxons consequently lie between those of the two first-named
                    peoples, although naturally much commingling has taken place between Frisians
                    and Saxons, and Saxons and Franks, especially in the towns and on the
                    newly-acquired lands. The representatives of the Semitic stock (Portuguese or
                    German Jews), though their influence is not unimportant, number only 50,000 or
                    60,000, of whom about 40,000 reside at Amsterdam. The descendants of the three
                    Teutonic peoples above named are very slightly distinguished from each other by
                    their physical, intellectual, and moral characteristics, and all the less so
                    because the Dutch type is not itself strongly marked and bears the traces of
                    foreign commixture; for many Flemings and Brabanters settled in the country at
                    the time of the revolt against Spain, many Germans, Englishmen, and
                    Scandinavians during the prosperity of the republic, and many Frenchmen after
                    the revocation of the edict of Nantes. The differences most clearly discernible
                    are in the old local laws, in the peculiar customs, and above all in the
                    dialects. Among these last must be distinguished the Holland dialect
                    (Hollandsch) spoken in the provinces of Holland and part of Utrecht; the Zealand
                    dialect (Zeeuwsch, in Staats Flanders inclining towards Flemish); the Brabantine
                    (modified), also spoken in a part of Limburg and the south of Guelderland; the
                    Lower Rhenish, which is again subdivided into the Guelderland, the Overyssel,
                    and the Drenthe dialects; and, finally, the Groningen dialect. The peasant or
                    country Frisian forms a completely separate language with a literature of its
                    own. It has not been at all satisfactorily determined in what parts of the
                    Netherlands the remains of a pre-German population are to be found, nor to what
                    extent they are to be distinguished from the Germans by the form of the skull;
                    but investigations are being carried on in this department of inquiry, and a map
                    is being prepared to indicate the boundaries of the various dialects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> -</hi> The government of the Netherlands·is regulated by
                    the constitution of 1815, revised in 1848, under which the king’s person is
                    inviolable and the ministers are responsible. The crown is hereditary in both
                    the male and the female line according to primogeniture; but it is only on the
                    complete extinction of the male line that females can come to the throne. The
                    crown prince or heir apparent is the first subject of the king, and bears the
                    title of the Prince of Orange. The king alone has executive authority. To him
                    belong the ultimate direction of foreign affairs, the power to declare war and
                    peace and to make treaties and alliances, the supreme command of the army and
                    navy, the supreme administration of the finances and of the colonies and other
                    possessions of the kingdom, and the prerogative of mercy. By the provisions of
                    the same constitution he establishes the ministerial departments, and shares the
                    legislative power with the first and second chambers. The heads of the
                    departments to whom the especial executive functions are entrusted are eight in
                    number,—ministers respectively of the interior, of public works (the
                    “waterstaat,” including trade and industry, railways, post-ofiice, &amp;c. ), of
                    justice, of finance, of war, of marine, of the colonies, and of foreign affairs.
                    They are appointed and dismissed at the pleasure of the king, usually
                    determined, however, as in all constitutional states, by the will of the nation
                    as indicated by its representatives. The members of the first chamber are chosen
                    by the provincial states from among those who bear the greatest burden of direct
                    taxation in each province, the proportion of persons thus eligible being 1 to
                    every 3000 of the population. North Brabant sends 5, Guelderland 5, South
                    Holland 7, North Holland 6, Zealand 2, Utrecht 2, Friesland 3, Overyssel 3,
                    Groningen 2, Drenthe 1, Limburg 3—or altogether 39. The duration of parliament
                    is nine years, a third of the members retiring every three years. The retiring
                    members are eligible for re-election. The members of the second chamber are
                    chosen in the electoral districts by all citizens of full age who pay direct
                    taxes varying according to local circumstances from 20 to 160 guilders. One
                    member is elected for every 45,000 of the population. At present (1880) there
                    are eighty-six; they must be at least thirty years old, and they cease to be
                    members if they take a salaried Government appointment. They discuss all laws,
                    and have the right of proposing amendments. Their teπn is four years, but they
                    are re-eligible. All communications from the king to the states-general and from
                    the states to the king, as well as all general measures relating to internal
                    administration or to foreign possessions, are first submitted to the
                    consideration of the council of state, which also has the right of making
                    suggestions to the king in regard to subjects of legislation and administration.
                    The king appoints the vice-president of the council, which consists of fourteen
                    members; he is himself the president, and can name councilors, to the number of
                    not more than fifteen, for special service.</p>
                <p>The provincial administration is entrusted to the provincial ] states, which are
                    returned by direct election by the same electors &lt; as vote for the second
                    chamber. The term is for six years, but ι part of the members retire every three
                    years. The president of the 1 assembly is the royal commissioner for the
                    province. As the provincial states only meet a few times in the year, they name
                    a committee of deputy-states to which the management of current general business
                    is entrusted, and which at the same time administers the affairs of the
                    communes. At the head of every commune stands a communal council, whose members
                    are chosen by the inhabitants for a definite number of years. The president of
                    the communal council, the burgomaster, is named by the king in every instance
                    for six years, and along with the magistrate to be chosen by and from the
                    members of the council is charged with the ordinary administration. The
                    provinces, as already stated, are eleven in number (the grandduchy of
                    Luxembourg, over which the king has control, is not incorporated with the

                <p>The amount expended on the war and marine departments is given above. The
                    standing army consists of infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineers, and
                    gendarmerie, forming together a force of 60,000 men, with 3000 horses. Less than
                    half, however, is kept in arms the whole year. The soldiers are raised partly by
                    voluntary enlistment, and partly by conscription. In 1876, 1877, and 1878 the
                    conscripts amounted to 10,808, 10,878, and 10,772 respectively. They are
                    selected from the males who have entered their twentieth year and are not
                    exempted for special reasons. The term of service in time of peace is five
                    years, but may be extended in time of war; the conscript recruits, however, so
                    far as the number of volunteers permits, are kept under arms for a few months
                    only. A portion of the annual contingent is appropriated to the marine service.
                    In the communes there are “schutterijen,” militia “trainbands,” which in time of
                    war serve for the defence of the country, and at all times for the maintenance
                    of order. Their actual term of service lasts only five years, but every male
                    inhabitant from his twenty-fifth to his thirty-fourth year is liable to be
                    called out. On the 1st of January 1879 there were of these on duty, in 88
                    communes, 212 companies, or 41,714 men, including 573 officers.</p>
                <p>The strength of the navy in 1879 was—home service, 17 ships with 3162 men; Indian
                    military marine, 23 ships with 1793 hands; auxiliary squadron, 4 ships with 900
                    hands; in the West Indies, 2 ships with 206 men. The fleet for the protection of
                    the “seagates,” or estuaries, coasts, roadsteads, and rivers on the 1st August
                    1878 amounted to 61 ships, of which 23 were armour-plated; 21 ships for general
                    service, of which 2 were armour-plated; besides 7 guardships and tenders and 7
                    training vessels. The strength of the marine corps was in July 1878 returned at
                    2055, and the number of guns carried by the navy at about 500.</p>
                <p>In accordance with the law of April 18, 1874, the military and naval defences are
                    supported by a system of fortification which embraces the following lines :—the
                    Nieuwe Hollandsche water-line from the Zuyder Zee by Utrecht, the Lek, and the
                    Merwede, through the district of Altena to the New Merwede; the line of the
                    Guelders valley and the Lower Betuwe; the lines of the Hollandsche Diep and the
                    Volkerak, of the mouth of the Meuse and the Haringvliet, and of the Helder; the
                    works for the protection of the river-crossings and the reception of troops on
                    the Yssel, the Waal, and the Meuse; the Amsterdam line from the German Ocean,
                    near Ymuiden, to the Zuyder Zee and the Nieuwe Hollandsche water-line; the
                    southern water-line from the Meuse above St Andries to the Amer below
                    Geertruidenberg; and the works on the Western Scheldt. As already mentioned, in
                    many cases the fortifications can be supplemented by extensive inundations.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Holland enjoy full religious as well as political liberty. Not
                    only is the free profession of his religious opinions guaranteed to every one by
                    the constitution; the same protection is accorded to all the various
                    ecclesiastical bodies; all the adherents of the different creeds have equal
                    civil and political rights, and equal claims to public offices, dignities, and
                    appointments; and all denominations possess perfect freedom of administration in
                    everything relating to their religion and its exercise.</p>

                <p>From this it appears that in the north-east the Protestant creed greatly
                    preponderates, and that the majority of the Roman Catholics are found in the
                    south, while both are fairly represented in the central provinces. That in the
                    last fifty years there has been over the whole population a steady increase in
                    the proportion of Protestants and Jews, and a corresponding decrease of Roman
                    Catholics, is evident from the following table :—</p>

                <p>The government of each of the Protestant bodies (with the exception of the
                    Baptists, who have no central authority) is in the hands of an assembly or
                    “synod” of deputies from the provincial judicatures. In the case of the Reformed
                    Church the affairs of the community are entrusted to the provincial synods. The
                    provinces are subdivided into “classes,” and the classes again into “circles”
                    (ringen), each circle comprising from 5 to 25 congregations, and each
                    congregation being governed by a “church council” or session. The provincial
                    synods are composed of ministers and elders deputed by the classes; and these
                    are composed of the ministers belonging to the particular class and an equal
                    number of elders appointed by the local sessions. The meetings of the circles
                    have no administrative character, but are mere brotherly conferences. The
                    financial management in each congregation is entrusted to a special court
                    (kerk-voogdij) composed of “notables” and church wardens. In every province
                    there is besides, in the case of the Reformed <pb break="no"

                    the ecclesiastical administration. For the whole kingdom this supervision is
                    entrusted to a common “collegium” or committee of supervision, which meets at
                    the Hague, and consists of 11 members named by the provincial committee and 3
                    named by the synod. Some congregations have within recent years withdrawn from
                    provincial supervision, and have thus free control of their own financial
                    affairs. As a Roman Catholic province Holland is divided into 5 dioceses—the
                    archbishopric of Utrecht, and the suffragan bishoprics of Haarlem, Bois le Duc,
                    Breda, and Roermund, which are severally divided into deaneries (dekanaten).</p>
                <p>The various denominations are subsidized by the state. The total thus expended in
                    1877 was £65,654.</p>
                <p>Primary education is being more widely diffused year after year, and at the same
                    time receiving increased support from the state. While in 1868 there were 3675
                    schools, attended by 437,311 pupils, and conducted by 10,375 teachers, the
                    corresponding figures for 1877 were respectively 3813, 522,861, and 12,292; and
                    while in 1858 the state, the provinces, and the communes expended only 1,278,894
                    guilders (==ls. 8d. sterling) on the schools, the expenditure for education in
                    1877 was 7,271,484 guilders. In 1875, 1876, and 1877 there were 841, 848, and
                    847 in every thousand boys between six and eight years of age at school, and
                    786, 796, and 803 out of every thousand girls; and from nine to eleven years of
                    age 881, 890, and 910 out of every thousand boys, and 812, 815, and 827 out of
                    every thousand girls. There is thus a steady decrease of non-attendance. The
                    improvement of primary education is shown by the growing decrease in the
                    proportion of conscripts who could neither read nor write: from 1846 to 1858
                    this was 22 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 82 per cent.; 1859-62, 19-79;
                    1863-67, 1774; 1868-71, 15 46; 1872-76, 13 13; and in 1876 only 11*99 per cent.
                    There are no bilingual schools in Holland, and teachers discourage the use of
                    the dialects. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>For secondary education there were in 1877 39 “burgher schools” (partly day
                    schools, partly night schools), with 372 teachers and 4319 pupils; 43 industrial
                    art and technical schools, with 203 teachers and 4145 pupils; 53 higher class
                    “burgher schools/’ having courses of 5 or 6, of 4, and of 3 years, with 620
                    teachers and 4000 pupils; the polytechnic school, with 12 professors and 13
                    teachers, and attended by 319 pupils; and the national school of agriculture at
                    Wageningen, with 100 pupils. Schools of navigation were maintained at Rotterdam,
                    Amsterdam, Helder, Terschelling, Vlieland, Harlingen, Schiermonnikoog,∙
                    Groningen, Delfzijl, and Veendam, with a total of 536 pupils and 26 instructors.
                    The secondary school for girls (with courses of 5 and of 4 or 3 years) were 12
                    in number, and had about 900 pupils and a teaching staff of 140. For secondary
                    education in 1876 the state expended 933,721 guilders, the provinces 24,329, and
                    the communes 906,618, making a total of 1,864,668, or £155,389 sterling.</p>
                <p>The higher education is provided for in the four universities of Leyden (founded
                    in 1575), Utrecht (1636), Groningen (1614), and Amsterdam (1877), with 45, 34,
                    31, and 41 professors, and 627, 401, 189, and 389 students respectively.
                    Instruction is also given by about 100 teachers to 1400 pupils in various
                    seminaries and theological schools; the number of Latin or grammar schools and
                    gymnasia in 1877—78 was 51, with 240 teachers and 1503 pupils. The total cost of
                    the higher education amounted to 1,057,694 guilders.</p>
                <p>A national institution at Leyden for the study of the languages, geography, and
                    ethnology of the Dutch Indies has given place to communal institutions of the
                    same nature at Delft and at Leyden, founded in 1864 and 1877. Military and naval
                    instruction are provided for by corps schools, by a training battalion at
                    Kämpen, an artillery training company at Schoonhoven, and scientific courses for
                    the several corps, by the royal military academy (founded 1828), the “school of
                    war” for officers, the royal navy institute at Willemsoord (1856), and by
                    training ships at Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Helvoetsluys for apprentice
                    boatswains, sailors, cabin-boys, pilots, and engineers. For the education of
                    medical practitioners, civil and military, the more important institutions are
                    the national obstetrical college at Amsterdam, the national veterinary school at
                    Utrecht, the national college for military physicians at Amsterdam, and the
                    establishment at Utrecht for the training of military apothecaries for the East
                    and West Indies.</p>
                <p>Of the numerous institutions in Holland for the encouragement of the sciences and
                    the fine arts, the following are strictly national —the royal academy of
                    sciences (1855), the royal Netherlands meteorological institute (1854), the
                    national academy of the plastic arts, the royal school of music, the national
                    archives, the royal picture gallery at the Hague, and the national gallery of
                    modern masters in the Pavilion at Haarlem, the national museum of antiquities,
                    the national museum of ethnography at Leyden, the τoyal collection of
                    curiosities at the Hague, &amp;c. Provincial scien tific societies exist at
                    Middelburg, Utrecht, Bois le Duc, and Leeuwarden, and there are private and
                    municipal associations, institutions, and collections in a large number of the
                    smaller towns. Among others of general utility are the society for the service
                    of the community <hi rend="italic">{Maatschappij tot nut van</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">t algemeen,</hi> 1784), and the geographical society at Amsterdam
                    (1873), Teyler’s Stichting or foundation, and the society of industry at
                    Haarlem, the loyal institute of languages, geography, and ethnology of the Dutch
                    Indies (1851) and the Indian society at the Hague, the royal institute of
                    engineers at Delft (1848), the association for the encouragement of music at
                    Amsterdam, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The agricultural methods vary according as the soils are sandy or clay. In the
                    first the “three-crop” system (two crops of rye and one of buckwheat) differs
                    widely from the careful Flemish method of cultivation, in which even the
                    pastures are manured. On the clay there is still greater variety both in the
                    modes of treatment and in the amount of care bestowed on weeding and draining.
                    The produce of the land is thus very different in the various provinces for the
                    same soil. The general value of the crops is gradually rising, as may be seen
                    from the following statistics, in which the higher figures cannot be altogether
                    ascribed to the greater extent of land brought under cultivation: improved
                    education and the influence of local associations for the advancement of the
                    interests of agriculture have contributed to the result. In 1851-60 there was
                    under cultivation in grain and other marketable crops 1,637,512 acres, in
                    1861-70 1,770,890 acres, and in 1871-75 1,860,850 acres. The total value of the
                    crops was £8,311,666 in 1851, £13,445,672 in 1862, £15,870,586 in 1871, and
                    £19,001,598 in 1875. Of the total acreage just mentioned about 25'9 per cent,
                    was devoted to rye, 17'3 to potatoes, 13 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 to
                    oats, 8'6 to buckwheat, 7 to beans and pease, 7'1 to barley, 5 to rape seed, 3
                    to flax and hemp, 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 to madder, 0’6 to garden
                    seeds, 0 2 to tobacco; while the rest is set apart for the special cultivation
                    of chicory, hops, beetroot, mangold wurzel, market-garden produce, flowers,
                    pharmaceutical plants, grapes, &amp;c. The woods or rather the plantations,
                    covering 6 per cent., consist·—of (1) the so-called forest timber (opgaandhout;
                    French, arbres de haute futaie),—including the beech, oak, elm, poplar, birch,
                    ash, willow, and coniferous trees; and (2) the copse wood (akkermaal or
                    hak-hout),—embracing the alder, willow, beech, oak, &amp;c. This forms no
                    unimportant branch of the national wealth.</p>
                <p>Stock-breeding varies in the different provinces. For cattle, Friesland and North
                    and South Holland take the lead as regards both quality and numbers; sheep are
                    best in Texel and North Holland, and most numerous in Drenthe, where their
                    preponderance is due to the number of commons which still remain unbroken up.
                    Pigs, for which the low lauds are peculiarly favourable, are reared in all the
                    provinces. Goats, mainly kept for their milk, are most numerous in Guelderland
                    and North Brabant. Guelderland, Friesland, Zealand, and Groningen possess the
                    greatest number of horses. Poultry, especially fowls, are generally kept. Bee
                    culture is mainly carried on in buckwheat and heath districts (Guelderland,
                    Overyssel, Drenthe, the Gooiland, and Utrecht). A bee market is held at
                    Veenendaal in Utrecht. Stock breeding is mainly carried on along with
                    dairy-farming and hay-making on the alluvial soils; and there the cereal crops
                    give way to fodder plants. The permanent pasture in recent years extends to some
                    2⅜ millions of acres, and clover, artificial meadows, &amp;c., occupy about
                    400,000. The production of milk, butter, and cheese amounts to the value of 90
                    millions of guilders (ls∙ ’ 8d. each); butcher meat produces 35 millions, and
                    wool, hides, fowls, and game 10 millions; while horse-breeding also yields a
                    total of 10 millions. In 1870 the number of horses was 252,200; cattle,
                    1,410,800; sheep, 900,200; goats, 156,900; and pigs, 329,100; whereas in 1876
                    the horses numbered 268,000; cattle, 1,439,257; sheep, 891,090; goats, 150,000;
                    and pigs, 352,000. The value of this live stock in 1870 was £22,087,375, and in
                    1876 £29,799,905.</p>
                <p>In the densely peopled Netherlands, with no extensive forests, hunting forms
                    rather an amusement than a means of subsistence, the only exception being the
                    pursuit of wild-fowl (ducks, geese, and snipes). Hares, partridges, wood-snipes,
                    finches, and thrushes are the only form of game; a few roebucks and deer are
                    found in Overyssel and Guelderland; rabbits are numerous in the dunes, and
                    sea-gulls’ eggs are gathered in the north of Texel, which consequently bears the
                    name of Eijerland <hi rend="italic">He.,</hi> Eggland).</p>
                <p>Much more important as a means of subsistence are the fisheries, which, however,
                    are not at present in a flourishing state. They are divided into the “deep-sea
                    fishery” (buitengaatsch) in the German Ocean, and the “inner” fisheries
                    (binnengaatsch) in the Zuyder Zee, the rivers of Zealand, and the inland waters.
                    The deep-sea fishery may be further divided into the great (the so-called
                    “saltherring”) fishery, mainly carried on from Vlaardingen and Maassluis, and
                    the “fresh-herring” fishery, chiefly pursued at Scheveningen, Katwijk, and
                    Noordwijk. The deep-sea fisheries also yield cod and flat fish. In the Zuyder
                    Zee flat fish, herrings, anchovies, and shrimps are caught off the islands uf
                    Urk and Marken and the coast towns of Vollenhove, Kämpen, Harderwijk, Huizen,
                    and Vollendern; and there are oyster banks near Texel. In the Zealand rivers

                <p>To obtain a correct idea of the trade of the Netherlands greater attention than
                    would be requisite in the case of other countries must be paid to the inland
                    traffic. It is impossible to state the value of this in definite figures, but an
                    estimate may be formed of its extent from the number of ships which it employs
                    in the rivers and canals, and from the quantity of produce brought to the public
                    markets or daily transported by thousands of carts and delivered by the peasant
                    direct to the salesman. Of the market traffic, even in places of secondary rank,
                    the following facts may give some idea. There are yearly brought to market at
                    Gorcum and Hoorn from 10,000 to 13,000 head of cattle; at Barneveld, more than
                    20,000 sheep; at Alkmaar about 10 million and at Hoorn 5⅜ million tb cheese; at
                    Delft 1⅜ million tb butter and 2 million tb cheese; at Meppel 3 million tb
                    butter; at Leeuwarden 9 to 11 million lb butter, 2 million tb cheese, and 7⅜
                    million lb of grain and seeds; at the Overyssel markets Zwolle, Deventer, and
                    Kämpen, and at Steenwijk and Almelo, 7⅜ million lb butter; at Utrecht 770,000
                    and at Groningen 330,000 bushels of grain and seeds. The turn-over at the cattle
                    market at Leyden in 1877 was £639,278. In 1877 there were 7 00 steamboats afloat
                    on the rivers and canals in the service of the inland traffic.</p>
                <p>The foreign trade, although less than it was formerly, still continues to be
                    considerable in proportion to the size of the country. In 1878 the merchant
                    marine consisted of 1277 vessels of 958,652 cubic metres (the register ton is
                    equal to 2'83 cubic metres); of which 79 were steamships of about 200,000 cubic
                    metres. In 1877 there entered 8166 vessels with 3,000,000 tons, and cleared 4936
                    vessels with 1,800,000 tons; to which must be added 20,500 vessels with
                    2,400,000 tons, which came down the rivers in cargo from foreign countries, and
                    11,850 vessels, with 1,500,000 tons, w hich passed the frontier upward
                    bound.</p>
                <p>The extent of the trade and its increase or decrease from year to year is shown
                    approximately in the following table<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The six ports which take the largest share in the foreign trade are Amsterdam,
                    Rotterdam, Helder, Dort, Schiedam, and Harlingen; at a considerable distance
                    follow Groningen, Middelbur«*, Vlaardingen, Purmerend, Zaandam, Edam, Zwolle,
                    Kämpen, and Delfzijl. The returns of recent years show best in the case of the
                    South Holland towns; but it must be kept in view that the direct imports, the
                    so-called “proper trade,” are most important at Amsterdam, while a great part of
                    the commercial business at Rotterdam belongs to the commission and transit
                    trade. For exports Rotterdam is by far the most important, sending out nearly
                    thrice as much as Amsterdam.</p>
                <p>An examination of its lists of exports and imports will show that Holland
                    receives from its colonies its spiceries, coffee, sugar, tobacco, indigo,
                    cinnamon; from England, Prussia, and Belgium its manufactured goods and coals;
                    grain from the Baltic provinces, Archangel, and the ports of the Black Sea;
                    pease and beans from Prussia, timber from Norway and the basin of the Rhine,
                    yarn from England, wine from France, hops from Bavaria and Alsace; while in its
                    turn it sends its colonial wares to Germany, its agricultural produce to the
                    London market, its fish to Belgium and Germany, and its cheese to Fiance,
                    Belgium, and Hamburg, as well as England. The briskest trade is carried on with
                    Germany and England; thin follow Java, France, Russia, the United States,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The mineral resources of Holland give no encouragement to industrial activity,
                    with the exception of the coal mining in Limburg, the smelting of iron ore in
                    four furnaces in Overyssel and Guelderland, the use of stone and gravel in the
                    making of dykes and roads and of clay in brick works and potteries, the
                    quarrying of stone at St Pietersberg, &amp;c. Still the industry of the country
                    has developed itself in a remarkable manner since the separation of Belgium, and
                    that in spite of the lack of iron and coal, and the rivalry of other productive
                    forms of labour. The greatest activity is shown in the cotton industry, which
                    especially flourishes in Twenthe (in Overyssel) and also at Haarlem and
                    Veenendaal. In the manufacture of woollen goods Tilburg ranks first, followed by
                    Leyden, Utrecht, and Eindhoven; that of half woollens is best developed at
                    Roermond and Helmond. The cotton and woollen manufactures together furnish
                    employment to 20,000 hands. The linen manufacture is carried on especially in
                    Meierij van den Bosch, Helmond, Boxtel, Woensel, &amp;c. Even iron works and
                    ma&lt;dιine factories have greatly increased since the free importation of the
                    raw material was permitted—for example, at Amsterdam and at Fijenoord opposite
                    Rotterdam; and in this department more than 6000 workers are employed throughout
                    the country. It need hardly be said that shipbuilding is of no small importance
                    in the Netherlands, not only in the greater but also in the smaller towns along
                    the rivers and canals; and it is naturally associated with ropespinning and
                    other auxiliary crafts. Among the less noteworthy branches of industry are the
                    making of cigars and snuff, especially at Eindhoven, Amsterdam, Utrecht, and
                    Kämpen; diamond-cutting at Amsterdam; beetroot-sugar refining at Amsterdam;
                    papermaking in the Veluwe, on the Zaan, and in Limburg; shoemaking and
                    leather-tanning in Brabant (Langstraat); mat-plaiting and broom-making at
                    Genemuiden and Blokzijl; the manufacture of glass, crystal, and earthenware at
                    Maestricht; carpet-weaving at Deventer; working in gold and silver in North and
                    South Holland and on a smaller scale at Schoonhoven; and the distillation of
                    brandy, gin, and liqueurs at Schiedam, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam. The number of
                    hands occupied in the manufactories throughout the whole of the Netherlands is
                    estimated at about 100,000, of whom three-fourths are settled in North and South
                    Holland, North Brabant, and Overyssel. The following table shows how great has
                    been the industrial development of the last thirty years :—</p>

                <p>As the development of trade and industry and agriculture was promoted by the
                    improvement of education and the abolition of transit and export dues and the
                    lessening of import dues, so also has it been advanced by the improvement of the
                    means of communication, and of the postal and telegraph systems. The waterways
                    of the country have been already considered. The roads are divided into national
                    or royal roads, placed directly under the control of the “waterstaat” and
                    supported by the state; provincial roads, under the direct control of the states
                    of the provinces, and almost all supported by the provincial treasuries;
                    communal and polder roads, maintained by the communal authorities and the polder
                    boards; and finally, private roads. The system of national roads, mainly
                    constructed between 1821 and 1827, but still in process of extension, brings
                    into connexion nearly all the towns. The construction of railways was long
                    deferred and slowly accomplished: the “Holland Railway” was laid down in
                    1839-47, the Rhine Railway in 1843-56, the Aix-Maestricht-Landen line in
                    1853-56, and the Dutch-Belgian in 1853-54. All the other lines, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> that from Maestricht to Liège, the Central Railway, the
                    Nimeguen line, the Almelo-Salzberg line, the State Railway system, &amp;c., have
                    been constructed since 1861, a large number of them having been opened about
                    1863 and 1864. A great improvement has in consequence been effected in the
                    communication. The town of Utrecht, which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n80/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0080-0069"/> is the centre both of the country and of the
                    railway system, may be approached by six different lines. From Amersfoort,
                    Zutρhen, Zwolle, Hengelo, Boxtel, Rosendaal, Venlo, and Maestricht lines stretch
                    out in four directions, while Groningen, Leeuwarden, Meppel, Enschede,
                    Hilversum, Amsterdam, Haarlem, Uitgeest, the Hague, Rotterdam, Moerdijk, Breda,
                    Tilburg, and Eindhoven are each the meeting place of three lines. With foreign
                    countries the Netherlands communicate from Groningen by the Winschoten and
                    Nieuwe Sehans line; from Overyssel by the Almelo-Salzberg line; from
                    Guelderlaιid by the Arnhem-Emmerik and Nimeguen-Cleves lines, from Limburg by
                    the Gennep-Goch, Venlo-Gladbach, and Maestricht-Aix-la-Chapelle lines; and in
                    the south with Belgium by the Terneuzen-Ghent, Hulst-St-Nikolaas,
                    Rosendaal-Antwerp, Tilburg-Turnhout, Eindhoven-Hassel t, Maestricht-Liège,
                    &amp;c. Among ’the lines at present projected or in construction may be
                    mentioned the works at Amsterdam by which the Holland Railway along the Y is to
                    be brought into connexion with the Eastern Railway and the Rhine Railway; the
                    line between Zaandam and Enkhuizen <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Purmerend and
                    Hoorn; the Groningen-Delfzijl line; and those from Zwolle to Almelo, and from
                    Rotterdam or Schiedam by Vlaardingen to Maassluisand the mouth of the New
                    Waterway.</p>
                <p>The extent of the mail service routes was 26,898 miles in 1873, and 29,773 miles
                    in 1877; and in the same years the post-office staff numbered 3026 and 3525
                    respectively. The number of letters (exclusive of newspapers, printed matter,
                    and official letters), which in 1850 was only 7,000,000, had increased by 1877
                    to 50,000,000. The number of inland post-cards rose from 4,000,000 in 1871 to
                    about 10,000,000 in 1877; the number of inland newspapers was in 1860 about
                    5,000,000, and in 1877 about 27,000,000. The following are the statistics for
                    1853 and 1877 of the national telegraph system, originated in 1852 :—</p>

                    reclaiming of their waste lands, and the working of their mines, that they
                    cannot be left altogether out of view in considering the trade and finances of
                    the mother country. The Dutch colonies in the East Indies, situated between 30°
                    N. lat. and 6° S lat., and between 95° and 141° E. long., comprise an area of
                    600,000 square miles, with a population of about 23,000,000, among which are
                    35,000 Europeans, 319,000 Chinese, 15,000 Arabs, and 10,000 other immigrant
                    Asiatics. For convenience of supervision they are divided into the Great Sunda
                    (Soenda) Islands, the Smaller Sunda Islands, and the Moluccas—a division which
                    is based neither on political nor on ethnological considerations, nor on the
                    phenomena of animal or vegetable distribution. The Great Sunda Islands are Java,
                    Sumatra, Celebes, and Borneo, all with subsidiary islands; the Smaller Sunda
                    Islands comprise Bali, Lombok, Soem-bawa, Flores, Sandalwood Island, and Timor;
                    the Moluccas include Halmaheira, Ceram, Burn (Boeroe), Amboyna, Banda, and the
                    south-eastern groups, besides Western New Guinea. The West Indian possessions of
                    Holland include Dutch Guiana or the government of Surinam, and the Dutch
                    Antilles or the government of Curaçoa and its dependencies (St Eustatius, Saba,
                    the southern half of St Martin, Curaçoa, Bonaire, and Aruba), a total area of
                    60,000 square miles, with 90,000 inhabitants, of whom a small portion are
                    Europeans, and the rest negroes and other people of colour, Chinese, and other
                    emigrants. The East Indian possessions yield an annual average contribution, as
                    already stated, of over £800,000; the West Indian, on the other hand, require
                    aid to the amount of £500,000 or £600,000 yearly.</p>
                <p>The character of the Dutch people may be largely explained by their history, the
                    conformation of the country, their means of subsistence, their strife with the
                    sea, and their struggles to maintain their independence against Spain and
                    against hostile neighbours. The love of freedom and independence is the leading
                    element in their character; the peculiarity of their soil has constrained them
                    to be industrious and economical; their contest against the sea, their wars, and
                    their distant expeditions, have trained them to bravery and self-possession; and
                    their liberality has been stimulated by the disasters which, falling upon one
                    to-day, might be the lot of any other to-morrow: Of course the virtues of the
                    Dutch are apt to be distorted to vices: their composure not seldom becomes
                    indifference; their tendency to reflexion makes them laggard in action and
                    delicient in enterprise; their love of liberty degenerates into an extravagant
                    sense of independence that is more concerned about rights than about duties.
                    Sociability is by no means a dominant characteristic of the Dutch; they speak
                    little and laugh less. But their appearance and expression give a poor
                    indication of their sterling qualities. Their general sincerity and uprightness
                    are evident to every one λvhose own respectability gains him admission, on terms
                    of familiar intercourse, to the respectable circles of Dutch society.</p>
                <p>Bibliography.—The first place in a bibliography of Holland is due to the

                <p>PART II.—HISTORY.</p>
                <p>The oldest inhabitants of Holland of whom anything is known were of Celtic
                    origin; so much may be gathered from scanty remains found in cairns, from a few
                    proper names, such as Nimeguen (Nimwegen) and Walcheren, and from the Druid
                    altars found in that island. In Caesar’s day the whole district between the
                    Rhine and the Scheldt was occupied by Belgae, the bravest of Celts, while the
                    Betaw, the “good meadow,” the Insula Batavorum, was peopled by a portion of the
                    Germanic tribe of the Chatti, and provided first the stoutest foes and then the
                    most serviceable allies of the Roman empire. But if the Batavi were the most
                    distinguished of the Germanic tribes in the country, the “free Frisians” (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Frisians),</hi> who filled the whole northern portion of
                    it, were by far the most important; in addition to them, and mostly on the
                    borderland, were others, Usipetes, Bructeri, Sicambri, Chamavi,. Eburones, and
                    the like, of whom we know little but the names.</p>
                <p>From 28 to 47 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> a struggle went on between the
                    Romans and the Frisians, which ended in the latter year in the complete
                    reduction of the tribe by the vigour of Domitius Corbulo; the Batavi and
                    Frisians were probably, in the earlier days of their connexion with Rome,
                    admitted, if not to the more honourable position of “socii,” at least to the
                    lower grade of “auxilia,” their relation to the empire doubtless varying from
                    time to time. This friendly state of things did not last long; for in 70 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Rome had dismissed her Batavian cohorts, and had
                    turned Claudius Civilis, the “Mithridates of the West,” into a bitter foe. This
                    remarkable patriot had served for many years in the armies of Rome, and had
                    learnt the secrets of the imperial strength and weakness. Taking advantage of
                    the wrongs of Germans and Gauls, and skilfully using the divisions within the
                    empire, he displayed high statesmanlike ability, while his energy and success in
                    war placed him in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n81/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0081-0070"/> rank of great captains. He declared for Vespasian
                    against Vitellius, and grouped together Celt and Teuton in an effort to sweep
                    the tyrant Roman out of Gaul. At first all went well with them, and the Romans
                    were driven out of all modern Holland, Belgium, and from the left bank of the
                    Rhine as far as Alsace. Then the Roman power began to assert itself once more.
                    An able general, Cerealis, was sent into the north-west, and after a chequered
                    and exhausting struggle, in which both suffered greatly, the Batavian hero gave
                    way. Peace was made on easy terms; Civilis laid down arms, and the Batavians
                    submitted and resumed their old position towards Rome. The Batavian island was
                    lined with forts, and became for the Romans the frontier between Gaul and
                    German; much as in far later days the Spanish Netherlands were the barrier
                    between the Dutch and the French.</p>
                <p>For a time all was quiet on this north-western frontier, till late in the 3d
                    century the Franks appeared (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Franks).</hi> In the
                    course of the 5th century the Salian Franks had occupied a great part of the
                    Netherlands, and when Hlodowig (Clovis) was lifted (481) on his warriors’
                    shields, they were possessors of South Holland, the Velu we, Utrecht, Brabant,
                    Antwerp, Limburg, Liége, Hainault, Namur, and Luxembourg. After his death (511)
                    these districts for the most part belonged to the Austrasian kingdom. Behind the
                    Salians came the Saxons, who had made themselves felt in the Batavian island by
                    the middle of the 4th century; in the course of the 5th and 6th centuries they
                    had settled firmly in Overyssel and Drenthe, lying between the Frisians to the
                    north and the Franks to the south. There they shared, in alliance with the
                    Frisians, the varying fortunes of that struggle against the Frankish power which
                    lasted 400 years, and was ended only by the genius and persistency of Charles
                    the Great.</p>
                <p>The first Christian church in the Netherlands was founded in the time of Dagobert
                    I., who had reduced the Frisians and Saxons at the town of Wiltenberg,
                    afterwards Utrecht, between 622 and 632. But the true apostle of the Netherlands
                    was Willibrord the Northumbrian, first bishop of that see (695). He made Utrecht
                    the centre from which Christian light spread across a wide circle of heathendom;
                    and under the protection of Pippin of Heristal, the new faith was so firmly
                    planted in those parts, that when Willibrord died Limburg, North Brabant,
                    Utrecht, and other districts had accepted the faith of the Franks. After
                    Willibrord, Christianity had in that part of Europe another stout champion,
                    Wolfram of Sens, who had nearly persuaded the Frisian king, Radbod, to be a
                    Christian; and lastly in 755, St Boniface, “the apostle of the Germans,” was
                    martyred at Dokkum in Friesland while preaching among the heathen. Towards the
                    end of the century the stern methods of Charles the Great completed the
                    conversion of the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>As an integral part of the Frankish empire, the land under Charles and his
                    immediate successors was divided into “landschafts” and “gaus,” ruled over by
                    dukes and counts, by the side of whom the church also asserted her territorial
                    rights. Hence sprang the dukedom of Brabant, the countships of Flanders,
                    Holland, Guelderland, and the bishopric of Utrecht; and these, under the later
                    Carolings, were independent in all but the name. Ecclesiastically the northern
                    portion of the Netherlands, with South Holland and part of Zealand, was under
                    the bishop of Utrecht; while the eastern districts were under the Saxon bishops
                    of Münster and Osnabrück, and the southern parts under the Frankish bishops of
                    Cologne, Liége, and Doornick. The original dukedoms were subdivided politically
                    into countships, and geographically into gaus; each gau had a chief town, girt
                    with a wall, wherein count and judges administered justice; such towns were also
                    market-places.</p>
                <p>These districts were again subdivided into marks or villages, each with its
                    headman, who acted as judge in lesser and local cases. These gaus were Frisian
                    in the north, Saxon in the middle (about Drenthe, &amp;c.), and Frankish in the
                    south.</p>
                <p>In the great partition of Verdun (843), Lothar, eldest son of Louis the Pious,
                    became lord of North Brabant (a&lt; <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> it is now
                    called), Guelderland, Limburg, and all modern Belgium; Charles the Bald got
                    Flanders and part of Zealand, while Louis the German had whatever lay on the
                    right bank of the Rhine: this district (called Lotharingia in the days of his
                    son Lothar II.) thus became a borderland between Gaul and Germany. When Lothar
                    II. died without heirs in 869, his uncle Charles the Bald got all the northern
                    Netherlands, with Friesland; but the Mersen agreement (870) redistributed these
                    lands,—to Louis the German the districts south of the present Zuyder Zee,
                    including Utrecht and the Veluwe; to Charles the Bald, Holland, Zealand, and
                    modern Belgium, Eventually in 879 Louis, son of Louis the German, got these
                    districts also. In 912 they accepted Charles the Simple of France as overlord;
                    in 924 Henry I. brought them again under German lordship; afterwards Otto the
                    Great granted them as a fief to his brother Bruno, archbishop of Cologne, who,
                    dividing the land into Upper aud Lower Lotharingia, set Gottfried, count of
                    Verdun, over the latter as duke, and himself took the title of archduke. Thus,
                    during this period, the Netherlands from 843 to 869 were a part of Lotharingia
                    (as it came to be called); from 869 to 870 they were under French lordship, from
                    870 to 879 partly French partly German, from 879 to 912 altogether German, from
                    912 to 924 French again, and finally after 924 German.</p>
                <p>Throughout this time the country was swamp below and woodland above; and though
                    much forest was cleared from time to time, it was still a difficult tangle, with
                    little communication except down the rivers and by the old Roman roads. Yet,
                    backward as they were, the Netherlands were rich enough to attract the Northmen,
                    who ravaged the shores and river sides, and carried with them southward many a
                    willing Saxon and Frisian warrior. Under Louis the Pious they got firm footing
                    on the coast, and received the district from Walcheren up to the Weser as a
                    group of fiefs under the emperors; they even took and sacked Utrecht. In 873
                    Rolf, founder of Normandy, seized Walcheren; in 880 the Northmen took Nimeguen,
                    and spread up the left bank of the Rhine as far as Cologne; in the chapel of the
                    Great Charles at Aix they stabled horses and held heathen revel, till bribed to
                    withdraw by Charles the Fat. Their great leader Siegfried had the emperor’s
                    daughter to wife, with lands in Friesland; he was willing to become a Christian,
                    though this put no stop to his demands; “as the lands granted him hitherto
                    produced no wine,” he demanded also Rhine towns and districts for the sake of
                    their vintages. His father-in-law, however, sent instead men to murder him, and,
                    this being done, the lord ship of the Northmen in the Netherlands came to an
                    end.</p>
                <p>The effect of these viking incursions on Frankish feudalism was great. “Eighty
                    years of plunder and murder," says Gerlache <hi rend="italic">(Essai sur les
                    grandes Époques,</hi> p. 94), “had turned the fields into a wilderness; the
                    towns rose like oases in the desert; the wealth of the monasteries perished; the
                    people were either slain with the sword or had taken to the sword as robbers;
                    all the elements of political life, kingship, nobility, clergy, were confounded
                    together, and every tie of civil society relaxed.” The impoverished natives took
                    rèfuge under the nobles, whose power made great advance. Now arose, too, a new
                    title of nobility, that of margrave,—each margrave being bound to defend a piece
                    of frontier, receiving in return an almost <pb break="no"

                    Antwerp, who guarded the mouth of the Scheldt. The towns also became as
                    sanctuaries against the ravager; the serf who took refuge there presently became
                    free; the burghers began to trade, and found encouragement in their traffic even
                    from the Northmen themselves.</p>
                <p>Thus the whole district came to be covered with prosperous towns; it was also
                    divided into independent lordships, among which the countship of Holland, as it
                    soon afterwards was called, was the most prominent and important. The title
                    “count of Holland” does not appear in history till the 11th century. In the
                    latter part of the 9th century there was a certain Count Dirk, to whom, early in
                    the 10th, Charles the Simple granted the abbey of Egmond near Alkmaar. Of his
                    history almost nothing is known; he was dead before 942, as there exists still a
                    document of that year signed by Dirk II. Dirk II. was a man of weight; he got
                    for his younger son the archbishopric of Treves, and Arnulf his elder son
                    married a kinswoman of the emperor Otto II. He himself received in 983 a broad
                    district, that now covered by the Zuyder Zee, from Texel to the north, and the
                    mainland southward down to Nimeguen. He died in 988; and Arnulf was count till
                    993. His son, Dirk HI., a boy, on his accession found things in great confusion;
                    the fiefs held under France were gone, and much besides. But the young count was
                    full of vigour, and grew at last so strong that in 1018 the emperor ordered the
                    duke of Nether Lotharingia to crush him. Dirk, however, completely defeated his
                    assailant, and not only retained the disputed lands and powers, but added
                    thereto Bodegrave, the Merwede, and Swammerdam, as fiefs of the church at
                    Utrecht. It is here that the true history of Holland begins; for.Dirk III. now
                    firmly settled himself in this district, and became lord of the rich woodland
                    (“Holt-land,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    Holland) on the Rhine and Meuse. Having also subdued the Frisians and set his
                    brother over them, he next went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and after his return
                    in 1034 ruled in peace till his death in 1039. His son, Dirk IV., was also a man
                    of vigour; he began the long strife with the counts of Flanders as to the
                    lordship over Walcheren and the other islands of Zealand, the quarrel was
                    important, as dealing with the borderland between French and German
                    overlordship. This strife, which lasted 400 years, did not at first break out
                    into actual warfare, because both Dirk and Baldwin V. of Flanders had a common
                    danger in the emperor Henry III., who in 1046 occupied the lands in dispute; but
                    while other opponents gave in, Dirk, after the manner of his house, stood out,
                    and in the winter of 1047 with his light boats took the imperial fleet, ruined
                    the imperial army, and dictated his own terms. In 1049, in a fresh contest with
                    the bishop of Utrecht and his allies, Dirk met with his death at Dort. His
                    brother, Floris I., succeeded, and carried on the quarrel; in 1061 he was slain
                    on the battlefield, after having won a decisive victory over the bishop His son,
                    Dirk V., was a child, and the neighbouring princes thought the end of the house
                    of Holland at hand; and though the boy had stout friends, especially Robert “the
                    Frisian,” who had married his widowed mother, his prospects were at first very
                    gloomy. The battle of Cassel, however, in 1072, in which Robert the Frisian
                    defeated Philip of France and Richilda of Flanders, secured his possessions for
                    Dirk, who henceforth saw better days, and ruled in peace till his death in 1091.
                    . His son, Floris II., the Fat, had also peace, and at his death in 1122 left
                    Holland in great prosperity. His widow, . Petronilla of Saxony, governed for her
                    young son Dirk VI., and continued the joint resistance of Holland and Saxony to
                    the Franconian emperors. But when, on the death of Henry V., Lothair of Saxony
                    became emperor, this quarrel came to an end, and the fortunes of the house of
                    Holland rose greatly; the Frisian Ostergow and Westergow were transferred from
                    the bishop of Utrecht to Count Dirk in 1125. The Hohenstaufen, on the contrary,
                    favoured the bishop, and gave back the two “gows”; and thus, with gain and loss,
                    Dirk VI. ruled till he died in 1157. It was in his time that Holland sent out
                    her first colonists; invited by Adolf of Holstein and Albert the Bear of
                    Brandenburg, Hollanders settled on the Elbe and the Havel, and by their skill in
                    reclaiming marshlands, and their thrift and vigour, created a flourishing
                    district out of a waste of wood and water.</p>
                <p>Floris III., the next count, allied himself with Frederick Barbarossa, thus
                    reversing the traditional policy of his house. He was less fortunate than his
                    fathers; the count of Flanders carried off a slice of his territory; he scarcely
                    held his own against West Friesland and Groningen; his reign was marked by the
                    great flood of 1170, which swept over Holland, Friesland, and Utrecht, and
                    helped to form the Zuyder Zee. Later in life Floris followed the emperor on
                    crusade, and soon after the death of the latter, perished in 1190 of pestilence
                    at Antioch. His son, Dirk VII., had a stormy time, losing rather than gaining in
                    the long-run. He died in 1203, leaving an only daughter, Ada, with whom came up
                    the question as to female succession to a male fief. Zealand mainly declared for
                    William, the late count’s brother, while Holland went with Ada; by 1206,
                    however, William had beaten down all opposition, and was undisputed count. He
                    sided with the emperor Otto IV., and was present at Bouvines (1214), where
                    Philip Augustus crushed the allied forces of Otto, John of England, Flanders,
                    Holland, and Brabant. Soon after this William changed sides, and, attaching
                    himself to Philip Augustus, accompanied Louis to England. After King John’s
                    death he joined the fourth crusade, in which his men distinguished themselves
                    greatly at the siege of Damietta in 1219. Returning thence he reigned in peace
                    till his death in 1224. His reign is notable by reason of the civic charters he
                    granted,—one to Geertruidenberg in 1213, another celebrated one to Middelburg in
                    Zealand in 1217. These charters were the models on which later ones were framed;
                    they secured the existing liberties of towns, gave the burghers the right of
                    being ruled by law, and established equal justice within the walls.</p>
                <p>William was succeeded by Floris IV , murdered at Corbie in 1235; his son, William
                    II., was a man of mark. Pope Innocent IV. having deposed Frederick II., and
                    wanting a prince to set up against the Hohenstaufen, thought that the young
                    count of Holland might serve, and accordingly had him elected king of the Romans
                    by an assembly composed chiefly of German ecclesiastics. He took
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, and was there crowned king in 1248; and after Frederick’s death
                    in 1250 he had a considerable party in Germany. His foreign ambitions were,
                    however, crossed by troubles at home, and before he received the imperial crown
                    he perished in West Friesland, going down, horse and armour, through the ice. It
                    was he who fixed the seat of government at the Hague. His successor was Floris
                    V., a babe. The father had been a young man of unusual promise, ruined by German
                    politics; the son was destined to play a considerable part in Netherland
                    history. Hitherto Holland had dealt only with smaller neighbours, Flanders,
                    Friesland, Utrecht, or Guelderland; henceforward she takes part in European
                    questions, interfering in the great strife between Edward I. of England and
                    France. For when he came of age Floris allied himself closely with the English
                    king, and secured great trading advantages for his people; the staple of wool
                    was placed at Dort, and the Hollanders and Zealanders got fishing rights on the
                    English coast. To balance the power of the nobles, which more and more <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n83/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0083-0072"/> took the form of oppression, he also granted
                    charters to towns (notably to Amsterdam), and forwarded their growth. In 1296,
                    finding that Edward of England was dealing with his rival of Flanders, Floris
                    joined Philip the Fair of France; but this act and his severities towards the
                    nobles led to a conspiracy, to which he fell a victim; the burghers and people,
                    who knew him to be their best friend, took such vengeance on his slayers as
                    permanently reduced the power of the nobles.</p>
                <p>John I., his son, was in England when his father was murdered; he was a feeble
                    boy in body and mind, married to the daughter of Edward I. His reign was a
                    struggle between Zealand, led by Wolfart van Borselen, and Holland, guided by
                    John of Avennes, the young count’s guardian and next heir. In 1299 Van Borselen
                    was killed by the Hollanders, and soon after Count John died. John of Avennes
                    was at once recognized as count by the Hollanders, and with John I. ended the
                    first line of counts, after a rule of nearly 400 years. Europe has perhaps never
                    seen an abler series of princes; excepting the last, there is not one weak man
                    among them; they were ready fighters, brave crusaders, handsome well-built
                    persons, with high chivalrous gifts tainted with corresponding chivalrous vices;
                    they were all ready to advance the commerce of the country; they were the
                    friends of the people, the supporters of the growing towns. They made their
                    marsh lands fertile, and raised Holland to be a companion of kings.</p>
                <p>During this time Holland became independent of the imperial authority. The
                    fragments of Nether Lorraine, Holland, Guelderland, Utrecht, Brabant, and
                    Flanders paid little heed to their nominal lord; Holland especially, so far from
                    the centre of the empire, so nearly forgotten in the greater troubles of Italy
                    or Switzerland, was left to herself. She made her own laws, imposed river-dues
                    (a recognized imperial right), named her own officers, held high court of
                    justice, coined money, made peace or war at will. Even the <hi rend="italic">de
                    jure</hi> authority of the empire over Holland is a matter of doubt, much
                    debated by publicists and historians. The independent development of the country
                    took, as we have said, a municipal form; and as the constitutions of her cities
                    have throughout affected her history, they demand some consideration. Before the
                    14th century there were in Holland no estates, nor any general political life;
                    the count was all powerful. Over the country districts he set his “baljews” or
                    bailiffs, and in towns and villages his “schouts” or local judges. In the 13th
                    century, when any greater matter had to be discussed in a city, all citizens
                    were summoned by ring of the great bell to the public square, and there decided
                    the question by democratic vote. Justice was administered “by a man’s peers,”
                    according to the Saxon code in the east, the Frisian in the north, and the
                    Frankish or Salian in the south,— each district having also its several uses or
                    customs. Taxation for the count’s benefit was styled his “beden” or prayer for
                    supplies, and fell chiefly on the towns. And as the towns paid most, and were
                    generally built on the count’s lands, they claimed his protection, receiving
                    charters and liberties from him in return for their dues and levies of men. In
                    time the vague civic democracy gave place to an oligarchical government. While
                    the Flemjsh towns were opposed to their feudal lord, in the north it was the
                    other way; the counts of Holland were with the cities against the other classes
                    of society. Consequently, though the Dutch towns began later, they in the end
                    enjoyed far more steady prosperity than their southern neighbours. Thus under
                    William II. and Floris V., Dort and Delft, Haarlem, Alkmaar, Middelburg, Leyden,
                    Schiedam, and others began their prosperous career. Each of these cities was at
                    first ruled by the count’s “schepenen” or judges, supported by councillors, one
                    from each quarter of the town, from whom sprang the title of burgomaster, by
                    which they became known in later days. The “schepenen” administered justice,
                    while the councillors or burgomasters attended to civil affairs, and by degrees
                    threw the judges into the background. Peace and defence were entrusted to a
                    local militia, armed with the cross-bow. Dort was the earliest of these
                    prosperous towns; it enjoyed a very strict stapleright; the commerce of the
                    northern districts was compelled to pass through its market. Two centuries later
                    came the prosperity of Amsterdam, and with it the European fame of Dutch butter
                    and cheese; then the wealth arising from the herring-fishery, of which the
                    centre was Enkhuysen. In the 14th century the chief towns had joined the Hansa,
                    and though that exclusive body in the 15th century ejected them, they far more
                    than recovered the loss of their trade through the newly opened worlds of India
                    and America.</p>
                <p>When John of Avennes succeeded in 1299 as first count of the house of Hainault,
                    the Hollanders were willing to receive him, the Zealanders not; and a long
                    struggle between the provinces ensued. In 1301 he coerced Utrecht into alliance,
                    and got the bishopric for his brother Guy. In 1304 the Flemings were driven out
                    of Holland, and John II. was for a few .months real lord of the county. He died
                    that year, and was succeeded by his son William III., “the Good” (1304-1337),
                    who made peace with Flanders in 1323, settled the outstanding quarrel between
                    Holland and Zealand, united the Amstelland and its city Amsterdam to his
                    territories, encouraged civic life, and developed the resources of his country.
                    He also entered into close relations with the states of Europe, having married
                    Johanna of Valois, niece of the French king; in 1323 the emperor Louis the
                    Bavarian wedded his daughter Margaret, and in 1328 his third daughter, Philippa
                    of Hainault, was given to Edward III. of England. William III. was in all
                    respects a great prince, and an acute statesman. In 1337 he died, and was
                    succeeded by his son William IV., who was killed fighting against the Frisians
                    in 1315. He left no children, and the question as to the succession now brought
                    on Holland a time of violent civil commotions. -The county was claimed by
                    Margaret, William’s eldest sister, as well as by Philippa of Hainault, or, in
                    other words, by Edward III. of England. Margaret eventually succeeded, siding
                    with the older nobles, and being, therefore, not well received by the towns.
                    These are the days in which came up the famous parties of “Kabbeljaus” and
                    ‘.‘Hoeks,” the “Cods” and the “Hooks,” the fat burgher fish and the sharp
                    steel-pointed nobles who wanted to catch and devour them. After much buffeting
                    and many changes of fortune, Margaret resigned her lordship in 1349 in favour of
                    her second son William, but again resumed it in 1350. Then the struggle between
                    nobles and cities broke into open war. Edward III. came to Margaret’s aid,
                    winning a sea fight off Veere in 1351; a few weeks later the Hooks and the
                    English were defeated by William and the Cods at Vlaardingen—an overthrow which
                    ruined Margaret’s cause. She made peace with het son in 1354, and died two years
                    later. He, however, shortly after fell mad; so that in 1358 the Hooks had to
                    call in his younger brother, Albert of Bavaria, to be stadtholder or “ruwaard”
                    in his stead; he ruled well, and restored some order to the land. In the latter
                    part of his life he went over to the Cods, a step which led to another outbreak
                    of civil war which lasted until 1395. In 1404 he died, and was succeeded by his
                    son William VI. who upheld the Hooks with all his power, and secured their
                    ascendency. He died in 1417, leaving only a daughter, Jacoba (or Jacqueline),
                    wife of John of France, who died that same year. Again was Holland rent with
                    civil strife; the Hooks, as before, readily accepting a female sovereign, <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0084-0073"/> while the Cods declared for John of Liége. Jacoba
                    was granddaughter of Philip of Burgundy, who behaved very ill towards her; her
                    romantic and sad life has rendered her the most picturesque figure in all the
                    history of Holland; she struggled long against her powerful kinsfolk, nor did
                    she know happiness till near the end of her life, when she abandoned the unequal
                    strife, and found repose with Francis of Borselen, ruwaard of Holland, her
                    fourth husband. Him Philip the Good of Burgundy craftily seized, and thereby in
                    1433 Jacoba was compelled to cede her rights over the counties of Holland,
                    Zealand, Friesland, and Hainault. Consequently, at her death in 1436, as she
                    left no children, Philip seized on all her lands. He already held much of the
                    Netherlands; he had inherited Flanders and Artois, had bought Namur, had seized
                    Brabant, with Limburg, Antwerp, and Mechlin; he now got Holland, Zealand, and
                    Hainault, with a titular lordship over Friesland; a few years later he became
                    lord also of Luxembourg. By this incorporation with the possessions of the house
                    of Burgundy, the commercial and artistic life of Holland was quickened, but
                    political liberties suffered; for the rule of the “good duke” was far from being
                    good. It was a time of luxury and show, of pageants and display, of the new and
                    brilliant Order of the Golden Fleece (1430), and of the later days of feudalism,
                    with all its brilliancy, corruption, and Recline in the presence of the new
                    monarchical spirit of Europe. Duke Philip on his accession declared that the
                    privileges and constitutions of Holland, to which he had taken oath as ruwaard
                    for Jacoba, should be null, unless he chose to confirm them as count. From that
                    moment till the latter part of the next century the liberties of the Netherlands
                    were treated with contempt. Holland, however, at first contented herself with
                    growing material prosperity: her herring fishery, rendered more valuable than
                    ever by the curing process discovered or introduced by Beukelzoon, brought her
                    fresh wealth; and her fishermen were unconsciously laying the foundations of her
                    maritime greatness. It was in the days of Duke Philip that Lorenz Koster of
                    Haarlem contributed his share to the discovery of printing; the arts and
                    learning of the Renaissance began to flourish greatly. The Burgundian dukes
                    rivalled their contemporaries the Medici; under them grew up the Flemish school
                    of painters, headed by the Van Eycks and Memling; architecture advanced as
                    stately churches and town-houses were built; the dukes collected priceless
                    manuscripts, founded libraries, and encouraged authors. But this speedy growth
                    in art and letters belonged more to Flanders and Brabant than to Holland or
                    Zealand.</p>
                <p>In short, throughout the Burgundian time Holland plays but an insignificant part;
                    and it may merely be remarked that the friendship of the dukes for the nobility
                    did that class more harm than their hostility to civic liberties hurt the towns;
                    for the lavish waste of Philip’s court impoverished the nobles, and the wars of
                    Charles destroyed them. After their days the Netherlands nobility were never
                    again powerful. The church also suffered: it was enriched and corrupted by
                    Philip, and was consequently very loyal to him; but his favour instead of
                    strengthening it made the Reformation necessary. The cities, though oppressed
                    and heavily taxed, grew stronger; and, when Duke Charles perished at Nancy, they
                    at once stood out for their rights, and obliged his sole heir the duchess Mary,
                    not unwillingly, to grant them the “Great Privilege” of March 1477, which
                    affirmed the power of the cities and provinces to hold diets, and reserved to
                    the estates a voice in the declaration of war, and authority to approve of the
                    choice she might make of a husband. It was declared that natives alone might
                    hold high office; no new taxes should be laid without the approval of the
                    estates; one high court of justice was established for Holland, Zealand, and
                    Friesland; the Dutch language was made official. Thus came to an end the
                    centralizing despotism of the Burgundian dukes. This period is also remarkable
                    for a reconstruction of the civic government, and for the appearance of the
                    States General, first summoned ’ by Philip the Good. In t⅛e states of Holland
                    many nobles sat in person, though they had but one collective vote. At first all
                    towns, larger and smaller, also sent representatives, but after a time the
                    smaller ceased to appear, and only such larger cities as Dort, Haarlem, Leyden,
                    Amsterdam, Gouda, were represented, each having one vote. The president was the
                    “advocatus,” or “vogt,” of the country, afterwards styled “the pensionary,” an
                    officer regarded as the champion of the estates against the counts. In Zealand
                    and elsewhere, clergy, nobles, and cities sat separately, each order having a
                    single vote. The estates, under the Burgundians, had little power; they could
                    not even control the taxation. Duke Philip in 1464 summoned them to meet him at
                    Bruges, and, though some of the more distant held aloof, the majority obeyed.
                    These States General, however, expressed no national feeling or union of the
                    provinces: that was a far later state of things.</p>
                <p>After Mary of Burgundy had granted the Great Privilege, the provinces warmly
                    supported her against Louis XL; they approved her union with Maximilian of
                    Austria in August 1477, though it brought them no rest; for the old parties
                    still survived, and Hooks and Cods fought savagely in almost every town.
                    Maximilian had allied himself with the Cods, and the Hooks were defeated at
                    Leyden and Dort, and finally in their last stronghold, Utrecht, of which city
                    the archduke was made temporal protector in 1483. Before that time (March 1482)
                    Mary of Burgundy had died, and Maximilian, acting for his son Philip, became
                    governor of the Netherlands. After fresh Hook and Cod troubles at Haarlem, he
                    finally made peace with France in December 1482, and after the death of Louis XL
                    brought the Flemings to complete obedience by the peace of Frankfort in 1489.
                    The provinces were still very uneasy, partly through the turbulence of the
                    Hooks, partly because of the autocratic character of his rule, and partly
                    through the so-called “Bread and Cheese” war, caused by famine in the northern
                    provinces. War with France also complicated matters, and the government over the
                    Netherlands was entrusted to Albert of Saxony. In 1494 Maximilian, having been
                    elected emperor, laid down his office as guardian, and bad Philip the Handsome
                    declared of age. He was at once accepted by Brabant, and the estates of Holland
                    even let him sweep away the Great Privilege. He ruled over them quietly, and got
                    back their English trade. In 1496 he married Joanna of Aragon, daughter of
                    Ferdinand and Isabella, and afterwards heiress to the new monarchy of Spain. On
                    Philip’s death in 1506, leaving two sons, Charles and Ferdinand, and four
                    daughters, Maximilian again became guardian for his grandson Charles, then but
                    six years old; he named Margaret of Savoy, his daughter, governess of the
                    Netherlands in 1507.</p>
                <p>In 1515 Charles was. declared of age, and received the homage of Holland and
                    Zealand, Brabant and Flanders, as Count Charles II. In consequence of his
                    friendly relations with Francis I. of France, Henry of Nassau, his comrade and
                    trusted follower, was wedded to Claude, sister of Philibert, prince of Orange,
                    and from this union springs the great house of Orange-Nassau. On his accession
                    to the Spanish and imperial thrones successively, Charles continued his aunt
                    Margaret of Savoy as governess of the Netherlands, with a privy council to
                    assist her.</p>
                <p>He brought all the provinces under one hand, having in 1524 become lord of
                    Friesland by purchase, and in 1528 acquired the temporalities of Utrecht. He now
                    ruled <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n85/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0085-0074"/> over seventeen provinces: that is, over four
                    duchies— Brabant, Guelderland, Limburg, and Luxembourg; seven counties—Flanders,
                    Artois, Hainault, Holland, Zealand, Namur, and Zutphen; the margraviate of
                    Antwerp; and five lordships—Friesland, Mechlin, Utrecht, Overyssel, and
                    Groningen, with the Ommeland.</p>
                <p>After the death in 1530 of Margaret, who had continued to act for him with her
                    accustomed wisdom and prudence, Charles V. at first treated the provinces with
                    studied moderation: he redressed some of their griefs, reformed the
                    administration and the coinage, issued sumptuary edicts, regulated their
                    commerce, while he also re-enacted the severe laws against heresy, and gave full
                    powers to the supreme court of Holland—a body completely under his control. He
                    then appointed his sister Mary, queen of Hungary, regent of the Netherlands. She
                    had at first no easy task; for the provinces had on hand a war with Denmark, and
                    Anabaptist troubles at home; before long also she had to ask for increased
                    supplies; and while the Hollanders granted a large annual subsidy, they refused
                    her a hearth tax which she demanded. Similar monetary questions in 1539 produced
                    that famous struggle between the court and Ghent which was only ended by the
                    personal intervention of the emperor; after punishing severely the rebellious
                    burghers, he passed on into Holland, and in 1540, in defiance of the
                    acknowledged rights of the provinces, established a foreigner, René of Chalons,
                    prince of Orange, as stadtholder of Holland, Zealand, and Utrecht. He thus
                    forced on them that great family which has both shed lustre on the history of
                    Holland, and defended there and elsewhere the liberties of Europe. René himself
                    ruled but a short time; he perished in France in 1544, leaving his territories
                    to a little cousin, William of Nassau.</p>
                <p>In 1545-46 the estates gave the emperor men and money for his war against the
                    Protestant princes of Germany; after Mühlberg, the Netherlanders hoped that they
                    might now be freed from the foreign troops Charles had quartered among them. He,
                    however, had other plans on hand, and determined to place permanently in the
                    provinces 4000 horse, entirely at his own orders; he also laid before the
                    estates in 1548 a scheme of incorporation, which aimed at making the Netherlands
                    an integral portion of the empire, under the name of the circle of Burgundy, and
                    which he abandoned only after the refusal of the seven electors to make Philip
                    king of the Romans. In 1549 he revisited the provinces and called Philip thither
                    also, that they might see their future master; the young prince swore to
                    maintain their rights and customs; and so began between the Netherlands and him
                    the formal relation which under circumstances elsewhere related (vol. v. 416,
                    417) became so real on October 25, 1555.</p>
                <p>After appointing Margaret of Parma, a natural daughter of Charles V., to be
                    regent in the Netherlands, in 1559 Philip set sail for Spain, leaving, in spite
                    of the remonstrances of the estates, 4000 foreign troops, nominally to protect
                    the frontiers, really to check the independence of the people, and to support
                    the policy of religious persecution which had been resolved on. The real
                    direction of all affairs was in the hands of the Burgundian churchman Antony
                    Perrenot, bishop of Arras (afterwards so well known as Cardinal Granvella), who
                    was chief of the “consulta” or secret council of three. A sharp attack on the
                    Reformers now began. The first step, the proposal (which had originated with
                    Charles) to reorganize the bishoprics of the Netherlands, was announced at once.
                    Hitherto ecclesiastical affairs had been in the charge of four bishops,—Arras,
                    Cambray, Tournay, Utrecht,—the last under the archbishop of Cologne, the others
                    under Rheims. It was proposed now to establish a new and national hierarchy,
                    independent of Germany and France, with three archbishops and fifteen bishops
                    —Mechlin, the chief archbishopric, having under it Antwerp, Herzogenbusch,
                    Roermond, Ghent, Bruges, and Ypres; Cambray, with Tournay, Arras, St Omer, and
                    Namur; Utrecht, with Haarlem, Middelburg, Leeuwarden, Groningen, and Deventer.
                    Each bishop was to appoint nine new prebendaries to help him in his diocese; of
                    the nine two should be inquisitors, specially told off to sniff' out and hunt
                    down heresy. Nor was this all; it was believed that not merely would these new
                    bishoprics strengthen the old episcopal inquisition, but that a more stringent
                    form of inquisition was to be introduced, organized after the Spanish system,
                    which had been long known for its efficient severity. The Netherlanders regarded
                    the change, in fact, as part of a general plan for the subjection of the
                    provinces from abroad,*by means of foreign troops and ecclesiastics, with
                    contempt of their feelings, rights, and liberties. All classes—nobles, clergy,
                    burghers, peasants—disliked the new ecclesiastical system, and regarded
                    Granvella, who became first archbishop of Mechlin, with detestation. Though the
                    Spanish troops were withdrawn in 1560, the ferment was not quieted; the nobles
                    were uneasy, and, finding their position uncertain between the court and the
                    populace, began to form confederacies and to head the resistance. Even such
                    leading men as William of Orange, who tried to mediate between Government and
                    the provinces, were driven into opposition; in 1561 Granvell·a’s overbearing
                    acts alienated them still more, and Orange and Horn withdrew from the council.
                    Even Margaret felt she could no longer rule with Granvella at her side; and he
                    at last, seeing that a crisis was coming on, withdrew into Burgundy in 1563. Now
                    things were easier; party badges were dropped, and men felt cooler.</p>
                <p>But at this moment the long labours of the Council of Trent were ending; and,
                    when in 1565 it finally promulgated its decrees, Philip determined to enforce
                    their acceptance throughout his dominions. Accordingly, he now made a more
                    vehement attack on the Reformers; and then it was that, in 1566, the Netherland
                    nobles, led by Count Brederode, signed the famous “Compromise,” with which the
                    open rebellion of the provinces begins. Orange, Egmont, and Horn stood aloof.
                    When, in their first interview with the regent, the nobles appeared on foot, in
                    sedulously plain guise and without arms, Berlay-mont standing by her side begged
                    her not to be alarmed, “for they were but a pack of beggars ;” and the phrase
                    being overheard, at Brederode’s banquet that night it was gaily adopted by the
                    young nobles as a party name, “les gueux,” and it became the fashion for
                    patriots to wear beggar’s garb, and a medal round the neck, bearing Philip's
                    image on one side and a wallet on the other, with two hands crossed, and the
                    legend “Fidèles au roy jusqu’ à la besace.” Orange, Egmont, and Horn, who
                    dropped in on the revelry at Brederode’s house, joined the merry scene and drank
                    the beggars’ health.</p>
                <p>To deprecate Philip’s anger at the “Compromise,” the council of state sent the
                    marquis of Bergen and Horn’s brother, the lord of Montigny, Knights of the
                    Golden Fleece and men of high repute, to Spain, where Philip received them
                    kindly, but took good care that they should never again see their homes.
                    Meanwhile he gathered forces with which to suppress the disturbances, which had
                    become very serious. Open air preachings, guarded by armed men, were taking
                    place throughout the provinces, and raised the excitement to such a height that
                    it at last found vent in iconoclastic tumults, similar to those of France. This
                    gave the court party only too good an excuse; it could now interpose with
                    authority on behalf of public order. Matters threatened war. Margaret played
                    with the discontented nobles, having orders from Spain to decoy <pb break="no"

                    confederacy. Hereon Orange withdrew into. Holland; Horn, in moody opposition,
                    conscious of his integrity, retired to his country house; while Egmont still
                    hovered, a bright flutterer, round the fatal taper of the court. The confederacy
                    was in fact broken up; and Margaret saw with satisfaction a considerable body of
                    German mercenaries enter the provinces to inflict punishment, in all its
                    ghastliest and most brutal forms, on the iconoclasts. In 1567 it came to blows:
                    the undisciplined rabble of Calvinists,, who tried to raise the siege of
                    Valenciennes, were cut to pieces by the troops of Egmont and other loyal nobles.
                    William of Orange withdrew to Nassau, after vainly warning Egmont of the
                    imminent peril which he ran.</p>
                <p>In spite of Margaret, who assured Philip that the heretics were completely pat
                    down, and their worship abolished, and that consequently there was no need of an
                    army, and that on the contrary the time for mercy had come, the plan for the
                    utter subjugation of the provinces was adhered to, and the duke of Alva, already
                    famous for his harshness and bigotry, was named commander of the forces, with
                    almost unlimited powers. He set forth in May 1567, and all hopes of peace or
                    mercy fled before him. There was a great and desperate exodus of the
                    inhabitants; thousands took refuge in England, Germany, and Denmark, carrying
                    with them, it was thought, the last relics of their faith and party. The nobles’
                    confederacy had already been broken up; now the popular movement was dispersed,
                    despair and helplessness alone remained to greet the cold Spaniard and his train
                    of orthodox executioners. He entered the Netherlands with about 20,000 men, all
                    tried troops, ready for any cruelties. Their weakness lay in the fact that they
                    were after all mere mercenaries,—Spaniards, Italians, Germans,—and as such ever
                    ready for a mutiny, if pay fell short, or if there were none to plunder.</p>
                <p>Egmont and Horn were arrested at once; the Council of Troubles—the
                    “Blood-tribunal”—was established; Margaret, thrust aside by the imperious
                    general, resigned her weary office, and carried away with her the last hopes of
                    the wretched people. Alva was now appointed governorgeneral, and the executions
                    of his council filled the land with blood. Orange was outlawed on his
                    non-appearance; it was about this time that he declared his conversion to
                    Calvinism, and so fitted himself in every respect to lead the people when the
                    time came. The hostilities of 1568 led to the execution of Egmont and Horn.
                    Though the Gueux under Louis of Nassau won a considerable victory over the
                    Spaniards at Heiligerlee, the arrival of Alva compelled him to raise the siege
                    of Groningen, and to withdraw towards the Ems. At Jemmingen Louis was at last
                    utterly defeated, and though the prince of Orange did his utmost to raise the
                    country, and skilfully avoided a fatal battle, the campaign ended in his being
                    obliged to withdraw out of the country. Alva was now at the highest point of his
                    success; his statue, cast from cannon taken at Jemmingen, was set up at Antwerp;
                    the exodus of the inhabitants continued incessantly, especially to England. The
                    advice of Admiral Coligny, that the provinces should wage war from the sea, was
                    hardly listened to at the first. In 1570, however, Orange turned his attention
                    that way, and his little navy under William de la Marek annoyed Spanish commerce
                    and took rich prizes. In 1572, being unable to find refuge in any ports,—for
                    neither England, nor Denmark, nor Sweden, would allow them harbourage, and they
                    were treated not merely as rebels but as pirates,—William de la Marek, with his
                    “Water-Beggars,” suddenly seized on Briel, at the mouth of the Meuse, and the
                    face of the struggle began from that moment to change. Alva, partly from the
                    general requirements of his position, partly from lack of funds and desire of
                    his recently-imposed tenth penny, had at this moment driven the Netherlanders to
                    desperation. He was engaged in a struggle with Brussels and Utrecht, in which
                    city, to punish the inhabitants, he had collected his Spanish soldiery from all
                    the neighbouring towns. The news of the capture of Briel woke him from his
                    security. Flushing also fell into the hands of the “Water-Beggars,” who
                    surprised under its walls a rich convoy from Spain. About the same time, Louis
                    of Nassau, who had been at La Rochelle with the Huguenots, and had received help
                    and encouragement from Charles IX. of France, suddenly seized Mons in Hainault,
                    thus giving the French sympathizers with the revolt the means of entering safely
                    into the Walloon provinces. Alva, now seriously alarmed, withdrew from Zealand
                    the whole of the forces with which he had intended to check the movement of the
                    “Water-Beggars,” in order that he might repair the great breach thus made in his
                    southern system of defence, and so left the province free to develop its
                    resistance. Holland followed quickly, Enkhuizen setting the example; so that,
                    within three months of the capture of Briel, Amsterdam was the only town in
                    Holland in the hands of the Spaniards. In Friesland also the revolt spread far
                    and wide. The states of Holland met, and, acting under advice of Philip of
                    Marnix, lord of St Aldegonde, the prince’s deputy, declared that William of
                    Orange was, by Philip’s nomination, stadtholder of Holland, Zealand, and
                    Friesland; they also declared their intention to raise money for the costs of
                    war and the relief of Mons, and affirmed again the liberties of the provinces;
                    finally they named the rough and ready William de la Marck captain-general— a
                    man whose prompt and practical daring would supply the qualities which the
                    caution and apparent irresolution and timidity of William of Orange seemed
                    unlikely to provide for the emergency.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Alva pressed the siege of Mons; French help failed utterly to relieve
                    Louis of Nassau, nor could William of Orange either force his way through the
                    Spanish lines or induce Alva to fight. At this moment came tidings of the
                    massacre of St Bartholomew, and the prince, seeing that all hope of aid from
                    France was utterly at an end, bade his brother make the best terms he could, and
                    withdrew beyond the Rhine and thence into Holland. Mons at once capitulated, and
                    Alva, passing on to Mechlin, pitilessly sacked that wealthy city. Thence he
                    pressed forward to the north; Zutphen was taken, the towns of Guelderland and
                    Friesland submitted, and for a while nothing seemed to stay his career of
                    conquest and revenge. The prince of Orange was powerless; but <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> the despair caused by the cruel destruction of
                    Naarden roused a spirit which even Alva could not tame, and the famous siege of
                    Haarlem, lasting through the winter of 1572 till July 1573, cost 12,000 Spanish
                    troops, and gave the insurgent provinces time to breathe. A great mutiny among
                    Alva’s troops still more hindered the work of subjugation. The repulse of Don
                    Frederick of Toledo, Alva’s son, from Alkmaar, the capture of Geertruidenberg by
                    the Dutch, and Admiral Dirkson’s great victory over Alva’s fleet, entirely
                    changed the aspect of affairs, and saved the towns of North Holland. Alva, who
                    had come as far as Amsterdam, returned to Brussels, and thence, obtaining his
                    recall, bade farewell to his government. During the six years it had lasted, his
                    executioners bad put to death 18,000 persons, to say nothing of the victims in
                    cities captured by his troops; the Spaniards plundered where they could, and
                    considered the whole wealth of the Netherlands their lawful prey, forfeited by
                    rebellion. But his pitiless severity only served to raise up a stubbornness of
                    civic resistance, against which the tried discipline of the Spanish soldiery,
                    and the consummate skill of their commander, reckoned to be the first general in
                    Europe, were powerless.</p>

                <p>Don Louis of Requesens, grand-commander of Castile, was appointed Alva’s
                    successor, and after a brief and deceptive lull the war went on. In January
                    1574, by the fall of Middelburg, the Spaniards lost their last hold on Walcheren
                    and on Zealand, while by the splendid defence of Leyden, unparalleled in the
                    history of heroic endurance, their efforts in another direction were effectually
                    frustrated. After fruitless negotiations with Philip, the estates of Holland, in
                    November 1574, formally offered to William “the Silent,” prince of Orange, full
                    authority by land and sea, with the title of governor or regent. Conferences
                    were also held, with a view to peace, at Breda; and on their failure, in summer
                    1575, Holland and Zealand drew up articles of union, and an ordinance for their
                    joint government under the prince of Orange. By it he received supreme command
                    in war and absolute authority in all matters of defence, the control of all
                    money voted by the estates, the maintenance of the laws as count, in the king’s
                    name, the ultimate appointment (after nomination by the estates) of all judicial
                    officers. He undertook to protect Calvinism, and to suppress all religion at
                    variance with the gospel,” while he forbade all inquisition into private
                    opinions. These terms accepted, William became, in spite of their nominal
                    recognition of Philip, the true prince of the two provinces. Still this union,
                    brought about by the prince’s personal character and ability, and by the popular
                    faith in him, was distasteful to the larger cities. Already we may note the
                    beginnings of that party division which was afterwards so prominent, and divided
                    Holland between the lιnd-party, popular, quasi-monarchical, Calvinistic, headed
                    by the Orange-Nassau family, and the sea-party, the town-party, headed by the
                    burghers of Amsterdam, Arminian, civic, and aristocratic.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the grand-commander made a successful attempt on the Zealand coast. His
                    troops took Duivelaud, and laid siege to Zierikzee, chief town of Schouwen, and
                    key of the whole coast. The two provinces, unable to relieve the place, were
                    driven to consider their position. So long as they paid any allegiance to Philip
                    of Spain, agιinst whom they were struggling for life, they could never get much
                    help from any other prince, nor were they strong enough to assert their own
                    sovereignty. Three powers lay near them the empire, already connected with them
                    by old relations, and by the family connexion of the house of Orange; France,
                    with her restless Valois dukes, ready for any venture, whether in Poland,
                    England, or Holland; and, lιstly, England, whose queen knew well that Philip was
                    her foe, and that the Low Countries might effectually hinder his efforts against
                    her. The provinces, though William had suggested it, refused to deal with the
                    emperor, and turned to Elizabeth; she brought them little real help, and they
                    seemed to be on the very brink of ruin when fever carried Requesens off in March
                    1576.</p>
                <p>The breathing space thus gained enabled them to strengthen their union under
                    William; but before the question respecting the position of the duke of Anjou
                    could be settled, the siege of Zierikzee drew to an end. Boisot perished in a
                    too gallant attempt to break the leaguer, and the town yielded. Things looked
                    ill for the patriots, and Zealand would have been at the mercy of the conqueror,
                    had not another great mutiny neutralized the success of the victors; the Spanish
                    and Walloon troops left Zealand and, headed, as usual, by their “eletto,”
                    marched into the richer plains of Brabant, seizing Alost, whence they threatened
                    both Brussels and Antwerp. One of the results of the panic they caused in
                    Brabant was the capture of Ghent by William. Brussels was only saved from being
                    pillaged by them by the vigour of the inhabitants, who armed in their own
                    defence. Suffering under a powerless administrative, and smarting from the curse
                    of the foreign soldiery, the southerners now began to wish for freedom and union
                    with the other provinces. The broad liberality of Orange, moderating the
                    Calvinism of the people, enabled the two groups to draw together. In October
                    1576 a congress of the States General of the provinces met at Ghent; the council
                    of state at Brussels was forcibly dissolved; the frightful “Spanish Fury” at
                    Antwerp struck such terror into all hearts that a treaty was concluded in
                    November 1576 under the title of the “Pacification of Ghent.” It was received
                    with great enthusiasm; in it the provinces agreed first to eject the foreigner,
                    then to meet in States General and regulate all matters of religion and defence;
                    it was stipulated that nothing should be done against the Catholic religion; the
                    Spanish king’s name was still used; the prince of Orange was recognized only as
                    stadtholder of Holland and Zealand. All the seventeen provinces accepted the
                    Pacification; and for a brief space the “United Provinces” really did exist.</p>
                <p>Early in January 1577 the “Union of Brussels” was put forth. The document engaged
                    all who joined to help in ejecting the foreign troops, in carrying out the
                    Pacification, in maintaining the Catholic faith, in recognizing Philip’s
                    sovereignty, in defending the liberties and constitutions of the provinces. It
                    was eagerly adopted; and even Holland and Zealand made no demur. When the paper,
                    crowded with signatures, was laid before Don John of Austria, who meanwhile had
                    arrived as regent, he also accepted it; and on the 17th February 1577 was signed
                    the “Perpetual Edict,” which ratified the Pacification of Ghent. Not till the
                    troops were gone should Don John be received as governor-general. Philip II.
                    ratified the Edict a few weeks later.</p>
                <p>Yet, after all, unity did not ensue from it. The natural divergency between north
                    and south at once appeared; in character, in interests, above all, in religion,
                    they had little in common; and when William of Orange refused to publish the
                    edict in Holland and Zealand he was warmly supported by these provinces. This is
                    perhaps the real point at which Dutch independence begins. Don John ente-ed
                    Brussels in triumph, and, by conciliation and winning manners, had already
                    broken up the union; the whole of the southern provinces withdrew from it at
                    once, and that well-marked difference in political life, which, after so many
                    changes, still distinguishes Belgian from Dutchman, was from that moment made
                    clear. Yet, though Don John had achieved so much, the result, after all,
                    disappointed him; he was surrounded by difficulties, suspicions, and plots; he
                    saw the failure of his larger schemes, and only the partial success of his
                    effort to reduce the Netherlands; he recognized the dangers which the abilities
                    and rivalry of William of Orange were preparing for him. This was soon shown in
                    the seizure of Antwerp citadel by the patriots, and in the destruction of the
                    hated fortifications, so long the sign and efficient cause of their subjection.
                    Other castles, such as that of Ghent, were razed to the ground as soon as the
                    fall of Antwerp citadel was known. Still less was Don John pleased by the
                    election of his rival as ruwaard of Brabant, and by his enthusiastic reception
                    at Brussels. The States General (7th December 1577)declared strongly against Don
                    John’s authority.</p>
                <p>It was clear war must begin again; and the patriots raised an army nearly 20,000
                    strong, which was utterly defeated by Don John and Alexander Farnese, at
                    Gembloux near Namur. But their campaign was wasted on isolated movements and
                    town-taking, while William of Orange fell back unmolested to Antwerp. A sudden
                    illness, so sudden as to arouse the common suspicion of poison, carried off the
                    conqueror of Lepanto (1st October Γ578), and Alexander of Parma succeeded him in
                    the government.</p>

                    gather strength; the recovery of Amsterdam (1-578) removed the one hindrance to
                    their prosperity. While the south trusted to foreign help, some John Casimir, or
                    duke of Anjou, the north quietly consolidated itself. In January 1579 was
                    proclaimed the famous “Union of Utrecht.” The document professed to make no
                    changes; it would but carry out the Pacification of Ghent by a closer junction
                    of Holland and Zealand with Friesland, Guelderland with Zutphen, Utrecht,
                    Overyssel, Groningen; united as one, these provinces should still retain their
                    local uses and privileges So long as the archduke Matthias, who had been
                    appointed governor-general in 1577, remained, his authority would be respected;
                    on his withdrawal in 1580 the States General named as stadtholder William of
                    Orange, who had already exercised the real authority over the provinces. A
                    considerable number of southern cities, Ghent, Antwerp, Bruges, and others, as
                    well as some of the nobles, also joined this union. Thus did the United
                    Provinces at last come definitely into being.</p>
                <p>During the next five years Spain devoted her efforts to the southern provinces
                    alone; the union was unmolested. The Walloon provinces were reconciled to Spain;
                    the others, with exception of Holland and Zealand, had accepted the duke of
                    Anjou as their sovereign; Holland and Zealand had proclaimed William of Orange
                    as their chief, though he did not finally accept sovereign poweκ and the title
                    of count till August 1582, by a sort of cross division, the seven northern
                    provinces, meeting at the Hague, had (26th July 1581 ) made an “Act of
                    Abjuration,” and had issued their “Declaration of Independence,” the five naming
                    Anjou, the two William, as their sovereign in Philip’s stead. Then Holland and
                    Zealand framed an independent constitution, conservative of their ancient
                    liberties, as expressed in the “Great Privilege of the Lady Mary ;” they
                    declared themselves a free country, severed alike from Spain and from the
                    empire.</p>
                <p>But Spain was not yet ready to take up this challenge; and meanwhile she resorted
                    to other weapons. A scandalous proclamation, offering rewards and honours to any
                    ruffian who would serve church and king by murdering William of Orange, was now
                    issued; and, roused by the double inducement, after many unsuccessful attempts,
                    a paltry wretch (10th July 1584) succeeded in assassinating the greatest man of
                    his age, the worthy “Father William” of the Dutch, and the only ruler in the
                    world’s history who may fairly be compared with Washington.</p>
                <p>Fortunately for the Provinces, and for the world’s liberties, the spirit of
                    William of Orange survived in his second son Maurice, who now, though he was
                    only seventeen and a student at Leyden, and though he had an older brother
                    living in Spain, was at once, chiefly through the influence of that great
                    statesman John Olden Bιrneveldt, named governor of the United Provinces, with a
                    council of st de, and with Count Hohenlohe, his brother-iu-law, as
                    lieutenant-general. He was also, soon after, made stadtholder of Holland and
                    Zealand, while Utrecht was placed under the lord of Villars as stadtholder,
                    Guelderland and Overyssel under the count of Meurs, and Friesland under William
                    of Nassau. Never was any one better fitted for his life’s task than was this
                    boy, thus early called to rule in troubled times. For Maurice of Nassau had all
                    the coldness and calculation of his family, all its ambition, all its firmness
                    apd tenacity of grasp, while he added thereto a quality wanting in the others, a
                    genius for war, and those gifts which go to make what is commonly called a lucky
                    commander—gifts which may be best described by saying that the lucky captain is
                    he who in war leaves least to luck. For over forty years Maurice was the
                    champion of the Provinces; and, if we except his treatment of Barneveldt, we may
                    say that he comes next after his father as a founder of the Dutch republic.</p>
                <p>At the outset his antagonist was that formidable captain, Alexander Farnese, who
                    had by this time nearly subdued all the southern provinces, and whose arms
                    proved successful at Ghent (1584) and at Antwerp (1585). The northern provinces,
                    thinking it necessary to call in foreign aid, appealed to Henry III. of France,
                    but the outburst of the “War of the three Henries,” caused by the anxiety of the
                    Guises lest Henry should draw too much towards the heretics, put a stop to all
                    hope of help from that side. Olden Barneveldt, therefore, next crossed over to
                    England with offers to Queen Elizabeth, who, though declining for herself the
                    proffered sovereignty over the Provinces, undertook to appoint a
                    governor-general, and to send over and pay 5000 foot and 1000 horse; in return
                    for which she was to be put in possession of certain cautionary towns.
                    Accordingly, Sir John Norris was at once sent over with the English forces; Sir
                    Philip Sidney was appointed governor of Flushing, and the earl of Leicester was
                    named governorgeneral by the queen. At first Leicester was welcomed with all the
                    joy that his Calvinistic opinions, and his position as favourite and
                    representative of Elizabeth, could elicit in the breasts of men who had now long
                    been struggling for existence, and who, bereft of their great prince, were
                    yearning for some strong hand to guide them. But it did not last: his high
                    pretensions, and his mistress’s haughty tone, joined with his foolish
                    interference with Dutch commerce and with the religious difficulties now
                    beginning to show themselves, soon offended the States General, and neutralized
                    whatever good the active help of England might have promised them. In 1586 Sir
                    Philip Sidney invaded Flanders, and the young stadtholder of Holland gladly
                    served under him. In the same autumn Leicester himself took the field, and
                    marched to meet Parma, who was threatening the provinces from the east. Under
                    the walls of Zutphen Sir Philip Sidney fell; and Leicester, finding his efforts
                    useless, soon raised the siege of that town, and withdrew to the Hague. The rest
                    of his time was spent in bitter quarrels with the estates; Olden Barneveldt and
                    Maurice were united for a time by his marked ill-will towards them both; and so
                    strong did the feeling against him grow, that in 1587 Queen Elizabeth was fain
                    to order his recall. For a while there was great soreness between the countries;
                    the general interest, however, was far stronger than any partial pique, and in
                    the crisis of the Spanish Armada in 1588 the Dutch did very great service to
                    England by resolutely blockading in their ports the transports and army with
                    which Parma had meant to invade the English shores. In the same year Maurice had
                    the satisfaction of seeing the English and Dutch repulse the famous duke from
                    the walls of Bergen-op-Zoom. In 1589, on the other hand, the English garrison of
                    Geertruidenberg betrayed that important place, the doorway out of Brabant into
                    Holland, into Parma’s hands, and laid the United Provinces open to attack. In
                    other places also the English forces, not yet withdrawn, were an anxiety and
                    danger to the states. Still, from this moment the fortunes of the Dutch began to
                    rise. No contrast could be more striking than that between the Spanish
                    Netherlands and the United Provinces. In the fertile districts of Hainault and
                    Brabant, where climate and soil are good and transit easy, utter ruin alone was
                    seen: wolves and wild dogs swarmed; the land was overrun with weeds and briars;
                    and even the wealthy cities of the past were almost deserted. In the United
                    Provinces, on the contrary, the wellbeing of the country was steadily
                    increasing: every year its hardy seamen brought back fresh wealth; and
                    thousands' of ingenious workers, turning in despair from the hopelessness of
                    their condition in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n89/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0089-0078"/> Spanish Netherlands, brought their skill and
                    industry into the north, which soon became as famous for its manufacturing
                    excellence as for its energy in commerce. It was at this period that, just when
                    the southern cities were languishing and losing ground, the northern burgher
                    life made vigorous growth, and prepared the way for that supremacy of town
                    aristocracy which characterized the history of Holland in the following
                    century.</p>
                <p>The year 1590 opened well for the United Provinces: Utrecht joined its fortunes
                    with those of Holland and Zealand; Guelderland and Overyssel made William Louis
                    of Nassau their stadtholder, so strengthening the power of the family; and Breda
                    was recovered by a daring stratagem. The duke of Parma also, with failing
                    health, was called away to oppose the victorious progress of Henry IV. in
                    northern France. In 1591 Prince Maurice sti.l further strengthened himself by
                    taking Zutphen, Deventer, Hulst, and eventually Nimeguen, which secured for him
                    the complete submission of Guelderland. Parma was unable to oppose him
                    effectually, for his troops were again mutinous; he was also once more called
                    off into France. The reputation of Prince Maurice rose now to its highest point:
                    the greatest captain in Europe seemed unable to cope with him, and the vigorous
                    help of Barneveldt still secured him firm support at home. In 1593 he took
                    Geertruidenberg; and in 1594 Groningen, the only stronghold left to the
                    Spaniards in all the Seven Provinces, was reduced.</p>
                <p>The appointment of the cardinal archduke Albert as governor of the Spanish
                    Netherlands did not much change the current of affairs; the Dutch now tried to
                    open up a trade with the East Indies, and made some vigorous explorations in
                    Arctic seas. In 1596 the archduke recovered Hulst, which commanded the
                    northernmost parts of Flanders; the Dutch on the other hand, with the English,
                    sacked Cadiz and destroyed the Spanish fleet; and in the next year Maurice
                    inflicted a defeat on the Spaniards at Turnhout, transferred his sphere of
                    action to the Rhine country, and took town after town, making the provinces
                    secure on the side of Zutphen, Overyssel, and Friesland. The year 1598 gave a
                    new aspect to affairs by the conclusion of the Franco-Spanish war in the treaty
                    of Ver vins, and by the death of Philip II. The Dutch, assisted only by the
                    English, and that chiefly by volunteers, were now to bear the whole brunt of the
                    efforts of Spain. In the autumn of 1599 Prince Maurice endeavoured to transfer
                    the war into Germany; and after taking Emmerich in the Cleves country, delivered
                    Bommel from the siege which Mendoza, the Spanish general, was laying to it. But
                    dissatisfaction at home, and the unreadiness of his German allies, forced
                    Maurice to turn his eyes towards Flanders, which he invaded in the summer of
                    1600. Surprised by the Spaniards in the neighbourhood of Nieuport, Maurice was
                    attacked by the archduke Albert in a most critical position, but, after a long
                    and well-balanced battle, inflicted on him (July 2) a disastrous defeat. Maurice
                    could not, however, take the town, and winter put a stop to the campaign without
                    any great change in the relative position of the belligerents. In 1601 the
                    archduke began the famous siege of Ostend, which lasted three years and two
                    months; the losses on both sides, more especially among the Spanish, were
                    immense. While it continued, the coolness between the States General and Maurice
                    steadily increased; for they thought his cold ambitious nature capable of
                    anything, and saw with fear the paramount influence he had over the army. Their
                    instincts led them to rest on the ships, to prefer peace to war, and commerce to
                    glory. It was during the siege of Ostend that they established the Dutch East
                    India Company in 1602, though its basis had been laid down by a group of
                    Amsterdam traders in 1595.</p>
                <p>In 1604 Maurice took S1uis, and Ostend at last fell to Spinola. Thenceforward the
                    mam lines of the struggle by land were simple enough: the Spaniards tried to
                    transfer the seat of war into the United Provinces, and were steadily foiled by
                    Maurice. All the while the States General aimed at peace, though the naval war
                    became vigorous as that on land languished. The sea fight off Gibraltar in 1607
                    utterly ruined the Spanish fleet, and left her commerce powerless. At last,
                    after long negotiations, which served to emphasize the variance between the
                    patriot party, headed by Barneveldt and Grotius, and the war party, which
                    included the official classes, the army, navy, East India Company, the clergy,
                    and the populace in the towns, a truce for twelve years was signed, on the <hi
                    rend="italic">uti possidetis</hi> ground, between Spain and Holland. In the war
                    the Dutch had added Overyssel and Groningen to the union; they held Sluis,
                    Hulst, and other ports on the Flemish side, in what is called “Dutch Flanders”;
                    they had Bergen-op-Zoom, Breda, and Herzogenbusch on the Brabant frontier, and
                    the forts which commanded the Scheldt and strangled Antwerp for the sake of
                    Amsterdam; lastly, they were become lords of the sea, and the chief traders of
                    the world.</p>
                <p>After a brief interference in the affairs of Germany, where the intricate
                    question of the Cleves-Juliers succession was already preparing the way for the
                    Thirty Years’ War, Holland settled down into that hot and absorbing theological
                    struggle, which was closely mixed up with political questions, and which stained
                    with a deplorable triumph the last years of the career of Maurice of Nassau. In
                    1603 Jacob van Hermansen, or, in Latin form, Arminius (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Arminius),</hi> had been appointed one of the two professors of theology at
                    Leyden, Francis Gomar being the other. The two men took opposite sides with
                    zeal, Arminius assailing and Gomarus defending the current popular theology. The
                    views of Arminius spread fast among the upper classes, especially in the larger
                    towns, and became the theology of the civic aristocracy; the established
                    opinions were tenaciously supported by the bulk of the clergy, the peasantry,
                    the town populace, the army, and the navy. At their head stood Maurice, ready to
                    use the strength of Calvinistic feeling, to secure his own authority, however
                    little he might care for the tenets of his side; at the head of the other party,
                    more philosophical, less in earnest perhaps, was Barneveldt, with the town
                    traders. King James of England as yet supported the Calvinists, and with
                    Archbishop Abbot influenced greatly the proceedings of the famous synod of Dort
                    (1618) in favour of Prince Maurice and the anti-Remonstrants. The results of the
                    synod enabled the prince for his own political purposes to crush the
                    aristocratic party. Barneveldt and Grotius (another leading Remonstrant) were
                    seized, and in spite of all his great services to his country, his venerable
                    age, and his past support of Maurice, the pensionary was brought to an infamous
                    trial and executed at the Hague in 1619. Grotius afterwards escaped from prison
                    and took refuge in France. The silenced Remonstrants, finding that there was no
                    hope of toleration for them, left the country in great numbers, and formed a
                    prosperous settlement in Holstein in 1621, where they founded the town of
                    Frederickstadt on the Eider.</p>
                <p>In 1621 the truce with Spain came to an end, and the Dutch were at once involved
                    in the vortex of the Thirty Years’ War, which had now been going on for a couple
                    of years. Spinola, after taking Juliets, attempted Bergen-op-Zoom, hoping
                    thereby to open a passage into Zealand; he was, however, foiled by Maurice.
                    About this time a great coolness sprang up between Holland and England, the
                    beginning of the deadly rivalry which lasted so long.</p>

                <p>King James, was eager to gain his objects Λvithout fighting, and to be on
                    friendly terms with Spain; he and Laud were opposed to the Calvinism of the
                    Dutch, and disliked their form of church government; and commercial jealousy was
                    already beginning to arise. Successes and losses were evenly balanced in the
                    war: the Dutch recaptured Juliers and took Cleves, while Spinola, after great
                    losses caused by the gallant defence of the English, in 1625 took Breda. A few
                    days before the town fell Maurice died, leaving the Spaniards in the heart of
                    his territories, and the Dutch vexed with religious and domestic factions.</p>
                <p>His brother, Frederick Henry of Orange-Nassau, succeeded him as stadtholder of
                    Holland, Zealand, Guelderland, Utrecht, and Overyssel. The war by land became
                    utterly spiritless, though by sea the Dutch still asserted their maritime
                    supremacy. By land the chief operations were the siege and capture by Frederick
                    Henry of Herzogenbuscb, Maestricht, and Wesel in 1628; by sea the Dutch
                    interfered, much against the popular feeling, to assist the French court against
                    the Huguenots at La Rochelle. They blockaded Dunkirk, whence Spanish privateers
                    had been wont to harass their commerce; under Piet Heyn of Delftshaven, boldest
                    of their sea-captains, they vexed the Spanish coasts, captured Spanish war
                    ships, carried off their “silver fleet,” and finally in 1631 won near Tholen a
                    brilliant victory over a great Spanish fleet commanded by Count John of Nassau,
                    who was endeavouring to make a descent on the Zealand coast.</p>
                <p>In this year the States, feeling that the moderation of the stadtholder was
                    honest and salutary, that his influence . alone seemed able to quiet the rage of
                    religious faction, and that his military operations had secured the confidence
                    of the provinces, took the important, and, as it turned out, the unwise step of
                    securing to his infant son the reversion of all his great offices of
                    stadtholder, captain, and admiralgeneral. The Calvinists were willing to grant
                    so much to the head of their party, and made no objection to the introduction of
                    the principle of hereditary succession; while the Remonstrants, discerning that
                    Frederick Henry, like his brother before him, was personally more favourable to
                    their tenets than to those of their adversaries, accepted the measure in the
                    hope that when permanently established as their prince he would carry out those
                    tolerant views which he was known to hold.</p>
                <p>In 1632 he justified their confidence by his masterly siege and capture of
                    Maestricht, in defiance of all the efforts of the Spanish and imperial generals;
                    Namur, Luxembourg, and eastern Brabant were laid under contribution in
                    consequence, and the States defended from danger of attack towards the east. As
                    the war dragged on after the death of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, France and
                    Holland drew more together, and in 1635 an alliance and partition treaty was
                    made between them, in which it was proposed that the Spaniards should be driven
                    out of the Netherlands, which should be made an independent state, guaranteed by
                    the allies; that France should receive, as her share, the seacoast up to
                    Blankenberg, together with Thionville and Namur; and that a corresponding
                    portion should be given to Holland; if this scheme of an independent state
                    proved a failure, then France and Holland should divide the whole district
                    between them. The joint operations consequent on this agreement proved a
                    failure: Frederick Henry had always been opposed to the alliance, and probably
                    did not wish its success; the divergence between him and the States General at
                    this time gave Cardinal Richelieu the opportunity of restoring the Remonstrant
                    party in Holland, and makiιig it French in sympathy, in opposition to the House
                    of Orange—a combination of which Louis XIV. afterwards made great use. In 1637
                    the stadtholder recovered Breda, though the gain was balanced by the loss of
                    Roermond and other places; and in 1638 the war was favourable to the Spaniards.
                    In 1639, however, a series of great naval triumphs under Tromp and De Witt
                    turned the scale in favour of the Dutch.</p>
                <p>In 1640, on the death of Count Henry of Nassau, stadtholder of Friesland and
                    Groningen, the latter province chose Frederick Henry as its stadtholder, and he
                    thus became chief of six out of the seven United Provinces; in the next year he
                    was able to arrange the marriage of his son William with Mary, eldest daughter
                    of Charles I. of England, a match devised by the queen-mother of France, while a
                    refugee in Holland, in order to increase the ill-will between Richelieu and the
                    stadtholder. Thus began the dynastic relation between the Stewarts and the house
                    of Orange, which led to such great results before the end of the century. The
                    States General were not too well pleased with this alliance, and looked shyly at
                    Henrietta Maria when she came over to Holland to get help for Charles L in 1642.
                    They were becoming alarmed at the great power and growing ambition of France
                    under Richelieu, while they sympathized to a great extent with the English
                    Puritans.</p>
                <p>All parties, except the French, being now utterly weary of the war, negotiations
                    for peace, long talked of, long prepared for, began in earnest at Münster and
                    Osnabrück. Before their close Frederick Henry died in 1647, and was succeeded in
                    his dignities and offices by his young son William II., and almost immediately
                    afterwards (January 1648), in spite of the opposition of France and the young
                    prince of Orange, the deputies of the Provinces (with exception of Zealand and
                    Utrecht) signed a separate treaty of peace with Spain, which was confirmed and
                    sworn to in May at Münster. It was a complete surrender of everything for which
                    Spain so long had fought. The United Provinces were recognized as free and
                    independent, and Spain dropped all her claims; the <hi rend="italic">uti
                    possidetis</hi> basis was adopted in the matter of all conquests; the two
                    contracting parties agreed to respect and keep clear of each other’s
                    trading-grounds; each should pay, in the ports of the other, only such tolls as
                    natives of the other paid; the Scheldt was entirely closed by the States, so
                    that Amsterdam might strangle Antwerp—the chief harbour of the free Provinces
                    thus ruining the chief harbour of those still subject to Spain. And so ended the
                    so-called Eighty Years’ War.</p>
                <p>No sooner was the peace concluded than bitter disputes arose between Holland, on
                    the one hand, and the prince of Orange, supported by the army and navy and the
                    smaller provinces, on the other. He was tempted into foolish acts: he arrested
                    six of the deputies of Holland; he even tried to surprise and occupy Amsterdam;
                    he favoured the English royalists, now plentiful in the Provinces, while
                    Amsterdam and Holland inclined towards the Commonwealth. Things went so far that
                    William ∏. had almost destroyed the liberties of the Provinces, and was intent
                    on two schemes, —the resumption of war against Spain, with a partition with
                    France of the Spanish Netherlands, and interference on behalf of Charles II. in
                    England,—when his opportune death by small-pox occurred. A few days afterwards
                    his widow, Mary of England, gave birth to a son, who was destined to be the most
                    distinguished man of his race, William III. of Holland and England.</p>
                <p>For a time the death of William II. restored the burgherparty to power, and made
                    Amsterdam the head of the United Provinces. Holland triumphed over Zealand; the
                    house of Orange, friend of the Stewarts, seemed to suffer eclipse with them; and
                    though the royalist mob even at the Hague, set on by a princely rough of the
                    palatine house, made it impossible for the envoys of the English Commonwealth to
                    come to terms with the republic, still the popular monarchical party was in fact
                    powerless in the Provinces for more <pb break="no"

                    security of this aristocratic government that a great assembly of the Provinces
                    was held in 1651, and established that form of rule which Sir William Temple has
                    so well described in his <hi rend="italic">Observations upon the United
                    Provinces of the Netherlands.</hi></p>
                <p>There were four chief elements in that federation :—the terms of the Union of
                    Utrecht (1579); the claims and position of the house of Orange; the sovereignty,
                    within its own borders, of each province; and lastly, the liberties and power of
                    the cities. In the last two the lead was taken by Holland: Holland w as the
                    chief province, and Amsterdam, its capital, the chief city of the union. And
                    these two parts of the federation were at one also in their resistance to the
                    house of Orange, of which the chief strength lay in Zealand. The union was
                    governed, in theory at least, by the States General of the provinces, which met
                    at the Hague, and consisted of a fluctuating number of deputies (sometimes as
                    many as 800), and was supplemented by a permanent council of state, a kind of
                    cabinet composed of twelve deputies from the provinces, and a chamber of
                    accounts. Besides this body each province had its own estates, and each great
                    city its own senate. Thus Amsterdam was ruled by a senate of thirty-six
                    burghers, who kept order, administered justice, raised local taxes. The office
                    of senator was for life, originally by election of the whole body of freemen,
                    but from the 16th century by cooptation, so that the government of the city
                    became a dose oligarchy. The chief towns followed Amsterdam in this direction.
                    The senate elected the deputies of the city to the states of Holland.</p>
                <p>The commercial prosperity of the Provinces went on advancing throughout the 17th
                    century; each town had its own work. Flushing received the West India trade;
                    Middelburg was entrepôt for French wines; Terveer was the Scottish and Dort the
                    English staple; Leyden manufactured; Haarlem made linen and mixed stuffs, and
                    grew tulips for profit and pastime; Delft was known for beer and hardware;
                    Zaandam built ships; Enkhuizen caught and cured herrings; Friesland had the
                    Greenland trade; and lastly Amsterdam, recognized chief of Dutch cities, had the
                    East India trade, with that of Spain and the Mediterranean: their whole carrying
                    business reached from t∩e Gulf of Bothnia to the farthest Indies. Their
                    seafaring enterprise received an early scientific impulse from the labours of
                    Coignet and G. Mercator. All questions as to the nature and development of
                    wealth were still in their infancy: it was believed that all depended on
                    balances of actual bullion; and the Spaniards were envied because their ships
                    brought over masses of gold and silver. The “balance of trade,” the
                    establishment of banks at home and colonies abroad, especially mining colonies,
                    a huge carrying trade, the making of goods to be sold for cash only, the
                    discouragement of all imports, and the support of all monopolies—these things,
                    chief elements of what is called the “isolation theory of trade,” guided the
                    politics of the 17th century, gave Holland vast temporary wealth, discouraged
                    her power of production, and eventually have left her impotent among the
                    nations.</p>
                <p>At first William the Silent had been governor of the Provinces, nominally at
                    least under the king of Spain; and in the reconstruction he secured his own
                    rights, while the sovereign power was transferred to the States General They
                    took the right of making peace and war, of concluding alliances, of taxing and
                    coining. The governor had all military commands, had power to pardon, and
                    controlled the civil appointments; he represented the dignity of the state, with
                    a court, and guards, and envoys from other lands. Each province had its own
                    stadtholder, an office in name at least derived from the Spanish times; each
                    town had its own pensionary or chief minister. But after the death of William
                    II., the office of stadtholder of Holland was for a time suspended; there was no
                    captain-general or admiral; and the grand pensionary of Holland, first minister
                    of the state, became virtual president of the republic, as we see in the cases
                    of John De Witt and Heinsius.</p>
                <p>When the English envoys returned to tell their masters, the Commonwealth, of
                    their failure at the Hague, parliament at once replied by passing the memorable
                    Navigation Act of 1651, which aimed at destroying the carrying-trade of the
                    Provinces. The struggle for the lordship of the seas which ensued, and with
                    which the names of Tromp and Ruyter, Blake, and Monk are so splendidly
                    associated, was waged with equal bravery and nearly equal success on both sides,
                    until 1654, when peace was made by the Amsterdam burgher-party. By the terms of
                    the treaty with Cromwell the Orange-Nassau family was altogether to be excluded
                    from the stadtholderate of Holland, the other Provinces reserving their
                    independence, and the Dutch populace also much disliking the peace. England
                    preserved the honour of her flag, while Holland was seen to be a worthy and
                    equal rival for the command of the sea.</p>
                <p>Hostilities between the Dutch and Portuguese respecting their rights in Brazil
                    followed, in which, after each side had done much damage to the other, peace was
                    also made; and Holland in 1658 interfered to save the Danes from Charles
                    Gustavus of Sweden. In 1659 a treaty of peace was made between France, England,
                    and the United Provinces, with a view to the settlement of the Dano-Swedish
                    question, which ended in securing a northern peace in 1660, and in keeping the
                    Baltic waters open for Dutch trade. Since the abolition of the stadtholderate
                    after William’s death in 1650, the centre of authority had lain in the hands of
                    John de Witt, the sagacious leader of the anti-Orange or Amsterdam
                    burgher-party; and he guided the foreign affairs of the provinces in such a way
                    as to secure the fair development of their commerce on every side.</p>
                <p>The momentous year 1660 was almost as critical for Holland as for any state of
                    Europe. Charles, in England, having re-enacted the Navigation Act, war again
                    broke out in 1665, and the duke of York took the command of the English fleet.
                    At the beginning of June he met the Dutch admiral Opdam, and, after a
                    close-fought battle off Lowestoft, the English were completely victorious. But
                    so bad was the condition of the home Government in England that in the following
                    year the Dutch had by far the stronger fleet at sea, and for a time held their
                    own in the Channel. The four-days’ battle (June 1-4) between Prince Rupert and
                    Monk on the one side and Ruyter on the other ended in an uncertain victory for
                    the Dutch; but on July 25th they were decidedly defeated off the North Foreland,
                    and driven back to their own shores with immense loss. The English were now
                    masters of the sea; but both parties needed peace, and negotiations began at
                    Breda. In the course of these Ruyter suddenly sailed up the Thames nearly to
                    Gravesend, and struck terror into the very heart of London, which thus became
                    all the more eager for a settlement. In July 1667 a treaty between England and
                    Holland was signed at Breda; and in the following year Sir William Temple
                    accomplished the triple alliance of England, Holland, and Sweden, against the
                    aggressive views of Louis XIV., a hollow affair, and pernicious in its results
                    to those who made it It made Louis XIV. determine to take vengeance on the
                    United Provinces and on the De Witts; it led at once to the humiliation of
                    England by the treaty of Dover (1670), to the overthrow of the Amsterdam party,
                    and to the miserable end of the De Witts; and it eventually raised the prince of
                    Orange to supreme authority in the United Provinces.</p>

                <p>From 1668 to 1672 Louis XIV. made ready to destroy the Dutch; and so well had his
                    diplomacy served him that they were left without a friend in Europe. In 1672 the
                    storm broke: the English, without a declaration of war, tried unsuccessfully to
                    intercept the Dutch Mediterranean fleet; and France at once set forth to conquer
                    the hated tradesmen of the north. The States Were ill-prepared on land, though
                    their fleet was strong and ready; party spirit was exceedingly bitter, and the
                    ruling party, well aware that the prince of Orange was very popular with the
                    land forces, had utterly neglected their army. On May 58, 1672, Ruyter fought a
                    great naval battle in South wold Bay (Solebay) against the duke of York and
                    Marshal D’Estrées: the French held aloof, pleased to see the Dutch and English
                    destroy each other: the English suffered most, but, as the Dutch withdrew to
                    their own ports, the others claimed the victory. Meanwhile Louis XIV. crossed
                    the Rhine and threatened Amsterdam (see <hi rend="smallcaps">France).</hi> The
                    young prince of Orange alone seemed to rise to the occasion; while others were
                    panic-stricken, sending embassies of submission to the haughty monarch, making
                    preparations for a great flight by sea, William with his miserable army did his
                    best, and aroused so strongly the feelings of the people that Amsterdam, passing
                    from dejection to despair and thence to reckless enthusiasm, rose against the De
                    Witts and foully murdered both in the streets. They had just before proclaimed
                    William stadtholder of Holland with powers unlimited. And thus Louis XIV.
                    destroyed the proud republic, though in so doing he had raised up the most
                    formidable enemy he was destined to encounter. His invasion did not prosper;
                    other nations began to take up the Dutch cause; Germans and Spaniards threatened
                    the embarrassed French army in the Provinces; so that in 1674 France was on the
                    defensive on every side. William of Orange in that year was defeated at Senef,
                    and had to abandon his plan of penetrating into France, and in 1675 the death of
                    Marshal Turenne, and the retirement of the great Condé, turned the tide of war
                    in favour of the Dutch, except on the sea, where the French fleet defeated and
                    destroyed in the Mediterranean (in 1676) the united navies of Holland and Spain.
                    In 1677 negotiations for peace went on, and were hastened by the marriage, at
                    the close of the year, of William of Orange with the Princess Mary, daughter of
                    the duke of York. At last, in 1678, came the great peace of Nimeguen, which
                    secured the independence of the Dutch.</p>
                <p>The aggressive policy of Louis XIV., in the years which followed the peace of
                    Nimeguen, enabled William to lay the basis of the famous confederacy which
                    changed the whole front of European politics. Brandenburg, Denmark, and England
                    sided with the French king; while the league of Augsburg (1686), following
                    directly after the revocation of the edict of Nantes, placed William at the head
                    of the resistance to French domination. The league was joined by the emperor,
                    Spain, the United Provinces, Sweden, Bavaria, and other German princes. The
                    accession of James II. to the throne of England made it easy for the stadtholder
                    to keep up close relations with the malcontents in church and state, who
                    regarded him and the Princess Mary as the natural successors to the English
                    throne. On the birth of the prince of Wales the antiCatholic feeling in England
                    at last grew so strong that William was able to interfere with success; while
                    the diversion of the attention of Louis XIV. from Holland to the Rhine relieved
                    the timid rulers of Amsterdam from all anxiety. The Revolution of 1688 ensued,
                    and England became, under William’s strong rule, the chief member of the great
                    coalition against France. In the grand alliance of 1689-90 he clearly sacrificed
                    Dutch to English interests, and carried through his policy in spite of great
                    irritation in Holland and Zealand. His power seemed almost autocratic, and the
                    States impotent. Henceforward their part in history becomes quite secondary
                    compared with that of England, and we may refer for details of the great wars to
                    the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">England</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>In 1690 Waldeck, commanding the Dutch, was defeated by Luxembourg at Fleurus; and
                    the Anglo-Dutch fleet was also severely handled off Beachy Head by the French,
                    who inflicted terrible losses on Dutch commerce. In 1691 the French took Mons;
                    in 1692 the allied ships ruined Tourville’s fleet off La Hogue, and recovered
                    the command of the sea. On land the allies fared ill: Louis took Namur, and
                    after a hard-fought battle William was defeated at Steenkirk; in 1693 the Dutch
                    shared in the defeat of Neerwinden, and were not fortunate even on the sea. In
                    1695 the tide of affairs had turned, and William retook Namur, his greatest
                    triumph after the battle of the Boyne. Negotiations for peace, first attempted
                    in 1694, led to the peace of Ryswick in 1697, in which William was recognized by
                    France as king of England, the Dutch obtaining a favourable commercial treaty,
                    and the right to garrison the Netherland barrier-towns. Holland was still an
                    important factor in the balancing system rendered necessary by the ambition of
                    France. Louis XIV., however, held himself little bound by the peace. In 1701 he
                    elbowed the Dutch troops out of the barriertowns; he defied England by
                    recognizing James III. on the death of his father; and it was clear to all that
                    another war was imminent, when William III. died in 1702. He had been made
                    hereditary stadtholder in five of the Provinces in 1672; but as he left no
                    children as heirs, the old opposition of Holland to his house again sprang up,
                    and, led by the grand pensionary Heinsius, Amsterdam successfully asserted her
                    independence, and ruled throughout the coming struggle against Fra^hce with
                    energy and credit.</p>
                <p>When war was declared in 1702, Marlborough was named commander-in-chief of
                    English and Dutch troops, and thenceforward became the chief man in the famous
                    “triumvirate” of Marlborough, Heinsius, and Prince Eugene. Tn 1703 the Dutch
                    invaded Flanders, and fought the drawn battle of Eckeren; in 1704 they and the
                    English took Gibraltar; in the same year they took part in the great battle of
                    Blenheim. In 1705 Marlborough led them into the Netherlands; but, hampered by
                    the deputies of the States, he achieved little. In 1706 he won the battle of
                    Ramillies, and swept the French out of the Netherlands; in 1708 came Oudenarde,
                    and after it an unsuccessful attempt of Louis XIV. to detach the Dutch from the
                    alliance; in 1709 the terrible battle of Malplaquet and the capture of Mons.
                    After this great changes followed in England, and Marlborough’s power came to an
                    end. Negotiations for peace, often tried before, drew towards success in 1712,
                    and in 1713 the peace of Utrecht was signed. While France received Aire, St
                    Venant, Bethune, and Douay, the Spanish Netherlands were formally handed over to
                    the United Provinces, which in their turn passed them on, after conclusion of a
                    barrier treaty, to Austria; henceforth they are known as the Austrian
                    Netherlands. A favourable commercial treaty was also made between the Dutch and
                    France. The peace of Utrecht made the republic almost as powerful on shore as
                    she had been by sea; at the same time it taught her that the great powers around
                    her would use her resources for war, and abandon her when they wanted peace: she
                    therefore determined henceforth to stand clear of all foreign complications.
                    With 1713 the importance of Holland in European politics comes almost to an
                    end.</p>
                <p>The ruling party in the States took an active part in securing George I. on the
                    throne of England; and on <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0093-0082"/> the death of Louis XIV. in 1715, the old ill-will
                    between France and the provinces died entirely out, so that they were secure in
                    a position of tranquillity; they also brought to a fair conclusion their
                    difficulties with Austria on the subject of the Netherlands barrier. These,
                    however, began again when in 1723 the emperor set on foot the Ostend East India
                    Company, which was at once regarded as an offensive rival by the Amsterdam
                    merchants. For the sake of crushing this competition the States in 1731
                    consented to guarantee the Pragmatic Sanction of Charles VI. In 1743 they joined
                    England in supporting the claims of Maria Theresa, queen of Hungary, and fell
                    consequently into complications with France, which invaded the barrier country.
                    In 1744 they granted a subsidy in money and put 20,000 men in the field, and
                    became a member of the Quadruple Alliance with Austria, England, and Saxony. In
                    1745 the Provinces took their part in the rout of Fontenoy, after which Marshal
                    Saxe overran the Austrian Netherlands, while England and Holland were alike
                    paralysed by the Jacobite rising in Scotland. The States lost every
                    barrier-town, and lay defenceless before the French, who in 1747 entered Dutch
                    Flanders, and made an easy conquest. And now the Orange party, supported by
                    English aid, began to lift its head. The Provinces had fallen so low that all
                    men began to wish for a dictator. Accordingly Prince William Charles Henry Friso
                    was proclaimed stadtholder, captain, and admiral-general of Zealand at Terveer,
                    under the title of William IV. The movement thus begun spread like wildfire; all
                    Zealand accepted him with enthusiasm, and Holland was not far behind; even at
                    Amsterdam and the Hague the popular feeling was too strong to be resisted, and
                    the Government had to give way. William IV. became captain and admiral-general
                    of the whole union, and stadtholder of the Seven Provinces; a little later these
                    offices were declared hereditary in both male and female lines.</p>
                <p>The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, though it nominally restored things to
                    their old estate, could not efface the mischief and humiliation which the war
                    had caused to Holland. Nor ,were affairs mended by the death of the stadtholder
                    William IV. in 1751, who, though dull and quiet, did his best to develop the
                    commercial and manufacturing prosperity of the States. His widow, Anne of
                    England, daughter of George II., carried on the government for her son William
                    V. She showed but little aptitude for the post of regent, and the Provinces had
                    great difficulty in standing clear of the European complications of the Seven
                    Years’ War. They did so, however, and after her death in 1759 were on better
                    terms with England, which had urged them to take up the cause of Frederick the
                    Great. In 1766 William V. was declared to be of age; irresolute and weak, he was
                    entirely under the command of his old preceptor Louis of Brunswick, and his wife
                    Frederica Wilhelmina, niece of Frederick the Great. His rule is only
                    distinguished for the springing up of several learned societies, and for the
                    stimulus, derived partly from England partly from France, given to scientific
                    inquiries. In other respects the influences of England and France were not
                    propitious to the Provinces. In the American War of Independence William
                    sympathized with the English court against the French and the revolted colonies,
                    while the Dutch people warmly embraced the other side. Hence arose again old
                    maritime disputes. The Provinces quarrelled at home over the relative importance
                    of army and navy, and strengthened neither. So things went on from 1776 to 1780,
                    when the famous “Armed Neutrality,” with which the Continental states replied to
                    the demands of England on the seas, drew the Provinces once more into the arena
                    of European politics. After a division of the States, in which four were on one
                    side and three on the other, the United Provinces decided to adopt the
                    Neutrality, and threw in their lot with France and Russia against England. But
                    though war broke out at once, nothing could cure the violence of party
                    spirit—the stadtholder and the court party going with the English, and
                    neutralizing all the warlike efforts of the “patriot” party. In 1781 Dutch
                    commerce was utterly paralysed; the other powers set on the Provinces, and took
                    each its part. Their West India Islands were seized, and it seemed as if they
                    could do nothing in their own defence. At last, however, an indecisive but not
                    inglorious action with Admiral Parker at the Dogger Bank roused the national
                    spirit, and the Orange party lost ground everywhere. In 1782 the Provinces
                    recognized the independence of the United States of America; with generous
                    sympathy the aged commonwealth saluted the rising republic of the West, which
                    was destined to take its share also in the ruin of Dutch trade. In 1783 the
                    States made an inglorious peace with England, in which the English got right of
                    "free traffic with the Dutch East India colonies.</p>
                <p>The patriot party was so much excited by this long series of blunders and
                    humiliations that the fall of the house of Orange seemed imminent, and the king
                    of Prussia had to interfere on behalf of his kinsfolk. In 1784 the States were
                    in trouble with a new antagonist; the emperor Joseph II. sought to compel them
                    to acquiesce in the reopening of the mouths of the Scheldt, so as to restore
                    some of its ancient prosperity to Antwerp. But as neither party was able to
                    fight, a peace was patched up iu 1785, though its terms, as usual, were very
                    humiliating to the States. The resistance against the princess of Orange
                    continued to increase in violence, until in 1787 the Prussians again interfered,
                    occupying Amsterdam, reinstating the stadtholder, who had been driven out, and
                    com pelling the states to ally themselves, much against their will, with England
                    and Prussia.</p>
                <p>Under their sway the Dutch passivelyremained, and when the French Revolution came
                    they stood neutral as long as they could between it and the kings; it was not
                    till Dumouriez had overrun all the Austrian Netherlands in 1792, and had
                    determined to secure justice to Antwerp by forcing open the passage of the
                    Scheldt, that they were drawn into the strife. On the death of Louis XVI. in
                    1793 the national convention at once declared war against both England and the
                    Provinces. Their first campaign against the Dutch under Dumouriez failed: the
                    invaders were arrested before Willemstadt, and ultimately were compelled to
                    retreat. But in the autumn of 1793 Jourdan restored Hie credit of the French
                    arms in the Austrian Netherlands. In 1794 Pichegru brilliantly completed the
                    conquest of Belgium, and before the end of the year invaded the Provinces. The
                    very severe frost of that winter gave his army easy passage over all the rivers
                    and low-lying lands, which still formed the chief defence of the states; he
                    occupied Amsterdam, and with his hussars crossed the ice and took the Dutch
                    fleet as it lay at the Texel; the stadtholder fled (1795) to England; and the
                    shattered remains of the duke of York’s army having reached Bremen returned home
                    in disgrace. The republican party in the Provinces now reorganized the
                    government so as to bring it into close harmony with that of Paris. A new
                    constitution was framed; the ancient system of representative government, the
                    stadtholderate, and the offices of captain and admiral-general were all swept
                    away; a fair and open representation was established; and the Batavian republic
                    came into being in close alliance with France. The French with one hand
                    delivered the Provinces from a worn-out system of government, and with the other
                    seized on a substantial return for their assistance. The new constitution, so
                    excellent <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n94/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0094-0083"/> in appearance, soon proved a delusion. One change
                    of government succeeded another: after the States General came a national
                    convention; then in 1798 a constituent assembly with an executive directory;
                    then chambers of representatives; then a return to the earlier system under the
                    names of the eight provincial and one central commissions (1801).</p>
                <p>The peace of Amiens gave the country a little rest, and the Dutch got back the
                    Cape of Good Hope and their South American colonies: it was, however, but the
                    brief and deceptive lull between two storms; when war began again England once
                    more swept away all she had restored. In 1805 Bonaparte, with his usual high
                    hand, imposed on them a new constitution, and set Schimmelpenninck over them
                    with the ancient title of grand pensionary. In the next year . Napoleon added
                    Holland to the ring of great fiefs with which he surrounded his imperial system,
                    and forced an unwilling brother, Louis, to be king of an unwilling people.
                    Worthy of a better fate, the excellent king of Holland did all in his power to
                    protect his new subjects from the crushing friendship of his brother; but his
                    efforts were in vain, and he withdrew to Vienna. In 1810 Napoleon annexed all
                    Holland to the empire, declaring that it was “in the nature of things nothing
                    but a portion of France.” In 1813 the change in the affairs of Europe encouraged
                    the Dutch to join the general revolt, when they established a limited monarchy.
                    The prince of Orange was recalled from England, and entered Amsterdam amidst the
                    utmost enthusiasm. An assembly of notables met and declared him king with the
                    title of William I., king of the Netherlands, in 1814. By the treaty of Paris
                    Belgium was united to Holland, and the seventeen provinces were again forcibly
                    joined together under one prince. It was settled that the house of Orange should
                    have the hereditary sovereignty, with a fairly liberal constitution. To make up
                    to the new king for the loss of his territories in Germany, the grand duchy of
                    Luxembourg, with the exception of the town and fortress of Luxembourg, was
                    handed over to him as his private possession, not as a part of the kingdom; the
                    bishopric of Liége and the duchy of Bouillon also went with it. The episode of
                    the “Hundred Days,” though it delayed the conclusion of the very complicated
                    arrangements involved in these transfers, gave the new kingdom an opportunity of
                    distinguishing itself: it was the first point of attack, and met the crisis with
                    vigour. The Dutch troops under William, eldest son of the new king, took
                    considerable part in the short and striking campaign which was closed on June
                    18, 1815, by the final victory of Waterloo.</p>
                <p>The allied powers now founded in Holland and Belgium what they hoped would be a
                    solid and permanent kingdom as a barrier against France. It was felt that
                    Napoleon had shown Europe the importance of this district in connexion with his
                    scheme for European domination. The new kingdom under the house of Orange was
                    therefore the subject of great and anxious consideration at Vienna. The king, an
                    hereditary sovereign, received full executive powers, and the initiative in
                    proposing laws. He had also the power of appointing his own council of state. As
                    a legislative body there were the States-General, divided into two chambers;
                    each province had also its own local states. Freedom of worship and political
                    equality were secured for all.</p>
                <p>A highly artificial arrangement like this, however, could not stand long, if
                    Europe came to throw off the trammels of the monarchical reaction, and to give
                    freer course to those liberal tendencies which had survived the drama of the .
                    French Revolution. In religious belief, in laws and usages, in language, in
                    interests, the Belgic and Batavian provinces had little in common. Their
                    inhabitants were different races, with instincts and feelings not merely diverse
                    but opposed. The Belgic provinces spoke French or Walloon, the Batavians, Dutch.
                    The Belgians were strict Catholics, while the Dutch were Protestants. The Dutch
                    were chiefly a commercial and seafaring people, with interests in distant lauds
                    and colonial possessions; the Belgians were agriculturists, except where their
                    abundance of minerals made them manufacturers. The Dutch connected themselves
                    with Germany and (though often only by way of rivalry) with England; the
                    Belgians drew their chief inspirations from France, and connected themselves
                    with the French in traditions, religion, and commercial interests. Such a
                    diversity could not possibly stand the brunt of any great politicalmovement;
                    especially as the Dutch were oppressive towards their Belgian partners in the
                    kingdom. Accordingly we find that in 1830 the revolution at Faris at once
                    aroused the strongest sympathy at Brussels. The dull obstinacy of William I. had
                    emphasized the divergence, and his narrow and antiquated policy rendered an
                    outburst inevitable.</p>
                <p>The revolt at Brussels, which began on the 25th August 1830, spread instantly
                    throughout the whole of Belgium. After a short struggle in November, a
                    conference of France, England, Prussia, Austria, and Russia, sitting in London
                    at the request of William I., proposed an armistice, to which both parties
                    agreed. In the following January the conference attempted to settle the terms of
                    a separation, and proposed that Holland should have Luxembourg and part of the
                    left bank of the Scheldt; this the Dutch accepted, while the provisional
                    Government at Brussels protested against it. The assembly at Brussels
                    constructed a new and liberal constitution, with a broad representative
                    government, liberty of teaching, of the press, of public meeting; and in April
                    1831 the crown was offered to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, who, after ascertaining
                    that he would be recognized by England and France, did not hesitate to accept it
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Belgium).</hi> This -appointment caused the utmost
                    irritation at the Hague, and the Dutch suddenly invaded Belgium; the opportune
                    appearance of a French army checked the Dutch advance, and gave diplomacy time
                    to interfere. The citadel of Antwerp, however, was still in Dutch hands, and the
                    allied powers used in vain all their influence to persuade William I. to give it
                    up to the Belgians. War was hereon declared, and France and England blockaded
                    the Dutch ports, while a French army attacked the citadel, and, after a sharp
                    struggle, compelled it to capitulate: The forts of Lillo and Liefkenshoek were
                    left in the hands of the Dutch; on May 21, 1833, there was signed at London by
                    the plenipotentiaries of Holland on one side, and those of England and France on
                    the other, a convention in which William I. engaged not to recommence
                    hostilities against Belgium, and to leave the Scheldt navigation open, till the
                    relation between the two countries should be definitely settled by treaty. The
                    final settlement of outstanding questions, however, was not reached till six
                    years later, when Limburg and the eastern part of Luxembourg were secured to
                    Holland, and heavy tolls were imposed on the navigation of the Scheldt; then the
                    two kingdoms finally parted company on the 19th of April 1839.</p>
                <p>In the following year William I. resigned his crown to his son William II., who
                    reigned in peace till his death in 1849, when he was succeeded by his eldest son
                    William HL, who' still reigns. The wave of revolution which passed over Europe
                    in 1848 had in Holland comparatively little effect: the constitution of 1814 was
                    revised, and the tranquillity of the country secured. Iιi 1853, after the
                    establishment by the papacy of Catholic bishoprics in England and Holland, a
                    considerable excitement arose, which resulted in the accession to power of <pb

                    cabinet, and in the main the Protestant-liberal party has guided the country for
                    the last quarter of a century. The Dutch took but a secondary part in the
                    disputes between France and Germany as to Dutch Luxembourg, which by the treaty
                    of London (1867) was declared neutral, and guaranteed to Holland. Recently they
                    have been engaged in a very vexatious and wasteful war with the sultan of
                    Acheen, their neighbour on the island of Sumatra.</p>

                <p>PART III.—LANGUAGE.</p>
                <p>. Of the Low German tribes the Old Saxons, the Anglo-Saxons, the Franks, and the
                    Frisians played a specially important part both in north-western Europe in
                    general and in the Low Countries in particular; and accordingly it is with these
                    tribes that we have in the first place to do when investigating the origin and
                    development of the Dutch language. A great many dialects formerly existed side
                    by side on Dutch ground, and many of them still live on the lips of the people;
                    but they all belonged to one or other of three well-defined groups—Frisian,
                    Saxon, and Frankish.</p>
                <p>In the earliest times about which records have come down to us, the Frisian
                    dialect, in various shades of difference indeed, occupied a very extensive area.
                    It was the language universally spoken in the provinces of Groningen, Friesland,
                    and North Holland. But in Groningen the Frisian has been superseded by the
                    Saxon, and in North Holland by the Low Frankish dialect; and the three leading
                    dialects of the Dutch are now distributed in Holland nearly as follows:—(1)
                    Saxon in Groningen, Drenthe, Overysse], and the county of Zutphen; (2) Frisian
                    (more or less corrupt in the towns) in Friesland; and (3) Low Frankish in
                    Guelderland (excepting the county of Zutphen), Utrecht, North and South Holland,
                    Zealand, North Brabant, and Limburg.</p>
                <p>In Groningen and North Holland the Frisian dialect has left more or less marked
                    traces of its former predominance in the pronunciation, vocabulary, and
                    phraseology of the present spoken language. During a considerable period laws,
                    ordinances, contracts, and similar documents were drawn up in the various
                    provinces in the peculiar dialect of each, and many of these documents,
                    especially in Frisian, have come down to our time. The inhabitants of the
                    northern provinces, however, had neither superiority of culture nor political
                    preponderance enough to secure the assimilation of the adjoining populations.
                    The occupants of the tract in which Low Frankish was spoken were much more
                    favourably situated; and that dialect has in the end ousted the two others, and
                    become the speech, both oral and written, of cultured Dutchmen.</p>
                <p>From the documents collected by Müllenhoff and Scherer, and from many others, it
                    is evident that between the 8th and the 12th century the different German
                    dialects served as vehicles of literary composition, and this, it appears, must
                    also have been the case in the Netherlands. It may therefore be safely taken for
                    granted that, among the <hi rend="italic">libri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Teuihonice</hi><hi rend="italic">scripti</hi> referred to in the act given in
                    the year 1202 by the papal legate Guido for the organization of the bishopric of
                    Liége, there were some written in the vernacular, ⅜.e., in Low Frankish, which
                    after the subjugation of the Frisians and Saxons by the Franks was the idiom of
                    the victors. Whatever pains Charlemagne took to raise the dignity of the German
                    language, the practice, prevailing at the time and long afterwards, of using
                    Latin in official documents emanating from the authorities, prevented the
                    predominant form of speech from encroaching to any considerable extent on the
                    other dialects. Still it is in this period that we must seek the first
                    indications of the future victory of the Frankish dialect over the two others.
                    And in course of time the Franks strengthened their political pre-eminence by a
                    superiority of a different character, which, added to the first, went far to
                    secure to the Frankish dialect the prerogative of being the universal vehicle of
                    cultured thought, written and spoken, throughout the Netherlands. The barbarous
                    victors could not resist the humanizing influence of the higher culture
                    resulting from a lengthened intercourse with the Romans. And when, after a
                    considerable lapse of time, the new idiom, thus born from Latin, began to be
                    employed in the composition of literary productions, the influence of these
                    writings soon made itself sensibly felt in the southern Netherlands. The
                    inhabitants of ancient Belgium had always continued in close intercourse with
                    their brethren in France; and the literary productions put forth in France,
                    especially after the crusades, soon began to engage the attention of the opulent
                    citizens of the thriving towns of Flanders and other parts of the southern
                    Netherlands, and were diligently translated by them into their own tongue.
                    Holland, Zealand, and Utrecht in their turn were connected with the southern
                    Netherlands by many close ties. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n96/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0096-0085"/> language spoken in the southern and-in the
                    northern Netherlands was the same for all practical purposes; and so it happened
                    that the French literary works and their Flemish reproductions attracted no
                    small share of attention also in the northern Netherlands. The “Dietsch”
                    dialect, in which the oldest and most popular works, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reynard the Fox</hi> and the works of Jacob van Maerlant, dating from the close
                    of the 13th century, were composed, became the model speech for every one who
                    wanted to address a larger public than that of his immediate vicinity. It was in
                    this. Dietsch dialect that Melis Stoke, an inmate of the monastery of Egmond,
                    composed his <hi rend="italic">Rhymed Chronicle (c.</hi> 1305).</p>
                <p>From Holland and Utrecht the Dietsch dialect readily found its way farther north.
                    What the Franks had tried to achieve in times long past was now undertaken by
                    the counts of Holland and the bishops of Utrecht, viz., the total subjection of
                    the northern provinces to their rule. These efforts on the part of the princes
                    just named again made Frankish the dialect of the dominant, Frisian and Saxon
                    the idiom of the conquered race. In this way Dietsch, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> Low Frankish, became the predominant dialect all over the
                    Netherlands.</p>
                <p>At a time when laws, mutual contracts, and other official documents issued in
                    Friesland between the Vlie and the Lauwers are still drawn up in pure Old
                    Frisian, the treaty by which the citizens of Stavoren recognize Count Floris for
                    their sovereign lord in 1292 is written in Dutch. The contracts drawn up by
                    Frisians on both sides are nearly always in Frisian, even down to the close of
                    the 15th century, though occasionally Dutch was used. In deeds of sale,
                    contracts, Ac., drawn up between 1490 and 1500, we meet with all possible shades
                    and varieties of the Dutch dialect, which is seen to be rapidly gaining ground.
                    Still, this substitution of Dutch for Frisian in documents of this nature by no
                    means proves that Frisian was falling into desuetude among the country
                    population. A good deal of course depended on the persons who were employed to
                    compose the documents above referred to. The historian of Friesland, Gabbema,
                    writing about 1650, bitterly laments the decay of the Frisian tongue; and even
                    foreign writers, such as Conrad Gesner, refer to the fact in a similar way. But
                    in spite of his lamentations Gabbema submits to the pressure of the times and
                    writes his history not in Frisian but in Dutch. Nay, his friend Gysbert Japix,
                    the cultivator <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of Frisian, the national
                    poet of Friesland, wrote the introduction to his <hi rend="italic">Friesche
                    Rijmelerije</hi> (“Frisian Rhymes ”), and many a manly poem besides, in the same
                    language. They were by no means averse to seeing cultured non-Frisians take
                    cognizance of their literary labours; and to satisfy this ambition, there was no
                    other course open than to employ the language which such eminent men as Marnix,
                    Coornhert, Roemer, Visser, Spiegel, Hooft, Huygens, and Vondel had permanently
                    made the approved vehicle of thought and poetical utterance throughout the
                    Netherlands, more especially after the fall of Antwerp, in 1585, had induced the
                    most highly cultured minds of the southern Netherlands to migrate to Holland.
                    This had been achieved partly by direct endeavours tending to the improvement of
                    the language and the excision of all “foreign dross,” partly by the creation of
                    beautiful works of literary art, and solid contributions to history and
                    erudition. For the language and intellectual culture of Holland had now each
                    attained a stage of advancement where neither imperiously demanded new
                    capabilities in the other. What thus happened in Friesland also took place
                    elsewhere, the same or nearly the same causes bringing about the same results
                    throughout the country.</p>
                <p>The language of the Dutch has travelled to their transmarine possessions, without
                    engendering a new dialect either in the East or West Indies. But a very
                    different result might be expected if at any time their East Indian possessions
                    should enter upon an independent career. A kind of mongrel dialect would arise,
                    which may be seen foreshadowed in official papers and letters composed by
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">sinjos,</hi> or “half-breeds,” in the island of
                    Java. We may even now point to one such dialect, the speech of the Dutch
                    settlers in the Transvaal and the Orange Territory in South Africa, who have
                    actually begun to raise their clipped Dutch to the dignity of a written
                    language, in which they are now composing works of general literature, and even
                    poems, diligently editing class-books and theological treatises, and printing
                    such newspapers as <hi rend="italic">Den opregten</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Afrikaander.</hi></p>
                <p>Flemish or South Dutch, 7.e., Belgian Dutch, though very nearly allied to North
                    Dutch or the Dutch of Holland, essentially differs from the latter in many
                    important points of detail. In its vocabulary, its phraseology, and the
                    structure of its sentences, it clearly betrays the influence of the
                    French-speaking part of the nation. In a novel by a very popular Flemish author,
                    A. C. van der Cruyssen, printed in bold type in small octavo, and numbering less
                    than 200 pages, the present writer noted far more than 200 cases in which a
                    North-Dutchman would have chosen quite another turn of expression. The South
                    Dutch dialect, which after the fall of Antwerp had remained almost stationary,
                    but which in our days has become a cultured written language through the
                    diligent efforts of various writers of great talent, bears the evident marks of
                    this recent emergence from a state of utter neglect on the part of cultured men,
                    and to a North-Dutchman has an air of simple-minded artlessness and innocent
                    naïveté.</p>
                <p>The complexity of origin of the Dutch language is most noticeable in the case of
                    the vowels. In the consonants the Saxon and the Frankish did not differ greatly,
                    and the Frisian has had a much smaller, influence. To the Saxon must be ascribed
                    the dropping of the nasal before s, ∕, <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> as well as
                    before δ and <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">vyf</hi> (five), <hi
                    rend="italic">sedert</hi> (sinthe, since), <hi rend="italic">rnuiden</hi>
                    (mouth), in proper names, &amp;c. At the same time there are several words in
                    which the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is preserved,—most of these being borrowed
                    from the Frankish, as <hi rend="italic">ander, künde,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Yselmonde</hi> in Holland (alongside of <hi rend="italic">Yselmuiden</hi> in
                    Overyssel), and <hi rend="italic">gans</hi> (for which we have <hi rend="italic"
                    >goeze</hi> in the Overyssel dialect). The s in the nom. plur. of the vowel
                    stems is only partially retained: side by side there exist in Middle Dutch
                    plural forms like <hi rend="italic">honde, dorpers, kinder, kinde, kyne,</hi>
                    which have almost all in later Dutch assumed either <hi rend="italic">s</hi>
                    simply, <hi rend="italic">s</hi> after the plural form <hi rend="italic">r,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">en</hi> (originally the plural form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >η</hi> stems), the s and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> being erroneously regarded as
                    a sign of the plural (see <hi rend="italic">infra).</hi> On the whole the
                    Frankish influence has been the most potent,—that of the other two tongues being
                    only observable here and there in the terminations, or in a comparatively
                    limited number of words and expressions. The history of the development of the
                    language may be divided into two great periods. In the first, the Middle Dutch,
                    the fuller forms and long vowels of inflexional and derivational suffixes and
                    the final elements of compound words, which are preserved in Gothic and High
                    German, have already become short and unaccented, while at the same time,
                    through the loss of the accent, the final elements have partly lost their
                    significance, and occasionally a notable abbreviation has been effected both in
                    their pronunciation and their orthography. From the Middle Dutch the modern
                    language is distinguished by a greater neglect and confusion of inflexional
                    forms, by the presence of a large number of foreign words introduced about the
                    end of the 15th century, as well as of a multitude of dialect and modern terms,
                    and by the disuse or modified significations of many of the older words.</p>

                <p>Of the Middle Dutch we have no remains earlier than the beginning of the 13th
                    century, though Saxon aud Frankish linguistic monuments go back to the 8t⅛ or
                    9th.</p>
                <p>Middle Dutch extends from the 12th century to 1450; then follows a transition
                    period, reaching to 1550, from which date Modern Dutch has prevailed to the
                    present time. In the period last named a subdivision may be made at 1865, the
                    date of the introduction of the new spelling.<note anchored="true"

                    Taalen Letterbode, part iii. p. 275.</p></note></p>
                <p>In Modern Dutch there is a considerable difference between the latest and the
                    earliest forms. The older language still preserves many words that have now
                    become obsolete, and the style is modelled more closely on that of the classical
                    writers. Towards the end of the 18th century the influence of Van Effen, Stijl,
                    Bilderdijk, and others effected great changes; and while the deflexion largely
                    increased, the Hollandsch dialect began to make itself predominant, especially
                    in regard to the vowels <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">ij</hi> (i). Indeed the main difference between Middle and
                    Modern Dutch is due to the fact that the former is under the influence of
                    Dietsch (the Flemish-Zealand dialect), while in the latter Hollandsch has the
                    supremacy.</p>
                <p>In the transition period the language was adulterated by a great number of
                    bastard words and bastard forms derived from French, which obtained currency
                    throughout Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, and the southern provinces, from the
                    influence of the court and government of the dukes of Burgundy.</p>
                <p>The study of the dialects and grammar of Middle Dutch has not been prosecuted far
                    enough to allow of very detailed statements regarding them. Our principal
                    authorities for the interpretation of the literary remains are the works of De
                    Vries, Verwijs, Verdam, Moltzer, and others. Most of these remains are in
                    Dietsch, as the romances of chivalry, the works of Maerlant, the chronicles and
                    songs; others, as the <hi rend="italic">St Servaas</hi> of Van Veldeke, are in
                    the language of the south-east (Limburgsch). Of the mediaeval language, as it
                    was spoken in Utrecht or in the Saxon provinces<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Sloet, oorkondenboek van Gelre en
                    Zutphen: Taalkundige Bijdragen, i.</p></note> ® (the countship of Zutphen,
                    Overyssel, and Drenthe), the only remains are in charters and similar documents.
                    Since the Saxon, as is indicated by the conjugation of the verb, has exercised
                    no dominant influence, and the Hollandsch on the other hand is closely connected
                    with the Dietsch, we will only quote as an example of the language a single
                    strophe from Maerlant’s <hi rend="italic">l·Vapene Martyn,</hi> with a metrical
                    translation (hitherto unpublished) from the pen of Nicolas Beets (1880).</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">The Consonants. —</hi> As regards the consonants, Dutch in the
                    main does not differ from the other Low German languages. The explosive <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">th</hi> are wanting. Instead of
                    the former there is a <hi rend="italic">g</hi> with “fricative” pronunciation,
                    and as in High German the iΛhas passed over into <hi rend="italic">d.</hi></p>
                <p>Nearly all the final consonants in Middle Dutch are sharpened, and the sharp
                    sounds are graphically represented; in Modern Dutch, on the other hand, the
                    historical development of the language being more distinctly kept in view, and
                    the agreement observed with the inflexional forms, the soft consonant is written
                    more frequently than it is sounded; thus we have Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic"
                    >doch,</hi> Modern Dutch <hi rend="italic">dag,</hi> in analogy with the plural
                    <hi rend="italic">dagen.</hi></p>
                <p>The gutturals arc <hi rend="italic">g, k, ch,</hi> and Λ. The aspirate sound of
                    the <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is of very early date; even in the Old Dutch psalms
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi> interchanges with <hi rend="italic">h (weh</hi> side by
                    side with <hi rend="italic">weg,</hi> just as in Gothic <hi rend="italic"
                    >faheds</hi> and <hi rend="italic">faginon,</hi> Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic"
                    >borh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">borges,</hi> Old Saxon <hi rend="italic"
                    >manah</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manag).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi>
                    which in Middle Dutch frequently appears before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">i,</hi> served to distinguish the fricative <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> from the French <hi rend="italic">g</hi>; in later Middle Dutch we find
                    this object lost sight of, and the <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> also written before
                    <hi rend="italic">a, o,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> In Maerlant <hi
                    rend="italic">ghans</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ghene</hi> both occur. In the
                    15th century the <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> was also employed instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">ch,</hi> when people began to observe the etymological agreement
                    of <hi rend="italic">ik</hi><hi rend="italic">lach</hi> and <hi rend="italic">si
                    laghen,</hi> and in this way arose the spelling <hi rend="italic">ik lagh.</hi>
                    This indicated no change in pronunciation. That in Middle Dutch, however, an
                    explosive pronunciation existed (in some words, more especially after <hi
                    rend="italic">n),</hi> as well as the aspirated pronunciation, is evident from
                    words like <hi rend="italic">dine, ginc</hi>; this sound did not hold its ground
                    but passed into the nasalized guttural now written <hi rend="italic"
                    >ding,</hi><hi rend="italic">ging.</hi> The explosive force, however, was
                    preserved where the diminutive suffixae followed immediately after <hi
                    rend="italic">ng,</hi> as well as before <hi rend="italic">lijk</hi> and some
                    other affixes, and it is now expressed by <hi rend="italic">k (koninkje,
                    jonkman}.</hi> In combination with <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> g became <hi
                    rend="italic">k(speeksel, fluks</hi> from <hi rend="italic">vlug).</hi> So also
                    in intensive verbs like <hi rend="italic">bukken, knikkc·n,</hi> where the <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> arose from an explosive <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before <hi
                    rend="italic">j</hi> of the suffix, and was doubled after the short vowels. In
                    non-intensives, as <hi rend="italic">liggen, zeggen,</hi> where the <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> was aspirated, that letter was doubled in the same way from
                    <hi rend="italic">gj.</hi> The Dutch <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is besides
                    sometimes derived from the common German <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(gans, dag)</hi>; sometimes it is the . Old German <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> at the end of a word, between vowels, or after liquids <hi
                    rend="italic">(hoog, zuig).</hi> Sometimes it is a survival of the compound <hi
                    rend="italic">gw,</hi> and exists along with a form in <hi rend="italic">w,</hi>
                    as <hi rend="italic">spugen, spuweιι.</hi><hi rend="italic">G</hi> arose out of
                    <hi rend="italic">j</hi> in <hi rend="italic">kruisigen</hi> and other verbs in
                    <hi rend="italic">-igen,</hi> just as in Anglo-Saxon. In the beginning of some
                    words in Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">g</hi> passed into/, as <hi
                    rend="italic">jonst</hi> for <hi rend="italic">gonst,</hi> while Modern Dutch
                    again has <hi rend="italic">gunst.</hi> The passage of <hi rend="italic">g</hi>
                    into <hi rend="italic">j,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> after <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> or <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and before a vowel, is found
                    both in Middle Dutch and Modern Dutch: <hi rend="italic">segel</hi> becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">zeil</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gezegd gezeid.</hi> In some words the explosive <hi rend="italic">g</hi> has
                    passed into <hi rend="italic">k∙,</hi> in others, and indeed the majority, the
                    <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> both in the body of the word and as an initial and a
                    final letter, is the common Low German <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> After short
                    vowels the <hi rend="italic">k</hi> of the compound <hi rend="italic">kj</hi>
                    was doubled, and the <hi rend="italic">j</hi> dropped off after producing
                    “umlaut” <hi rend="italic">(dekken, wekken).</hi> An original <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> remained as an initial letter before <hi rend="italic">n</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> in <hi rend="italic">kring, knijpen,</hi> &amp;c.,
                    alongside of which we have <hi rend="italic">ring, nijρen,</hi> &amp;c., in
                    which the <hi rend="italic">k</hi> passed into <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and then
                    disappeared. The <hi rend="italic">k</hi> also remains undisplaced in the
                    diminutive <hi rend="italic">ken (Taal-</hi><hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Letterbode,</hi> ii. 105). Before <hi rend="italic">t, k</hi>
                    became <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> in <hi rend="italic">zücht</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(ziek),</hi><hi rend="italic">wacht</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(waken).</hi></p>
                <p>In Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">k</hi> are
                    interchanged without distinction of sound. <hi rend="italic">C</hi> is used
                    before vowels except <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> and
                    before <hi rend="italic">l, n,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and at the end
                    of a word <hi rend="italic">(cop, cleem, crane).</hi> After <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> sometimes <hi rend="italic">ck</hi> is also employed <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ganc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ganck).</hi> In later Middle Dutch the <hi
                    rend="italic">ck</hi> is more frequent; in other cases <hi rend="italic">k</hi>
                    is common <hi rend="italic">(kint, kerke).</hi> Frequently we find <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">c,—</hi> never, however, <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,</hi> except in French words, where <hi rend="italic">c</hi> had the sound of
                    s <hi rend="italic">(dtroen).</hi> Sometimes <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> (as in
                    <hi rend="italic">cheins, chessen)</hi> occurs as well as <hi rend="italic">c
                    (ceins,</hi><hi rend="italic">cessen),</hi> where <hi rend="italic">ch</hi>
                    represents the palatal sound of the s, which in the more modern language is
                    rather represented by <hi rend="italic">sj (korsjet</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >corset, sjokken</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sokken,</hi> &amp;c.). The doubling
                    of the <hi rend="italic">k</hi> was indicated by <hi rend="italic">ck</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(decken),</hi> while <hi rend="italic">qu</hi> was the ordinary
                    for <hi rend="italic">kw (bequame, quedelen, queue),</hi> in Modern Dutch <hi
                    rend="italic">dekken, bekwaam.</hi></p>
                <p>In the beginning of words <hi rend="italic">h</hi> has lost its original aspirate
                    sound and become a mere breathing, and consequently it has often dropped off
                    both before other consonants and between vowels: thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >hring</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">ring</hi> (as early as in the Old Frankish
                    psalms), <hi rend="italic">slahan</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">slaan,
                    vliehen</hi> in Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">vlien.</hi> In some of these
                    words a <hi rend="italic">d</hi> has been afterwards inserted out of a supposed
                    analogy with weak verbs, as <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> with <hi rend="italic"
                    >belien, beltde</hi>; where Modern Dutch has <hi rend="italic">vlieden,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">geschieden,</hi> Middle Dutch had <hi rend="italic">vlien,
                    gescien</hi>; even in Middle Dutch, indeed, <hi rend="italic">geschiede</hi>
                    (Modern Dutch <hi rend="italic">geschiedde)</hi> was an alternative form with
                    <hi rend="italic">geschach.</hi> In the dialects <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is
                    frequently prefixed improperly <hi rend="italic">(harm</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">arm,</hi> &amp;c. ). At the end of words the <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> occasionally kept its fricative sound <hi rend="italic">(hooch,
                    geschach, tooch),</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> shows. In the verbs <hi
                    rend="italic">tiegen (tiuhan)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tijgen (tihan),</hi>
                    which sounded <hi rend="italic">tien</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tijen</hi> in
                    Middle Dutch, the <hi rend="italic">g</hi> has been afterwards introduced into
                    the present stem, probably through the similarity of the sound of the <hi
                    rend="italic">h (ch)</hi> in <hi rend="italic">tooch</hi> with the <hi
                    rend="italic">ch</hi> sound which <hi rend="italic">g</hi> acquires as a final
                    consonant, and through the <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    plural preterite <hi rend="italic">togen. Ch</hi> did not remain in the
                    preterite of all verbs in Middle Dutch: <hi rend="italic">vlien</hi> has <hi
                    rend="italic">vloe</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">υlooch^,</hi> alongside of
                    this, however, there is an infinitive <hi rend="italic">vlieghen,</hi> also with
                    a preterite <hi rend="italic">vlooch.</hi> From the compound <hi rend="italic"
                    >hw</hi> the <hi rend="italic">h</hi> soon dropped off in the Middle Dutch <hi
                    rend="italic">(walvisch,</hi><hi rend="italic">wie,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >waar),</hi> not, however, where the <hi rend="italic">w</hi> was vocalized
                    (compare <hi rend="italic">hui</hi> with <hi rend="italic">ιvei, hoe</hi> with
                    <hi rend="italic">woe</hi> in the Saxon; in this last case <hi rend="italic"
                    >woe</hi> passes further into <hi rend="italic">boe).</hi> Before <hi
                    rend="italic">t, h</hi> retains its aspirate sound, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >vlucht (ch</hi> pronounced as the German <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> without <hi
                    rend="italic">i);</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> also before <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> takes the sharp sound of <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi>
                    although this is not represented by the spelling in substantives in <hi
                    rend="italic">∙te,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">gebergte,</hi> adjectives in <hi
                    rend="italic">-lijk,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">genoeglijk,</hi> and in the
                    conjugation <hi rend="italic">hij ligt.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> in
                    <hi rend="italic">sch</hi> (pronounced as s: <hi rend="italic">vleesch,</hi>
                    pron. <hi rend="italic">vices),</hi> derived from the Middle Dutch <hi
                    rend="italic">sc (sk),</hi> is a mere orthographical convention; as an initial
                    consonant <hi rend="italic">sch</hi> is now pronounced <hi rend="italic">sg
                    (schip),</hi> but in the Saxon dialects and in Frisian the old sound is
                    preserved: <hi rend="italic">skip, skool</hi><hi rend="italic">(schola).</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sculan</hi> has already in Middle Dutch changed the <hi
                    rend="italic">sc</hi> into <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> and in Modern Dutch it
                    appears as <hi rend="italic">z</hi><hi rend="italic">(zullen).</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ch</hi> before <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> except where it stands

                    rend="italic">d</hi> derived from <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> remains, <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> at the end of words always changes in Middle Dutch into <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> or into <hi rend="italic">dt.</hi> Where, however, the <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> had remained before vowels in the conjugations of the verbs
                    or the inflexions of the nouns, the <hi rend="italic">d</hi> was in several
                    words afterwards restored, although the sharp sound was preserved. In other
                    instances the sharp sound of the nominative affected the oblique cases, and all
                    forms acquired the sharp sound which then remained in Modem Dutch <hi
                    rend="italic">{gezant, gezanfen; rit,</hi><hi rend="italic">ritten</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">; verwant, verwanten)</hi>; and the same change took place
                    especially in indeclinable words, as <hi rend="italic">want, met.</hi></p>
                <p>In Middle Dutch a <hi rend="italic">tenuis</hi> or spirant before <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> changes it into <hi rend="italic">t;</hi> but whether it be
                    owing to difference of dialect or to inaccuracies of orthography, many instances
                    may be pointed out where this does not occur; thus we find <hi rend="italic"
                    >nochtan, ontaen</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">onttaen),</hi> but along with these
                    also <hi rend="italic">nochdanne, ontdaen.</hi> In Modern Dutch this is not the
                    case, but a number of forms are due to the same principle, especially in
                    compounds of prepositions with the article <hi rend="italic">{metten,
                    metier),</hi> while in the conjugation of weak verbs also the suffix <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi> turns into <hi rend="italic">te</hi> after sharp
                    consonants <hi rend="italic">(legde,</hi><hi rend="italic">lachte,</hi> Middle
                    Dutch <hi rend="italic">loech).</hi> On account of the sharpening of the <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> final letter, no <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> is ever found before the suffix <hi rend="italic"
                    >-nis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> even occurs before an afterwards
                    inserted«, as in <hi rend="italic">beeltenis</hi> (the same is the case with <hi
                    rend="italic">f, b, v,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">vergiffenis</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">vergifnis).</hi></p>
                <p>After <hi rend="italic">o, oe,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ui</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">j,</hi> though in Middle
                    Dutch instances seldom occur (Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">ruden,</hi> Modern
                    Dutch <hi rend="italic">ruien;</hi> Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">roden,</hi>
                    Modern Dutch <hi rend="italic">uitroeien);</hi> sometimes it drops out <hi
                    rend="italic">{kwede, kwee).</hi> The spoken language goes much farther than the
                    written in this use of <hi rend="italic">j</hi> for <hi rend="italic">d;</hi>
                    thus <hi rend="italic">dooje, goeje</hi> are written <hi rend="italic">doode,
                    goede.</hi> In like manner the spoken language has changed <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> into <hi rend="italic">w</hi> after <hi rend="italic">au</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ou</hi> derived from <hi rend="italic">al</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ol</hi>; thus we find the pronunciation <hi rend="italic">ouwe,
                    gouwen, kouw,</hi> with the spelling <hi rend="italic">oude, gouden, koude.</hi>
                    In the adjectives <hi rend="italic">ouwelijk</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >kouwelijk</hi> the <hi rend="italic">w</hi> has become established. Except
                    after vowels in verbs where <hi rend="italic">h</hi> has dropped out, whenever
                    there is no preceding consonant, and an <hi rend="italic">r</hi> follows either
                    immediately or after an <hi rend="italic">e,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> is
                    inserted after <hi rend="italic">l, n, r (kelder, zwaarder, holder, diender,
                    donder),</hi> an insertion which is less common in Middle Dutch <hi
                    rend="italic">{helre, solve, donre∙,</hi> also, however, <hi rend="italic"
                    >dondre).</hi> At the end also of words we often have a paragogic <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> after <hi rend="italic">n</hi> where the Middle Dutch kept
                    the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> as the final letter (thus <hi rend="italic">iemand,
                    arend</hi>; Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">ieman, aren);</hi> after sharp
                    consonants <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is added, as <hi rend="italic">gedrocht,
                    burcht,</hi><hi rend="italic">borst</hi> ( High German <hi rend="italic"
                    >burs</hi><hi rend="italic">ehe),</hi> and also in <hi rend="italic"
                    >rnijnent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">B</hi> is frequently syncopated as a penultimate consonant
                    before s: <hi rend="italic">thans</hi> for <hi rend="italic">thands,
                    volgens</hi> for <hi rend="italic">volgends. Asem, wasem,</hi> perhaps, have not
                    dropped the <hi rend="italic">d {th)</hi> before <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> but
                    have changed <hi rend="italic">th</hi> into <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> While the
                    final <hi rend="italic">t</hi> has partly grown out of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>
                    it is partly also the common Low German and English <hi rend="italic">t
                    {tal,</hi><hi rend="italic">laten,</hi><hi rend="italic">haut).</hi> Between s
                    and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in words derived from the Romance tongues a <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> is inserted owing to the common German dislike to <hi
                    rend="italic">sr (stroop</hi> from <hi rend="italic">siroρ)</hi>; after <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> and also before the suffix <hi rend="italic">-lijk,</hi>
                    the introduction of <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> which was frequent in the 16th
                    century, is less and less heard, and on this point the written speech is far
                    before the spoken <hi rend="italic">{wezenlijk, cigenlijk</hi> are frequently
                    pronounced <hi rend="italic">wezeutlijk, eigentlijk;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ordéntelijk</hi> alongside of <hi rend="italic">ordelijk</hi> at an early date
                    has acquired the <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and afterwards an inserted <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> at the same time modifying its signification). In the
                    dialects (Limburg, Brabant, Utrecht) the final <hi rend="italic">t</hi> after
                    consonants and vowels is frequently dropped: <hi rend="italic">hij heef
                    {heeft),</hi><hi rend="italic">nie (niet).</hi> The compound <hi rend="italic"
                    >ts</hi> serves in words borrowed from the French to represent the Dutch
                    pronunciation of the French sound <hi rend="italic">ç</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(falsoen,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">façon).</hi> While the present language,
                    both in orthography and pronunciation, makes a distinction between <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> (as in the English <hi rend="italic">sound)</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> (as in the English <hi rend="italic">hazel),</hi> the
                    Middle Dutch had only s (though in the later MSS. <hi rend="italic">z</hi>
                    begins to appear), and Frisian is still in the same position. Before a vowel or
                    <hi rend="italic">w,</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi> has for the most part passed
                    into <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> except in those words in which it is followed
                    either by a long or short vowel succeeded by <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> or by a
                    short vowel before <hi rend="italic">s</hi> or <hi rend="italic">k</hi>; or <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> was sharpened into <hi rend="italic">s</hi> by a <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> from the preposition <hi rend="italic">ie∙. zoel, zwak,
                    zitten; sissen, suizen, sokken, samen</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">tsamen</hi>
                    for <hi rend="italic">ie zamen).</hi> In foreign words the s usually remains <hi
                    rend="italic">{saluut, soldij).</hi> Contrary to the pronunciation, <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> is written in <hi rend="italic">zestig</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">zeventig</hi> (pronounced <hi rend="italic">sestig, seventig,</hi>
                    and in dialects <hi rend="italic">tsestig, tseventig).</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This dialect t has probably come from the Old
                    Saxon ant- {hund), which stood before zeventig, tachtig, negentig (dialect
                    tnegentig). From these words the sharpening of the initial consonant has spread
                    to the other numerals: veertig and vijftig are pronounced feertig
                    a.nàfgftig.</p></note> The <hi rend="italic">z</hi> in the middle of a word,
                    after a syllable which originally had no accent, has passed into <hi

                    In many cases the meaning has been modified.</p>
                <p>Prothesis of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> occurs in <hi rend="italic">srnoel</hi> for

                    rend="italic">Zwenken</hi> and <hi rend="italic">wanken,</hi> go back to older
                    forms, and are thus probably doublets of much older date than the breaking off
                    of the German languages from each other.</p>
                <p>As in English so in Dutch <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the undisplaced German
                    medial. At the beginning and in the body of a word it has the same sound; at the
                    end it is pronounced as <hi rend="italic">p</hi> (see p. 86). In Middle Dutch
                    for the most part <hi rend="italic">b</hi> was followed by a vowel (Middle Dutch
                    <hi rend="italic">webbe,</hi> Modern Dutch <hi rend="italic">web)</hi>; this
                    vowel fell away in Modern Dutch, but the <hi rend="italic">b</hi> remained in
                    the written language. Wherever the <hi rend="italic">b</hi> represents <hi
                    rend="italic">-bj</hi> it is doubled, just as after a short vowel <hi
                    rend="italic">{krab, krabben).</hi> So, too, frequentatives have <hi
                    rend="italic">bb</hi><hi rend="italic">{krabbelen,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >kibbelen,</hi> with which compare Modern Dutch <hi rend="italic">kijven,</hi>
                    Middle Lower German <hi rend="italic">kibben; stribbelen</hi> side by side with
                    <hi rend="italic">streven</hi>; compare also <hi rend="italic">hebben</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">heeft,</hi> Old Frankish <hi rend="italic">libban,</hi> Dutch
                    <hi rend="italic">levcn).</hi> After <hi rend="italic">ä</hi> or δ + <hi
                    rend="italic">tn, b</hi> fell away both as a middle letter and as a final
                    consonant; but this is not as yet general in Middle Dutch; alongside of <hi
                    rend="italic">crom, omme,</hi> we find <hi rend="italic">cromp, ombe,</hi> while
                    in Modern Dutch we always have <hi rend="italic">lam, krom, dom, om.</hi> In
                    substantives ending in <hi rend="italic">m</hi> with a preceding long vowel,
                    wherever the diminutive particle <hi rend="italic">je</hi> is appended, a p is
                    inserted <hi rend="italic">{kruim, kruirnpje; bloem, blocmpje)∙,</hi> but this
                    does not take place after an imperfect vowel where an <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    is inserted <hi rend="italic">{kam,</hi><hi rend="italic">kammetje).</hi> As in
                    English the <hi rend="italic">p</hi> has not been displaced, and it has the same
                    sound <hi rend="italic">{paard, post, pink, lap).</hi></p>

                    rend="italic">{leef, leven; plof, ploffen).</hi> At the end and also before

                    rend="italic">F</hi><hi rend="italic">{υ)</hi> is the common German <hi

                    >vater</hi> along with ∕αder, while in Middle Dutch likewise a similar variation
                    prevails. Usually the precedence of a sharp consonant in Middle Dutch causes the
                    <hi rend="italic">v</hi> to become ∕ <hi rend="italic">{mesfal, ontfaen; cf.
                    val</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vaen;</hi> but also <hi rend="italic"
                    >mesval,</hi> &amp;c. ).</p>
                <p>The combination <hi rend="italic">ft</hi> has in Dutch passed into <hi
                    rend="italic">cht,</hi> but it appears in the dialects, and was more frequent in
                    Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">{verkocht, hecht, sticht, achter; verkoft, heft,
                    stift,</hi><hi rend="italic">after).</hi> On the other hand in the psalms and.
                    the <hi rend="italic">Glossae Lipsianae,</hi> and also in dialectic charters, we
                    find occasionally <hi rend="italic">ft</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ht:</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">druften {druhtin), sufte</hi> (stem <hi rend="italic">suk),

                <p>The liquids are unchanged, except <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    >l</hi> interchanges with <hi rend="italic">n:</hi> for example, <hi

                    as <hi rend="italic">giyohta</hi> indicates an older form <hi rend="italic"
                    >giyanhta.</hi><hi rend="italic">Vowels.—</hi> As early as the Middle Dutch

                    lost their sound. The <hi rend="italic">i</hi> which gave rise to the umlaut was
                    in great measure elided in some words before the umlaut period, in others later.
                    The number of words in which no umlaut occurs is increased; in some words it is
                    absent, even while <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is retained or has passed into <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi>; this depends on the greater or less sensitiveness of the
                    dialect for the umlaut :— <hi rend="italic">loot,</hi> comparat, <hi

                    the dialects e is still frequently retained). In Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> before <hi rend="italic">l</hi> sometimes, but not usually, becomes <hi

                    in Modern Dutch, into <hi rend="italic">o</hi> through the influence of the

                    of the preterite participle. In the conjugation of the verbs Middle Dutch has
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> where Modem Dutch has <hi rend="italic">a (geslegen,

                    >geheven</hi> alone <hi rend="italic">e</hi> has been kept. In the 3d pers.

                    Dutch, along with <hi rend="italic">ont-faet, gaet, staet</hi> (Modern Dutch <hi
                    rend="italic">ontvangt, gaat, stoat).</hi> In participles of verbs in the
                    Germanic <hi rend="italic">-jan,</hi> Middle Dutch has in some cases the
                    original form without the umlaut, where Modern Dutch, through the analogy with
                    the present, has the umlaut: Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">beeant, genant,
                    gesant</hi>; Modern Dutch <hi rend="italic">bekend, gezonden.</hi> This last
                    arose through confusion with the participle of the verb <hi rend="italic"
                    >sinden,</hi> which had become obsolete, <hi rend="italic">gezant</hi>
                    continuing to exist as a substantive.</p>
                <p>In substantives and adjectives we find e (derived from <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    through <hi rend="italic">i)</hi> along with the unchanged <hi rend="italic">a
                    (gretig, graag,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">gradig; hekcl, akelig;</hi><hi

                    the western dialects, which has not arisen through the umlaut; in some places it
                    is even pronounced as <hi rend="italic">ai</hi> where the written form has <hi

                    ρeinzen,</hi> Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">penzen a.xiøpeizen;</hi> sometimes
                    it is the result of an <hi rend="italic">i</hi> following: <hi rend="italic"
                    >heinde (hende, handi).</hi></p>
                <p>Since the umlaut has not been equally effective in all dialects, being even
                    wanting where <hi rend="italic">i</hi> has passed into e or dropped out, we find
                    words with ee side by side with words with <hi rend="italic">ei.</hi> Thus,
                    Middle Dutch has <hi rend="italic">reene, kleene,</hi> where Modern Dutch,
                    through the influence of another dialect, has <hi rend="italic">rein,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">klein.</hi> In Modern Dutch ee frequently exists side by side with
                    <hi rend="italic">ei (verbreedeη, verbreiden; heelen,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >heil)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in this case there is usually a
                    differentiation of meaning. The dialect of North Holland turns <hi rend="italic"
                    >ee</hi> into <hi rend="italic">ie (bicst, stien,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bien,</hi> for the Dutch <hi rend="italic">beest, steen, been);</hi> and this
                    explains some words with <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> in the spoken language: for
                    example, <hi rend="italic">tientje (twig), driegeη (dreigen)—</hi> 17 th
                    century.</p>
                <p>The letter <hi rend="italic">o</hi> represents three sounds :—(1) the short sharp
                    <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and (2) the short soft <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> the
                    former like the <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in English <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                    and French <hi rend="italic">soldat</hi> (Dutch <hi rend="italic">bod, belofte,
                    tocht, kolf),</hi> the latter like the French <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">ballon</hi> (Dutch <hi rend="italic">vod, ploffen,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">achtend,</hi><hi rend="italic">vol;</hi> Middle Dutch has
                    frequently <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">uchtend);</hi> and (3)
                    the full <hi rend="italic">o</hi> as in French <hi rend="italic">noter</hi>
                    (Dutch <hi rend="italic">kolen, sloten,</hi><hi rend="italic">verloren).</hi>
                    The sharp clear <hi rend="italic">oo</hi> lias almost the same sound as the full
                    <hi rend="italic">o;</hi> in some dialects (among others the Saxon) it is
                    pronounced as double <hi rend="italic">oo,</hi> in others (Flemish and
                    Hollandsch) somewhat like <hi rend="italic">au.</hi> In Middle Dutch, the
                    lengthening of the vowels was frequently indicated by <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    (before <hi rend="italic">r</hi> sometimes by <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> as in
                    <hi rend="italic">oir)</hi>; hence <hi rend="italic">ae</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">â,</hi><hi rend="italic">oe</hi> for <hi rend="italic">6.</hi>
                    Where <hi rend="italic">oe</hi> occurs in the modern language, it has the sound
                    of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (pronounced like the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> in
                    High German, and answering to the Gothic <hi rend="italic">6,</hi> Old High
                    German <hi rend="italic">uo.</hi> from <hi rend="italic">ua),</hi> which in

                    dialects still preserve in these cases an <hi rend="italic">ô</hi> sound which
                    agrees with the Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">oe</hi><hi rend="italic">(bôk,
                    môder);</hi> in two words— <hi rend="italic">romer (roemer,</hi> however, is
                    also used) and <hi rend="italic">spook—o</hi> has passed from these dialects
                    into Dutch. As the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (Old German <hi rend="italic"
                    >Û),</hi> which in the modern tongues has passed into <hi rend="italic">wi</hi>
                    except before <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> retains the
                    u sound in the Saxon districts, some words have come into Dutch from these
                    dialects, being written with <hi rend="italic">oe</hi> from the similar sound of
                    <hi rend="italic">oe</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">Ô)</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ua (snoet, boer, soczen,</hi> alongside of which are Frankish words, <hi
                    rend="italic">snuit, suizen,</hi> &amp;c.). Except in the Saxon dialects, which
                    are more sensitive to the umlaut, the modification of <hi rend="italic">oe</hi>
                    by <hi rend="italic">i</hi> seldom occurs (Modern Dutch <hi rend="italic">groen,

                    changed before <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in <hi rend="italic">eu,</hi> when <hi
                    rend="italic">oe</hi> was still pronounced <hi rend="italic">6;</hi> they have
                    thus not umlaut of oe but of <hi rend="italic">6.</hi></p>
                <p>In French words which are completely naturalized longo becomes <hi rend="italic"
                    >oe</hi><hi rend="italic">(façon</hi><hi rend="italic">=fatsoen).</hi></p>
                <p>In Middle Dutch, o in some cases occurs instead of <hi rend="italic">oe (u)</hi>
                    in open syllables <hi rend="italic">(gode,</hi><hi rend="italic">moder).</hi>
                    This o for <hi rend="italic">oe</hi> rhymes with o; rhymes like <hi

                    >gode</hi> (Goth. <hi rend="italic">Guys), stocct (stookt)</hi> and <hi

                    repeatedly introduced. Thus, too, <hi rend="italic">oe = 6</hi> from <hi

                    >ô</hi> and <hi rend="italic">û</hi> rhyme with each other.</p>
                <p>The Modern Dutch oo from <hi rend="italic">au</hi> is represented by oo both in
                    open and in closed syllables. The full clear o from the German o or <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> is expressed in closed syllables by oo, in open syllables
                    by o: <hi rend="italic">kool, koleη</hi> (English <hi rend="italic">coal),
                    stroom, stτoomem</hi> The umlaut of the soft and sharp o <hi rend="italic"
                    >(eu=Q</hi> in High German <hi rend="italic">schön)</hi> is rare in Middle

                    sometimes with a difference in the meaning <hi rend="italic">(sprcuk, sρrook;

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Û</hi> had still the Old German pronunciation in the Old
                    Frankish psalms, and this was probably the case also in the oldest Middle Dutch.
                    In Maerlant’s style, however, it had already acquired the sound of the French
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi> in <hi rend="italic">nature·,</hi> thus, Maerlant
                    rhymes <hi rend="italic">nature, cure; gure, pure; sure, creature.</hi> In the

                    passes before double consonants into <hi rend="italic">ι (slieρ, ring).</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ie</hi> further indicates a lengthened <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Î</hi> in syllables on which the chief accent falls <hi
                    rend="italic">(fubriek, fabrieken),</hi> while <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is used
                    for short <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and in unaccented syllables, or, it may be,
                    for short <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in closed syllables <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fubrikant, sikkel, midden,</hi><hi rend="italic">binden).</hi> The long <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> is indicated by <hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> where <hi
                    rend="italic">ij</hi> (which was originally the sign of i, and in Middle Dutch
                    and the dialects is still so pronounced) passes over into <hi rend="italic"
                    >ui</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ei</hi> through dialect influence, but retains
                    the written form <hi rend="italic">ij: sijsje</hi> (Eng. <hi rend="italic"
                    >siskin),purtij, pijn, ijs,</hi> &amp;c. In some words in which the original <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> sound has been preserved, <hi rend="italic">Î</hi> is also
                    expressed by <hi rend="italic">ie (gerief, wierook, kiem,</hi> &amp;c. ).</p>
                <p>The sounds in Dutch which are the most difficult for foreigners to pronounce are
                    the aspirated <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> after
                    vowels, the <hi rend="italic">sch</hi> before vowels, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >v.</hi> This last letter is pronounced by the Germans either as <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> or as <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and they also usually
                    confound <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> as initial
                    consonants. Of the vowels, the most difficult is the <hi rend="italic">ui,</hi>
                    which is almost never pronounced with perfect accuracy by a foreigner. The <hi
                    rend="italic">ij</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ei</hi> are generally sounded too
                    closely like <hi rend="italic">ui.</hi><hi rend="italic">Grammar.—In</hi> Middle
                    Dutch the different noun-stems are divided into two principal classes :—(1) a
                    combination of the various vowel stems, which nave more or less lost their
                    individual characters, though here and there, in particular expressions and
                    dialects, the difference of the stems makes itself apparent; and (2) a
                    consonantal declension, that of the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> stems—the other
                    consonantal stems having been assimilated partly to the <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    stemsand partly to the vowel stems. Gradually, however, the two classes begin to
                    be confused with each other; thus in the vowel stems <hi rend="italic">s</hi>
                    completely ousts the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> as a sign of the nominative
                    plural, and consequently acquires a plural significance as well as <hi
                    rend="italic">en,</hi> so that (with some exceptions, like <hi rend="italic"
                    >gruuf, hertog,</hi> &amp;c., and adjectives employed as substantives) <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">en</hi> are in Modern Dutch used
                    indifferently as plural terminations, the selection mainly depending on the
                    nature of the foregoing consonant. In the words already mentioned— <hi
                    rend="italic">gruuf, hecr, υorst,</hi> &amp;c., and in compounds like <hi
                    rend="italic">gruvenkroon, hunenkum,</hi> the genitive termination <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi> is preserved. The <hi rend="italic">s</hi> of the genitive
                    is employed in feminines whenever the qualified word stands after it, as <hi
                    rend="italic">mocderskind</hi>; with this exception, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >s,</hi> especially in the spoken speech, is almost entirely superseded by the
                    periphrasis <hi rend="italic">van den; des heeren</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic"
                    >van den heer,</hi> the two forms having the same meaning, which is not the case
                    in High German.</p>
                <p>Neuters have in the plural the same inflexiones masculines; but they more
                    frequently than these have the plural termination <hi rend="italic">-er,—</hi>
                    corrupted, however, to <hi rend="italic">-ers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">-eren
                    (kind, hinders</hi> or <hi rend="italic">kinderen),</hi> no plural termination
                    in <hi rend="italic">-er</hi> alone being now recognized. Some words, which in
                    the singular had a parallel form with another termination, have the plural
                    according only to one form: <hi rend="italic">stud</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >stedc,</hi> for example, have the plural <hi rend="italic">steden.</hi> In some
                    cases (as <hi rend="italic">schiρ,</hi> plur. <hi rend="italic">schepen;
                    smut,</hi> plur. <hi rend="italic">smeden)</hi> the plural form has not yet been
                    explained. In the dialects, especially in the Saxon, the older forms, more
                    particularly of the plural, are still in force; and there is still a certain
                    difference between the several stems: <hi rend="italic">boom,</hi> pl. <hi
                    rend="italic">beume (borne); gust,</hi><hi rend="italic">geste.</hi></p>
                <p>The old genitive ami dative forms are only retained in individual expressions, as
                    <hi rend="italic">den lande,</hi><hi rend="italic">des huizes,</hi> &amp;c.; in
                    all other cases the genitive and dative are expressed by the prepositions <hi
                    rend="italic">van</hi> or «an. 1he accusative is like the nominative, while in
                    the neuter the dative also without <hi rend="italic">aan</hi> is like the
                    accusative. From the similarity of the dative and accusative masculine and
                    neuter of the article great similarity has arisen in the government of the
                    prepositions; it is only in a few expressions <hi rend="italic">(mctterdaad, van
                    goeden huize)</hi> that the original cases have been maintained; in all other
                    instances <hi rend="italic">voor, van, door, met,</hi> &amp;c., govern the
                    accusative. In Middle Dutch this confusion had not advanced so far. The dropping
                    of the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> at the end after vowels—a special peculiarity of
                    Hollandsch—has given rise to great neglect of the genders in the spoken
                    language; and this confusion has even made itself felt in the literary style,
                    though it is kept in check by the Saxon dialects, which are strongly
                    conservative in this respect.</p>
                <p>The singular of the second personal pronoun <hi rend="italic">du</hi> (still used
                    in Middle Dutch) has been displaced by the plural <hi rend="italic">gij,</hi>
                    which was originally used out of politeness; and <hi rend="italic">U</hi>
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">Uwe Edelheid</hi> is now employed as the
                    honorific. As dative and accusative of <hi rend="italic">gij, jo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi> is familiar in the spoken language
                    (Eng. <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> Goth. <hi rend="italic">jus).</hi> The third
                    person has, as in English, for the masculine <hi rend="italic">hij (hi),</hi>
                    thus diverging from the High German; the neuter is <hi rend="italic">het.</hi>
                    The form in use for the neuter article also sounds <hi rend="italic">het</hi>;
                    this <hi rend="italic">het</hi> is due to the fact that the abbreviation <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">t</hi> for the pronoun <hi
                    rend="italic">het</hi> and for the article <hi rend="italic">dut</hi> was the
                    same,—a coincidence which led to an erroneous identification . In Middle Dutch
                    the reflexive pronoun was <hi rend="italic">hem</hi>; Modern Dutch (agreeing in
                    this with the Old Frankish psalms) has <hi rend="italic">zieh.</hi></p>
                <p>Though the strong verbs and the various classes of weak verbs are always kept
                    separate, many verbs have become through association of ideas almost
                    unrecognizable. Strong verbs have become wholly or partially weak: <hi
                    rend="italic">bannen,</hi><hi rend="italic">bande,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gebunnen;</hi><hi rend="italic">spannen, spunde,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gespun-nen; helen, heelde,</hi><hi rend="italic">verholen</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">verheeld , beseffen, besefte, beseft</hi> (Middle Dutch <hi
                    rend="italic">besief, beseven)</hi>; weak verbs have become strong: <hi
                    rend="italic">jagen</hi> (Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">jaugde), joeg</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">juagde,</hi><hi rend="italic">gejaugd; sehenden,
                    schänd,</hi><hi rend="italic">geschonden; zenden(see</hi> above); <hi
                    rend="italic">prijzcnanà</hi><hi rend="italic">wijzen</hi> passthrough the <hi
                    rend="italic">ij</hi> (the weak ) into the strong <hi rend="italic">î</hi> class
                    (Middle Dutch, <hi rend="italic">prisde, wisde;</hi> Modern Dutch, <hi
                    rend="italic">precs, wees, geprezen, gcwezen.</hi> In <hi rend="italic"
                    >belijden, beluidde,</hi> Middle Dutch <hi rend="italic">belîën, bclîde,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the preterite found its way into the present
                    also and into the infinitive; and the <hi rend="italic">belîden,</hi> Modern
                    Dutch <hi rend="italic">belijden,</hi> thus formed passed into the i class of
                    strong verbs. The <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of <hi rend="italic">ward,</hi> the
                    preterite of <hi rend="italic">werden,</hi> has passed into <hi rend="italic"
                    >werd,</hi> and the plural has through analogy become <hi rend="italic"
                    >werden,</hi> the present being <hi rend="italic">ik word</hi> and the
                    infinitive <hi rend="italic">wot den.</hi> The first class of strong verbs has
                    before <hi rend="italic">n</hi> + a consonant <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in the
                    stem of the present <hi rend="italic">(binden)</hi> or else <hi rend="italic">e
                    (helρen),</hi> this <hi rend="italic">e</hi> remaining throughout the
                    conjugation of the present <hi rend="italic">(hij hclpt,</hi> not, as in wgh
                    German, <hi rend="italic">hilft).</hi> In the preterite the <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> has changed into <hi rend="italic">o</hi> through the influence of the
                    plural, as has already been, mentioned under o. The conjunctive or optative is
                    frequently neglected even in Middle Dutch; in the living language it is
                    sometimes used after certain .verbs and conjunctions <hi rend="italic"
                    >{op</hi><hi rend="italic">dut</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ten einde),</hi> but
                    in expressing a wish it is sometimes periphrased by <hi rend="italic">mögen</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">laten,</hi> and it is very frequently displaced by the
                    indicative. The High German construction of the verb with <hi rend="italic"
                    >zieh</hi> to express a passive idea is contrary to the genius of Dutch, which
                    employs the periphrastic passive form <hi rend="italic">het wordt duur
                    gevonden</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">es findet sich du</hi> (Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">il se trouve là).</hi> The formation of the future likewise
                    differs from that of the High German, the auxiliary being not <hi rend="italic"
                    >werden</hi> but <hi rend="italic">zullen</hi> (Eng. <hi rend="italic">shall):
                    ik zul het doen</hi> = both <hi rend="italic">I shall do it</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">I will do it.</hi></p>
                <p>Much of the vocabulary of Middle Dutch has now become obsolete. Some words have
                    altogether disappeared:— <hi rend="italic">dorper, dmperlike</hi> (Modern Dutch,
                    <hi rend="italic">gemeen), gruen (knevel),</hi><hi rend="italic">grein</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(kern,</hi> excellent person), <hi rend="italic">ontstuen
                    (afwuchten), ors (petard), oorbucr (nut).</hi> Others have changed their meaning
                    :— <hi rend="italic">couse,</hi> “breeches,” now “hose”; <hi rend="italic"
                    >clene,</hi> ‘ few,” now “small”; <hi rend="italic">onnoozel,</hi> “innocent,”
                    now “halfwitted”; <hi rend="italic">slecht,</hi> “simple,” now “wicked”; <hi
                    rend="italic">beρroevcn,</hi> “toprove,” now “to attempt”; <hi rend="italic"
                    >crane,</hi> “weak,” now “sick.”</p>
                <p>Many new native words have grown up in connexion with trade, industry, art, and
                    science; many foreign words have also been introduced, such as those taken from
                    the French with the suffixes <hi rend="italic">eeren, ιck, ief;</hi> and many
                    words from the dialects have received rights of citizenship.</p>

                <p>As has been shown above, the language now known as Dutch or Flemish did not begin
                    to take distinct shape till about the end of the 11 th century. From a few
                    existing fragments—two incantations from the 8th century, a version of the
                    Psalms from the 9th century, and several charters—a supposed Old Dutch language
                    has been recognized; butDutch literature actually commences in the 13th century,
                    as Middle Dutch, the creation of the first national movement in Brabant,
                    Flanders, Holland, and Zealand. From the wreck of Fr ιnkish anarchy no genuine
                    folk-tales of Dutch antiquity have come down to us, and scarcely any echoes of
                    German myth. On the other hand, the sagas of Charlemagne and Arthur appear
                    immediately in Middle Dutch forms. These were evidently introduced by wandering
                    minstrels and jongleurs, and translated to gratify the curiosity of the noble
                    women. It is rarely that the name of such a translator has reached us, but we
                    happen to know that the fragments we possess of the French romance of <hi
                    rend="italic">William of Orange</hi> were written in Dutch by a certain Klaas
                    van Haarlem, between 1191 and 1217.∙ The <hi rend="italic">Chanson de
                    Poland</hi> was translated about the same time, and considerably later <hi
                    rend="italic">Parthenopeus de Blois.</hi> The Flemish minstrel Diederic van
                    Assenede completed his version of <hi rend="italic">Floris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Blanchefleur alc&gt;oυX</hi> 1250. The Arthurian
                    legends appear to have been brought to Flanders by some Flemish colonists in
                    Wales, on their return to their mother-country. About 1250 a Brabantine minstrel
                    translated Walter Map’s <hi rend="italic">Lancelot du Lac</hi> at the command of
                    his liege, Lodewijk van Velthem. The <hi rend="italic">Gauvain</hi> was
                    translated by Pennine and Vostaert before 1260, while the first original Dutch
                    writer, the famous Jakob van Maerlant, occupied himself about 1260 with several
                    romances dealing with Merlin and the Holy Grail. The earliest existing fragments
                    of the epic of <hi rend="italic">Peynard the Fox</hi> were written in Latin by
                    Flemish priests, and about 1250 a very important version in Dutch was made by
                    Willem the Minstrel, of whom it is unfortunate that we know no more, save that
                    he was the translator of a lost romance, <hi rend="italic">Madoc.</hi> In his
                    existing work the author follows Pierre de Saint-Cloud, but not slavishly; and
                    he is the first really admirable writer that we meet with in Dutch literature.
                    It is not necessary to dwell at any length on the monkish legends and the hymns
                    to the Virgin Mary which were abundantly produced during the 13th century, and
                    which, though destitute of all literary merit, were of use as exercises in the
                    infancy of the language. The first lyrical writer of Holland was John I., duke
                    of Brabant, who practised the <hi rend="italic">rniηηelied</hi> with success,
                    but whose songs are only known to us through a Swabian version of a few of them.
                    In 1544 the earliest collection of Dutch folk-songs saw the light, and in this
                    volume one or two romances of the 14th century are preserved, of which <hi
                    rend="italic">Het Daghet in den Oosten</hi> is the best known. Almost the
                    earliest fragment of Dutch popular poetry, but of later time, is an historical
                    ballad describing the murder of Count Floris V. in 1296. A very curious
                    collection of mystical mediaeval hymns by Sister Hadewych, a nun of Brabant, was
                    first printed in 1877.</p>
                <p>Hitherto, as we have seen, the Middle Dutch language had placed itself at the
                    service of the aristocratic and monastic orders, flattering the traditions of
                    chivalry and of religion, but scarcely finding anything to say to the bulk of
                    the population. With the close of the 13th century a change came over the face
                    of Dutch literature. The Flemish towns began to prosper and to assert their
                    commercial supremacy over the North Sea. Linder such mild rulers as William II.
                    and Floris V., Dort, Amsterdam, and other cities contrived to win such
                    privileges as amounted almost to political independence, and with this liberty
                    there arose a new sort of literary expression. The founder and creator of this
                    original Dutch literature was Jakob van Maerlant, born near Bruges between 1225
                    and 1250. His youth was spent in Holland, and probably in connexion with the
                    court, but in 1261 he returned to Flanders, where he died about thirty years
                    later. Maerlant commenced, as his predecessors had done, by translating the
                    courtly romances of the French, but when he returned to Flanders he began to
                    take his true position as an original didactic poet. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flowers of Nature,</hi> written about 1263, forms an epoch in Dutch literature;
                    it is a collection of moral and satirical addresses to all classes of society.
                    With his <hi rend="italic">Pijmbijbel</hi> (Rhyming Bible) he nearly brought
                    down on his too secular head, in 1270, the chastisement of the bishop of
                    Utrecht, and thus early in Dutch history foreshadowed the courage and
                    free-thought of the Reformation. It was not until 1284 that he commenced his
                    masterpiece, <hi rend="italic">De Spieghel Histoτiael</hi> (The Mirror of
                    History), at the. command of Count Floris V. After writing a great many
                    important works, lyrical and didactic, Maerlant died at Damme, about 1291. Of
                    his disciples, the most considerable in South Holland was Jan van Boendale
                    (1280-1365). He was a politician of considerable influence, and his works are
                    historical and moral in character. In him the last trace of the old chivalric
                    and romantic element has disappeared. He completed his famous rhyme chronicle,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Brabantsche Yeesten,</hi> in 1315; it contains the history
                    of Brabant down to the times of the author himself. For English readers it is
                    disappointing that Boendale’s other great historical work, an account of Edward
                    HI. and his expedition to Flanders in 1338, has survived only in some fragments.
                    The remainder of Boendale’s works are didactic poems, pursuing still further the
                    moral thread first taken up by Maerlant, and founded on mediaeval scholastic
                    literature. In Ypres the school of Maerlant was represented by Jan de Weert, a
                    surgeon, who died in 1362, and who was the author of two remarkable works of
                    moral satire and exhortation. In North Holland a greater talent than that of
                    Weert or of Boendale was exhibited by Melis Stoke, a monk of Egmond, who wrote
                    the history of the state of Holland to the year 1305; this work, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pijmkroηik,</hi> was printed in 1591, and for its exactitude and
                    minute detail has proved of inestimable service to later historians.</p>
                <p>With the middle of the 14th century the chivalric spirit came once more into
                    fashion. A certain revival of the forms of feudal life made its appearance under
                    William III. and his successors. Knightly romances came once more into vogue,
                    but the new-born didactic poetry contended vigorously against the supremacy of
                    what was lyrical and epical. It will be seen that from the very first the
                    literary spirit in Holland began to assert itself in a homely and utilitarian
                    spirit. Jan van Heelu, a Brabanter, was the author of an epic poem on the battle
                    of Woeronc (1288), and to him has been attributed the still finer romance of the
                    <hi rend="italic">War of Grimbergen.</hi> Still more thoroughly aristocratic in
                    feeling was Hein van Aken, a priest of Louvain, who lived about 1255-1330, and
                    who combined to a very curious extent the romantic and didactic elements. As
                    early as 1280 he had completed his translation of the <hi rend="italic">Roman de
                    la Pose,</hi> which he must have commenced in the lifetime of Jean de Meung.
                    More remarkable than any of his translated works, however, is his original
                    romance <hi rend="italic">Heiwric</hi><hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Margriete,</hi> upon which he was at work for thirty-seven years. During the
                    Bavarian period (1349-1433) very <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n102/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0102-0091"/> little original writing of much value was
                    produced in Holland. Buodewijn van der Loren wrote one excellent piece on the
                    Maid of Ghent, in 1389. Augustijnken van Dordt was a peripatetic minstrel of
                    North Holland, who composed for the sheriff Aelbrecht and for the count of Blois
                    from 1350 to 1370. Such of his verses as have been handed down to us are
                    allegorical and moral. Willem van Hildegaersberch (1350-1408) was another
                    northern poet, of a more strictly political cast. Many of his writings exist
                    still unpublished, and are very rough in style and wanting in form. Towards the
                    end of the 15th century an erotic poet of considerable power arose in the person
                    of the lord of Waddinxsveen and Hubrecbtsambacht, Dirk Potter. During a stay of
                    three years in Rome, from 1409 to 1412, this eminent diplomatist made himself
                    acquainted with the writings of Boccaccio, and commenced a vast poem on the
                    course of love, <hi rend="italic">Der Minnen</hi><hi rend="italic">Loep,</hi>
                    which is a wonderful mixture of classical and Biblical instances of amorous
                    adventure, set in a framework of didactic philosophy. In Dirk Potter the last
                    traces of the chivalric element died out of Dutch literature, and left poetry
                    entirely in the hands of the school of Maerlant.</p>
                <p>It is now time to consider the growth of prose literature in the Low Countries.
                    The oldest pieces of Dutch prose now in existence are charters of the towns of
                    Flanders and Zealand, dated 1249,1251, and 1254. A prose translation of the Old
                    Testament was made about 1300, and there exists a <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Jesus</hi> of about the same date. Of the mystical preachers whose religious
                    writings have reached us, the Brussels friar, Jan van Ruysbroec (1294-1381), is
                    the most important. But the most interesting relics of mediaeval Dutch prose, as
                    far as the formation of the language is concerned, are the popular romances in
                    which the romantic stories of the <hi rend="italic">trouvères</hi> and minstrels
                    were translated for the benefit of the unlettered public into simple language.
                    As in most European nations, the religious drama takes a prominent place in
                    every survey of mediaeval literature in Holland. Unfortunately the text of all
                    the earliest mysteries, the language of which would have an extraordinary
                    interest for us, has been lost. We possess records of dramas having been played
                    at various places— <hi rend="italic">Our Lord's Resurrection,</hi> at the Hague,
                    in 1400; <hi rend="italic">Our Lady the Virgin,</hi> at Arnheim, in 1452; and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Three Kings,</hi> at Delft, in 1498. The earliest existing
                    fragment, however, is part of a <hi rend="italic">Limlmrg-Maestricht Passover
                    Play</hi> of about 1360. The latest Dutch miracle play was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mystery of the Holy Sacrament,</hi> composed by a certain Smδken, at Breda, and
                    performed on St John’s Day, 1500. This play was printed in 1867. With these
                    purely theological dramas there were acted mundane farces, performed outside the
                    churches, by semi-religious companies; these curious moralities wereknown as
                    “Abelespelen” and“Sotternieën.” In these pieces we discover the first traces of
                    that genius for low comedy which was afterwards to take perfect form in the
                    dramas of Brederôo and the paintings of Teniers.</p>
                <p>The theatrical companies just alluded to, “Gesellen van den Spele,” formed the
                    germ out of which developed the famous “Chambers of Rhetoric” which united
                    within themselves all the literary movements that occupied the Low Countries
                    during the 15th and 16th centuries. The poets of Holland had already discovered
                    in late mediaeval times the value of guilds in promoting the arts and industrial
                    handicrafts. The term “collèges de rhétorique” is supposed tohave been
                    introduced about 1440 by the courtiers of the Burgundian dynasty, but the
                    institutions themselves existed at least from 1400. These literary guilds lasted
                    for two centuries, and during the greater part of that time preserved a
                    completely mediaeval character, even when the influences of the Renaissance and
                    the Reformation obliged them to modify in some degree their outward forms. They
                    were in almost all cases absolutely middle class in tone, and opposed to
                    aristocratic ideas and tendencies in thought. Of these remarkable bodies the
                    earliest were almost entirely engaged in preparing mysteries and miracle-plays
                    for the populace. Each chamber, and in process of time every town in the Low
                    Countries, possessed one, and took as its title some fanciful or heraldic sign.
                    The earliest of all, “The Alpha and Omega,” at Ypres, was founded about 1398;
                    that of the “Violet,” at Antwerp, followed in 1400; the “Book,” at Brussels, in
                    1401; the “Berberry,” at Courtrai, in 1427; the “Holy Ghost,” at Bruges, in
                    1428; the “Floweret Jesse,” at Middelburg, in 1430; the “Oak Tree,” at
                    Vlaardingen, in 1433; and the “Marigold,” at Gouda, in 1437. The most celebrated
                    of all the chambers, that of the “Eglantine” at Amsterdam, with its motto <hi
                    rend="italic">In Liefde Bloeyende</hi> (Blossoming in Love), was not instituted
                    until 1496. Among the most influential chambers not above mentioned should be
                    included the “Fountain” at Dort, the “Corn Flower” at the Hague, the “White
                    Columbine” at Leyden, the “Blue Columbine” at Rotterdam, the “Red Rose” at
                    Schiedam, the “Thistle” at Zierikzee, “Jesus with the Balsam” at Ghent, and the
                    “Garland of Mary” at Brussels. And not in these important places only, but in
                    almost every little town, the rhetoricians exerted their influence, mainly in
                    what we may call a social direction. Their wealth was in most cases
                    considerable, and it very soon became evident that no festival or procession
                    could take place in a town unless the “Kamer” patronized it. Towards the end of
                    the 15tb century the Ghent chamber of “Jesus with the Balsam” began to exercise
                    a sovereign power over the other Flemish chambers, which was emulated later on
                    in Holland by the “Eglantine” at Amsterdam. But this official recognition proved
                    of no consequence in literature, and it was not in Ghent, but in Antwerp, that
                    intellectual life first began to stir. In Holland the burghers only formed the
                    chambers, while in Flanders the representatives of the noble families were
                    honorary members, and assisted with their money at the arrangement of
                    ecclesiastical or political pageants. Their pompous <hi rend="italic"
                    >landjuweelen,</hi> or tournaments of rhetoric, at which rich prizes were
                    contended for, were the great occasions upon which the members of the chambers
                    distinguished themselves. Between 1426 and 1620 at least 66 of these festivals
                    were held. There was a specially splendid <hi rend="italic">laηdjuweel</hi> at
                    Antwerp in 1496, in which 28 chambers took part, but the gayest of all was that
                    celebrated,at Antwerp on the 3d of August 1561. To this the “Book” at Brussels
                    sent 340 members, all on horseback, and clad in crimson mantles. The town of
                    Antwerp gave a ton of gold to be given in prizes, which were shared among 1893
                    rhetoricians. This was the zenith of the splendour of the “Kamers van
                    Rhetorica,” and after this time they soon fell into disfavour. We can trace the
                    progress of literary composition under the chambers, although none of their
                    official productions have descended to us. Their dramatic pieces were certainly
                    of a didactic cast, with a strong farcical flavour, and continued the tradition
                    of Maerlant and his school. They very rarely dealt with historical or even
                    Biblical personages, but entirely with allegorical and moral abstractions, until
                    the age of humanism introduced upon the stage the names without much of the
                    spirit of mythology. Of the pure farces of the rhetorical chambers we can speak
                    with still more confidence, for some of them have come down to us, and among the
                    authors famed for their skill in this sort of writing are named Cornelis
                    Everaert of Bruges and Laurens Janssen of Haarlem. The material of these farces
                    is extremely raw, consisting of rough jests at the expense of priests and
                    foolish husbands, silly old men and their light wives. Laurens Janssen is also
                    deserving of remembrance for a satire against the clergy, written in 1583. The
                    chambers also <pb break="no"

                    very little success; they produced no lyrical genius more considerable than
                    Matthijs de Casteleyn (1488-1550), the founder of the Flemish chamber of “Pax
                    Vobiscum” at Oudenarde, a personage whose influence as a fashioner of language
                    would have been more healthy if his astounding metrical feats and harlequin <hi
                    rend="italic">tours-de-force</hi> had not been performed in a dialect debased
                    with all the worst bastard phrases of the Burgundian period.</p>
                <p>In the middle of the 16th century a group of rhetoricians in Brabant and Flanders
                    attempted to put a little new life into the stereotyped forms of the preceding
                    age by introducing in original composition the new-found branches of Latin and
                    Greek poetry. The leader of these men was Jean Baptista Houwaert (1533-1599), a
                    personage of considerable political influence in his generation. He considered
                    himself a devout disciple of Matthijs de Casteleyn, but his great characteristic
                    was his unbounded love of classical and mythological fancy. His didactic poems
                    are composed in a wonderfully rococo style, and swarm with misplaced Latinities.
                    In his bastard Burgundian tongue he boasted of having “poëtelijck geïnventeert
                    ende rheto-rijckelijck ghecomponeert” for the Brussels chamber such dramas as
                    <hi rend="italic">Aeneas</hi><hi rend="italic">and Dido, Mars and Venus,
                    Narcissus and Echo, or Leander and Hero.</hi> But of all his writings <hi
                    rend="italic">Pegasides Pleyn,</hi> or the Palace of Maidens, is the most
                    remarkable; this is a didactic poem in sixteen books, dedicated to a discussion
                    of the variety of earthly love. Houwaert’s contemporaries nicknamed him “the
                    Homer of Brabant later criticism has preferred to see in him an important link
                    in that chain of homely didactic Dutch which ends in Cats. His writings are
                    composed in a Burgundian so base that they hardly belong to Flemish literature
                    at alL Into the same miserable dialect Cornell’s van Ghistele of Antwerp
                    translated, between 1555 and 1583, parts of Terence, Virgil, Horace, and Ovid,
                    while the painter Karel van Mander (1547-1609) puta French version of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi> of Virgil
                    into an equally ill-fitting Flemish dress. In no country of Europe did the
                    humanism of the 16th century at first affect the national literature so slightly
                    or to so little purpose.</p>
                <p>The stir and revival of intellectual life that arrived with the Reformation found
                    its first expression in the composition of Psalms. The earliest printed
                    collection appeared at Antwerp in 1540, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Souter-Liedekens,</hi> and was dedicated to a Dutch nobleman, Willem van Zuylen
                    van Nieuvelt, by whose name it is usually known. This collection, however, was
                    made before the Reformation in Holland really set in. For the Protestant
                    congregations Jan LRenhove printed a volume of Psalms in London in 1566; Lucas
                    de Heere, and immediately after him, with much greater success, Petrus Datheen
                    (1531-1590), translated the hymns of Clément Marot. For printing this last
                    volume, in 1567, Herman Schinkel of Delft was burned to death in 1568. Datheen
                    was not a rhetorician, but a person of humble origin, who wrote in the vulgar
                    tongue, and his hymns spread far and wide among the people. Until 1773 they were
                    in constant use in the state church of Holland. But the great events of the
                    period of reformation are not marked by psalms only in Dutch literature. Two
                    collections of hymns and lyrical pieces, printed in 1562 and 1569, perpetuate
                    the fervour and despair of the martyrs of the Mennonite Church. Similar
                    utterances of the persecuted Protestants were published at Haarlem and
                    Leeuwarden, at Ghent and at Bruges. Very different in tone were the battle-songs
                    of liberty and triumph sung a generation later by the victorious Reformers or
                    “Geuzen.” The famous song-book of 1588, the <hi rend="italic">Geusen
                    Lieden</hi><hi rend="italic">Boecxkeη,</hi> was full of ardent and heroic
                    sentiment, expressed often in marvellously brilliant phrases. In this collection
                    appeared for the first time such classical snatches of Dutch song as the Ballad
                    of Heiligerlee, the Ballad of Egmond and Horn, and the song of the Storm of
                    Leyden. The political ballads, with their ridicule of the Spanish leaders, form
                    a section of the <hi rend="italic">Boecxken</hi> which has proved of inestimable
                    value to historians. All these lyrics, however, whether of victory or of
                    martyrdom, are still very rough in form and language.</p>
                <p>The first writer who used the Dutch tongue with grace and precision of style was
                    a woman and a professed opponent of Lutheranism and reformed thought. Modern
                    Dutch literature practically begins with Anna Bijns. Against the crowd of
                    rhetoricians and psalm-makers of the early part of the 16th century she stands
                    out in relief as the one poet of real genius. The language, oscillating before
                    her time between French and German, formless, corrupt, and invertebrate, took
                    shape and comeliness, which none of the male pedants could give it, from the
                    impassioned hands of a woman. Anna Bijns, who is believed to have been born at
                    Antwerp in 1494, was a schoolmistress at that city in her middle life, and in
                    old age she still “instructed youth in the Catholic religion.” Hendrik Peppinck,
                    a Franciscan, who edited her third volume of poems when she was an old woman in
                    1567, speaks of her as “a maiden small of descent, but great of understanding,
                    and godly of life.” Her first known volume bears the date 1528, and displays her
                    as already deeply versed in the mysteries of religion. We gather from all this
                    that she was a lay nun, and she certainly occupied a position of great honour
                    and influence at Antwerp. She was named “the Sappho of Brabant” and the
                    “Princess of all Rhetoricians.” She bent the powerful weapon of her verse
                    against the faith and character of Luther. In her volume of 1528 the Lutherans
                    are scarcely mentioned; in that of 1540 every page is occupied with invectives
                    against them; while the third volume of 1567 is the voice of one from whom her
                    age has passed. All the poems of Anna Bijns which we possess are called <hi
                    rend="italic">refereinen</hi> or refrains. Her mastery over verse-form was
                    extremely remarkable, and these refrains are really modified chants-royal. The
                    writings of Anna Bijns offer many points of interest to the philologist, In her
                    the period of Middle Dutch closes, and the modern Dutch begins. In a few
                    grammatical peculiarities—such as the formation of the genitive by some verbs
                    which now govern the accusative, and the use of <hi rend="italic">ghe</hi>
                    before the infinitive —her language still belongs to Middle Dutch; but these
                    exceptions are rare, and she really initiated that modern speech which Filips
                    van Marnix adopted and made classical in the next generation.</p>
                <p>In Filips van Marnix, lord of St Aldegonde (1538- 1598), a much greater personage
                    came forward in the ranks of liberty and reform. He began life as a disciple of
                    Calvin and Beza in the schools of Geneva. It was as a defender of the Dutch
                    iconoclasts that he first appeared in print, with his tract on <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Images thrown down in Holland in August</hi> 1566. He soon became one of
                    the leading spirits in the war of Dutch independence, the intimate friend of the
                    prince of Orange, and the author of the glorious <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wilhelmuslied.</hi> It was in the autumn of 1568 that Marnix composed this, the
                    national hymn of Dutch liberty and Protestantism. In 1569 he completed a no less
                    important and celebrated prose work, the <hi rend="italic">Biencorf</hi> or
                    Beehive of the Romish Church. In this satire he was inspired in a great measure
                    by Rabelais, of whom he was an intelligent disciple. It is written in prose that
                    may be said to mark an epoch in the language and literature of Holland.
                    Overwhelmed with the press of public business, Marnix wrote little more until in
                    1580 he published his <hi rend="italic">Psalms of David newly translated out of
                    the Hebrew Tongue.</hi> He occupied the last years of his life in preparing a
                    Dutch <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n104/mode/1up"

                    original. At his death only Genesis was found completely revised; but in 1619
                    the synod of Dort placed the unfinished work in the hands of four divines, who
                    completed it.</p>
                <p>In Dirck Volckertsen Coornhert (1522-1590) Holland for the first time produced a
                    writer at once eager to compose in his native tongue and to employ the weapons
                    of humanism. Coornhert was a typical burgher of North Holland, equally
                    interested in the progress of national emancipation and in the development of
                    national literature. He was a native of Amsterdam, but he did not take part in
                    the labours of the old chamber of the Eglantine, but quite early in life
                    proceeded to Haarlem, of which place he remained a citizen until his death. He
                    practised the art of etching, and spent all his spare time in the pursuit of
                    classical learning. He was nearly forty years of age before he made any
                    practical use of his attainments. In 1561 he printed his translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">De Offi,ciis</hi> of Cicero, and in 1562 of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Beneficiis</hi> of Seneca. In these volumes he opposed
                    with no less zeal than Marnix had done the bastard forms still employed in prose
                    by the rhetoricians of Flanders and Brabant. During the next decade he occupied
                    himself chiefly with plays and poems, conceived and expressed with far less
                    freedom than his prose, and more in the approved conventional fashion of the
                    rhetoricians; he collected his poems in 1575. The next ten years he occupied in
                    polemical writing, from the evangelical point of view, against the Calvinists.
                    In 1585 he translated Boetius, and then gave his full attention to his original
                    masterpiece, the <hi rend="italic">Zedekumst,</hi> or Art of Ethics, a
                    philosophical treatise in prose, in which he studied to adapt the Dutch tongue
                    to the grace and simplicity of Montaigne’s French. His humanism unites the
                    Bible, Plutarch, and Marcus Aurelius in one grand system of ethics, and is
                    expressed in a style remarkable for brightness and purity. He died in 1590; his
                    works, in three enormous folio volumes, were first collected in 1630.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the period of transition, Amsterdam became the centre of all
                    literary enterprise in Holland. In 1585 two of the most important chambers of
                    rhetoric in Flanders, the “White Lavender” and the “Fig-Tree,” took flight from
                    the south, and settled themselves in Amsterdam by the side of the “Eglantine.”
                    The last-named institution had already observed the new tendency of the age, and
                    was prepared to encourage intellectual reform of every kind, and its influence
                    spread through Holland and Zealand. In Flanders, meanwhile, crushed under the
                    yoke of Parma, literature and native thought absolutely expired. From this time
                    forward, and until the emancipation of the southern provinces, the domain of our
                    inquiry is confined to the district north of the Scheldt.</p>
                <p>In the chamber of the Eglantine at Amsterdam two men took a very prominent place,
                    more by their intelligence and modern spirit than by their original genius.
                    Hendrick Laurenssen Spieghel (1549-1612) was a humanist of a type more advanced
                    and less polemical than Coornhert. He wrote a charming poem in praise of
                    dancing; but his chief contributions to literature were his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Twespraeclc van de Nederduytsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Letterkunst,</hi> a
                    philological exhortation, in the manner of Joachim du Bellay’s famous tract,
                    urging the Dutch nation to purify and enrich its tongue at the fountains of
                    antiquity, and a didactic epic, entitled <hi rend="italic">Hertspieghel,</hi>
                    which has been greatly praised, but which is now much more antiquated in style
                    and more difficult to enjoy than Coornhert’s prose of a similar tendency. That
                    Spieghel was a Catholic prevented him perhaps from exercising as much public
                    influence as he exercised privately among his younger friends. The same may be
                    said of the man who, in 1614, first collected Spieghel’s writings, and published
                    them in a volume with his own verses. Roemer Pieterssen Visscher (1545-1620)
                    proceeded a step further than Spieghel in the cultivation of polite letters. He
                    was deeply tinged with a spirit of classical learning that was much more genuine
                    and nearer to the true antique than any that had previously been known in
                    Holland. His own disciples called him the Dutch Martial, but he was at best
                    little more than an amateur in poetry, although an amateur whose function it was
                    to perceive and encourage the genius of professional writers. Roemer Visscher
                    stands at the threshold of the new Renaissance literature, himself practising
                    the faded arts of the rhetoricians, but pointing by his counsel and his
                    conversation to the naturalism of the great period.</p>
                <p>It was in the salon at Amsterdam which the beautiful daughters of Roemer Visscher
                    formed around their father and themselves that the new school began to take
                    form. The republic of the United Provinces, with Amsterdam at its head, had
                    suddenly risen to the first rank among the nations of Europe, and it was under
                    the influence of so much new emotion and brilliant ambition that the country no
                    less suddenly asserted itself in a great school of painting and poetry. The
                    intellect of the whole Low Countries was concentrated in Holland and Zealand,
                    while the six great universities, Leyden, Groningen, Utrecht, Amsterdam,
                    Harderwijk, and Franeker, were enriched by a flock of learned exiles from
                    Flanders and Brabant. It had occurred, however, to Roemer Visscher only that the
                    path of literary honour lay, not along the utilitarian road cut out by Maerlant
                    and Boendale, but in the study of beauty and antiquity. In this he was curiously
                    aided by the school of ripe and enthusiastic scholars who began to flourish at
                    Leyden, such as Drusius, Vossius, and Hugo Grotius, who themselves wrote little
                    in Dutch, but who chastened the style of the rising generation by insisting on a
                    pure and liberal Latinity. Out of that generation arose the greatest names in
                    the literature of Holland,—Vondel, Hooft, Cats, Huygens,—in whose hands the
                    language, so long left barbarous and neglected, took at once its highest finish
                    and melody. By the side of this serious and aesthetic growth there is to be
                    noticed a quickening of the broad and farcical humour which had been
                    characteristic of the Dutch nation from its commencement. For fifty years, and
                    these the most glorious in the annals of Holland, these two streams of
                    influence, one towards beauty and melody, the other towards lively comedy, ran
                    side by side, often in the same channel, and producing a rich harvest of great
                    works. It was in the house of the daughters of Roemer Visscher that the
                    tragedies of Vondel and the comedies of Brederôo, the farces of Coster and the
                    odes of Huygens, alike found their first admirers and their best critics.</p>
                <p>Of the famous daughters of Roemer, two cultivated literature with marked success.
                    Anna (1584-1651) was the author of a descriptive and didactic poem, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Poemster van den Aemstel</hi> (The Glory of the Aemstel), and
                    of various miscellaneous writings; Tesselschade (1594-1649) wrote some lyrics
                    which still place her at the head of the female poets of Holland, and she
                    translated the great poem of Tasso. They were women of universal accomplishment,
                    graceful manners, and singular beauty; and their company attracted to the house
                    of Roemer Visscher all the most gifted youths of the time, several of whom were
                    suitors, but in vain, for the hand of Anna or of Tesselschade.</p>
                <p>Of this Amsterdam school^ the first to emerge into public notice was Pieter
                    Cornelissen Hooft (1581-1647). He belonged to a patrician family, and became a
                    member at a very early age of the chamber of the Eglantine. When he was only
                    eighteen he produced, before this body, his tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Achilles and</hi><hi rend="italic">Polyxena</hi> (1598), which displayed a
                    precocious ease in the use of rhetorical artifices of style. Hi" intellectual
                    character, however, was formed by a journev into Italy which he took in 1598,
                    where he steeped himself <pb break="no"

                    both prose and verse. He returned to Holland in 1601, with his head full of
                    schemes for the creation of a Dutch school of belles lettres. In 1605 he
                    produced his pastoral drama of <hi rend="italic">Granula,</hi> in which he
                    proved himself a pupil of Guarini. During the remainder of his life he dedicated
                    himself chiefly to history and tragedy. In the latter field he produced <hi

                    Henry the Great,</hi> while from 1628 to 1642 he was engaged upon his
                    master-work, the <hi rend="italic">History of Holland.</hi> Hooft desired to be
                    a severe purist in style, and to a great extent he succeeded, but, like most of
                    the writers of his age, he permitted himself too many Latinisms. In his poetry,
                    especially in the lyrical and pastoral verse of his youth, he is full of Italian
                    reminiscences both of style and matter; in his noble prose work he has set
                    himself to be a disciple of Tacitus. Mr Motley has spoken of Hooft as one of the
                    greatest historians, not merely of Holland, but of Europe. His influence in
                    purifying the language of his country, and in enlarging its sphere of
                    experience, can hardly be overrated.</p>
                <p>Very different from the long and prosperous career of Hooft was the brief,
                    painful life of the greatest comic dramatistthat Hollandhas produced. Gerbrand
                    Adriaanssen Brederôo (1585-1618) was the son of an Amsterdam shoemaker. He knew
                    no Latin; he had no taste for humanism; he was a simple growth of the rich
                    humour of the people. His life was embittered by a hopeless love for
                    Tesselschade, to whom he dedicated his dramas, and whose beauty he celebrated in
                    a whole cycle of love songs. His ideas on the subject of drama were at first a
                    mere development of the mediaeval “Abelespelen.” He commenced by dramatizing the
                    romance of <hi rend="italic">Roderick and Alphonsus,</hi> in 1611, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Griaηe</hi> in 1612, but in the latter year he struck out a new
                    and more characteristic path in his <hi rend="italic">Farce of the Cow.</hi>
                    From this time until his death he continued to pour out comedies, farces, and
                    romantic dramas, in all of which he displayed a coarse, rough genius not unlike
                    that of Ben Jonson, whose immediate contemporary he was. His last and best piece
                    was <hi rend="italic">Jerolimo, the Spanish</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Brabanter,</hi> a satire upon the exiles from the south who filled the halls of
                    the Amsterdam chambers of rhetoric with their pompous speeches and preposterous
                    Burgundian phraseology. Brederôo was closely allied in genius to the dramatists
                    of the Shakespearian age, but he founded no school, and stands almost as a
                    solitary figure in the literature of Holland.</p>
                <p>The only individual at all clearly connected with Brederôo in talent was Dr
                    Samuel Coster, whose dates of birth and death are unknown. He is chiefly
                    remembered for having been the first to take advantage of the growing dissension
                    in the body of the old chamber of the Eglantine to form a new institution. In
                    1617 Coster founded what he called the “First Dutch Academy.” This was in fact a
                    theatre, where, for the first time, dramas could be publicly acted under the
                    patronage of no chamber of rhetoric. Coster himself had come before the world in
                    1612 with his farce of <hi rend="italic">Teuwis the Boor,</hi> and he continued
                    this order of composition in direct emulation of Brederôo, but with less talent.
                    In 1615 he began a series of “blood-and-thunder” tragedies with his horrible <hi
                    rend="italic">Itys,</hi> and he continued this coarse style of tragic writing
                    for several years. He survived at least until after 1648 as a supreme authority
                    in Amsterdam upon all dramatic matters.</p>
                <p>The greatest of all Dutch writers, Joost van der Vondel (1587-1679), was born at
                    Cologne on the 17th of November 1587. In 1612 he brought out his first work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Het</hi><hi rend="italic">Pascha,</hi> a tragedy or tragi-comedy
                    on the exodus of the children of Israel, written, like all his succeeding
                    dramas, on the recognized Dutch plan, in alexandrines, in five acts, and with
                    choral interludes between the acts. There is comparatively little promise in <hi
                    rend="italic">Het</hi><hi rend="italic">Pascha.</hi> It was much
                    inferior-dramatically to the plays just being produced by Brederôo, and
                    metrically to the clear and eloquent tragedies and pastorals of Hooft; but it
                    secured the young poet a position inferior only to theirs. Yet for a number of
                    years he made no attempt to emphasize the impression he had produced on the
                    public, but contented himself during the years that are the most fertile in a
                    poet’s life with translating and imitating portions of Du Bartas’s popular epic.
                    The short and brilliant life of Brederôo, his immediate contemporary and
                    greatest rival, burned itself out in a succession of dramatic victories, and it
                    was not until two years after the death of that great poet that Vondel appeared
                    before the public with a second tragedy, the <hi rend="italic">Jeηιsalem laid
                    Desolate.</hi> Five years later, in 1625, he published what seemed an innocent
                    study from the antique, his tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Palamedes,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or Murdered Innocence.</hi> All Amsterdam discovered, with
                    smothered delight, that under the name of the hero was thinly concealed the
                    figure of Barneveldt, whose execution in 1618 had been a triumph of the hated
                    Calvinists. Thus, at the age of forty-one, the obscure Vondel became in a week
                    the most famous writer in Holland. For the next twelve years, and till the
                    accession of Prince Frederick Hendrick, Vondel bad to maintain a hand-to-hand
                    combat with the “Saints of Dort.” This was the period of his most resolute and
                    stinging satires; Cats took up the cudgels on behalf of the
                    counter-Remonstrants, and there raged a war of pamphlets in verse. A purely
                    fortuitous circumstance led to the next great triumph in VondeΓs slowly
                    developing career. The Dutch Academy, founded in 1617 almost wholly as a
                    dramatic guild, had become so inadequately provided with stage accommodation
                    that in 1638, having coalesced with the two chambers of the “Eglantine” and the
                    “White Lavender,” it ventured on the erection of a large public theatre, the
                    first in Amsterdam. Vondel, as the greatest poet of the day, was invited to
                    write a piece for the first night; on the 3d of January 1638 the theatre was
                    opened with the performance of a new tragedy out of early Dutch history, the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Gysbreght van Aemstel.</hi> The next ten years were
                    rich in dramatic work from VondeΓs hand; he supplied the theatre with heroic
                    Scriptural pieces, of which the general reader will obtain the best idea if we
                    point to the <hi rend="italic">Athalie</hi> of Racine. In 1654, having already
                    attained an age at which poetical production is usually discontinued by the most
                    energetic of poets, he brought out the most exalted and sublime of all his
                    works, the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Lucifer.</hi> Very late in life, through
                    no fault of his own, financial ruin fell on the aged poet, and from 1658 to
                    1668—that is, from his seventieth to his eightieth year—this venerable and
                    illustrious person, the main literary glory of Holland through her whole
                    history, was forced to earn his bread as a common clerk in a bank, miserably
                    paid, and accused of wasting his masters’ time by the writing of verses. The
                    city released him at last from this wretched bondage by a pension, and the
                    wonderful old man went on writing odes and tragedies almost to his ninetieth
                    year. He died at last in 1679, of no disease, having outlived all his
                    contemporaries and almost all his friends, but calm, sane, and good-humoured to
                    the last, serenely conscious of the legacy he left to a not too grateful
                    country. Vondel is the typical example of Dutch intelligence and imagination at
                    their highest development. Not merely is he to Holland all that Camoens is to
                    Portugal and Michiewicz to Poland, but he stands on a level with these men in
                    the positive value of his writings.</p>
                <p>Lyrical art was represented on its more spontaneous side by the songs and ballads
                    of Jan Janssen Starter (b. 1594), an Englishman by birth, who was brought to
                    Amsterdam in his thirteenth year. Very early in life he was made a member of the
                    “Eglantine,” and he worked beside <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0106-0095"/> Brederoo for two years; but in 1614 he wandered
                    away to Leeuwarden, in Friesland, where he founded a literary guild, and brought
                    out, in 1618, his tragi-comedies of <hi rend="italic">Timbre de Cardone</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Daraida.</hi> But his great contribution to literature was his
                    exquisite collection of lyrics, entitled the <hi rend="italic">Friesche
                    Lusthof,</hi> or Frisian Pleasance. He returned to Amsterdam, but after 1625 we
                    hear no more of him, and he is believed to have died as a soldier in Germany.
                    The songs of Starter are in close relation to the lyrics of the English
                    Elizabethans, and have the same exquisite simplicity and audacity of style.</p>
                <p>While the genius of Holland clustered around the circle of Amsterdam, a school of
                    scarcely less brilliance arose in Middelburg, the capital of Zealand. The ruling
                    spirit of this school was the famous Jakob Cats (1577-1660). In this voluminous
                    writer, to whom modern criticism almost denies the name of poet, the genuine
                    Dutch habit of thought, the utilitarian and didactic spirit which we have
                    already observed in Houwaert and in Boendale, reached its zenith of fluency and
                    popularity. Cats was a man of large property and high position in the state, and
                    his ideas never rose above the horizon of wealth and easy domestic satisfaction.
                    Between 1609 and 1621, that is, during early middle life, he produced the most
                    important of his writings, his pastoral of <hi rend="italic">Gαlαthea,</hi> and
                    his didactic poems, the <hi rend="italic">Maechdenplicht</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sinne-en Minne-Beelden.</hi> In 1624 he removed from Middelburg to
                    Dort, where he soon after published his tedious ethical work called <hi
                    rend="italic">Houιοelidk,</hi> or Marriage; and this was followed from time, to
                    time by one after another of his monotonous moral pieces. Cats is an exceedingly
                    dull and prosaic writer, whose alexandrines roll smoothly on without any power
                    of riveting the attention or delighting the fancy. Yet his popularity with the
                    middle classes in Holland has always been immense, and his influence extremely
                    hurtful to the· growth of all branches of literary art. Among the disciples of
                    Cats, Jakob Westerbaen (1599-1670) was the most successful. The Jesuit Adriaen
                    Poirters (1606-1675) closely followed Cats in his remarkable <hi rend="italic"
                    >Masquer of the World.</hi> A poet of Amsterdam, Jan Hermansz Krul, preferred to
                    follow the southern fashion, and wrote didactic pieces in the Catsian
                    manner.</p>
                <p>A poet of dignified imagination and versatile form was Sir Constantijn Huygens
                    (1596—1687), the diplomatist. Though born and educated at the Hague, he threw in
                    his lot with the great school of Amsterdam, and became the intimate friend and
                    companion of Vondel, Hooft, and the daughters of Roemer Visscher. His famous
                    poem in praise of the Hague, <hi rend="italic">Batava</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tempe,</hi> appeared in 1621, and was, from a technical point of view, the most
                    accomplished and elegant poem till that time produced in Holland. His collected
                    poems, <hi rend="italic">Otiorum Libri</hi><hi rend="italic">Sex,</hi> were
                    printed in 1625. <hi rend="italic">Oogentroost,</hi> or Eye Consolation, was the
                    fantastic title of a remarkable poem dedicated in 1647 to his blind friend,
                    Lucretia van Trello. He printed in 1654 a topographical piece describing his own
                    mansion, <hi rend="italic">Hofινijck.</hi> Huygens represents the direction in
                    which it would have been desirable that Dutch literature, now completely founded
                    by Hooft and Vondel, should forthwith proceed, while Cats represents the tame
                    and mundane spirit which was actually adopted by the nation. Huygens had little
                    of the sweetness of Hooft or of the sublimity of Vondel, but his genius was
                    eminently bright and vivacious, and he was a consummate artist in metrical form.
                    The Dutch language has never proved so light and supple in any hands as in his,
                    and he attempted no class of writing, whether in prose or verse, that he did not
                    adorn by his delicate taste and sound judgment. A blind admiration for our own
                    John Donne, whose poems he translated, was the greatest fault of Huygens, who,
                    in spite of his conceits, remains one of the most pleasing of Dutch writers. In
                    addition to all this he comes down to us with the personal recommendation of
                    having been “one of the most lovable men that ever lived.”</p>
                <p>Three Dutchmen of the 17th century distinguished themselves very prominently in
                    the movement of learning and philosophic thought, but the illustrious names of
                    Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) and of Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) can scarcely be said
                    to belong to Dutch literature. Balthasar Bekker (1634—1698), on the contrary, a
                    Reformed preacher of Amsterdam, was a disciple of Descartes, who deserves to be
                    remembered as the greatest philosophical writer who has used the Dutch language.
                    His masterpiece, <hi rend="italic">Betoνeτde Wereld,</hi> or the World
                    Bewitched, appeared in 1691-1693. Bekker is popularly remembered most honourably
                    by his determined attacks upon the system of a penal code for witchcraft.</p>
                <p>From 1600 to 1650 was the blossoming time in Dutch literature. During this period
                    the names of greatest genius were first made known to the public, and the vigour
                    and grace of literary expression reached their highest development. It happened,
                    however, that three men of particularly commanding talent survived to an extreme
                    old age, and. under the shadow of Vondel, Cats, and Huygens there sprang up a
                    new generation which sustained the great tradition until about 1680, when the
                    final decline set in. Jan Vos (d. 1667) gained one illustrious success with his
                    tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Aaron and Titus</hi> in 1641, and lost still more
                    in the same year by his obscene farce of <hi rend="italic">Oene.</hi> His second
                    tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Medea,</hi> in 1665, and his collected. poems in
                    1662, supported his position as the foremost pupil of Vondel. Geeraerdt Brandt
                    (1626-1685) deserves remembrance less as a tragic dramatist than as a consummate
                    biographer, whose lives of Vondel and of De Ruyter are among the masterpieces of
                    Dutch prose. Johan Antonides van der Goes (1647-1684) followed Vos as a skilful
                    imitator of Vondel’s tragical manner. His Chinese tragedies, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trazil</hi> (1665) and <hi rend="italic">Zuηgchin</hi> (1666), scarcely gave
                    promise of the brilliant force and fancy of his <hi rend="italic">Ijstroom,</hi>
                    a poem in praise of Amsterdam, 1671. He died suddenly, in early life, leaving
                    unfinished an epic poem on the life of St Paul. Reyer Anslo (1626-1669) marks
                    the decline of taste and vigour; his once famous descriptive epic, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Plague at Naples,</hi> is singularly tame and rococo in style.
                    Joachim Oudaen (1628-1692) wrote in his youth two promising tragedies, <hi
                    rend="italic">Johanna Gray</hi> (1648) and <hi rend="italic">Konradyn</hi>
                    (1649). The Amsterdam section of the school of Cats produced Jeremias de Decker
                    (1609—1646) and Joannes Vollenhove (1631-1708), voluminous writers of didactic
                    verse. The engraver Jan Luiken (1649-1708) published in 1671 a very remarkable
                    volume of poems. In lyrical poetry Starter had a single disciple, Daniel
                    Jonctijs (1600- 1652), Who published a volume of love songs in 1639 under the
                    affected and untranslatable title of <hi rend="italic">Rooselijns oochjens
                    ontlped.</hi> None of these poets, except in some slight degree Luiken, set
                    before themselves any more ambitious task than to repeat with skill the effects
                    of their predecessors.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the romantic and voluminous romances of the French school of Scudéry
                    and Honoré d’Urfé had invaded Holland and become fashionable. Johan van
                    Heemskerk (1597-1656), a councillor of the Hague, set himself to reproduce this
                    product in native form, and published in 1637 his <hi rend="italic">Batavian
                    Arcadia,</hi> the first original Dutch romance, in which a party of romantic
                    youths journey from the Hague to Katwijk, and undergo all sorts of romantic
                    adventures. This book was excessively popular, and was imitated by Hendrik
                    Zoetebυom in his <hi rend="italic">Zaanlandsche Arcadia</hi> (1658), and by
                    Lambertus Bos in his <hi rend="italic">Dordtsche Arcadia</hi> (1662). A far more
                    spirited and original romance is the <hi rend="italic">Mirandor</hi> of Nikolaes
                    Heinsius, the younger (b. 1655), a book which resembles <hi rend="italic">Gil
                    Blas,</hi> and precedes it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0107-0096"/> by forty years. It was written when the author
                    was only twenty years of age, and gave promise of very great talent in the
                    future; but unfortunately Heinsius committed a murder only two years afterwards,
                    and, escaping to Paris, was never heard of again.</p>
                <p>The drama fell into Gallicized hands at the death of Vondel and his immediate
                    disciples. Lodewijck Meijer translated Corneille, and brought out his plays on
                    the stage at Amsterdam, where he was manager of the national theatre or
                    Schouwburg after Jan Vos. In connexion with Andries Pels, author of the tragedy
                    of <hi rend="italic">Dido's Death,</hi> Meijer constructed a dramatic club,
                    entitled “Nil Volentibus Arduum,” the great object of which was to inflict the
                    French taste upon the public. Pels furthermore came forward as the censor of
                    letters and satirist of barbarism in <hi rend="italic">Horace’s Art of Poetry
                    expounded,</hi> in 1677, and in his <hi rend="italic">Use and Misuse of the
                    Stage,</hi> in 1681. Willem van Focquenbroch (1640-1679) was the most voluminous
                    comic writer of this period. The close of the century saw the rise of two
                    thoroughly Gallican dramatists, Johan van Paffenrode and Pieter Bernagie, who
                    may not unfairly be compared respectively to our own Farquhar and Shadwell.
                    Thomas Asselijn (1630-1695) was a writer of more considerable talent and more
                    homely instincts. He attempted to resist the dictatorship of Pels, and to follow
                    the national tradition of Brederôo. He is the creator of the characteristic
                    Dutch type, the comic lover, Jan Klaaszen, whom he presented on the stage in a
                    series of ridiculous situations. Abraham Alewijn, author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jan Los</hi> (1721), possessed a coarse vein of dramatic humour; he lived in
                    Java, and his plays were produced in Batavia. Finally Pieter Langendijk claims
                    notice among the dramatists of this period, although he lived from 1683 to 1756,
                    and properly belongs to the next century. With him the tradition of native
                    comedy expired.</p>
                <p>The Augustan period of poetry in Holland was even more blank and dull than in the
                    other countries of Northern Europe. Of the names preserved in the history of
                    literature there are but very few that call for repetition here. Arnold
                    Hoogvliet (1687-1763) wrote a passable poem in honour of the town of
                    Vlaardingen, and a terrible Biblical epic, in the manner of Blackmore, on the
                    history of Abraham. Hubert Cornelissen Foot (1689-1733) showed an unusual love
                    of nature and freshness of observation in his descriptive pieces. Sybrand
                    Feitama (1694-1758), who translated Voltaire’s <hi rend="italic">Henτiade,</hi>
                    and wrote much dreary verse of the same class himself, is less worthy of notice
                    than Dirk Smits (1702-1752), the mild and elegiac singer of Rotterdam. Tragic
                    drama was more or less capably represented by Lucretia Wilhelmina van Merken
                    (1722-1789), wife of the very dreary dramatist Nicholaas Simon van Winter
                    (1718-1795).</p>
                <p>In the midst of this complete dissolution of poetical style, a writer arose who
                    revived an interest in literature, and gave to Dutch prose the classical grace
                    of the 18th century. Justus van Effen (1684-1735) was born at Utrecht, fell into
                    poverty early in life, and was thrown very much among the company of French
                    émigrés, in connexion with whom he began literary life in 1713 by editing a
                    French journal. Coming to London just when the <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> were in their first vogue, Van Effen studied
                    Addison deeply, translated Swift and Defoe into French, and finally determined
                    to transfer the beauties of English prose into his native language. It was not,
                    however, until 1731, after having wasted the greater part of his life in writing
                    French, that he began to publish his <hi rend="italic">Hollaηdsche
                    Spectator,</hi> which his death in 1735 soon brought to a close. Still, what he
                    composed during the last four years of his life, in all its freshness,
                    manliness, and versatility, constitutes the most valuable legacy to Dutch
                    literature that the middle of the 18th century left behind it.</p>
                <p>The supremacy of the poetical clubs in every town pro duced a very weakening and
                    Della-Cruscan effect upon literature, from which the first revolt was made by
                    the famous brothers Van Haren, so honourably known as diplomatists in the
                    history of the Netherlands. Willem van Haren (1710-1768) wrote verses from his
                    earliest youth, while Onno Zwier van Haren (1713-1779), strangely enough, did
                    not begin to do so until he had passed middle life. They were friends of
                    Voltaire, and they were both ambitious of success in epic writing, as understood
                    in France at that period. Willem published in 1741 his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gevallen van Friso,</hi> an historical epos, and a long series of odes and
                    solemn lyrical pieces. Onno, in a somewhat lighter strain, wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">Diet and Agnietje, or Pandora's Box,</hi> and a long series of
                    tragedies in the manner of Voltaire. The Baroness Juliana Cornelia de Lannoy
                    (1738-1782) was a writer of considerable talent, also of the school of Voltaire;
                    her poems were highly esteemed by Bilderdijk, and she has a neatness of touch
                    and clearness of penetration that give vivacity to her studies of social life.
                    Jakobus Bellamy (1757-1786) was the son of a Swiss baker at Flushing; his
                    pompous odes struck the final note of the false taste and Gallic pedantry that
                    had deformed Dutch literature now for a century, and were for a short time
                    excessively admired.</p>
                <p>The year 1777 has been mentioned as the turning-point in the history of letters
                    in the Netherlands. It was in that year that Betjen Wolff (1738-1804), a widow
                    lady in Amsterdam, persuaded her friend Aagjen Deken (1741— 1804), a poor but
                    extremely intelligent governess, to throw up her situation and live with her.
                    For nearly thirty years these women continued together, writing in combination,
                    and when the elder friend died on the 5th of November 1804, her companion
                    survived her only nine days. Madame Wolff had appeared as a poetess so early as
                    1762, and again in 1769 and 1772, but her talent inverse was by no means very
                    remarkable. But when the friends, in the third year of their association,
                    published their <hi rend="italic">Letters on Divers Subjects,</hi> it was
                    plainly seen that in prose their talent was very remarkable indeed. Since the
                    appearance of Heinsius’s <hi rend="italic">Mirandor</hi> more than a century had
                    passed without any fresh start in novel-writing being made in Holland. In 1782
                    the ladies Wolff and Deken, inspired partly by contemporary English writers, and
                    partly by Goethe, published their first novel, <hi rend="italic">Sara
                    Burgerhart.</hi> In spite of the close and obvious following of Richardson, this
                    was a masterly production, and it was enthusiastically received. Another novel,
                    <hi rend="italic">Willem Leeveηd,</hi> followed in 1785, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cornelia Wildschut</hi> in 1792. The ladies were residing in France at the
                    breaking-out of the Revolution, and they escaped the guillotine with difficulty.
                    After this they wrote no more, having secured for themselves by their three
                    unrivalled romances a place among the foremost writers of their country.</p>
                <p>The last years of the 18th century were marked in Holland by a general revival of
                    intellectual force. The romantic movement in Germany made itself deeply felt in
                    all branches of Dutch literature, and German lyricism took the place hitherto
                    held by French classicism. Pieter Nieuwland (1764-1794) was a feeble forerunner
                    of the revival, but his short life and indifferent powers gave him no chance of
                    directing the transition that he saw to be inevitable. The real precursor and
                    creator of a new epoch in letters was the famous Willem Bilderdijk (1756-1831).
                    This remarkable man, whose force of character was even greater than his genius,
                    impressed his personality on his generation so indelibly that to think of a
                    Dutchman of the beginning of the present century is to think of Bilderdijk. He
                    was born at Amsterdam on the 7th of September 1756, and through an accident in
                    early childhood was obliged to rest almost constantly, thus attaining habits of
                    long and <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n108/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0108-0097"/> concentrated study. His parents were zealous in
                    the cause of the house of Orange, and the youth grew up violently monarchical
                    and Calvinistic, as Da Costa says, “antirevolutionary, anti-Barneveldtian,
                    anti-Loevesteinish, anti· liberal.” In poetry bis taste was strictly national
                    and didactic; he began as a disciple of Cats, nor could he to the end of his
                    life tolerate what he called “the puerilities of Shakespeare.” His early
                    love-songs, collected in 1781 and 1785, gave little promise of talent, but in
                    his epic of <hi rend="italic">Elias</hi> in 1786,. he showed himself superior to
                    all the Dutch poets since Huygens in mastery of form. For twenty years he lived
                    a busy, eventful life, writing great quantities of verse, and then commenced his
                    most productive period with his didactic poem of <hi rend="italic">The Disease
                    of the Learned,</hi> in 1807; in 1808 he imitated Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay
                    on Man,</hi> and published <hi rend="italic">Floris</hi> F^., and in 1809
                    commenced the work which he designed to be his master-piece, the epic of <hi
                    rend="italic">De Ondergang</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >eerste Wereld</hi> (The Destruction of the First World), which he never
                    finished, and which appeared as a fragment in 1820. His long and fretful life
                    ceased on the 18th of December 1831. To the foreign student Bilderdijk is a
                    singularly uninviting and unpleasing figure. He unites in himself all the
                    unlovely and provincial features which deform the worst of his countrymen. He
                    was violent, ignorant, and dull; his view of art was confined to its declamatory
                    and least beautiful side, and perhaps no writer of equal talent has shown so
                    complete an absence of taste and tact. Ten Brink has summed up the character of
                    Bilderdijk’s writings in an excellent passage:—“As an artist,” he says, “he can
                    perhaps be best described in short as the cleverest versemaker of the 18th
                    century. His admirable erudition, his power over language, more extended and
                    more colossal than that of any of his predecessors, enabled him to write pithy
                    and thoroughly original verses, although the general tone of his thought and
                    expression never rose above the ceremonious, stagy, and theatrical character of
                    the 18th century.” But in spite of his outrageous faults, and partly because
                    these faults were the exaggeration of a marked national failing, Bilderdijk has
                    enjoyed almost to the present day an unbroken and unbounded popularity in
                    Holland. Fortunately, however, within the last few years a sounder spirit has
                    arisen in criticism, and the prestige of Bilderdijk is no longer preserved so
                    religiously.</p>
                <p>Bilderdijk’s scorn for the dramas of Shakespeare was almost rivalled by that he
                    felt for the new German poetry. Notwithstanding his opposition, however, the
                    romantic fervour found its way into Holland, and first of all in the persons of
                    Hieronymus van Alphen (1746-1803) and Pieter Leonard van de Kastiele
                    (1748-1810), who amused themselves by composing funeral poems of the school of
                    Gessner and Blair. Van Alphen at one time was extolled as a writer of verses for
                    children, but neither in this nor in the elegiac line did he possess nearly so
                    much talent as Rhijnvis Feith (1753-1824), burgomaster of Zwolle, the very type
                    of a prosperous and sentimental Dutchman. In his <hi rend="italic">Julia</hi>
                    (1783), a prose romance, Feith proved himself as completely the disciple of
                    Goethe in <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> as Wolff and Deken had been of
                    Richardson in their <hi rend="italic">Sara Burgerhart.</hi> In Johannes Kinker
                    (1764-1845) a comic poet arose who, at the instigation of Bilderdijk, dedicated
                    himself to the ridicule of Feith’s sentimentalities. The same office was
                    performed with more dignity and less vivacity by Baron W. E. van Perponcher
                    (1741-1819), but Feith continued to hold the popular ear, and achieved an
                    immense success with his poem <hi rend="italic">The Grave,</hi> in 1792. He then
                    produced tragedies for a while, and in 1803 published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiquity,</hi> a didactic epic. But his popularity waned before his death, and
                    he was troubled by the mirth of such witty scoffers as Arend Fokke Simons
                    (1755-1812), the disciple of Klopstock, and as P. de Wacker van Zon (1758-1818),
                    who, in a series of very readable novels issued under the pseudonym of Bruno
                    Daalberg, sharply ridiculed the sentimental and funereal school.</p>
                <p>U nder the Batavian republic an historian of great genius arose in the person of
                    Johannes Henricus van der Palm (1763-1840), whose brilliant and patriotic <hi
                    rend="italic">Gedenkschmft van</hi><hi rend="italic">Nederlands</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Herstelling</hi> (1816) has somewhat obscured his great fame as a
                    politician and an Orientalist. The work commenced by Van der Palm in prose was
                    continued in verse by Cornelis Loots (1765-1834) and Jan Frederik Helmers
                    (1767-1813). Loots, in <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">As Batavians of
                    the Time</hi><hi rend="italic">ofCaesar</hi> (1805), read his countrymen a
                    lesson in patriotism, which Helmers far exceeded in originality and force by his
                    <hi rend="italic">Dutch Nation</hi> in 1812. Neither of these poets, however,
                    had sufficient art to render their pieces classical, or, indeed, enough to
                    protect them during their lifetime from the sneers of Bilderdijk. Other
                    political writers, whose lyrical energies were stimulated by the struggle with
                    France, were Maurits Cornelis van Hall (1768-1858), Samuel Iperuszoon Wiselius
                    (1769-1845), and Jan ten Brink (1771-1839), the second of whom immortalized
                    himself and won the favour of Bilderdijk by ridiculing the pretensions of such
                    frivolous tragedians as Shakespeare and Schiller.</p>
                <p>The healthy and national spirit in which the ladies Wolff and Deken had written
                    was adopted with great spirit by a novelist in the next generation, Adriaan
                    Loosjes (1761- 1818), a bookseller at Haarlem. His romantic stories of mediaeval
                    life, especially his <hi rend="italic">Charlotte van Bourbon,</hi> are curiously
                    like shadows cast forward by the Waverley Novels, but he has little of Sir
                    Walter Scott’s historical truth of vision. His production was incessant and his
                    popularity great for many years, but he was conscious all through that he was at
                    best but a disciple of the authoresses of <hi rend="italic">Sara
                    Burgerhart.</hi> Another disciple whose name should not be passed over is Maria
                    Jacoba de Neufville (1775- 1856), author of <hi rend="italic">Little
                    Duties,</hi> an excellent story somewhat in the manner of Mrs Opie.</p>
                <p>A remarkable poet whose romantic genius strove to combine the power of Bilderdijk
                    with the sweetness of Feith is Hendrik Tollens (1780-1856), whose verses have
                    shown more vitality than those of most of his contemporaries. He struck out the
                    admirable notion of celebrating the great deeds of Dutch history in a series of
                    lyrical romances, many of which possess a lasting charm. Besides his folk-songs
                    and popular ballads, he succeeded in a long descriptive poem, <hi rend="italic"
                    >A Winter in Nova Zembla,</hi> 1819. He lacks the full accomplishment of a
                    literary artist, but his inspiration was natural and abundant, and he thoroughly
                    deserved the popularity with which his patriotic ballads were rewarded. Willem
                    Messchert (1790-1844), a friend and follower of Tollens, pushed the domestic and
                    familiar tone of the latter to a still further point, especially in his genre
                    poem of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Wedding,</hi> 1825. Both these writers were
                    natives and residents of Rotterdam, which also claims the honour of being the
                    birthplace of Adrianus Bogaers (1795-1870), the most considerable poetical
                    figure of the time. Without the force and profusion of Bilderdijk, Bogaers has
                    more truth to nature, more sweetness of imagination, and a more genuine gift of
                    poetry than that clamorous writer, and is slowly taking a higher position in
                    Dutch literature as Bilderdijk comes to take a lower one. Bogaers printed his
                    famous poem <hi rend="italic">Jochebed</hi> in 1835, but it had then been in
                    existence more than thirteen years, so that it belongs to the second period of
                    imaginative revival in Europe, and connects the name of its author with those of
                    Byron and Heine. Still more beautiful was his <hi rend="italic">Voyage of
                    Heemskerk to Gibraltar</hi> (1836), in which he rose to the highest level of his
                    genius. In 1846 he privately printed his <hi rend="italic">Romances and
                    Ballads.</hi> Bogaers had a great objection to publicity, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n109/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0109-0098"/> and his reputation was long delayed by the
                    secrecy with which he circulated his writings among a few intimate friends. A
                    poet of considerable talent, whose powers were awakened by personal intercourse
                    with Bogaers and Tollens, was Antoni Christiaan Winand Staring (1767-1840), who
                    first at the age of fifty-three came before the world with a volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Poems,</hi> but who continued to write till past his seventieth
                    year. His amorous and humorous lyrics recall the best period of Dutch song, and
                    are worthy to be named beside those of Starter and Vondel.</p>
                <p>Since 1830 Holland has taken a more prominent position in European thought than
                    she could claim since the end of the 17th century. In scientific and religious
                    literature her men of letters have shown themselves cognizant of the newest
                    shades of opinion, and have freely ventilated their ideas. The language has
                    resisted the pressure of German from the outside, and from within has broken
                    through its long stagnation and enriched itself, as a medium for literary
                    expression, with a multitude of fresh and colloquial forms. At the same time, no
                    very great genius has arisen in Holland in any branch of literature, and all
                    that a foreign critic can do in such space as is here at his command is to
                    chronicle the names of a few of the most prominent writers of the past and
                    present generations. The vast labours of Jakobus van Lennep (1802-68) consist of
                    innumerable translations, historical novels, and national romances, which have
                    gained for him the title of the leader of the Dutch romantic school. Reinier
                    Cornelis Bakhuizen van den Bnnk (1810-65) was the chief critic of the romantic
                    movement, and Everhard Johannes Potgieter (1808-75) -its mystical philosopher
                    and esoteric lyrical poet. The genius and influence of Potgieter were very
                    considerable, but they were exceeded by the gifts of Nicolaes Beets, author of
                    the famous <hi rend="italic">Camera Obscura</hi> (1836), a masterpiece of humour
                    and character. Johannes Pieter Hasebroek, who has been called the Dutch Charles
                    Lamb, wrote in 1840 an admirable collection of essays entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Truth and Dreams.</hi> A poet of unusual power and promise was lost in the
                    early death of Pieter Augustus de Genestet (1830- 1861). Criticism has been
                    represented by W. J. A. Jonckbloet, C. Busken Huet, and Jan ten Brink. With
                    Isaac de Costa (1798-1860), W. J. van Zeggelen, and J. J. L. Ten Kate, the
                    domestic tendency of Cats and Bilderdijk has overpowered the influence of
                    romanticism. An independent writer of great power and charm both in prose and
                    verse is C. Vosmaer, author of a life of Rembrandt, and of a translation of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> into Dutch hexameters. E. Douwes Dekker, in his
                    novel of <hi rend="italic">Max Havelaar,</hi> and Marcellus Emants, in his poem
                    of <hi rend="italic">Lilith,</hi> have displayed talents of a very modern and
                    cosmopolitan order, but it yet remains to be seen whether they have sufficient
                    power to sustain their promise.</p>
                <p>Flemish literature has again come into being since the independence of Belgium,
                    and has produced two writers of &lt; very remarkable talent, the popular poet
                    Karel Ledeganck (1805-47), and the still more popular novelist Hendrik
                    Conscience. But the general use of the French language, although Flemish
                    exercises are encouraged by the Government, has prevented any considerable
                    cultivation of Flemish by modern writers of ambition.</p>
