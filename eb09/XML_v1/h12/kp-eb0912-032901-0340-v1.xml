                    >Hugbaldus</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Hubaldus)</hi> was born in or about
                    840, if we may believe the statement of his biographers to the effect that he
                    died in 930, aged 90. Of his life little is known; not even the place of his
                    birth can be ascertained, but he was no doubt a Frenchman or a Belgian. It is
                    certain that he studied at the convent of St Amand in French Flanders, where his
                    uncle Milo occupied an important position. Hucbald made rapid progress in the
                    acquirement of various sciences and arts, including that of music, and at an
                    early age composed a hymn in honour of St Andrew, which met with such success as
                    to excite the jealousy of his uncle. It is said that Hucbald in consequence was
                    compelled to leave St Amand, and started an independent school of music and
                    other arts at Nevers. In 860, however, we find him at St Germain d’Auxerre, bent
                    upon completing his studies, and in 872 he is back again at St Amand as the
                    successor in the headmastership of the convent school of his uncle, to whom he
                    had been reconciled in the meantime. Between 883 and 900 Hucbald went on several
                    missions of reforming and reconstructing various schools of music, including
                    that of Rheims, but in the latter year he returned to St Amand, where he
                    remained to the day of his death (June 25, 930, or, according to other
                    chroniclers, June 20, 932), and where his most important works on music were
                    written. Of the character of these works and of the reforms and improvements
                    advocated by them it is not easy to give a correct idea; not even their number
                    is sufficiently certain, for some treatises have been attributed to Hucbald
                    which are obviously not his, and others of which the authorship is at least
                    doubtful. His largest and most authentic work is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enchiridion</hi><hi rend="italic">Musicae,</hi> published with other writings
                    of minor importance in the first volume of Gerber’s <hi rend="italic">Scriptores
                    ecclesiastici,</hi> and containing a complete system of musical science as well
                    as instructions regarding notation. Hucbald as a musical theorist may be called
                    a precursor of Guido d’Arezzo, to whose hexachord system his tetrachord, that
                    is, the use of four instead of seven letters, forms a kind of basis. His scales
                    are founded on strictly Greek principles, and cannot be said to mark a decided
                    step in advance; neither is his system of notation much superior to the earlier
                    ones, although here also he seems in a manner to foreshadow Guido’s use of the
                    linesand spaces of the staff from which the modern method took its rise. Of
                    great importance is the 13 th chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Enchiridion,</hi>
                    which treats of the diaphony or organum,—in other words, of singing in parts.
                    Amongst other prescriptions it is curious to find the rule which recommends the
                    use of parallel fifths and fourths, so strictly prohibited by later theorists,
                    while, on the other hand, consecutive thirds, particularly euphonious to the
                    modern ear, are excluded by Hucbald.</p>
                <p>A good account of the monk of St Amand and his system will be found in
                    Coussemaker’s <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur</hi><hi rend="italic">Hucbald,</hi>
                    Paris, 1841; Hawkins <hi rend="italic">(History,</hi> vol. i. p. 153) also gives
                    a short notice of Hucbald, and mentions two epitaphs written in his honour by
                    contemporaries.</p>
