                <p><label type="entry">HORN</label>. The weapons which project from the heads of
                    various species of animals, constituting what are known as horns, embrace
                    substances which are, in their anatomical structure and chemical composition,
                    quite distinct from each other; and although in commerce also they are known
                    indiscriminately as horn, their uses are altogether dissimilar. These
                    differences in structure and properties are thus indicated by Professor Owen
                    “The weapons to which the term horn is properly or technically applied consist
                    of very different substances, and belong to two organic systems, as distinct
                    from each other as both are from the teeth. Thus the horns of deer consist of
                    bone, and are processes of the frontal bone; those of the giraffe are
                    independent bones or ‘epiphyses’ covered by hairy skin; those of oxen, sheep,
                    and antelopes are ‘ apophyses ’ of the frontal bone, covered by the corium and
                    by a sheath of true homy material; those of the prong-horned antelope consist at
                    their basis of bony processes covered by hairy skin, and are covered by horny
                    sheaths in the rest of their extent. They thus combine the character of those of
                    the giraffe and ordinary antelope, together with the expanded and branched form
                    of the antlers of deers. Only the horns of the rhinoceros are composed wholly of
                    horny matter, and this is disposed in longitudinal fibres, so that the horns
                    seem rather to consist of coarse bristles compactly matted together in the form
                    of a more or less elongated sub-compressed cone.” True horny matter is really a
                    modified form of epidermic tissue, and consists of an albuminoid principle
                    termed “keratin.” It forms, not only the horns of the ox tribe, but also the
                    hoofs, claws, or nails of animals generally, the carapace of the tortoises and
                    the armadillo.es, the scales of the pangolin, porcupine quills, and birds’
                    feathers, &amp;c. The principal application of horns is for the manufacture of
                    combs, and under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Comb,</hi> vol. vi. pp.
                    177-78, that industry is described. The other uses to which horn is now devoted,
                    among which may be noted the pressing of buttons, the making of handles for
                    walking-sticks, umbrellas, and knives, the manufacture of drinking-cups, spoons
                    of various kinds, and snuff-boxes, do not here require extended notice. The
                    parings and refuse of horn are valuable for the manufacture of prussiate of
                    potash and as manure; and the ash of the cores of horn makes excellent cupels
                    for the assay of precious metals. In former times horn was applied to several
                    uses for which it is no longer required, although such applications have left
                    their traces in our language. Thus the musical instruments and fog signals known
                    as horns indicate their descent from earlier and simpler forms of apparatus made
                    from horn. Tn the same way powder-horns were spoken of long after they ceased to
                    be made of that substance; to a small extent lanterns still continue to be
                    “glazed” with thin transparent plates of horn, a practice which a century ago
                    was universal. Hornbooks consisted of spelling-books with their leaves protected
                    by thin plates of horn, and it was in former times customary to protect the
                    titles of valuable MSS. in the same way. Deer-horn is almost exclusively used
                    for handles by cutlers and walking-stick and umbrella makers. The largest supply
                    is obtained from the East Indies, and consists principally of the antlers of the
