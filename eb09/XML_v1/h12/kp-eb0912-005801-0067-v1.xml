                    Friedrich</hi></label> (1770- 1843), German poet, was born March 29, 1770, at
                    Lauffen on the Neckar. His mother removing, after a second marriage, to
                    Nürtingen, he began his education at the classical school there, where Schelling
                    was his schoolfellow and playmate. He was destined by his relations for the
                    church, and with this view was later admitted to the free schools of Denkendorf
                    and Maulbronn. At the age of eighteen, already an excellent classical scholar,
                    he was sent to the university of Tübingen, where, however, he showed no
                    inclination to the study of theology. He was already the writer of occasional
                    verses, and had begun to sketch his first version of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hyperion,</hi> when he was introduced in 1793 to Schiller, and obtained through
                    him the post of tutor to the young son of Frau von Kalb. A year later he left
                    this situation to attend Fichte’s lectures, and to become a disciple of Schiller
                    in Jena. Schiller recognized in the young poet something of his own style of
                    genius, and encouraged his early literary attempts by sending some of them to
                    Goethe, and by superintending the publication of others in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thalia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Horen.</hi> In 1796 Hölderlin obtained the
                    post of tutor to the three young children of a banker named Gontard in
                    Frankfort. Gontard’s beautiful and gifted wife is the Diotima of Hölderlin’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Hyperion.</hi> For this lady he conceived a foolish and hopeless
                    passion; and she became at once his inspiration and his ruin. At the end of two
                    years, during which time the first volume of <hi rend="italic">Hyperion</hi> was
                    published (1797), some kind of crisis appears to have occurred in their
                    friendship, for the unhappy young poet suddenly left Frankfort and the Gontard
                    family; but whether he was dismissed by the indignant husband of Diotima, or was
                    impelled by his own better resolutions, has not been explained. In spite of ill
                    health, he now completed <hi rend="italic">Hyperion,</hi> the second volume of
                    which appeared in 1799, and he began a tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tod des Empedokles,</hi> which is published in an unfinished
                    condition among his works. Some of his verses appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taschenbuch für Frauenzimmer</hi><hi rend="italic">va</hi> 1799 and 1800; and
                    he contemplated starting a new literary journal, of which he was to be the
                    editor, but the scheme was a failure. His friends now became alarmed at the
                    alternate depression and nervous irritability from which he suffered, and he was
                    induced to go to Switzerland, as tutor in a family at Haupt will. There his
                    health improved; and several of his poems, among which are “Der blinde
                    Säuger,”“AnDie Hoffnung,” and “Dichter-muth,” were written at this time. In 1801
                    he returned home to arrange for the publication of a volume of his poems; but,
                    on the failure of this enterprise, he was obliged to accept another tutorship in
                    the family of the Hamburg consul in Bordeaux. Diotima died a year later, in June
                    1802, and the news is supposed to have reached Hölderlin shortly afterwards, for
                    in the following month he suddenly left Bordeaux, and travelled homewards on
                    foot through France, arriving at Nürtingen destitute and insane. Kind treatment
                    gradually alleviated his condition, and in lucid intervals he occupied himself
                    by writing verses and translating Greek plays. Two of these translations—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antigone</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oedipus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rex</hi> of Sophocles—appeared in 1804, and several of his short poems were
                    published by Seckendorf in his <hi rend="italic">Musenalmanach,</hi> 1807 and
                    1808. In 1804 Hölderlin obtained the post of librarian to the landgrave of
                    Homburg, and went to live in Homburg under the supervision of friends; but the
                    post was abandoned two years later, and he was taken to Tübingen, where he
                    remained, irremediably but harmlessly insane, till his death, June 7, 1843.</p>
                <p>Hölderlin’s writings are the production of a beautiful and sensitive mind, a mind
                    of high ideals and noble impulses; but they are intensely, almost morbidly,
                    subjective, and they lack real human strength. Perhaps his strongest
                    characteristic was his passion for Greek subjects, and the natural result of
                    this was that he almost entirely discarded rhyme in favour of the ancient verse
                    measures. His poems are all short pieces; of his tragedy only a fragment was
                    written. <hi rend="italic">Hyperion,</hi><hi rend="italic">oder der
                    Eremit</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Griechenland,</hi> is thus
                    his one important work; and even to this a sequel is wanting. It may be called a
                    prose poem, and is written in the form of letters. Its exquisite language, the
                    purity of its tone, the sad philosophical vein which permeates it, together with
                    its autobiographic character, claim for it a unique position among German
                    classics.</p>
                <p>An edition of Hölderlin’s complete works, with his letters and biography,
                    appeared in 1846; and there is a cheap edition of his selected works, with a
                    biography by Christoph Theodor Schwab, published in 1874.</p>
