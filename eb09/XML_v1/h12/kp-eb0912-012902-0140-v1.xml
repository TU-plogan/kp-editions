                    rend="italic">(c.</hi> 1636-1695),painter, was born at Utrecht, it is said,
                    about 1636, and died at Amsterdam, April 3, 1695. Old historians say that, being
                    the grandson of Gillis and son of Gisbert d’Hondecoeter, as well as nephew of J.
                    B. W eenix, he was brought up by the last two to the profession of painting. Of
                    Weenix we know that he married one Josina d’Hondecoeter in 1638. Melchior was,
                    therefore, related to Weenix, who certainly influenced his style. As to Gillis
                    and Gisbert some points still remain obscure, and it is difficult to accept the
                    statement that they stood towards each other in the relation of father and son,
                    since both were registered as painters at Utrecht in 1637. Both it appears had
                    practised art before coming to Utrecht, but where they resided or what they
                    painted is uncertain. Unhappily pictures scarcely help us to clear up the
                    mystery. In the Fürstenberg collection at Donaueschingen there is a Concert of
                    Birds dated 1620, and signed with the monogram G. D. H.; and we may presume that
                    G. D. H. is the man whose Hen and Chickens in a Landscape in the gallery of
                    Rotterdam is inscribed “G. D. Hondecoeter, 1652;” but we ask, Is the first
                    letter of the monogram to stand for Gillis or Gisbert <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi>
                    In the museums of Dresden and Cassel landscapes with sportsmen are catalogued
                    under the name of Gabriel de Heusch (Î), one of them dated 1529, and certified
                    with the monogram G. D. H., challenging attention by resemblance to a canvas of
                    the same class inscribed G. D. Hond. in the Berlin Museum. The question here is
                    also whether G. means Gillis or Gisbert. Obviously there are two artists to
                    consider, one of whom paints birds, the other landscapes and sportsmen. Perhaps
                    the first is Gisbert, whose son Melchior also chose birds as his peculiar
                    subject. Weenix too would naturally teach his nephew to study the feathered
                    tribe. Melchior, however, began his career with a different specialty from that
                    by which he is usually known. Mr de Stuers affirms that he produced sea-pieces.
                    One of his earliest works is a Tub with Fish, dated 1655, in the gallery of
                    Brunswick. But Melchior soon abandoned fish for fowl. He acquired celebrity as a
                    painter of birds only, which he represented not exclusively, like Fyt, as the
                    gamekeeper’s perquisite after a day’s shooting, or stock of a poulterer’s shop,
                    but as living beings with passions, joys, fears, and quarrels, to which
                    naturalists will tell us that birds are subject. Without the brilliant tone and
                    high finish of Fyt, his Dutch rival’s birds are full of action; and, as Bürger
                    truly says, Hondecoeter displays the maternity of the hen with as much
                    tenderness and feeling as Raphael the maternity of Madonnas. But Fyt was at home
                    in depicting the coat of deer and dogs as well as plumage. Hondecoeter
                    cultivates a narrower field, and seldom goes beyond a cock-fight or a display of
                    mere bird life. Very few of his pictures are dated, though more are signed.
                    Amongst the former we should note the Jackdaw deprived of his Borrowed Plumes
                    (1671), at the Hague, of which Earl Cadogan has a variety; or Game and Poultry
                    and a Spaniel hunting a Partridge (1672), in the gallery of Brussels; or a Park
                    with Poultry (1686) at the Hermitage of St Petersburg. Hondecoeter, in great
                    favour with the magnates of the Netherlands, became a member of the painters’
                    academy at the Hague in 1659. William III. employed him to paint his menagerie
                    at Loo, and the picture, now at the Hague museum, shows that he could at a pinch
                    overcome the difficulty of representing India’s cattle, elephants, and gazelles.
                    But he is better in homelier works, with which hfe adorned the royal chateaus of
                    Bensberg and Oranienstein at different periods of his life (Hague and
                    Amsterdam). In 1488 Hondecoeter took the freedom of the city of Amsterdam, where
                    he resided till his death. His earliest works are more conscientious, lighter,
                    and more transparent than his later ones. At all times he is bold of touch and
                    sure of eye, giving the motion of birds with great spirit and accuracy. His
                    masterpieces are at the Hague and at Amsterdam. But there are fine examples in
                    private collections in England, and in the public galleries of Berlin, Caen,
                    Carlsruhe, Cassel, Cologne, Copenhagen, Dresden, Dublin, Florence, Glasgow,
                    Hanover, London, Lyons Montpellier, Munich, Paris, Rotterdam, Rouen, St Peters
                    burg, Stuttgardt, and Vienna.</p>
