                    (1718-1783), a celebrated physiologist and physician, and the first great
                    teacher of anatomy in England, was born May 23, 1718, at East Kilbride, Lanark.
                    He was the seventh child of his parents, and an elder brother of John Hunter,
                    the distinguished surgeon. When fourteen years of age he was sent to the
                    university of Glasgow, where he studied for five years. He had originally been
                    intended for the church, but, scruples concerning subscription arising in his
                    mind, he followed the advice of his friend William Cullen (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cullen,</hi> vol. vi. p. 694), and resolved to devote himself
                    to physic. During 1737-40 he resided with Cullen at Hamilton, and then, with a
                    view to increasing his medical knowledge before settling in partnership with his
                    friend, he spent the winter of 1740- 41 at Edinburgh, and thence went to London.
                    There Dr James Douglas, an anatomist and obstetrician of some note, to whom he
                    had been recommended, engaged his services as a tutor to his son, and as a
                    dissector, and assisted him to enter as a surgeon’s pupil at St George’s
                    Hospital, and to procure the instruction of the anatomist Dr Nicholls. Dr
                    Douglas died in April 1742, but Hunter still continued to live with his family.
                    In 1746 Hunter undertook in place of Mr Samuel Sharpe the delivery, for a
                    society of <pb break="no"

                    operative surgery, and so satisfactorily did he acquit himself of his task that
                    he was requested to include anatomy in his course. It was not long before he
                    attained considerable fame as a lecturer; for not only was his oratorical
                    ability great, but he differed from his contemporaries in the fulness and
                    thoroughness of his teaching, and in the care which he took to provide for his
                    hearers the best possible practical illustrations of his discourses. We read
                    that the syllabus of MrNourse, published in 1748, “totam rem anatomicam
                    complectens,” comprised only twenty-three lectures, exclusive of a short and
                    defective “Syllabus Chirurgicus,” and that at “one of the most reputable courses
                    of anatomy in Europe,” which Hunter had himself attended, the professor was
                    obliged to demonstrate all the parts of the body, except the nerves and vessels
                    (shown in a foetus) and the bones, on a single dead subject, and for the
                    explanation of the operations of surgery used a dog! In 1747 Hunter became a
                    member of the Corporation of Surgeons. In the course of a tour through Holland
                    to Paris with his pupil J. Douglas in 1728, he visited Albinus at Leyden, and
                    inspected with admiration his injected preparations. By degrees Hunter renounced
                    surgical for obstetric practice, in which he excelled. He was appointed a
                    surgeon-accoucheur at the Middlesex Hospital in 1748, and at the British
                    Lying-in Hospital in the year following. The degree of M.D. was conferred upon
                    him by the university of Glasgow, October 24, 1750. About the same time he left
                    his old abode at Mrs Douglas’s, and settled as a physician in Jermyn Street. He
                    became a licentiate of the College of Physicians, September 30, 1756. In 1762 he
                    was consulted by Queen Charlotte, and in 1764 was made physician-extraordinary
                    to her Majesty.</p>
                <p>On the departure of his brother John for the army, Hunter engaged as an assistant
                    Mr William Hewson, whom he subsequently admitted to partnership in his lectures.
                    Hewson was succeeded in 1770 by Mr Cruikshank. Hunter became in 1767 a fellow of
                    the Royal Society; in 1768 a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and third
                    professor of anatomy to the Royal Academy of Arts; and in 1780 and 1782
                    respectively an associate of the Royal Medical Society and of the Royal Academy
                    of Sciences of Paris. During the closing ten years of his life his health failed
                    greatly. His last lecture, at the conclusion of which he fainted, was given,
                    contrary to the remonstrances of friends, only a few days before his death,
                    which took place March 30, 1783. He was buried in the rector’s vault at St
                    James’s, Piccadilly.</p>
                <p>Hunter had in 1765 requested of the Hon. Mr Grenville the grant of a plot of
                    ground on which he might establish “a museum in London for the improvement of
                    anatomy, surgery, and physic” (see “Papers” at end of his <hi rend="italic">Two
                    Introductory Lectures,</hi> 1784), and had offered to expend on its erection
                    £7000, and to endow in perpetuity a professorship of anatomy in connexion with
                    it. His application receiving no recognition, he after many months abandoned his
                    scheme, and built himself a house, with lecture and dissecting-rooms, in Great
                    Windmill Street, whither he removed in 1770. In one fine apartment in this house
                    was accommodated his collection, comprising anatomical and pathological
                    preparations, ancient coins and medals, minerals, shells, and corals. His
                    natural history specimens were in part a purchase, for £1200, of the executors
                    of his friend Dr John Fothergill (see vol. ix. p. 475). Hunter’s whole
                    collection, together with his fine library of Greek and Latin classics, and an
                    endowment of £8000, by his will became, after the lapse of twenty years, the
                    property of the university of Glasgow. His paternal estate of Long Calderwood
                    was left to his brother-in-law, Dr James Baillie, by whom, as soon as the will
                    was proved, it was made over to John Hunter. Hunter was never married, and was a
                    man of frugal habits. Like his brother John, he was an early riser, and a man of
                    untiring industry. He is described as being in his lectures, which were of two
                    hours’ duration, “both simple and profound, minute in demonstration, and yet the
                    reverse of dry and tedious ;” and his mode of introducing anecdotal
                    illustrations of his topic was most happy. Lecturing was to him a pleasure, and,
                    notwithstanding his many professional distractions, he regularly continued it,
                    because, as he said, he “conceived that a man may do infinitely more good to the
                    public by teaching his art than by practising it” (see “Memorial” appended to
                    <hi rend="italic">Introd. Lect.,</hi> p. 120).</p>
                <p>Hunter was the author of several contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Medical
                    Observations and Enquiries</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions.</hi> In his paper on the structure of cartilages and joints,
                    published in the latter in 1743, he anticipated what Bichat sixty years
                    afterwards wrote concerning the structure and arrangement of the synovial
                    membranes. His <hi rend="italic">Medical Commentaries</hi> (pt,i., 1762,
                    supplemented 1764) contains, among other like matter, details of his disputes
                    with the Munros as to who first had successfully performed the injection of the
                    <hi rend="italic">tubuli</hi><hi rend="italic">testis</hi> (in which, however,
                    both he and they had been forestalled by Haller in 1745), and as to who had
                    discovered the true office of the lymphatics <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi> vol. i. p. 815), and also a discussion on the
                    question whether he or Pott ought to be considered the earliest to have
                    elucidated the nature of <hi rend="italic">hernia congenita,</hi> which, as a
                    matter of fact, had been previously explained by Haller. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> is exhibited Hunter’s one weakness—an inordinate
                    love of controversy. His impatience of contradiction he averred to be a
                    characteristic of anatomists, in whom he once jocularly condoned it, on the plea
                    that “the passive submission of dead bodies” rendered the crossing of their will
                    the less bearable. His great work, <hi rend="italic">The Anatomy of the Gravid
                    Uterus, exhibited in Figures,</hi> fol. (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi>
                    vol. i. p. 816), was published in 1774. His posthumous works are <hi
                    rend="italic">Two Introductory Lectures,</hi> 1784, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatomical Description of the Human Gravid Uterus,</hi> 1794, which was
                    re-edited by Dr Rigby in 1843.</p>
