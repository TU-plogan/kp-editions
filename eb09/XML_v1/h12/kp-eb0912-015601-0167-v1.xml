                    counties of England, but is believed not to be native in Scotland. On the
                    Continent it is distributed from Greece to Scandinavia, and extends through the
                    Caucasus and Central Asia to the Altai Mountains. It is common, but doubtfully
                    indigenous, in the northern and western States of North America, and has been
                    introduced into Brazil, Australia, and the Himalayas.</p>
                <p>It is a dioecious perennial plant, producing annually several long twining
                    roughish striated stems, which twist from left to right, are often 15 to 20 feet
                    long, and climb freely over hedges and bushes. The leaves are stalked, opposite,
                    3-5 lobed, and coarsely serrate, and bear a general resemblance to those of the
                    vine, but are, as well as the whole plant, rough to the touch; the upper leaves
                    are sometimes scarcely divided,.or quite entire. The stipules are interpetiolar,
                    each consisting of two lateral ones united, or rarely with the tips free. The
                    male inflorescence (fig. 1, A) forms a panicle; the flowers consist of a small
                    greenish five parted perianth <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> enclosing five stamens,
                    whose anthers (ά) open by terminal slits. The female inflorescence (fig. 1, B)
                    is less conspicuous in the young state. The catkin or strobile consists of a
                    number of small acute bracts, with two sessile ovaries at their base, each
                    subtended by a rounded bractlet (c). Both the bracts and bractlets enlarge
                    greatly during the development of the ovary, and form, when fully grown, the
                    membranous scales of the strobile (fig. 2, a). The bracts can then only be
                    distinguished from the bractlets by being rather more acute and more strongly
                    veined. The perianth (fig. 1, tZ) is short, cup-shaped, undivided, and closely
                    applied to the ovary, which it ultimately encloses. In the young strobile the
                    two purple hairy styles <hi rend="italic">(e)</hi> of each ovary project beyond
                    the bracts. The ovary contains a single exalbuminous seed, containing a
                    spirally-coiled embryo (fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">b).</hi></p>
                <p>The ovary and the base of the bracts are covered with a yellowish powder,
                    consisting of minute sessile grains (see vol. iv. p. 91, fig. 48) called lupulin
                    or lupulinic glands (see vol. i. p. 381). These glands (fig. 2, c) are stated by
                    Stoddart to be from - <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ^- <hi rend="subscript">
                    σ</hi> to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ∣ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> inch in
                    diameter, like flattened subovate little saucers in shape, and attached to a
                    short pedicel; by the expansion of the central portion during growth their apex
                    ultimately becomes convex instead of concave. The upper or hemispherical portion
                    consists of a delicate continuous membrane, and the lower part of tabular
                    polyhedric cells. The stalk is not perceptible in the gland as found in
                    commerce. When fresh the gland is seen to be filled with a yellowish or dark
                    brown liquid; this on drying contracts in bulk and forms a central mass. The
                    contents of these glands, according to Lermer, are chiefly wax (myricylic
                    palmitate) and resins, one of which is crystalline and unites with bases; with
                    these the bitter acid of hops is present in small proportion. It is to these
                    lupulinic glands that the medicinal properties of the hop are chiefly due. By
                    careful sifting, about 1 oz. may be obtained from 1 lb of hops, but the East
                    Kent variety is said to yield more than the Sussex hops.</p>
                <p>In hop gardens a few male plants, usually three or four to an acre, are sometimes
                    planted, that number being deemed sufficient to fertilize the female flowers. It
                    is stated, however, that the female plant produces sufficient male flowers for
                    self-fertilization (Royle). The blossoms are produced in August, and the
                    strobiles are fit for gathering from the beginning of September to the middle of
                    October, according to the weather.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of hops for use in the manufacture of beer dates from an early
                    period. In the 8th and 9th centuries hop gardens, called “humularia” or
                    “humuleta,” existed in France and Germany. In the herbarium of Λpuleius (1050
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> the hop (“hymele”) is said to have been put in
                    the usual drinks of England on account of its good qualities. Until the 16th
                    century, however, hops appear to have been grown in a very fitful manner, and to
                    a limited extent, generally only for private consumption; but after the
                    commencement of the 17 th century the cultivation increased rapidly. At the
                    present time England <pb break="no"

                    in Europe. Formerly several plants were used as well as hops to season ale,
                    hence the name “alehoof” for <hi rend="italic">Hepeta Glechoma,</hi> and
                    “alecost” for <hi rend="italic">Balsαmita vulgaris.</hi> The sweet gale, <hi
                    rend="italic">Myrica</hi><hi rend="italic">Gale,</hi> and the sage, <hi
                    rend="italic">Salvia οffi,cinalis,</hi> were also similarly employed. Various
                    hop substitutes, in the form of powder, have been offered in commerce of late
                    years, most of which appear to have quassia as a chief ingredient.</p>
                <p>The young tender tops of the hop are in Belgium cut off in spring and eaten like
                    asparagus, and are forced from December to February. They are not only
                    considered a delicacy, but valuable as a diet for anaemic, scrofulous, and
                    rachitic persons.</p>
                <p>Hops are extensively cultivated in parts of New England, New York, and Michigan,
                    and most of the hops consumed in the United States are supplied by those
                    districts. Although the hop was introduced into America nearly 250 years ago,
                    and its cultivation encouraged by legislative enactments in 1657, it is only
                    about seventy-five years since its culture was commenced on an extensive scale;
                    but from that time the progress has been rapid, and hops have been grown in
                    nearly every State in the Union. The amount produced in the United States was
                    estimated in 1840 at 6196 bales, in 1850 at 17,485, in 1860 at 54,960, and in
                    18/0 at 127,283. As in England, the hop is subject to disease and blight, and in
                    consequence the crop is variable; thus, in 1869, 69,463 bales were exported from
                    New York and none imported, and in 1873 only 315 bales were exported and 20,885
                    imported. The English cluster and grape hops seem to be most generally
                    cultivated in New York and Wisconsin. Hops are also grown largely in Belgium,
                    Prussia, France, Wiirtemberg, and central Germany. In 1879 only 7153 cwts. of
                    hops were exported from England chiefly to Australia and other British
                    possessions, while 262,765 cwts. were imported, of which 108,306 cwts. were
                    derived from the United States, 63,485 cwts. from Belgium, 50,567 from Germany,
                    26,796 from Holland, and smaller quantities from France and British North
                    America. The first packages of hops collected in England often fetch an
                    extravagant price, and are sometimes disposed of with remarkable celerity. The
                    first pocket of hops gathered in 1879 is said to have been picked, dried, sent
                    to London, sold by auction, subjected to hydraulic pressure, packed and banded
                    with iron, covered with three coats of paint, and despatched to an Indian mail
                    steamer—all within twenty-four hours. The better qualities are usually packed in
                    fine and the inferior in coarse sacking. In Germany two varieties of the hop are
                    distinguished, the August and the autumn hop, the former being preferred.</p>
                <p>The stem of the hop abounds in fibre similar to that of hemp and flax, and has
                    been used in Sweden in the production of a strong durable white cloth. Hitherto
                    it has been usual to steep the stem in water during the whole winter in order to
                    separate the fibre easily. A much quicker process has, however, been patented,
                    by which the fibre can be speedily extracted. This process consists in boiling
                    the stems first for three quarters of an hour in alkaline lye, and then, after
                    rinsing in water, for the same time in acetic acid; the fibre is thus obtained
                    in a state fit for bleaching. The leaves, stem, and root possess also an
                    astringent property, and their use for tanning purposes was hence at one time
                    patented in England. The leaves have also been recommended as fodder in the
                    fresh state, mixed with other materials, and are said to increase the quantity
                    and improve the quality of milk yielded by cows. The stems or “bine” are usually
                    burned in the hop garden. The spent hops from breweries form excellent manure
                    for light soils, and together with the leaves should be returned to the
                    hop-gardens, the materials absorbed from the ground by the hop plant being thus
                    in some measure restored to it.</p>
                <p>By distillation with water, hops yield 0 ’ 9 per cent, of a volatile oil, of a
                    greenish colour if from fresh, but reddish-brown if from old hops. Exposed to
                    the air it resinifies. This oil, according to Personne, contains <hi
                    rend="italic">valerol,</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> O, which soon passes into valerianic acid, 0 ’ 1 to
                    047 of this acid having been found by Méhu in the lupulinic glands. The
                    unpleasant odour of old hops is due to this change, which may be prevented or
                    retarded by exposure to the action of sulphurous acid gas. For medicinal use
                    fresh hops which have neither undergone this change nor been treated with
                    sulphurous acid should be used. For brewing purposes, according to Liebig, the
                    use of sulphured hops is not objectionable. The bitter acid principle, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 32</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 50</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"

                    Payen, was first obtained in the pure state by Lermer in 1863. It crystallizes
                    in large rhombic prisms, and is soluble in ether. It has been variously called
                    lupulin, ]upuline, lupulite, and humulin. Griessmayer (1874) has shown that hops
                    contain also in small proportion a liquid volatile alkaloid, not yet analysed,
                    which has the odour of conia; to this alkaloid its narcotic property is perhaps
                    due. The same chemist found tri methylamine in hops. Etti (1876-78) has found in
                    the scales of the hop strobiles an astringent principle, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The use of hops in medicine dates from a very early period. Coles, in <hi
                    rend="italic">}As,History of Plants</hi> (1657), says—“They are good to cleanse
                    the kidneys of gravel and provoke urine; they likewise open obstructions of the
                    liver and spleen, and cleanse the blood and loosen the belly; and as they
                    cleanse the blood, so consequently they help to cure eruptions of the skin.”
                    Brooke’s <hi rend="italic">Dispensatory^</hi> 1753)recommends them also as an
                    alterative, and as a remedy for hypochondriasis. Hops are, however, but little
                    used in medicine at the present day, although official in the British and United
                    Stites Pharmacopoeias. According to Bartholow hops increase the action of the
                    heart, excite the cutaneous circulation, and cause diaphoresis. A slight
                    cerebral excitement is first produced, soon followed by a disposition to sleep.
                    Hops also possess some anaphrodisiac properties. The preparations used are the
                    tincture, infusion, and extract, the oleoresin, and the lupulinic glands. The
                    drug is generally employed either as a stomachic in dyspepsia, or to allay
                    nervous irritability or cerebral excitement in delirium tremens, where the use
                    of opium is inadmissible. A combination of the tinctures of lupulin and capsicum
                    is said to be one of the best substitutes for alcoholic stimulants when their
                    habitual use is to be discontinued. A pillow stuffed with hops forms a
                    well-known domestic remedy for sleeplessness, and a bag of hops dipped in hot
                    water is often used as an external application to relieve pain or inflammation,
                    especially of the abdominal organs.</p>
