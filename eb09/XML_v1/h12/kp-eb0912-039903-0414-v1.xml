                    Staffordshire, where his father was a farmer, on January 13, 1720. He received
                    his early education at the grammar school of Brewood, in his native county, and
                    made such progress in his studies that in October 1733 he was admitted a sizar
                    of Emmanuel College, Oxford; he did not begin residence, however, till a year or
                    two afterwards. In 1739 he took the degree of B.A., and in 1742 he was ordained
                    deacon, and for a short time had charge of the parish of Reymerston, between
                    Thetford and Norwich; but, having in the same year proceeded M.A. and been
                    elected fellow of his college, he returned to Cambridge early in 1743. While
                    residing there he was ordained priest in 1744, and in 1748 he published his <hi

                    fully proved the title of its author to “the great but prostituted name of
                    critic,” and may still be read with interest, less, however, as an exposition of
                    the original than as containing “a more valuable and better digested collection
                    of criticisms than Horace ever wrote or intended to write.” In 1750 Hurd was,
                    through the recommendation of his friend Warburton, appointed one of the
                    preachers at Whitehall; and in 1751 he published <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Horatii Flacci</hi><hi rend="italic">Epist. ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Augustum,</hi><hi rend="italic">with an English Commentary and
                    Notes,</hi> justly held by Gibbon to be superior in merit to the edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1756 he accepted the college living of Thurcaston, Leicestershire, in the
                    studious retirement of which he wrote and published a volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertations (“</hi> On the Province of the Drama,” “On Poetical
                    Imitation,” and “On the Marks of Imitation,” 1757), and another entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Moral and Political Dialogues</hi> (“On Sincerity in the Commerce
                    of the World,” “On Retirement,” “On the Age of Queen Elizabeth,” and “On the
                    Constitution of the English Government,” 1759). The latter has proved the most
                    popular of his writings, and was chiefly instrumental in procuring for him at a
                    later period of his life the royal favour. In 1766 he was appointed preacher of
                    Lincoln’s Inn, and in 1767 he became archdeacon of Gloucester; his elevation to
                    the see of Lichfield and Coventry followed in 1774, and in 1776 he was selected
                    to be preceptor of the prince of Wales and the duke of York. In 1781 he was
                    translated to Worcester, and in 1783, on the death of Dr Cornwallis, he was
                    pressed to accept the primacy, but declined it as “a charge not suited to his
                    temper and talents, and much too heavy for him to sustain, especially in these
                    times.” He died May 28, 1808.</p>
                <p>Besides various sermons, charges, and other compositions of a more or less
                    occasional character, Hurd published, in addition to the works already
                    mentioned, a <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Delicacy of Friendship</hi>
                    (1755), a severe attack on Jortin, by whom Warburton had been assailed; <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters on Chivalry and Romance</hi> (1762); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertation on the Idea of Universal Poetry</hi> (1762); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialogues on Foreign Travel</hi> (1764); and <hi rend="italic">Discourse by way
                    of Preface to the Quarto edition of Bishop Warburton's Works, containing some
                    Account of the Life, Writings, and Character of the Author</hi> (1794). <hi
                    rend="italic">Remarks on Hume's Natural History of Religion</hi> (1757), a
                    controversial tract which caused considerable irritation to that philosopher,
                    was the joint production of Hurd and Warburton. The collected works of Hurd
                    appeared in an edition of 8 vols. 8vo, in 1811; his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi> by Kilvert, were published in 1860.</p>
