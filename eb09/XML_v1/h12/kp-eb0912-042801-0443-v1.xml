                    (“the Territory of the NizArn ”), an extensive realm of Southern India. This
                    territory, inclusive of the Hyderabad Assigned Districts, known as Berar, lies
                    between 15° 10' to 21° 4Γ N. lat., and 74° 40' to 81° 31' E. long., and is 475
                    miles in length from south-west to north-east, and about the same distance in
                    breadth. The area of Berar is 17,728 square miles, and of the NizAm’s
                    Territories 80,000 square miles,—the total area of the whole state being about
                    "98,000 square miles. It is bounded N. and N.E. by the Central Provinces, and S.
                    and S.E. by territory subject to the presidency of Madras, and W. by territory
                    subject to the presidency of Bombay. The Country of the NizAm presents much
                    variety of surface and feature. In some parts it is mountainous, wooded, and
                    picturesque, in others flat and undulating. The champaign lands are of all
                    descriptions, including many rich and fertile plains, much good land not yet
                    brought under cultivation, and numerous tracts too sterile ever to be
                    cultivated. The geological formations are on a large scale: in the north-west
                    the formations are volcanic, consisting principally of trap, but in some parts
                    of basalt; in the middle, southern, and south-western parts the country is
                    overlaid with gneissic formations. In the valley of the Wardha there are
                    coal-fields; the quality of the coal is inferior, but good enough for railway
                    purposes. Quarries of excellent limestone are worked for a considerable distance
                    along the line of the NizAm’s State Railway. The territory is well watered,
                    τivers being numerous, and tanks or artificial pieces of water very abundant.
                    The principal rivers are—the OodAvari, with its tributaries the Dudna, the
                    Manjira, and Pranhita; the Wardha, with its tributaries the PengangA and
                    WaingangA; and the Kistna, with its tributary the Tungabhadra. Many other
                    streams (considerable rivers during the annual periodical rains) are discharged
                    into these main channels of drainage. The climate may be considered in general
                    good; and as there are no arid, bare deserts, thehot winds are less felt. In the
                    vicinity of Hyderabad city, the annual mean temperature in the shade is 81° F.,
                    and the annual rainfall is estimated at 28 to 32 inches.</p>
                <p>The soil is in general fertile, though in some parts it consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">chilka,</hi> a red and gritty mould, little fitted for purposes of
                    agriculture. A low jungle springs up in any ground left uncultivated even for a
                    year or two, and in process of time is enlivened by the growth of numerous
                    trees. The principal crops are rice, wheat, maize, <hi rend="italic"
                    >jodr,</hi><hi rend="italic">bàjra,</hi><hi rend="italic">rdgi,</hi> oil-seeds
                    of various kinds, fruits and garden produce in great variety, cotton, indigo,
                    sugar-cane, and tobacco. Silk, the material known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >tusser,</hi> the produce of a wild species of worm, is utilized on a large
                    scale. Lac, suitable for use as a resin or dye, gums, and oils are found in
                    great quantities. Hides, raw and tanned, are articles of some importance in
                    commerce. The chief mart for Deccan-bred horses, adapted for military or general
                    purposes, is at a fair at Malegaon in the Bedar district. There is also a horse
                    bazaar near the capital, which is resorted to by merchants from almost every
                    quarter of Asia.</p>
                <p>The principal exports are cotton, oil-seeds, country cloths, hides, metal ware,
                    and agricultural produce; the imports are salt, grain, timber, European piece
                    goods, and hardware. Among the manufactures of the country may be mentioned the
                    ornamental ware of Bedar, the gold embroidered cloths of Aurangabad, Gulbarga,
                    and other towns, and the excellent paper of different kinds which is made by the
                    inhabitants of Kaghazpur, near the fortress of Daulatâbâd. Several railway lines
                    pass through the state. The line connecting Bombay with Madras traverses the
                    south-western part; the Great Indian Peninsula Railway runs the line as far as
                    Ratchur, where it is joined by the Madras Railway; and from Wadi the Nizam’s
                    State Railway branches off to Hyderabad and Secunderabad. The three principal
                    roads in the state all pass through Hyderabad city.</p>
                <p>No census of the population has been attempted in Hyderabad territory, with the
                    exception of Berar or the Assigned Districts. But the population in the Nizam’s
                    Territory has been estimated at 9,000,000 persons. In the different parts of the
                    territory the Marathi, the Kanarese, and the Telugu languages are spoken. The
                    Marhattas are most numerous in the west. The Musâlmans are chiefly to be met
                    with in the capital, and everywhere in the service of Government. In addition
                    there is a large admixture of Parsis, Sikhs, Arabs, Rohillas, aborigines, and
                    others. The revenue of the Nizam’s Territories, including Berar, may be stated
                    in round numbers at 40,000,000 rupees (say £4,000,000), including receipts from
                    all sources. About two-thirds of the above large sum is collected by the nizâm’s
                    own Government from tracts under British rule. The remaining one-third is
                    realized by British officers, principally from Berar. The native Government has
                    a mint situated at Hyderabad, and a currency of its own. It issues a
                    rupee,—namely, the <hi rend="italic">hali sicca,</hi> or “rupee of the
                    period.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The fortunes of the family of the nizâm were
                    founded by Kamr-ud-din Asaf Jah, a distinguished soldier of the emperor
                    Aurangzeb, who in 1713 was appointed Nizâm-ul·Mulk (Regulator of the State) and
                    Subahdàr of the Deccan, but eventually threw off the control of the Delhi court.
                    Asaf Jah died in 1748, and the right of accession to his power and authority was
                    contested by his descendants. The claimants most favoured were two; the one,
                    Naar Jang, a son of the deceased ruler, secured the support of the English, the
                    other Muzaffar Jang, a grandson, was supported by the French. After a brief
                    period of contest Muzaffar Jang became the prisoner of his rival, who, however,
                    soon perished by the hands of some of his followers, and Muzaffar Jang was
                    proclaimed subahdârof the Deccan. He, too, soon perished in a fray with some
                    Pathan chiefs, so the seat of power was now unoccupied. Two brothers of Nasir
                    Jang now claimed the dignity, but the contest was averted by the sudden death of
                    Ghazi-ud-din, the elder brother. The English and French continued a struggle for
                    power and influence in the Deccan, but the latter had to withdraw from the
                    support of Salabat Jang, through the danger threatening their own possessions
                    from the victories gained by Clive. In 1761 this weak prince was dethroned by
                    his younger brother Nizam Ali, who afterwards put him to death. In 1765 he
                    ravaged the Carnatic, but retired on the approach of a British force. Still the
                    British Government was anxious to be on better terms with him, partly from a
                    desire to obtain his concurrence to their retention of a maritime district known
                    as the Northern Circars, which they now occupied. In 1766 a treaty was concluded
                    by which, on condition of a gift of the Circars, the British Government agreed
                    to support the nizâm, Who on his part engaged to assist the British with his
                    troops. In 1790, on the breaking out of a war with Tippoo, son of Hyder Ali
                    Khân, a treaty of offensive and defensive alliance was concluded between the
                    nizâm, the peshwâ, and the British Government. Tippoo purchased peace (1792) at
                    the price of half his dominions, and the nizâm had no reason to be dissatisfied
                    with his share of the spoil. On the fall of Seringapatam and the death of Tippoo
                    Sultân, the nizâm participated largely in the division of territory, under the
                    treaty of 1799, and his share was increased on the peshwâ’s withdrawal from the
                    treaty. In 1800 the subsidiary force with the nizâm was further augmented, and
                    the pecuniary payment for its maintenance was commuted for a cession of
                    territory. This territory is known to the present time under the title of the
                    Ceded Districts. By the treaty of 1853 the nizâm still retained the full use of
                    the subsidiary force and contingent, but was released from the unlimited
                    obligation of service in time of war; and the contingent ceased to be part of
                    the nizâm’s army, and became an auxiliary force kept up by the British
                    Government for the nizâm’s use. In 1857, when the mutiny had broken out, the
                    state of Hyderabad and the nizâm’s dominions became critical; and an attack,
                    which was repulsed, was made upon the residency. The Hyderabad contingent
                    displayed its loyalty in the field against the rebels. In 1860 a fresh treaty
                    was made by which the territorial acquisitions of the nizâm were increased, a
                    debt of 50 lâkhs of rupees was cancelled, and assigned districts in Berar,
                    making up a gross revenue of 3,200,000 rupees (say £320,000), were taken in
                    trust by the British Government. The nizâm is the principal Mahometan ruler in
                    India, and is entitled to a salute of twenty-one guns.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hyderabad,</hi> the chief city and capital of the above
                    state, is situated in 17° 21' 45" N. lat. and 78° 30' 10" E. long., on the river
                    Musi, and stands at a height of about 1700 feet above sea level. No census of
                    the population has been taken, but it has been estimated at 200,000. The scenery
                    around Hyderabad is wild and picturesque, the country being hilly and dotted
                    with numerous granite peaks and isolated rocks. Approached from the west, the
                    appearance of the city is very striking,—the palace, the mosques, and the
                    magnificent pile of buildings erected for the British residency towering above
                    the outer wall. A large lake, a few miles south of Hyderabad, covering an area
                    of 10,000 acres, supplies the town with water. The palace of the nizâm, the
                    mosques, and the British residency are the principal buildings. The palace has
                    no pretensions to splendour, but is of considerable size. Hyderabad is a great
                    Mahometan stronghold, and contains several mosques. The Jamâ Masjid or
                    “cathedral” mosque, so called after the one at Mecca from which it is designed,
                    is large, and is crowned by minarets of an extraordinary height. In the environs
                    of Hyderabad there are many fine gardens with gorgeous pavilions; that of the
                    nizâm’s minister has long been celebrated for its beauty. One of the most
                    interesting places is the college, or <hi rend="italic">Châr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Minar</hi> (so called from its four minarets), built upon four
                    grand arches at which the four principal streets of the city meet. Above are
                    several stories of rooms, and formerly each story was devoted to a science. On
                    the north side of the Musi is an extensive suburb known as the Begam or
                    “Princess” bazaar. The British residency is in this quarter, and communication
                    between it and the palace of the nizâm is maintained by a fine bridge. The
                    residency is a very handsome building, and is remarkable as having been raised
                    entirely by native workmen. It stands in ornamental pleasure grounds enclosed by
                    a wall with two gateways. The staircase is the handsomest in India, each step
                    being a single block of the finest granite. The principal private residence in
                    the city is the palace of the <hi rend="italic">Bara Dari,</hi> or “Twelve
                    Doors,” which is now occupied by the minister of the nizâm, Sir Sâlar Jang.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Hyderabad was founded in 1589, by Kutab Shah
                    Muhammad Kuli, a descendant of Sultan Kuli Kutab Shah, the founder of the
                    dynasty at Golconda in 1512. Muhammad Kuli removed the seat of government on
                    account of its want of water and consequent unhealthiness, and built a new city
                    on the banks of the Musi river, 7 miles from his former capital. He called it
                    <hi rend="italic">Bhdgnαgαr,</hi> “Fortunate City,” from his favourite mistress,
                    Bhagmati; but after her death he named it Hyderabad. The history of Golconda and
                    of Hyderabad after 1589 are almost identical. Soon after establishing himself in
                    his new metropolis, Muhammad Kuli carried on an aggressive war with the
                    neighbouring Hindu râjâs. He extended his conquests south of the Kistna river;
                    the strong fortress of Gandikota was captured; and the town of Cuddapah was
                    sacked. His troops penetrated to the frontiers of Bengal, and Muhammad Kuli
                    defeated the ràjâ of Orissa and subjugated the Northern Circars. In 1603 an
                    ambassador from the king of Persia arrived with a ruby studded crown and other
                    magnificent gifts. When he returned six years afterwards, he was accompanied by
                    an officer of the court of Hyderabad, bearingreturn presents. In 1611 Muhammad
                    Kuli died, after a most prosperous reign of thirty-four years. The principal
                    memorials of this monarch are the palace and gardens of Ilahi Mahal, the
                    Muhammadi gardens, the palace of Nabat Ghat, and the Jama Masjid or “cathedral
                    ’’ mosque. During his reign nearly £3,000,000 was expended on public works, and
                    £24,000 was distributed every year among the poor.</p>
                <p>Muhammad Kuli was succeeded by his son, Sultan Abdullah Kutab Shah. Mir
                    Juml&lt;4, the prime minister, whose son had involved him in a dispute with the
                    court, finding himself unable to obtain favour from his own sovereign,
                    determined to throw himself on the protection of the Mughal emperor. Shah Jahan,
                    espousing his cause, issued a mandate to Abdullah to redress the complaints of
                    his minister; but Abdullah was so incensed that he sequestrated Mir Jumla’s
                    property, and committed his son to prison. Shah Jahan now despatched Aurangzeb,
                    his son, to carry his demands into effect by force of arms. Abdullah Kutab Shah
                    was preparing an entertainment for Aurangzeb’s reception, when he suddenly
                    advanced as an enemy, and took the king so completely by surprise that he had
                    only time to flee to the hill-fort of Golconda, whilst Hyderabad fell into the
                    hands of the Mughals, and was plundered and half burned before the troops could
                    be brought into order. Abdullah did all in his power to negotiate reasonable
                    terms, but the Mughals were inexorable, and he was at last forced to accept the
                    severe conditions imposed on him.</p>
                <p>Abdullah died in 1672, and was succeeded by his son-in-law Abu Husain, who in his
                    youth had been notorious for dissipated habits. He fell entirely under the
                    influence of a Marhatta Brahman, named Madhuna Panth, who became his prime
                    minister. During this reign Aurangzeb again marched upon the city. The king shut
                    himself in the fort of Golconda, and Hyderabad was again left open to plunder.
                    Madhuna Panth was killed in a popular tumult, and the king accepted such terms
                    as he could obtain. A payment of £2,000,000 sterling in money and jewels was
                    demanded. In 1687 Aurangzeb formally declared war against Abù Husain. The king
                    bravely defended the fort of Golconda, but lost it by treachery, and was sent a
                    captive to Daulatâbâd, where he resided until his death. Abd Husain was a very
                    popular monarch, and many anecdotes of his virtue are still current in the
                    Deccan. Aurangzeb immediately took possession of all the territories of Bijäpur
                    and Golconda, but his occupation was little more than military.</p>
                <p>No event of any importance occurred at Hyderabad until 1707, the year of
                    Aurangzeb’s death, when a dispute for the crown took place. His son, Prince
                    Muazim, was victorious, and ascended the throne as Bahadur Shah. After he made a
                    truce with the Mariettas, affairs in the Deccan remained quiet until the end of
                    his reign, in 1712. His death was followed by struggles amongst his sons. A
                    battle ensued; Azim-ush-Shan was slain, and Jalandhar Shah remained master of
                    the throne. Among those he could not get into his power was Farnιkh Siyyar, the
                    only son of Azim-ush-Shan; but the cause of this prince was espoused by the
                    governor of Behar, Sayyid Husain Ali. The rivals met near Agra; and on the 1st
                    January 1713 Farrukh Siyyar ascended the throne, and conferred dignities upon
                    all his adherents. Among these was Chin-Kilich Khan, to whom was given the title
                    of Nizâm-ul-Mulk Asaf Jâh, and Sayyid Husain All was appointed viceroy of the
                    Deccan. In 1719 Husain Alt and Sayyid Abdullah Khan, his brother, advanced upon
                    Delhi, and soon their troops took possession of the royal citadel· and palace.
                    Farrukh Siyyar was deposed, and two months later put to death. The Sayyids now
                    (1719) selected Muhammad Shah, who was the last emperor that sat on the Peacock
                    throne of Shah Jahan. In 1720 Husain All was assassinated, and at the end of the
                    year Abdullah Khan was defeated and taken prisoner by Muhammad Shah; but the
                    power of this monarch was fast declining. In 1722 Chin-Kilich Khan, also called
                    Asaf Jâh, arrived at Delhi, and assumed the office of vizier. In 1723 he
                    resigned his post, and set off for the Deccan, a proceeding amounting to a
                    declaration of independence. The emperor sent orders to Mobariz, the local
                    governor of Hyderabad to assume the government of the entire Deccan. Asaf was
                    forced to come to open war, and soon gained a decisive victory over Mobariz, who
                    lost his life in the battle, fought in October 1724. He then fixed his residence
                    at Hyderabad, and became the founder of an independent kingdom, now ruled over
                    by his descendants, who derive from him the title of the Nizams of Hyderabad
                    state.</p>
