                <p><label type="entry">URBAN IL</label> (Eudes or Odo), pope from 1088 to 1099, was
                    born of knightly rank, at Lagery (near Châtillon-sur-Marne), and was educated
                    for the church. He had already become archdeacon of Rheims when, under the
                    influence of St Bruno, his teacher, he resigned his preferment and entered the
                    cloister at Cluny, where he rose to be prior. In 1078 Gregory VII. summoned him
                    to Italy, and made him cardinal-bishop of Ostia. He was one of the most
                    prominent and energetic supporters of Hildebrandism, especially as legate in
                    Germany in 1084, and was among the few whom Gregory nominated as possible
                    successors. Desiderius of Monte Casino (Victor III.) was chosen in the first
                    instance to the difficult post, but at the next vacancy Odo was elected by
                    acclamation (March 1088) at a small meeting of cardinals and other prelates held
                    in Terracina. He frankly took up the policy of his great predecessor, but while
                    pursuing it with equal determination showed greater flexibility and diplomatic
                    finesse. At the outset he had to reckon with the presence of the powerful
                    antipope Clement III. in Rome; but a series of well-attended synods held in
                    Rome, Amalfi, Benevento, and Troia supported him in renewed declarations against
                    simony, lay investiture, and clerical marriages, and a continued policy of
                    opposition to Henry IV. In accordance with this last policy, the marriage of the
                    countess Matilda with Guelph of Bavaria was promoted, Prince Conrad was helped
                    in his rebellion against his father and crowned king of the Romans at Milan in
                    1093, and the empress (Adelaide or Praxedes) encouraged in her disgraceful
                    charges against her husband. In a protracted struggle also with Philip I. of
                    France, whom he had excommunicated, Urban II. finally proved victorious. But the
                    most prominent feature in his pontificate, a feature indeed which marks an epoch
                    in the history of Latin Christianity, is his connexion with the first crusade
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Crusades,</hi> vol. vi. pp. 623-624), which united
                    Christendom under the headship of the pope into one vast warlike confederacy
                    (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Popedom,</hi> vol. xix. p. 499). The crusading
                    movement first took shape at Piacenza, where in March 1095 Urban received an
                    embassy from the emperor Alexius I., asking help against the infidel, and where
                    a great council met, attended by numerous Italian, Burgundian, and French
                    bishops and by so vast a concourse of monks and laymen that the public meetings
                    had to be held in the open air outside the city. The still more enthusiastic
                    council of Clermont was held in November of the same year. Urban II. died on
                    29th July 1099, fourteen days after the fall of Jerusalem, but before the
                    tidings of that great event had reached Italy; his successor was Paschal II.</p>
