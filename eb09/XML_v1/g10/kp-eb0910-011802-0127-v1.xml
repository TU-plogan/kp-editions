                <p><label type="entry">GAVARNI</label>, French caricaturist, was born at Paris in
                    1801, and died in 1866. His true name was Chevalier (Sulpice Guillaume), and he
                    is said to have taken the <hi rend="italic">nom</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    plume</hi> under which he is known from the place where he made his first
                    published sketch. His parents were poor, and he started in life as a workman in
                    an engine-building factory. At the same time he attended the free school of
                    drawing. Here his natural talent was developed, and he acquired that training of
                    the hand without which an artist is unable to work up his best inspirations. In
                    his first attempts to turn his abilities to some account he met with many
                    disappointments, but was at last entrusted with the drawing of some
                    illustrations for a journal of fashion. Gavami was then thirty-four years of
                    age. His sharp and witty pencil gave to these generally commonplace and
                    unartistic figures a lifelikeness and an expression which soon won for him a
                    name in fashionable circles Gradually he gave greater attention to this more
                    congenial work, and finally ceased working as an engineer to become the director
                    of the journal <hi rend="italic">Les Gens du Monde.</hi> His ambition rising in
                    proportion to his success, Gavami from this time followed the real bent of his
                    inclination, and began a series of lithographed sketches, in which lie
                    pourtrayed the most striking characteristics, foibles, and vices of the various
                    classes of French society. The letterpress explanations attached to his drawings
                    were always short, but <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> were forcible and highly
                    humorous, if sometimes trivial, and were admirably adapted to the particular
                    subjects. The different stages through which Gavarni’s talent passed, always
                    elevating and refining itself, are well worth being noted. At first he confined
                    himself to the study of Parisian manners, more especially those of the Parisian
                    youth. To this vein belong <hi rend="italic">les Lorettes,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    made his own. His name was exceedingly popular, and his illustrations for books

                    sought for, on account of the clever and telling sketches contributed by
                    Gavarni. A single frontispiece or vignette was sometimes enough to secure the
                    sale of a new book. Always desiring to enlarge the field of his observations,
                    Gavarni soon abandoned his once favourite topics. He no longer limited himself
                    to such types as the <hi rend="italic">loτette</hi> and the Parisian student, or
                    to the description of the noisy and popular pleasures of the capital, but turned
                    his mirror to the grotesque sides of family life and of humanity at large. <hi

                    were composed at this time, and are his most elevated productions. But whilst
                    showing the same power of irony as his former works, enhanced by a deeper
                    insight into human nature, they generally bear the stamp of a bitter and even
                    sometimes gloomy philosophy. This tendency was still more strengthened by a
                    visit to England in 1849. He returned from London deeply impressed with the
                    scenes of misery and degradation which he had observed among the lower classes
                    of that city. In the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n128/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0128-0119"/> midst of the cheerful atmosphere of Paris he had
                    been struck chiefly by the ridiculous aspects of vulgarity and vice, and he had
                    laughed at them. But the debasement of human nature which he saw in London
                    appears to have affected him so forcibly that from that time the cheerful
                    caricaturist never laughed, or made others laugh again. .What he had witnessed
                    there became the almost exclusive subject of his drawings, as powerful, as
                    impressive as ever, but better calculated to be appreciated by cultivated minds
                    than by the public, which had in former years granted him so wide a popularity.
                    Most of these last compositions appeared in the weekly paper <hi rend="italic"
                    >HIllustration.</hi> In 1857 he published in one volume the series entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Masques and Visages</hi> (1 vol. 12τno), and in 1869, about two
                    years after his death, his last artistic work, <hi rend="italic">Les Douze
                    Mois</hi> (1 vol. fol.), was given to the world. Gavarni was much engaged,
                    during the last period of his life, in scientific pursuits, and tlιis*iact must
                    perhaps be connected with the great change which then took place in his manner
                    as an artist. He sent several communications to the Académie des Sciences, and
                    till his death, which happened on the 23d of November 1866, he was eagerly
                    interested in the question of aerial navigation. It is said that he made
                    experiments on a large scale with a view to find the means of directing
                    balloons; but it seems that he was not so successful in this line as his
                    fellow-artist, the caricaturist and photographer, Nadar.</p>
                <p>Gavami’s <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres choisies</hi> were edited in 1845 (4 vols.
                    4to) with letterpress by J. Janin, Th. Gautier, and Balzac, followed in 1850 by
                    two other volumes named <hi rend="italic">Perles</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Parures·,</hi> and some essays in prose and in verse written by him were
                    collected by one of his biographers, Ch. Yriarte, and published in 1869. The
                    book written by E. and J. de Goncourt, <hi rend="italic">Gavarni, Γhomme</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et l'oeuvre</hi> (1873, 8vo), must be mentioned here. J. Claretie
                    has also devoted to the great French caricaturist a curious and interesting
                    essay. A catalogue rα‰so7iτ√ of Gavarni’s works has been published by J.
                    Armelhault and E. Bocher, Paris, 1873, 8vo.</p>
