                    German, <hi rend="italic">Ingwer),</hi> the rhizome or underground stem of <hi
                    rend="italic">Zingiber officinale,</hi> Roscoe, a perennial reed-like plant
                    growing from 3 to 4 feet high. The flowers and leaves are borne on separate
                    stems, those of the former being shorter than those of the latter, and averaging
                    from 6 to 12 inches. The flowers themselves are borne at the apex of the stems
                    in dense ovate oblong conelike spikes from 2 to 3 inches long, composed of
                    obtuse strongly-imbricated bracts with membranous margins, each bract enclosing
                    a single small sessile flower. The leaves are alternate, bright green, smooth,
                    tapering at both ends, with very short petioles. The plant, though unknown in a
                    wild state, is considered with very good reason to be a native of the warmer
                    parts of Asia, over which it has been cultivated from an early period, and the
                    rhizome imported into England. From Asia the plant has spread into the West
                    Indies, South America, western tropical Africa, and Australia.</p>
                <p>The use of ginger as a spice has been known from very early times; it was
                    supposed by the Greeks and Romans to be a product of southern Arabia, and was
                    received by them by way of the Red Sea; in India it has also been known from a
                    very remote period, the Greek and Latin names being derived from the Sanskrit.
                    Flückiger and Hanbury, in their <hi rend="italic">Pharmacographia,</hi> give the
                    following notes on the history of ginger. Ou the authority of Vincent’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients,</hi> it is stated that in
                    the list of imports from the Red Sea into Alexandria, which in the second
                    century of our era were there liable to the Roman fiscal duty, ginger occurs
                    among other Indian spices. So frequent is the mention of ginger in similar lists
                    during the Middle Ages, that it evidently constituted an important item in the
                    commerce between Europe and the East. It thus appears in the tariff of duties
                    levied at Acre in Palestine about 1173, in that of Barcelona in 1221, Marseilles
                    in 1228, and Paris in 1296. Ginger seems to have been well known in England even
                    before the Norman Conquest, being often referred to in the Anglo-Saxon
                    leech-books of the 11th century. It was very common in the 13th and 14th
                    centuries, ranking next in value to pepper, which was then the commonest of all
                    spices, and costing on an average about Is. 7d. per ft&gt;. Three kinds of
                    ginger were known among the merchants of Italy about the middle of the 14th
                    century:—(1) <hi rend="italic">Belledi</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Baladi,</hi> an
                    Arabic name, which, as applied to ginger, would signify country or wild, and
                    denotes common ginger; (2) <hi rend="italic">Colombino,</hi> which refers to
                    Columbum, Kolarn, or Quilon, a port in Travancore, frequently mentioned in the
                    Middle Ages; and (3) <hi rend="italic">ΛIicchino,</hi> a name which denoted that
                    the spice had been brought from or by way of Mecca. Marco Polo seems to have
                    seen the ginger plant both in India and China between 1280 and 1290. John of
                    Montecorvino, a missionary friar who visited India about 1292, gives a
                    description of the plant, and refers to the fact of the root being dug up and
                    transported. Nicolo di Conto, a Venetian merchant in the early part of the 15th
                    century, also describes the plant and the collection of the root, as seen by him
                    in India. Though the Venetians received ginger by way of Egypt, some of the
                    superior kinds were taken from India overland by the Black Sea. The spice is
                    said to have been introduced into America by Francisco de Mendoça, who took it
                    from the East Indies to New Spain. It seems to have been shipped for commercial
                    purposes from San Domingo as early as 1585, and from Barbados in 1654; so early
                    as 1547 considerable quantities were sent from the West Indies to Spain.</p>
                <p>Ginger is known in commerce in two distinct forms, termed respectively coated and
                    uncoated ginger, as having or wanting the epidermis. For the first, the pieces,
                    which are called “races” or “hands,” from their irregular palmate form, are
                    washed and simply dried in the sun. In this form ginger presents a brown, more
                    or less irregularly wrinkled or striated surface, and when broken shows a dark
                    brownish fracture, hard, and sometimes horny and resinous. To produce uncoated
                    ginger the rhizomes are washed, scraped, and sun-dried, and are often subjected
                    to a system of bleaching, either from the fumes of burning sulphur or by
                    immersion for a short time in a solution of chlorinated lime. The whitewashed
                    appearance that much of the ginger has, as seen in the shops, is due to the fact
                    of its being washed in whiting and water, or even coated with sulphate of lime.
                    This artificial coating is supposed by some to give the ginger a better
                    appearance; it often, however, covers an inferior quality, and can readily be
                    detected by the ease with which it rubs off, or by its leaving a white powdery
                    substance at the bottom of the jar in which it is contained. Uncoated ginger, as
                    seen in trade, varies from single joints an inch or less in length to flattish
                    irregularly branched pieces of several joints, the “races” or “hands,” and from
                    3 to 4 inches long; each branch has a depression at its <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n621/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0621-0604"/> summit showing the former attachment of a leafy
                    stem. The colour, when not whitewashed, is a pale buff; it is somewhat rough or
                    fibrous, breaking with a short mealy fracture, and presenting on the surfaces of
                    the broken parts numerous short bristly fibres.</p>
                <p>The British market derives its supply of ginger from various parts of the world.
                    The principal sorts, however, or those most commonly found in commerce, are
                    Jamaica, Cochin, Bengal, and African, though each of these in its turn has its
                    several varieties and qualities. The best or most valued kind of all is the
                    Jamaica, and next to it the Cochin. For ordinary purposes uncoated ginger is
                    considered the best; the largest and finest pieces, of a pale buff colour both
                    outside and inside, and cutting softly and evenly, are considered the most
                    valuable. The chief sources of supply are the East and West Indies, Sierra
                    Leone, and Egypt.</p>
                <p>The principal constituents of ginger are starch, volatile oil (to which the
                    characteristic odour of the spice is due), and resin (to which is attributed its
                    pungency). Its chief use is as a condiment or spice, but as an aromatic and
                    stomachic medicine it is also used internally. “The stimulant, aromatic, and
                    carminative properties render it of much value in atonic dyspepsia, especially
                    if accompanied with much flatulence, and as an adjunct to purgative medicines to
                    correct griping.” Externally applied as a rubefacient, it has been found to
                    relieve headache and toothache. The rhizomes, collected in a young green state,
                    washed, scraped, and preservedin syrup, form a delicious preserve, which is
                    largely exported both from the West Indies and from China. Cut up into pieces
                    like lozenges, and preserved in sugar, ginger also forms a very agreeable
                    sweetmeat. (J. R. J.)</p>
