                    noble Russian family, descended fro⅛ι Michael Vsevolodovich, prince of
                    Chernigoff, who, in 1246, was assassinated by the Mongols. The following are the
                    most distinguished members of this family. <hi rend="smallcaps">Petr
                    Dimitrievich</hi> (1790-1868) served under Kamensky and Kutuzoff in the campaign
                    against Turkey, and afterwards against France in 1813-1814. In 1820 he
                    suppressed an insurrection in the Caucasus, for which service he was raised to
                    the rank of major-general. In 1828-29 he fought under Wittgenstein against the
                    Turks, occupied Aidos, and signed the treaty of peace at Adrianople. In 1839 he
                    was made governor of eastern Siberia, andin 1851 retired into private life. When
                    the Crimean war broke out he offered his services to the emperor Nicholas, by
                    whom he was appointed general of the 6th army corps in the Crimea. At the
                    battles of Alma and Inkerman he commanded the left wing of the Russian army. In
                    1855 he retired, and died at Moscow, March 18, 1868. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mikhail Dimitrievich</hi> (1792-1861), brother of the preceding, was born in
                    1792. In 1807 he entered the Russian army, in 1810 he took part in the campaigns
                    against Persia, and in 1812-1815 against France. During the Russo-Turkish war of
                    1828-29, he directed the operations of the sieges of Silistria and Shumla. After
                    being appointed, in 1830, general of artillery, he was present in the campaigns
                    in Poland, and was wounded at the battle of Grochow, February 25, 1831. He also
                    distinguished himself at the battle of Ostrolenka and at the taking of Warsaw.
                    For these services he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. In 1846 he
                    was nominated military governor of Warsaw. In 1849 he commanded the Russian
                    artillery against the Hungarians, and in 1852 he visited London as a
                    representative of the Russian army at the funeral of the duke of Wellington.
