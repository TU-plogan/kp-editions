                    (1676-1748), the most distinguished historian of whom Naples can boast, and
                    amongst all Italian historians second alone to Fra Paulo Sarpi for the strong
                    and clear light thrown in his works on the growth of the papal power, was born
                    at Ischitella, in the province of Capitanata, on the 7th of May 1676. Arriving
                    in Naples at the age of eighteen, he devoted himself to the study of law, but
                    his legal pursuits were much surpassed in importance by his literary labours. He
                    devoted twenty years to the composition of his great work, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Civil History of Naples,</hi> which was ultimately published in 1723. Here, in
                    his account of the rise and progress of the Neapolitan laws and government, he
                    warmly espoused the side of the civil power in its conflicts with the Romish
                    hierarchy. The position thus taken up by him, and the manner in which that
                    position was assumed, gave rise to a life-long conflict between Giannone and the
                    church; and we must know much more accurately than we at present do all the
                    facts concerning his alleged retractation in prison at Turin, before we can
                    withhold from him the palm—as he certainly endured the sufferings—of a confessor
                    and martyr in the cause of what he deemed historical truth. Hooted by the mob of
                    Naples, and excommunicated by the archbishop’s court, he was forced to leave
                    Naples and repair to Vienna. Meanwhile the Inquisition had attested after its
                    own fashion the value of his history by putting it on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Index.</hi> At Vienna the favour of the emperor Charles VI. and of many leading
                    personages at the Austrian court obtained for him a pension and other facilities
                    for the prosecution of his historical studies. Of these the most important
                    result was <hi rend="italic">Il Triregno, ossia del regno del cielo, della
                    terra, e del papa.</hi> On the transfer of the Neapolitan crown to Charles of
                    Bourbon, Giannone lost his Austrian pension, and was compelled to remove to
                    Venice. There he was at first most favourably received. The post of consulting
                    lawyer to the republic, in which he might have continued the special work of Fra
                    Paulo Sarpi, was offered to him, as well as that of professor of public law in
                    Padua; but he declined both offers. Unhappily there arose a suspicion that his
                    views on maritime law were not favourable to the pretensions of Venice, and,
                    notwithstanding all his efforts to dissipate that suspicion, it was resolved to
                    expel him from the state. On the 23d of September 1735 he was seized and
                    conveyed to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0588-0571"/> Ferrara. After wandering, under the assumed name
                    of Antonio Rinaldo, for three months through Modena, Milan, and Turin, he at
                    last reached Geneva, where he enjoyed the friendship of the most distinguished
                    citizens, and was on excellent terms with the great publishing firms. But in an
                    evil hour he was induced to visit a Catholic village within the Sardinian
                    territory, where he was kidnapped by the agents of the Sardinian Government,
                    conveyed to the castle of Miolan, and thence successively transferred to Ceva
                    and Turin. In the fortress of Turin he remained immured during the last twelve
                    years of his life, though part of his time was spent in composing a defence of
                    the Sardinian interests as opposed to those of the papal court, and though he
                    was led to sign a retractation of the statements in his history most obnoxious
                    to the Vatican. He died March 7, 1748, in his seventy-second year.</p>
                <p>Giannone’s style as an Italian writer has been pronounced to be below a severe
                    classical model. But his very ease and freedom, if not classical, have helped to
                    make his volumes more popular than many works of greater classical renown. In
                    England the just appreciation of his labours by Gibbon, and the ample use made
                    of them in the later volumes of The Decline and Fall, early secured his rightful
                    place for him in the estimation of English scholars.</p>
                <p>A good and complete edition of Giannone’s works is still a desideratum. The more
                    important facts of his life have been recorded by 'the Abbe Fernando Parizini in
                    Italian, and in Latin byFabroni; whilst a more complete estimate of his literary
                    and political importance may be formed by the perusal of the collected edition
                    of the works written by him in his Turin prison, published in Turin in
                    1859—under the care of the distinguished statesman Pasquale Stanislao Mancini,
                    late minister of grace and justice, universally recognized as one of the first
                    authorities in Italy on questions relating to the history of his native Naples,
                    and especially to the conflicts between the civil power and the church.</p>
