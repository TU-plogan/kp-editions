                <p><label type="entry">GLASTONBURY</label>, a market town and municipal borough of
                    England, is situated near the middle of Somersetshire, about 22 miles S.W. of
                    Bath, on the great western road from London to Exeter. The spot occupied by the
                    town is a sort of peninsula formed by the windings of the river Brue, which
                    flows west through the valley between the Poldew and the Mendip Hills; and in
                    earlier times it was to all intents an island, as the country round was an
                    extensive marsh, broken, however, by the Tor of St Michael to the N.E. of the
                    town. Of the public buildings the most important, besidee the ruins of the great
                    abbey, are the church of St John the Baptist, in the Perpendicular style, with a
                    tower of flue proportions; the church of St Benedict, dating from between 1493
                    and 1524; the hospital of St John, founded in 1246; and the George Inn, erected
                    about the time of Henry VII. or Henry VIII. There was formerly in the town a
                    remarkable cross, which is figured in Warner’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glastonbury</hi>; but it fell into decay, and was replaced by the present
                    insignificant monument in 1846. Though Glastonbury has a station on the Somerset
                    and Dorset Railway, and communicates with the estuary of the Severn by means of
                    a canal for vessels of 70 or 100 tons burden, it has comparatively little trade.
                    The woollen manufacture was introduced by the duke of Somerset in the first half
                    of the 16th century, as may be seen at length in Strype’s <hi rend="italic">Life
                    of Crammer</hi>; but neither that nor the manufacture of silk, which was also
                    carried on to some extent during the 18th century, is now of any importance.
                    There are tanneries, however, and tile-works. The population of the town in 1861
                    was 3496, aud in 1871 it was 3670.</p>
                <p>The abbey of Glastonbury is without doubt one of the very earliest ecclesiastical
                    foundations in England. In the words of Mr Freeman (“King Ine,” Ρrοc. of
                    Somersetshire Arch. Soc., 1874), “it is on any showing a tie between the Briton
                    and the Englishman, between the older Christianity of our island and the newer,
                    the one church of the first rank which lived through the storm of English
                    conquest, which passed into the hands of our victorious fathers as a trophy of
                    victory undestroyed and unplundered.” But unfortunately “everything relating to
                    its early history is so enveloped in legend that one has to tread one’s way with
                    the greatest caution at every step.” As Canon Stubbs remarks,<note

                    St Dunstan, Rolls Series, 1874.</p></note> the extravagant claims of the monks
                    in regard to the antiquity and celebrity of their church ‘ ‘ doubtless provoked
                    criticism, and criticism forced on them the need of a forged history to assert,
                    and of forged monuments to support these pretensions. The fabrication of such
                    evidence must have gone on at Glastonbury on a scale proportioned to the claims;
                    and William of Malmesbury, it would almost seem, undertook to erect the story
                    out of materials which he distrusted. This did not content his employers, and
                    they interpolated his work to a degree which makes it impossible to rely with
                    confidence on any part of it.’’</p>
                <p>Though Glastonbury is not mentioned either by Bede or by the authors of the Saxon
                    Chronicle as one of the early foundations, its existence (continues Prof.
                    Stubbs) is proved by the incontrovertible authority of the letters of St
                    Boniface and the life of the same by S. Willibald. The name of Glastonbury
                    however is of comparatively modem origin, being a corruption of the Saxon
                    Glccstingaburh or town of the Glaestings. By the Britons the spot seems to have
                    been called Ynys yr Avalion (Latinized as Avallonia), the Island of Apples, or
                    Ynyswitrin, the Glassy Island; and it became the local habitation of various
                    fragments of Celtic romance.</p>
                <p>According to the legends which grew up under the care of the monks, the first
                    church of Glastonbury was a little wattled building erected by Joseph of
                    Arimathea as the leader of the twelve apostles sent over to Britain from Gaul by
                    St Philip. About a hundred years later, according to the same authorities, the
                    two missionaries Phaganus and Deruvianus who came to king Lucius from Pope
                    Eleutherius established a fraternity of anchorites on the spot, and after three
                    hundred years more St Patrick introduced amongst them a regular monastic life.
                    About 546 David of Menevia is said to have built a new church near the old one,
                    and in the 7th century the old one was encased with boards and covered with lead
                    by the care of Paulinus of York. In the early part of the 8th century the great
                    West Saxon king Ine (c∕ ’. charter in Kemble, Codex diplomat icus ceυi Saxonici,
                    vol. i. No. lxxi.) built and endowed a monastery at Glastonbury, which, in spite
                    of the preceding establishments, may almost be considered as a new foundation.
                    From the decadent state into which, like other monasteries, Glastonbury was
                    brought by the Danish invasions, it was brilliantly recovered by the powerful
                    hand of Dunstan who had been educated within its walls and was appointed its
                    abbot about 946. The church and other buildings of his erection remained till
                    the installation, in 1082, of the first Norman abbot, who inaugurated the new
                    epoch by commencing a new church. His successor Herlewin (1101-1120), however,
                    dissatisfied with the meanness of the edifice, pulled it down to make way for a
                    finer structure. Henιy of Blois (1126-1172) added greatly to the extent of the
                    monastery, building a bell tower, a chapter-house,' a cloister, a dormitory, a
                    refectory, a palace, a brew-house, &amp;c. In 1184 (on 25th May) the whole of
                    the buildings were laid in ruins by fire; but Henry II. of England, in whose
                    hands the monastery then was, entrusted his chamberlain Rudolphus with the work
                    of restoration, and caused it to be carried out with much magnificence. The
                    great church of which the mins still remain was then erected. In the end of the
                    12th century, andon into the following, Glastonbury was distracted by a strange
                    dispute, caused by the attempt of Savaric the ambitious bishop of Bath to make
                    himself master of the abbey. The conflict, carried on alternately by blows and
                    bribes, was brought to a close by the decision of Innocent III., that the abbacy
                    should be merged in the new see of Bath and Glastonbury, and that Savaric should
                    have a fourth of the property. On Savaric’s death his successor gave up the
                    joint bishopric and allowed the monks to elect their own abbot. From this date
                    to the Reformation the monastery continued to flourish, the chief events in its
                    history being connected with the maintenance of its claims to the possession of
                    the bodies or tombs of King Arthur and St Dunstan. As early at least as the
                    beginning of the 11th century the tradition that Arthur was buried at
                    Glastonbury appears to have taken shape; and in the reign of Henry II.,
                    according to Giraldus Cambrensis and others, the abbot Henry de Blois, causing
                    search to be made, discovered at the depth of 16 feet a massive oak trank with
                    an inscription “Hic jacet sepultus inclitus rex Arthurus in insula Avalonia.
                    After the fire of 1184 the monks asserted that they were <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0696-0675"/> in possession of the remains of St Dunstan, which
                    had been abstracted from Canterbury after the Danish sack of 1011 and kept in
                    concealment ever since. The Canterbury monks naturally denied the assertion, and
                    the contest continued for centuries. In 1508 Warham and Goldston having examined
                    the Canterbury shrine reported that it contained all the principal bones of the
                    saint, but the abbot of Glastonbury in reply as stoutly maintained that this was
                    impossible. The day of such disputes was, however, drawing to a close. On 1539
                    the last and 60th abbot of Glastonbury, Robert Whyting, was, in the words of a
                    contemporary lettter (MS. Cotton, Cleop. E., iv. fol. 996), “arraigned, and next
                    day put to execution for robbing of Glastonbury church.” His body was quartered,
                    and his head fixed on the abbey gate. A darker passage does not occur in the
                    annals of our English Reformation than this murder of an able and high-spirited
                    man, whose worst offence was that he defended as best he could from the hand of
                    the spoiler the property of his charge.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A curious relic of Abbot Whyting, his watch, was purchased
                    in 1837 at the sale of T. Bowen’s effects, and presented by C. K. Tynte to the
                    duke of Sussex.</p></note></p>
                <p>The nιins of the abbey are now comparatively few, and as the work of destruction
                    has in many places descended to the very foundations it is impossible to make
                    out the details of the plan. Of the vast range of buildings for the
                    accommodation of the monks almost nothing remains except the abbot’s kitchen,
                    noteworthy for its octagonal interior, the porter’s lodge, and the abbey barn.
                    Considerable portions are still standing of the so-called chapel of St Joseph at
                    the west end, which Mr Willis has identified with the lady chapel, occupying the
                    site of the old wicker church. This chapel, which is the finest part of the
                    ruins, is transition work of the 12th century. It measures about 66 feet from
                    east to west and about 36 from north to south. Below the chapel is a crypt which
                    Professor Willis shows to be a construction of the 15th century inserted in a
                    building which had no previous crypt. Between the chapel and the great church is
                    an Early English building which appears to have served as a Galilee porch. The
                    great church itself was a cruciform structure with a choir, a nave, and
                    transepts, and a tower surmounting the centre of intersection. From east to west
                    the length was 410 feet, and the breadth of the nave was about 80 feet. The nave
                    had ten severies, and the choir six. Of the nave three bays of the south side
                    are still standing, and the windows have pointed arches externally and
                    semicircular arches internally. Two of the tower piers and a part of one arch
                    give some indication of the grandeur of the building. The old clock, presented
                    to the abbey by Adam de Godbury (1322-1335), and noteworthy as the first
                    recorded example of a clock striking the hours automatically with a count-wheel,
                    is still preserved, although not in its entirety, in the cathedral at Wells.</p>
                <p>The Glastonbury thorn, planted, according to the legend, by Joseph of Arimathea,
                    has been the object of considerable comment. According to Loudon {Arboretum et
                    Fmιticetu∕m) it was probably Crataegus prcecox, and he reports that he received
                    from Glastonbury in December 1833 a thorn branch in full blossom, having also on
                    it ripe fruit. The actual thorn visited by the pilgrims was destroyed about the
                    Reformation time, but specimens of the same variety are still extant in various
                    parts of the country.</p>
