                <p><label type="entry">GALLIPOLI</label>, the ancient Kαλλi7roλιs, a seaport town of
                    Turkey in Europe, in the province of Rumili and vilayet of Edimeh, at the
                    north-east extremity of the Straits of</p>
                <p>Dardanelles, on a narrow peninsula 130 miles S.W. of Constantinople, and 90 miles
                    due S. of Adrianople, in 40° 24' N. lat. and 26° 40' 30" E. long. Nearly
                    opposite is Lapsaki on the Asiatic side of the channel, which is here about 2
                    miles wide. The town of Gallipoli presents a miserable aspect; the streets are
                    narrow, the houses mostly of wood and ill built, though there are a few better
                    structures near the harbour, and the Anglo-French occupation of 1853-6 led to
                    some improvements. The only noteworthy buildings are the large, crowded, and
                    well-furnished bazaars, with leaden domes. There are several mosques, none of
                    them remarkable, and many interesting Roman and Byzantine remains, especially a
                    magazine of the emperor Justinian, a square castle and tower attributed to
                    Bajazet I., and some tumuli on the south, said to be the tombs of the Thracian
                    kings. The lighthouse, built on a cliff, has a fine appearance as seen from the
                    Dardanelles. Gallipoli is the residence of a captain-pasha and the seat of a
                    Greek bishop. It has two good harbours, and is the principal station for the
                    Turkish fleet. From its position as the key of the Dardanelles, it was occupied
                    by the allied French and English armies in 1854. Then the isthmus a few miles to
                    the north of the town, between it and Boulair, was fortified with strong
                    earthworks by English and French engineers mainly on the lines of the old works
                    constructed in 1357, when the Turks first crossed over into Europe, nearly 100
                    years before they gained possession of Constantinople. These fortifications were
                    renewed and enlarged in January 1878, on the Russians threatening to take
                    possession of Constantinople. The peninsula thus isolated by the fortified
                    positions has the Gulf of Saros on the N.W., and extends some 50 miles to the
                    S.W The guns of Gallipoli command the Dardanelles just before the strait joins
                    the Sea of Marmora. The town itself is not very strongly fortified, the
                    principal fortifications being further down the Dardanelles, where the passage
                    is narrower. The district of Gallipoli is exceedingly fertile and well adapted
                    for -agriculture; a great variety of crops are raised, but, previous to the war
                    of 1877-8, nearly all progress was stopped on account of the maladministration
                    of the Turkish authorities. Nevertheless considerable quantities of the various
                    cereals were exported, besides wine, oil, skins, cotton, sheep, &amp;c., much of
                    the trade being transit. The principal imports are manufactured goods, coal,
                    sugar, coffee, rice, soap, iron. The line of railway between Adrianople and the
                    Egean Sea has been prejudicial to the transit trade of Gallipoli, and several
                    attempts have been made to obtain concessions for the construction of a railway
                    that would connect this part with the Turkish railway system. There is little
                    industry in Gallipoli, though previous to the war attempts had been made to
                    extend and improve the manufacture of silk thread and silk goods, and some
                    little business was done in the construction of coasting vessels. Steamers to
                    and from Constantinople call regularly at Gallipoli. Widely different estimates
                    have been given of the population of the town; it is probably somewhere about
                    25,000 or 30,000.</p>
