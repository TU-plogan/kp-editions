                <p><label type="entry">GODWINE</label>, son of Wulfnoth, earl of the West-Saxons, is
                    the leading Englishman in the first half of the 11th century, and he holds a
                    special place in English history generally. He is the first Englishman who plays
                    the part of a minister and parliamentary leader, of one high in office under the
                    crown who at the same time sways the assemblies of the nation by his power of
                    speech. Such a position was perfectly possible before the Norman Conquest; it
                    did not again become possible for some ages. Godwine appears as the chief
                    champion of England against Norman influence, and as the father of the last
                    English king of the native stock. In these two characters he drew on himself the
                    fullest bitterness of Norman hatred; and to this hatred is doubtless largely,
                    though not wholly, owing the extraordinary contradiction with which the chief
                    events of his life are told, and the amazing slanders which have been heaped
                    upon his memory.</p>
                <p>His birth and origin are utterly uncertain. The highest authorities, the
                    contemporary English Chronicles, are silent. There are two alternative
                    statements, which are seemingly quite irreconcilable, but either of which alone
                    would have much to be said for it. By putting together certain passages in the
                    English Chronicles, in Domesday, and in the will of the Aetheling Aethelstan,
                    son of King Aethelred, a strong presumption is raised that Godwine was the son
                    of Wulfnoth the South-Saxon who was outlawed in 1009, and that his services in
                    the war against Cnut were deemed to entitle him to a restitution of his father’s
                    forfeited lands. There is no direct statement to this effect, but a number of
                    undesigned coincidences point towards such a belief. On the other hand, there is
                    a story which appears in various quarters, and which seems to come from more
                    than one independent source, which makes Godwine’s father Wulfnoth a churl
                    somewhere on the borders of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, and which makes
                    Godwine win the favour of the Danish earl Ulf by showing him his way after the
                    battle of Sherstone in 1016. A third account connects Godwine with the family of
                    Eadric the traitor of Aethelred’s day; but this version seems at once to be
                    impossible to reconcile with either of the other two stories, and to rest on
                    less authority than either.</p>
                <p>But, whatever was Godwine’s origin, there is no doubt that, according to Cnut’s
                    rule of preferring Englishmen to high office, he rose to power very early in
                    that king’s reign. He was an earl in 1018. The next year he distinguished
                    himself at the head of the English troops in Cnut’s Northern wars, and received
                    in marriage Gytha, the sister of the king’s brother-in-law Earl Ulf. In 1020 he
                    became earl of the West-Saxons, that is, of all England south of the Thames, a
                    new office, doubtless connected with Cnut’s frequent absences from England. All
                    this again is not in the Chronicles, though particular points are incidentally
                    confirmed by them. Still this stage of his history seems to be fairly made out
                    from other sources.</p>
                <p>From Cnut’s death in 1035 the events of Goclwine’s life are recorded in the
                    Chronicles, often with great minuteness. Much is also learned from the
                    contemporary biographer of Eadward. He asserted the claims of Harthacnut, the
                    son of Cnut and Emma, to the crown of his father; but he had to consent to a
                    division of the kingdom, and could only secure Wessex for Harthacnut, while
                    Harold reigned in Northumberland and Mercia. He then acted as the chief minister
                    of Emma, while she was regent on behalf of Harthacnut during his first reign.
                    During this time the Aetheling Aelfred, son of Aethelred and Emma, landed in
                    England in the hope of winning back his father’s crown; but coming into the
                    power of Harold, he was blinded by his order, and died of his wounds. Godwine
                    was said to have betrayed Aelfred to Harold, and the charge was eagerly seized
                    upon by the Norman writers. But it was not invented by them. At the beginning of
                    Harthacnut’s second reign in 1040, Godwine was formally accused of the death of
                    Aelfred, and was regularly tried and acquitted. His guilt is asserted in a poem
                    inserted in one of the Chronicles, but the words which tell against him are
                    carefully altered in another version. The story is told with great confusion and
                    contradiction, and the version unfavourable to Godwine seems to be inconsistent
                    with his position at the time as minister, not of Harold, to whom he is said to
                    have betrayed Aelfred, but of Harthacnut, whose kingship seems to be forgotten
                    in the story. Godwine remained in power during the reigns of Harold and
                    Harthacnut, and on the death of the last-named king in 1042, he was foremost in
                    promoting the election of Eadward, the son of Aethelred and Emma, to the vacant
                    throne. As earl of the West-Saxons he was the first man in the kingdom, but his
                    power was still balanced by that of the other great earls, Leofric in Mercia and
                    Siward in Northumberland. His sons Swegen and Harold, together with Beorn, the
                    nephew of his wife Gytha, were promoted to earldoms (1043-1045), and his
                    daughter Eadgyth was married to the king (1045). We hear much of his good and
                    strict government of his earldom, and of his influence with the king and with
                    the whole nation. He was not, however, all-powerful; in one very remarkable
                    case, which is most instructive as a piece of constitutional history, he was
                    out-voted in the witenagemdt on a question of foreign policy, In 1047, when his
                    wife’s nephew Swegen Estrithson, now king of the Danes, was at war with Magnus
                    of Norway, Godwine proposed to help Swegen with fifty ships; but the notion was
                    opposed by Leofric, and “all folk” accepted the amendment of the Mercian earl.
                    Godwine had also to strive against the king’s fondness for Normans and other
                    strangers, above all in the disposal of ecclesiastical offices. Godwine’s
                    policy, in this and in other matters, was opposed to all French connexions of
                    every kind. Next to Englishmen he favoured natives of the kindred Continental
                    lands, and he supported a policy of alliance with the empire and its princes. In
                    all this, at home and abroad, he had specially to withstand the influence of the
                    king’s Norman favourite Robert of Jumiéges, appointed bishop of London in 1044
                    and archbishop of Canterbury in 1051. Godwine was supported by the English
                    bishops Stigand of Winchester and Lyfing of Worcester. The appointment of Robert
                    to the archbishopric marks the decline of Godwine’s power; the foreign influence
                    was now at its height, and the English earl was to feel the strength of it.</p>
                <p>In the course of 1051 a series of outrages committed by the king’s foreign
                    favourites led to a breach between the king and the earl. The king’s
                    brother-in-law, Eustace count of Boulogne, returning with his followers from a
                    visit to the king, tried to obtain quarters by force in the houses of the
                    burgesses of Dover. An Englishman who withstood them was killed; a fight
                    followed, in which the count and his company were driven out of the town. The
                    king, hearing the tale from Eustace, bade God wine inflict military chastisement
                    on the townsmen; the earl refused, and demanded a fair trial of the charge
                    before the witan. About the same time men’s minds were stirred by the outrages
                    of several Normans who had received estates in Herefordshire. The influence of
                    the archbishop was used against Godwine, and he was summoned to airpear before
                    the witan at <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0743-0720"/> Gloucester as a criminal. He and his sons now
                    gathered the whole force of their earldoms, and marched towards Gloucester in
                    arms. They demanded the surrender of Count Eustace and of the other strangers
                    who had done outrages, whether at Dover or in Herefordshire. The king called the
                    other earls to his help; war was hindered by the mediation υf Leofric, and
                    matters were adjourned to another meeting in London. There the king appeared
                    with an army; Godwine and his sons were arraigned as criminals, and, on refusing
                    to appear without a safe-conduct, λvere outlawed. Godwine and his whole family
                    now left the kingdom, except his daughter, the Lady Eadgyth, who was banished
                    from court to the monastery of Wherwell. The foreign favourites of the king were
                    now supreme.</p>
                <p>The next year the tide turned; the feeling of the nation showed itself in favour
                    of Godwine. When his petition for a removal of his outlawry was refused, he came
                    back from his shelter in Flanders at the head of a fleet. In most parts of
                    England he was welcomed; he sailed up the Thames to London; the army gathered by
                    the king refused to fight against him; and. in a great meeting outside the walls
                    of London, he and his family were restored to all their offices and possessions,
                    and the archbishop and many other Normans were banished. Godwine’s friend
                    Stigand succeeded to the archbishopric. The next year Godwine was smitten with a
                    fit at the king’s table, and died three days later, April 15, 1052. His death
                    was worked up into a fabulous tale by his Norman enemies.</p>
                <p>The patriotism and good government of Godwine are undoubted; but it is plain that
                    he accumulated vast wealth for himself. Sometimes, it was said, he showed little
                    regard to the rights of the church; but in the only case where we hear both
                    sides, that of some lands in Kent disputed between him and the Norman
                    archbishop, it appears that he had a legal claim. It is much more certain that
                    he was unduly bent on the promotion of his own family. His eldest son Swegen
                    gave great and deserved offence by the seduction of Eadgifu, abbess of
                    Leominster, and still more by the treacherous murder of his cousin Beorn. He was
                    outlawed, but was afterwards restored to his earldom. He accompanied his father
                    to Flanders, but did not come back, having gone on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, on
                    his return from which he died. Of his other sons, the second, Harold, succeeded
                    Godwine in his earldom and Eadward in his kingdom; Tostig, Gyrth, and Leofric,
                    all earls, play a part in the later history; Wulfnoth, the youngest, was a
                    captive of William. Of his daughters the Lady Eadgyth survived her father,
                    husband, and brother, and lived in great honour under the Conqueror. The others
                    were Gunhild and Aelfgifu, the latter of whom appears in the story of Harold’s
                    oath to "William.</p>
