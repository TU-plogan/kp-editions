                    signified late, last, or slow, as in <hi rend="italic">laggard,</hi> a loiterer,
                    <hi rend="italic">lagman,</hi> the last man, <hi rend="italic">lagteeth,</hi>
                    the posterior molar or “wisdom” teeth (as the last to appear), and <hi
                    rend="italic">lagclock,</hi> a clock that is behind time. Thus the Grey Lag
                    Goose is the Grey Goose which in England when the name was given was not
                    migratory but <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi> behind the other wild species at the
                    season when they betook themselves to their northern breedingquarters. In
                    connexion with this word, however, must be noticed the curious fact mentioned by
                    the late Mr Rowley (0rn. <hi rend="italic">Miscell.,</hi> iii. p. 213), that to
                    this day the flocks of tame Geese in Lincolnshire are urged on by their drivers
                    with the cry of “Lag’em, Lag’em.”</p></note> Goose, a bird of exceedingly wide
                    range in the Old World, apparently breeding where suitable localities are to be
                    found in most European countries from Lapland to Spain and Bulgaria. Eastwards
                    it extends to China, but does not seem to be known in Japan. It is the only
                    species indigenous to the British Islands, and in former days bred abundantly in
                    the English Fen-country, where the young were caught in large numbers and kept
                    in a more or less reclaimed condition with the vast flocks of tame-bred Geese
                    that at one time formed so valuable a property to the dwellers in and around the
                    Fens. It is impossible to determine when the wild Grey Lag Goose ceased from
                    breeding in England, but it certainly did so towards the end of the last
                    century, for Daniell mentions <hi rend="italic">(Rural Sports,</hi> iii. p. 242)
                    his having obtained two broods in one season. In Scotland this Goose continues
                    to breed sparingly in several parts of the Highlands and in certain of the
                    Hebrides, the nests being generally placed in long heather, and the eggs seldom
                    exceeding five or six in number. It is most likely the birds reared here that
                    are from time to time obtained in England, for at the present day the Grey Lag
                    Goose, though once so numerous, is, and for many years has been, the rarest
                    species of those that habitually resort to the British Islands. The
                    domestication of this species, as Mr Darwin remarks <hi rend="italic">(Animals
                    and Plants under Domestication,</hi> i. p. 287), is doubtless of very ancient
                    date, and yet scarcely any other animal that has been tamed for so long a
                    period, and bred so largely in captivity, has varied so little. It has increased
                    greatly in size and fecundity, but almost the only change in plumage is that
                    tame Geese lose the browner and darker tints of the wild bird, and are
                    invariably more or less marked with white—being often indeed wholly of that
                    colour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From the times
                    of the Romans white Geese have been held in great estimation, and hence,
                    doubtless, they have been preferred as breeding stock, but the practice of
                    plucking Geese alive, continued for so many centuries, has not improbably also
                    helped to perpetuate this variation, for it is well known to many bird-keepers
                    that a white leather is often produced in place of one of the natural colour
                    that has been pulled out.</p></note> The most generally recognized breeds of
                    domestic Geese are those to which the distinctive names of Emden and Toulouse
                    are applied; but a singular breed, said to have come from Sebastopol, was
                    introduced into Western Europe about the year 1856. In this the scapulars are
                    elongated, curled, and spirally twisted, having their shaft transparent, and so
                    thin that it often splits into fine filaments, which, remaining free for an inch
                    or more, often coalesce again.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Want of space forbids our entering on the breeding of tame
                    Geese, which was formerly so largely practised in some English counties,
                    especially Norfolk and Lincoln. It was no uncommon thing for a man to keep a
                    stock of a thousand, each of which might be reckoned to rear on an average seven
                    Goslings. The flocks were regularly taken to pasture and water, just as sheep
                    are, and the man who tended them was called the Gooseherd, corrupted into
                    Gozzerd. The birds were plucked five times in the year, and in autumn the flocks
                    were driven to London or other large markets. They travelled at the rate of
                    about a mile an hour, and would get over nearly ten miles in the day. For

                <p>The other British species of typical Geese are the Bean-' Goose (A, <hi
                    rend="italic">segetum),</hi> the Pink-footed (A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >brachyrhynchus'),</hi> and the White-fronted (A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >albifrons').</hi> On the continent of Europe, but not yet recognized as
                    occurring in Britain, is a small form of the last (A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >erythropus)</hi> which is known to breed in Lapland. All these, for the sake of
                    discrimination, may be divided into <hi rend="italic">two</hi> groups—(1) those
                    having the “nail” at the tip of the bill white, or of a very pale flesh colour,
                    and (2) those in which this “nail” is black. To the former belong the Grey Lag
                    Goose, as well as A. <hi rend="italic">albifrons</hi> and A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >erythropus,</hi> and to the latter the other two. A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >albifrons</hi> and A. <hi rend="italic">erythropus,</hi> which hardly differ
                    but in size,—the last being not much bigger than a Mallard <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anas boschas),—</hi> may be readily distinguished from the Grey Lag Goose by
                    their bright orange bill and legs, and their mousecoloured upper wing-coverts,
                    to say nothing of their very conspicuous white face and the broad black bars
                    which cross the belly, though the two last characters are occasionally
                    observable to some extent in the Grey Lag Goose, which has the bill and legs
                    flesh-coloured, and the upper wing-coverts of a bluish-grey. Of the second
                    group, with the black “nail,” A. <hi rend="italic">segetum</hi> has the bill
                    long, black at the base and orange in the middle; the feet are also orange, and
                    the upper wing-coverts mouse-coloured, as in A. <hi rend="italic">albifrons</hi>
                    and A. <hi rend="italic">erythropus,</hi> while A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >brachyrhynchus</hi> has the bill short, bright pink in the middle, and the feet
                    also pink, the upper wing-coverts being nearly of the same bluish-grey as in the
                    Grey Lag Goose. Eastern Asia possesses in A. <hi rend="italic">grandis</hi> a
                    third species of this group, which chiefly differs-from A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >segetum</hi> in its larger size. In North America there is only one species of
                    typical Goose, and that belongs to the white-“nailed” group. It very nearly
                    resembles A. <hi rend="italic">albifrons,</hi> but is larger, and has been
                    described as distinct under the name of A. <hi rend="italic">gambeli.</hi>
                    Central Asia and India possess in the Bar-headed Goose (A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >indicus')</hi> a bird easily distinguished from any of the foregoing by the
                    character implied by its English name; but it is certainly somewhat abnormal,
                    and, indeed, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Eulabia,</hi> has been
                    separated from the genus <hi rend="italic">Anser,</hi> which has no other member
                    indigenous to the Indian Region, nor any at all to the Ethiopian, Australian, or
                    Neotropical Regions.</p>
                <p>But the New World possesses by far the greatest wealth of Anserine forms. Beside
                    others, presently to be mentioned, its northern portions are the home of all the
                    speciesof Snow-Geese belonging to the genus <hi rend="italic">Chen.</hi> It is
                    true that two of these are reported as having appeared, and that not
                    unfrequently, in Europe and Asia; but they possibly have been but stragglers
                    from America. The first of these is <hi rend="italic">C. hyperbοreus,</hi> the
                    Snow-Goose proper, a bird of large size, and when adult of a pure white, except
                    the primaries, which are black. This has long been deemed a visitor to· the Old
                    World, and sometimes in considerable numbers, but the later discovery of a
                    smaller form, <hi rend="italic">C. albatus,</hi> scarcely <pb break="no"

                    the older records, especially since examples which have recently been obtained
                    in the British Islands undoubtedly belong to this lesser bird, aud it would be
                    satisfactory to have the occurrence in the Old World of the true <hi
                    rend="italic">C. hyperboreus</hi> placed on a surer footing. So nearly allied to
                    the species last named as to have been often confounded with it, is the
                    Blue-winged Goose, <hi rend="italic">C. coerulescens,</hi> which is said never
                    to attain a snowy plumage. Then we have a very small species, long ago described
                    as distinct by Hearne, the Arctic traveller, but until 1861 discredited by
                    ornithologists. Its distinctness has now been fully recognized, and it has
                    received, somewhat unjustly, the name of <hi rend="italic">C. rossi.</hi> Its
                    face is adorned with numerous papillae, whence it has been removed by Mr Elliot
                    to a separate genus, <hi rend="italic">Exanthemops,</hi> and for the same reason
                    it has, for more than a century, been known to the European residents in the fur
                    countries as the “Horned Wavey ”—the last word being a rendering of a native
                    name, <hi rend="italic">Jf</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">αwa,</hi> which signifies Goose. Finally, there appears to belong
                    to this section, though it has been frequently referred to another <hi
                    rend="italic">(Chloep&gt;haga),</hi> and has also been made the type of a
                    distinct genus <hi rend="italic">{Philαcte),</hi> the beautiful Painted Goose,
                    <hi rend="italic">C. canagica,</hi> which is almost peculiar to the Aleutian
                    Islands, though straying to the continent in winter, and may be recognized by
                    the white edging of its remiges.</p>
                <p>The southern portions of the New World are inhabited by about half a dozen
                    species of Geese, akin to the foregoing, but separated as the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Ckloephaga.</hi> The most noticeable of them are the Rock or Kelp
                    Goose, <hi rend="italic">C. antarctica,</hi> and the Upland Goose, <hi
                    rend="italic">C. magellanica.</hi> In both of these the sexes are totally unlike
                    in colour, the male being nearly white, while the female is of a mottled brown,
                    but in others a greater similarity obtains.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    this group, if indeed that can be justifiably separated, comes one which belongs
                    to the northern hemisphere, and is common to the Old World as well as the New.
                    It contains the Geese which have received the common names of Bernacles or

                    long. Suffice it to say that the ordinary spelling Bernicle seems to be wrong,
                    if we may judge from the analogy of the French <hi rend="italic">Bernαche.</hi>
                    In both words the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> should be sounded as <hi

                    frequently called by fowlers Black Geese. Of these, the best known both in

                    modern writers—a truly marine bird, seldom (in Europe at least) quitting
                    saltwater, and coming southward in vast flocks towards autumn, frequenting bays
                    and estuarie3 on our coasts, where it live3 chiefly on sea-grass <hi

                    0ccur3 chiefly on the Pacific coast of North America. In it the black of the

                    many modern zoologists and botanists often treat it. They should remember that
                    the doctrine of spontaneous generation has still many adherents, and that seems
                    -to be hardly less extravagant than the notion of birds growing from “worms,” as

                <p>North America, but is said to breed in Iceland, and occasionally in Norway. Its
                    usual <hi rend="italic">incunabula,</hi> however, still form one of the puzzles
                    of the ornithologist, and the difficulty is not lessened by the fact that it
                    will breed freely in semi-captivity, while the Brent-Goose will not. From the
                    latter the Bernacle-Goose is easily distinguished by its larger size and white
                    cheeks. Hutchins’s Goose (77. <hi rend="italic">Hutchinsi)</hi> seems to be its
                    true representative in the New-World. In this the face is dark, but a white
                    crescentic or triangular patch extends from the throat on either side upwards
                    behind the eye. Almost exactly similar in coloration to the last, but greatly
                    superior in size, and possessing 18 rectrices, while all the foregoing have but
                    16, is the common wild Goose of America, <hi rend="italic">B. canadensis,</hi>
                    which, for some two centuries or more, has been introduced into Europe, where it
                    propagates so freely that it has been included by nearly all the ornithologists
                    of this quarter of the globe, as a member of its fauna. An allied form, by some
                    deemed a species, is <hi rend="italic">B. leucopareia,</hi> which ranges over
                    the western part of North America, and, though having 18 rectrices, is
                    distinguished by a white collar round the lower part of the neck. The most
                    diverse species of this group of Geese are the beautiful <hi rend="italic"

                    occasionally strays to Western Europe, and has been obtained more than once in
                    Britain, and that which is peculiar to the Hawaian archipelago, <hi
                    rend="italic">B. sandvi-censis.</hi></p>
                <p>The largest living Goose is that called the Chinese, Guinea, or Swan-Goose, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cygnopsis cygnoides,</hi> and it seems to be the stock whence the
                    domestic Geese of several Eastern countries have sprung. It may not unfrequently
                    be seen in English farmyards, and it is found to cross readily with our common
                    tame Goose, the offspring being fertile, and Blyth has said that these crosses
                    are very abundant in India. The true home of the species is in Eastern Siberia
                    or Mongolia. It is distinguished by its upright bearing, which has been well
                    rendered by Bewick’s excellent figure. The Ganders of the reclaimed form are
                    distinguished by the knob at the base of the bill, but the evidence of many
                    observers shows that this is not found in the wild race. Of this bird there is a
                    perfectly white breed.</p>
                <p>We have next to mention a very curious form, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cereop&gt;sis</hi><hi rend="italic">novoe-hollandioe,</hi> which is peculiar to
                    Australia, and appears to be a more terrestrial type of Goose than any other now
                    existing. Its short, decurved bill and green cere give it a very peculiar
                    expression, and its almost uniform grey plumage, bearing rounded black spots, 13
                    also remarkable. It bears captivity well, breeding in confinement, and may be
                    seen in many parks and gardens. It appears to have been formerly very abundant
                    in many parts of Australia, from which it has of late been exterminated. Some of
                    its peculiarities seem to have been still more exaggerated in a bird that is
                    wholly extinct, the <hi rend="italic">Cnemiornis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >calcitrans</hi> of New Zealand, the remains of which were described in full by
                    Professor Owen in 1873 <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Zool. Society,</hi> ix. p.
                    253). Among the first portions of this singular bird that were found were the
                    <hi rend="italic">tibias,</hi> presenting an extraordinary development of the
                    <hi rend="italic">patella,</hi> which, united with the shankbone, gave rise to
                    the generic name applied. For some time the affinity of the owner of this
                    wonderful structure was in doubt, but all hesitation was dispelled by the
                    discovery of a nearly perfect skeleton, now in the British Museum, which proved
                    the bird to be a Goose, of great size, and unable, from the shortness of its
                    wings, to fly.</p>

                <p>Iu correlation with this loss of power may also be noted the dwindling of the
                    keel of the sternum. Generally, however, its osteological characters point to an
                    affinity to <hi rend="italic">Cereopsis,</hi> as was noticed by Dr Hector
                    (2⅛tns. <hi rend="italic">New Zeal. Institute,</hi> vi. pp. 76-84), who first
                    determined its Anserine character.</p>
                <p>Birds of the genera <hi rend="italic">Chenalopex</hi> (the Egyptian and Orinoco
                    Geese), <hi rend="italic">Plectropterus, Sarcidiomis, Chlamydochen,</hi> and
                    some others, are commonly called Geese. To the writer it seems uncertain whether
                    they should be grouped with the <hi rend="italic">Anserinae.</hi> The males of
                    all appear to have that curious enlargement at the junction of the bronchial
                    tubes and the trachea which is so characteristic of the Ducks or <hi
                    rend="italic">Anatinae.</hi> As much may be said for the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nettαρus,</hi> but want of space precludes further consideration of the subject
                    here. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
