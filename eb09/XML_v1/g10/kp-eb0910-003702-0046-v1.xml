                    (1758-1828), anatomist, physiologist, and founder of phrenology, was born at
                    Tiefenbrunn near Pforzheim, Baden, on the 9th of March 1758. After completing
                    the usual literary course at Baden and Bruchsal, he began the study of medicine
                    under Hermann at Strasburg, whence, attracted by the names of Van Swieten and
                    Stoll, he removed to Vienna in 1781. Having received his diploma, he began to
                    practise as a physician there in 1785; but his energies were mainly devoted to
                    the scientific investigation of problems which, even from boyhood, had been
                    occupying his attention. At a comparatively early period he had formed a
                    generalization which he believed to be a sound one, that in the human subject at
                    least a powerful memory is invariably associated with prominent eyes; and
                    further observation had enabled him, as he thought, also to define the external
                    characteristics indicative of special talents for painting, music, and the
                    mechanical arts. Following out these researches, he gradually reached the strong
                    personal conviction, not only that the talents and dispositions of men are
                    dependent upon the functions of the brain, but also that they may be inferred
                    with perfect exactitude and precision from the external appearances of the
                    skull. Gall’s first appearance as an author was made in 1791, when he published
                    the first two chapters of a (never completed) work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophisch-medicinische</hi><hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen über
                    Natur</hi><hi rend="italic">u.</hi><hi rend="italic">Kunst im kranken u.
                    gesunden Zustande des Menschen.</hi> The first public notice of his inquiries in
                    cranioscopy, however, was in the form of a familiar letter addressed to a
                    friend, which appeared in Wieland’s <hi rend="italic">Deutscher</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mercur</hi> in 1798; but two years before this Gall had commenced
                    giving private courses of phrenological lectures in Vienna, where his doctrines
                    soon attracted general attention, and met with increasing success until, in
                    1802, they were interdicted by the Government on the ground that they were
                    dangerous to religion. This step on the part of the authorities had the effect
                    of greatly stimulating public curiosity and increasing Gall’s celebrity. In
                    March 1805 he finally left Vienna, in company with his friend and associate
                    Spurzheim, and made a tour through Germany, in the course of which he lectured
                    in Berlin, Dresden, Magdeburg, and several of the university towns. These
                    expositions, which he knew how to make popular and attractive, were much
                    resorted to by the public, and excited considerable controversy in the
                    scientific world. He had almost reached the zenith of his fame when, in 1807, he
                    repaired to Paris and established himself there as a medical practitioner, at
                    the same time continuing his activity as a lecturer and writer. In 1808 appeared
                    his <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi><hi rend="italic">au cours de
                    physiologie</hi><hi rend="italic">du</hi><hi rend="italic">cerveau,</hi> which
                    was followed in 1809 by the <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur le système nerveux
                    en general, et sur celui du cerveau en particulier</hi> (originally laid before
                    the Institute of France in March 1808), and in 1810 by the first instalment of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Anatomie et Physiologie du système nerveux en general, et
                    du cerveau en particulier, avec des observations sur la possibilité de
                    reconnaître plusieurs dispositions intellectuelles et morales de l'homme et des
                    animaux par la configuration de leurs tetes.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recherches,</hi> and the first two volumes of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatomie,</hi> bear the conjoint names of Gall and Spurzheim. The latter work
                    was completed in 1819, and appeared in a second edition of six 8vo volumes
                    shortly afterwards (1822-25). In 1811 he replied to a charge of Spinozism or
                    atheism, which had been strongly urged against him in certain quarters, by a
                    treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Des dispositions</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >innées</hi><hi rend="italic">de Fame</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Vesprit,</hi> which he afterwards incorporated with his greater
                    work. In 1819 he became a naturalized French subject, but his efforts two years
                    afterwards to obtain admission to the Academy of Sciences, although supported by
                    Geoffroy St Hilaire, were unsuccessful. In 1823 he visited London with the
                    intention of giving a series of phrenological lectures, but was disappointed of
                    the reception he had anticipated, and speedily abandoned his plans. He continued
                    to lecture and practise in Paris until the beginning of 1828, when he was
                    disabled by an apoplectic seizure. His death took place at Montrouge near Paris,
                    on the 22d of August 1828. The <hi rend="italic">Anatomie</hi> has been
                    translated into English by Lewis (Boston, U.S., 1835).</p>
