                    terms, and openly aimed at the equal division of property, if possible by
                    peaceful agitation, if necessary by revolution. At the time of the formation of
                    the party Herr von Bismarck was engaged in his struggle with the liberals in the
                    Prussian parliament, and he did not scruple to damage his opponents by
                    encouraging Lassalle, who detested them more vehemently than did the premier
                    himself. Soon after the war with France the condition of the country was in the
                    highest degree favourable to the progress of the movement. . Intoxicated by the
                    national triumphs, and having a vague impression that the French indemnity must
                    be an inexhaustible source of wealth, many of the German middle class indulged
                    in wild speculation, and contracted habits of reckless expenditure. At the same
                    time the resources of the nation were drained by the most costly military system
                    the world has ever seen. The inevitable result was that in a short time trade
                    was depressed beyond all recent experience; wages fell, and large numbers of
                    workmen were deprived of employment. Socialism found its opportunity; multitudes
                    of the sufferers eagerly listened to instructors who depicted for them a
                    brilliant future that might be easily attained. In England no considerable body
                    of men has ever been deeply impressed by socialist schemes; but in Germany the
                    conditions of political life are altogether different. There the Government is
                    the greatest of all powers. At every stage of a man’s life it makes itself felt;
                    it creates around the community a sort of political atmosphere from which there
                    is no escape, in which every one moves and breathes. Thus to an uninstructed
                    German there seems to be hardly any limit to the feats of which the state is
                    capable. It professes to be so nearly omnipotent that he appears to himself to
                    be within his right in asking it to make all poor men suddenly rich.</p>
                <p>At each successive general election the numbers of socialist deputies to the
                    imperial parliament increased; and in 1877 it was calculated that, although only
                    twelve members of the party were returned, about a tenth of the entire body of
                    voters were socialists. Some alarm was excited by these facts, but no one
                    thought of putting down the movement by force until one day in May 1878 a shot
                    was fired at the aged emperor in Berlin, as he drove along the Unter den Linden
                    with his daughter, the grand-duchess of Baden, by his side. The criminal, a
                    youth named Hödel, boasted of his socialist opinions and aims. A wave of anger
                    swept over the nation; and the reactionary party, fancying it had an opportunity
                    of laying a rough hand on far more than socialism, succeeded in inducing the
                    imperial Government to draw up without delay a severe measure, directed
                    nominally against the socialists, but in reality against all politicians
                    obnoxious to the conservatives. The bill was hurried through the federal council
                    and submitted to the diet. By that time the majority of the liberals had
                    recovered their self-control; and with the aid of the centre party they threw
                    out the proposed scheme by an immense majority. Parliament was prorogued, and it
                    was uncertain whether there would be any further attempt at repression.</p>
                <p>Suddenly the announcement came that the emperor had again been shot at, and that
                    this time he had been wounded. For some days Germany was convulsed with rage and
                    horror, and on all sides the cry was raised that now at last socialism must be
                    sternly dealt with. Taking courage, the Government dissolved parliament, and
                    pressure of every kind was put upon the electors to secure a thoroughly
                    reactionary diet. The country, however, reflected that, although it was
                    necessary to protect society, it might not be necessary to sacrifice the
                    liberties which it had with so much difficulty conquered. Accordingly, when the
                    new parliament assembled in August 1878, it was found that the liberals had not
                    sustained very serious losses. The progressists bitterly opposed the measure
                    introduced by the Government; but by some means Prince Bismarck managed, as he
                    had often done before, to overcome the objections of the national liberals. By
                    their support a law was passed which gave the police of the empire, for two
                    years and a half, enormous special powers. These powers were at once rigidly
                    enforced; and socialism appeared to vanish from the land. Whether, however, it
                    may not spring up in some great national crisis, all the stronger for the
                    sufferings of its adherents, is a point that can be determined only when some
                    great national crisis occurs.</p>
                <p>The socialists and the ultramontanes, without having anything else in common,
                    have joined in opposition to measures for promoting the national unity. They
                    have been aided by the Polish deputies, by the members for Alsace and Lorraine,
                    and by the so-called particularists, conservative politicians ardently attached
                    to the ancient customs and rights of the individual states. Notwithstanding this
                    formidable band of allies, considerable progress has been made in the task of
                    transforming a loose confederation of countries into a true nation. Between 1872
                    and 1875 utter anarchy in important departments of life was brought to an end by
                    laws relating to imperial coinage, imperial paper money, and the system of
                    banking. And in 1877 thorough investigation resulted in the appointment of a
                    supreme imperial tribunal (Reichsgericht). It was proposed that this tribunal
                    should sit in Berlin; but many liberals having no desire that that city should
                    assume in Germany the place which belongs in France to Paris, a large majority
                    decided for Leipsic. This was taken as a hint that, while Germany wishes to be
                    united, she will not voluntarily see herself transformed into a magnified
                    Prussia.</p>
                <p>In spite of their military strength, their victories, and the establishment of
                    their empire, the Germans are not, politically, a contented people; and the
                    reason is that they have outgrown their institutions. While a statesman of
                    extraordinary genius and authority stands in the way, a progressive system maybe
                    impossible; but the more intelligent classes have never lost the desire to add
                    to the hardly-earned national unity the crowning triumph of unfettered
                    representative government.</p>

                <p>PART HL—LANGUAGE.</p>
                <p>In its ordinary sense the name German Language or <hi rend="italic">Deutsche
                    Sprache</hi> is now generally used to denote, in all their stages from the
                    earliest time to the present day, the different languages and dialects of
                    Teutonic origin spoken in the German and Austrian empires and in Switzerland,
                    not including, however, the Frisian language, which once was spoken, and still
                    in a few remnants survives, on the shores and islands of the German Ocean, nor
                    the dialects of the Danish population of nortnern Schleswig. Flemish and Dutch,
                    although very closely connected with German, are likewise excluded. But the word
                    <hi rend="italic">Deutsch</hi> has also been, and still continues to be, used in
                    a wider sense. Jacob Grimm introduced it, in his famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deutsche Grammatik,</hi> as a comprehensive name for that family of the
                    so-called Indo-European or Aryan languages, for which English writers generally
                    use the name of “Teutonic,” and of which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n532/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0532-0515"/> the principal branches are represented by Gothic,
                    the Scandinavian languages, English, Frisian, and German. In this Grimm has had
                    many followers, but scarcely anywhere out of Germany; and even there the fact
                    that the name, in this application, besides being incorrect from an historical
                    point of view (as the word has never been used thus by any one of the people to
                    whom it has been applied by Grimm), is also liable to be misunderstood, has
                    caused a growing tendency towards confining it again to its original meaning
                    described above, and using <hi rend="italic">Germanisch,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Germanic,</hi> in the collective sense of the English “Teutonic.”
                    But even in the stricter sense the designation <hi rend="italic">Deutsch</hi> is
                    not of very long standing, nor has the word always been a real proper name for a
                    distinct people or tribe. In Bishop Ulfilas’s Gothic version of the Bible we
                    find the adverb <hi rend="italic">thiudisko (eθvικω&lt;s),</hi> Gal. ii. 14,
                    which is clearly a derivative from <hi rend="italic">thiuda (fθvο&lt;i),</hi>
                    meaning primarily “after the manner of the people.” German writers of tbe
                    earlier centuries were therefore as fully justified in calling their own
                    language <hi rend="italic">diutisc,</hi> or, in a Latinized form, <hi
                    rend="italic">theudiscus, theοtiscus,</hi> that is, their popular or vernacular
                    language, as were those mediaeval Latin writers of all nations who distinguished
                    their national languages by the name of <hi rend="italic">lingua vulgaris
                    irom.</hi> Latin, the only literary language fully acknowledged in their time.
                    It was not until the I Oth century that another Latinized form frequently used
                    in later times, viz., <hi rend="italic">teutonicus,</hi> began to be used
                    instead of the older <hi rend="italic">theοtiscus,</hi> of which the only rivals
                    in former times had been such local names as <hi rend="italic">frαnciscus
                    (frenkisc}</hi> or <hi rend="italic">saxoηi-cus,</hi> which were no doubt
                    derived from the names of single tribes, but were often also used in the same
                    comprehensive sense as <hi rend="italic">theotiscus,</hi> without necessarily
                    implying any allusion to dialectal differences between the languages of the
                    tribes they properly belonged to. The last name we have to mention here is the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">Germanus,</hi> with its different derivatives in the
                    modern languages, including the English form <hi rend="italic">German.</hi> Many
                    attempts have been made to elucidate the origin of this word, but as yet nothing
                    can be taken for certain beyond the fact that it is neither of Latin nor of
                    German origin. Most probably it was a Celtic word, and, according to what
                    Tacitus says in his <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi> (ch. ii.), it was originally
                    the name of a Celtic tribe, from which, by some strange error of the Roman and
                    Greek historians, it has been transferred to the non-Celtic inhabitants of
                    Germany. Accordingly the name has never been used by the Germans themselves
                    except in imitation of its use in the works of Latin writers.</p>
                <p>As to its geographical extension the German language has undergone very great
                    changes in the course of the last two thousand years. At the dawn of history no
                    Germans were to be found to the left of the Rhine, and even to the right of it
                    Celtic tribes occur in the earliest times. There were Celts also in the south of
                    the present Germany as far north at least as the Danube and the Main; Bohemia,
                    too, derives its name from an early Celtic population, the Boii. Only the
                    midland and north were inhabited by Germanic nations or tribes, stretching as
                    far east as Poland, and perhaps covering even parts of the adjoining territories
                    of Russia, where Slavonic and. Finnish tribes were their neighbours. But of
                    these Germanic tribes and their languages some have left no equivalents in our
                    modern German tribes and dialects. We have mentioned the Frisian language as not
                    belonging to German in its proper sense, although the Frisians have kept their
                    original residence up to the present day, and have always been in constant
                    connexion and frequent intercourse with their “German” neighbours. Many other
                    tribes have wandered from their seats and colonized other countries. It was as
                    late as the middle of the 5th century that the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons began
                    their voyages of conquest to England, where they founded a new people and a new
                    language,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">English Language,</hi> vol. viii. p. 390
                    sqq.</p></note> leaving their native soil open to Danish invasions. Much earlier
                    the midland tribes had already been slowly pushing on to the west and south, and
                    expelling or subduing and assimilating the Celtic owners of the territories they
                    invaded. But what was gained in these parts was counterbalanced by great losses
                    in the north and east. The territories about the lower and middle Elbe, Oder,
                    and Vistula, abandoned by the Lombards, the Burgundians, the Goths, and some
                    other Germanic tribes, as well as Bohemia, which for some short time had been in
                    the possession of the German Marcomans, were soon filled up by the immigration
                    of numerous tribes of the great Slavonic family. Without going into details of
                    the facts which are well known to the student of history,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For fuller particulars see C. Zeuss, Die
                    Deutschen und die Nαch-barstämme, Munich, 1837.</p></note> we may simply state
                    that, since about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when the great migration
                    of the nations had come to an end so far as Germany was concerned, no further
                    change of any great importance has taken place in the western and southern
                    parts. In the east the German population at this time did not go beyond a line
                    that may be drawn from about Kiel to the Böhmerwald, passing near Hamburg,
                    Magdeburg, ^Naumburg, Coburg, and Baireuth. As is well known, it is in later
                    centuries that almost all the eastern districts have been recovered for the
                    German language.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See G.
                    Wendt, Die Nationalität der Bevölkerung der Deutschen Ostmarken vor dem Beginne
                    der Germanisierung, Göttingen, 1878.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the 6th century the remains of the numerous smaller Germanic tribes, mentioned
                    before and during the migration of the nations, had consolidated into seven
                    larger bodies or aggregations of tribes. The Frisians still held the extreme
                    north of Holland and Germany. Their midland and eastern neighbours were then
                    called by the new name of Saxons, borrowed from the Saxons who had left the
                    Continent for England. In the main parts of the Netherlands and Belgium, along
                    both sides of the Rhine, and across Germany to the Thuringian and Bohemian
                    Forests, the powerful Frankish confederation had established itself, and it soon
                    incorporated the smaller and less vigorous tribes of the Hessians and
                    Thuringians, which were surrounded by the midland or eastern Franks, the Saxons,
                    and the Slavs. Alsatia, Switzerland, and South Germany eastward to the river
                    Lech were occupied by the Alemannians, while the inhabitants of the remaining
                    districts of the present Bavaria and Austria bore the collective name of
                    Bavarians.</p>
                <p>The history of the German language cannot be severed from the history of these
                    tribes, for Frisian, Saxon, Frankish (Hessian, Thuringian), Alemannian, and
                    Bavarian are the leading dialects of the Continental branch of the Teutonic
                    family. What Dr J. A. H. Murray has pointed out about the origin of the
                    principal English dialects<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See <hi rend="smallcaps">English Language,</hi> as above, p. 391.</p></note>
                    may equally well be said of these Continental idioms. Having no specimens of the
                    languages of the Continental tribes for nearly three centuries after their final
                    settlement, we cannot tell to what extent they originally agreed with or
                    differed from each other, although there must have been some dialectal
                    differences to begin with, which were afterwards increased and multiplied,
                    partly by phonetic changes (most probably resulting from scarcely discernible
                    phonetic peculiarities, which, even in the earliest times, must have prevailed
                    in those idioms), and partly by such alterations of the inflexional systems as
                    are known to occur frequently in all languages whose character is not merely
                    literary. But, however scanty our means of illustrating the earliest history of
                    these idioms may be, there is no doubt that they were not all of them related to
                    each other in the same <pb break="no"

                    distinguishable :—</p>
                <p>(1) Frisian and Saxon, whose nearest relation is English;</p>
                <p>(2) Frankish, Hessian, and Thuringian; and (3) Alemaunian and Bavarian. Frisian
                    is generally considered as a separate language. From Saxon the later Low German
                    dialects <hi rend="italic">{Niederdeutsche Mundarten)</hi> have sprung. The
                    members of the third group (generally designated as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oberdeutsch,</hi> or Upper German), combined with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mitteldeutsch,</hi> or the midland dialects, viz., Thuringian, Hessian, and
                    part of the Frankish dialects, are the sources of the later <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hochdeutsch</hi> or High German. The greatest difference prevails between the
                    first and third groups; the second may be characterized as containing various
                    transition dialects. The southern Frankish dialects are very closely akin to the
                    adjacent Upper German idioms, while Dutch, the utmost offshoot of the Frankish
                    language to the north, does not very materially differ from Saxon or Frisian in
                    the earliest period. The most striking phonetic feature of the languages of the
                    first group is their regular dropping of the nasal sounds before the spirants
                    <hi rend="italic">f, th, s,</hi> accompanied by subsequent lengthening of the
                    preceding vowels. Thus we have in Anglo-Saxon or Old English <hi rend="italic"
                    >fiif, after, cuft, gas</hi> (Mod. English <hi rend="italic">five, other, {uni)
                    couth, goose),</hi> in Old Frisian <hi rend="italic">fif, othar, cuth, gos,</hi>
                    in Old Saxon <hi rend="italic">fif, othar, cuth,gοs,</hi> corresponding to such
                    Gothic forms as <hi rend="italic">fimf, anthar, kunths,</hi> or the ordinary
                    High German <hi rend="italic">fünf, ander, kund,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gans.</hi> Since, however, Dutch partakes of this peculiarity to some extent,
                    we cannot easily form a decisive opinion as to the value of this fact as a
                    distinctive mark; but more stress may be laid on a very remarkable difference in
                    the inflexional system of the verb. Here the languages of the first group have
                    melted together the forms of the three persons of the plural number, thus <hi
                    rend="italic">we, ge, hie findaft,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fundon,</hi> we,
                    you, they find, or found, in Old English <hi rend="italic">∙,wi,gι, hia
                    findaft,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fundon</hi> in Old Frisian; <hi rend="italic"
                    >wi, gi, sia findaft,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fundon</hi> in Old Saxon. The
                    corresponding Old High German forms are <hi rend="italic">wir</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">findam,</hi><hi rend="italic">ir</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >findat,</hi><hi rend="italic">sie</hi><hi rend="italic">findant</hi> for the
                    present, <hi rend="italic">wir</hi><hi rend="italic">funium,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ir funtut,</hi><hi rend="italic">sie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >funtun</hi> for the perfect tense. Old Dutch joins, in this case, the German
                    branch; from <hi rend="italic">werthaη,</hi> to become, for instance, are
                    derived <hi rend="italic">wι werthun, gι werthift, sia τverthunt,</hi> &amp;c.
                    The declension of the substantives shows another remarkable difference. While
                    the languages of the first group have retained the original s in the nominative
                    plural of such words as Old English <hi rend="italic">dagas,</hi> days, Old
                    Saxon <hi rend="italic">dagos,</hi> or changed it to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi>
                    as Old Frisian <hi rend="italic">dagar,</hi> Dutch and German have dropped it
                    altogether, the corresponding forms being <hi rend="italic">daga</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">taga.</hi> These facts must be taken for decisive, as it seems to
                    be certain that they existed before any distinction of Low and High German in
                    their modern sense (a distinction chiefly dependent on subsequent changes in
                    their mute system) could be thought of. From a purely grammatical point of view,
                    Dutch, although generally considered a separate language (which no doubt it is,
                    with regard to its literary and political position), is entitled to claim a
                    closer relation to High German than even Low German, whose non· literary
                    character, taken along with the political union of northern and southern
                    Germany, has led to the current opinion that it is only a dialect of “German” in
                    its narrower sense. We do not mean to deny that there is, at present, a more
                    conspicuous conformity between Dutch and Low German than between Low German and
                    High German; but this is only due to the fact that High German, after the final
                    settlement of the German tribes, has deviated much more from its original
                    features than either Dutch or Low German. The most striking peculiarities of
                    High German, as opposed to all other Teutonic idioms, have mainly been caused by
                    the second or High German “Lautverschiebung,” or change of mute consonants,
                    which forme part of a long series of sound-changes generally comprehended under
                    the name of Germanische Lautverschiebung or Grimm’s Law. This Lautverschiebung
                    began, perhaps as early as the 7th century, in the south, and thence slowly
                    spread northward, but with decreasing vigour and consistency, Dutch and Low
                    German not being touched at all. It was only thus that the idiom of the
                    Netherlands Franks of the later centuries was separated from the dialects of
                    their “German” relations. Before, however, the first literary documents are met
                    with, this separation is complete; and we may therefore restrict ourselves here
                    to a short history of High and Low German alone.</p>
                <p>The German language presents, as do most of the cognate tongues, three maiu
                    stages of development,—Old, Middle, and Modern,—distinguished by their
                    inflexional and literary character. In accordance with Mr Henry Sweet’s
                    description of the stages of the English language,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See article <hi rend="smallcaps">English
                    Language,</hi> vol. viii. p. 391.</p></note> Old German may be defined as the
                    period of <hi rend="italic">full</hi> inflections (Old Low German, <hi
                    rend="italic">dages, dage, dagu∙, dagos, dago, dagun</hi>; Old High German, <hi

                    while the Middle period is that of <hi rend="italic">levelled</hi> inflections
                    (Middle Low German, <hi rend="italic">dages, dage, dagen∙,</hi> Middle High

                    it is chiefly the literary character that distinguishes Modern High German from
                    Low German and its own earlier stages. A special form of High German is
                    established in this period for all literary purposes, supplanting the dialects
                    both of Low and of High German that formerly were freely used in literary
                    intercourse. Assuming two periods of <hi rend="italic">transition</hi> besides,
                    we have the following divisions, with the approximate dates:</p>

                <p>The same divisions have to be made for Low German, but the scheme cannot be so
                    fully carried through, as the time between 1000 and 1200 is almost destitute of
                    literary monuments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Old German.—</hi> The inflexional characteristics of Old German
                    are almost identical with those of Old English. Nouns had the same five
                    cases,—nominative, accusative (only in a few instances kept distinct), genitive,
                    dative, and instrumental. Strong and weak declensions of nouns and their
                    subdivisions are likewise the same. The dual of the first and second personal
                    pronouns is almost extinct in Old High German, but is quite common in Low
                    German. In the verb we find the same distinction of the subjunctive from the
                    indicative mood, and the same two inflected tenses, present and past,—the former
                    also used for the future, the latter for all shades of past time. The order of
                    the sentence corresponds generally to the modern use, but is not kept so
                    strictly as now, especially in the oldest prose texts, which are often
                    materially influenced by the Latin sources from which they have been derived or
                    translated.</p>
                <p>The earliest extant specimen of Low German belongs to the beginning of the 9th
                    century. It is a short formula of renunciation of the devil to be used before

                <p>We cannot, unfortunately, tell what special dialect of Low German this piece
                    belonged to, nor even whether it was originally written in German, as several
                    forms occurring in it have rather an Old English look. No more certain are the
                    place of origin and the dialect of the most important relic of the Old Saxon
                    language, the great poem of the <hi rend="italic">Heliand,</hi> or the History
                    of our Saviour, composed in the old alliterative verse by a Saxon cleric or
                    monk, about the year 830. We quote as a specimen the following lines from the
                    Munich MS.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This MS.

                <p>Much more numerous and various in age and dialect are the documents of Old High
                    German, some of which date as far back as the 8th century. Welcome as they may
                    be to the student of grammar, not much can be said for their intrinsic value.
                    Almost all the prose pieces are mere translations (many of them could not be
                    worse) from the Latin; and even such poetical works as Otfrid’s <hi

                <p>High German, as already hinted, is chiefly distinguished from the other Teutonic
                    languages by a certain transformation of its mute system. The ordinary

                    language,—are the following:—d is changed to <hi rend="italic">t</hi> in all

                <p>This is the state of things in the High Frankish or Eastern Frankish dialect,
                    spoken in the south-east of the Frankish territory. In the earliest period, as
                    may be seen from the above list, it still preserved the <hi rend="italic"
                    >th</hi> sound in many cases; in the later stages <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is
                    found to have been substituted, as in Modern High German. The Upper German
                    dialects show the same change at a much earlier time, and, in addition to this,
                    they have also changed <hi rend="italic">k</hi> initial and following a
                    consonant into <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> initial into <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> (representing most likely voiceless soft stops, as still pronounced in
                    South Germany and Switzerland); Bavarian admits <hi rend="italic">p</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> even in the middle of words. Thus we have, for instance,
                    <hi rend="italic">denchen</hi> for Frankish i/wnføn, to think; <hi rend="italic"
                    >pitten</hi> for Frankish <hi rend="italic">bitten,</hi> to bid; <hi
                    rend="italic">keban,</hi> or Bavarian <hi rend="italic">kepan,</hi> for Frankish
                    <hi rend="italic">geban,</hi> to give. In illustration of these distinctions and
                    some other variations of spelling we may quote three contemporaneous versions of

                <p>It is impossible to give here a sufficient idea of the variability of Old High
                    German, as, indeed, out of several hundred pieces that have come to our
                    knowledge, there are not two representing exactly the same dialect to all its
                    shades or at least in exactly the same spelling. We shall therefore restrict
                    ourselves to a short notice of the more important documents. South-western
                    Frankish is best represented by a very old translation of a treatise by Isidorus

                    Germany. He not only carefully marks the quantities of vowels, but also points
                    out the phonetic difference between such diphthongs as <hi rend="italic"

                    that their power reaches to the end of the world?”</p>
                <p>It will be clear from what has been said above that the main feature of the Old
                    High German period is the total absence of a common literary language. No
                    voluntary modifications of the form of speech are to be found, but such as are
                    naturally involved in any attempt to adapt a spoken idiom to literary use.
                    Nevertheless it has been suggested by K. Müllenhoff<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See his Denkmäler, Introduction.</p></note>
                    and others that idioms of a more refined character than the ordinary popular
                    dialects were spoken at the principal courts of the empire, and especially at
                    the imperial court itself, and that the authority of these <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hofsprachen</hi> was great enough to exercise a modifying influence on the
                    literary productions throughout the empire, or in those parts at least where
                    High German was the vernacular speech. But how these suppositions can be proved
                    does not appear, or how they can be reconciled with the fact that all literary
                    documents of the period <hi rend="italic">are</hi> dialectal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Middle German.—</hi> The transition to Middle High and Low

                    Scherer, Geschichte der deutschen Literatur im XI. und XII. Jahrhundert,

                    specimens of poetry, and these of poor quality, the number of poems (mainly of a
                    theological bearing) dating from the 11th century is not inconsiderable, and the
                    12th century shows a rapidity of literary development almost unparalleled. At
                    first indeed religious and legendary poetry is still prevalent, but soon
                    literature begins to take a more historical or epic turn. This tendency is
                    clearly visible in the <hi rend="italic">Kaiserchronik,</hi> or Emperor’s
                    Chronicle, in which the first attempt is made to give a survey of universal and
                    German history in a poetical form. The romantic tales of Alexander the Great and
                    of the battle of Roncesvalles weretranslated from the French,— the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alexanderlied</hi> by the Pfaffe Lamprecht, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rolandslied</hi> by the Pfaffe Konrad; while old national traditions
                    contributed fitting subjects for such epic poems as that concerning the
                    adventures of the Lombard King Rother. Lyric poetry, hitherto altogether
                    neglected, sprang suddenly into vigour in the remote east of Austria about the
                    middle of the century, and soon found its way to other countries. But the most
                    decided advance was not made till about 1180, when the new forms of social life
                    that had crept in among the more cultivated classes, in imitation of the laws
                    and customs of French chivalry, began to exercise a powerful reforming influence
                    on all branches of poetry. The example set by the Netherlands poet, Heinrich von
                    Veldeke (who for some time lived, and partly wrote, in Germany), in his <hi
                    rend="italic">JEηeit,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> was soon followed
                    by the three great epic masters of the period, Hartmann von Λue, Gottfried von
                    Strasburg, and Wolfram von Eschenbach. About the same time the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nibelungenlied</hi> and other compositions of a more national character were
                    composed, while lyric poetry was raised to a height of excellence never attained
                    at any other period of the Middle Ages, and best represented in the songs of
                    Walther von der Vogelweide. It is true enough that this new chivalrous poetry
                    was not always very original in thought; indeed, most epic poems of this class,
                    and many lyric stanzas, have been directly copied from French models; but its
                    influence on the culture of the language was immense. It was then for the first
                    time that Germany possessed a real literary language, undoubtedly homogeneous as
                    far as style and metre are concerned. Whether a similar unity of the outer form
                    of speech had already been reached at that period is a point very difficult to
                    decide. The question was raised for the first time as early as 1820, by Karl
                    Lachmann, in his <hi rend="italic">Ausιvahl</hi><hi rend="italic">aus den
                    hochdeutschen Dichtern des</hi><hi rend="italic">XIII. Jahrh.</hi> Lachmann’s
                    opinion was that the poets of the 13th century spoke a definite, unchangeable
                    sort of High German, a few minor dialectal peculiarities being excepted, and
                    that uneducated scribes had been guilty of introducing older or corrupt forms of
                    the common speech into our manuscripts. These views were at the time unanimously
                    accepted, and are still held (though in a somewhat modified form, admitting two
                    literary idioms, one in the south, the other in the midland) by a majority of
                    the German philologists of the present day. As a consequence of this, most of
                    the “critical” editions of Middle High German poetry that have appeared since
                    Lachmann’s time do not reproduce the original readings of the manuscripts, but
                    give the texts in a “corrected” form, commonly called “correct Middle High
                    German,” which is assumed to appear in its purest form in the works of Hartmann
                    von Aue. It is chiefly Alemannian, or Swabian, with some Frankish peculiarities
                    of spelling in the use of the consonants, in order to produce a greater
                    resemblance to ordinary Modern High German orthography. No manuscript, however,
                    is known to be written in exactly the same language or orthography; nor are
                    there any poets, except those of Swabia, who do not clearly show by their rhymes
                    the existence of dialectal forms in their speech, All incongruities in the
                    rhymes disappear when they are transferred to the forms peculiar to the local
                    dialects of their authors.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This has been exemplified in a most masterly manner by W. Braune, va
                    Untersuchungen über Heinrich von Veldeke·, see Zeitschrift für deutsche
                    Philologie, iv. p. 279 sqq. Braune has conclusively shown that Heinrich von
                    Veldeke never tried to write German (although he wrote for German readers), as
                    had generally been supposed before, but simply wrote in his familiar Netherlands
                    dialect.</p></note> It was therefore but natural that a reaction against
                    Lachmann’s views should ultimately have set in;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See especially H. Paul, Gab es eine
                    mittelhochdeutsche Schrift-sprächet Halle, 1873. Paul seems, however, to go too
                    far in denying the existence of some peculiarities of style pointed out by
                    Lachmann and his followers.</p></note> and this reaction appears to have been
                    right in denying that dialectal forms were purposely and studiously avoided,
                    even by the classic authors of the period, with a view to the approximation of
                    their language to a certain universal idiom never existing anywhere but in the
                    fancy of certain modern writers. How injurious to the study of Middle High
                    German dialects the views of Lachmann, had they prevailed, must have been, it is
                    easy to see; but on the other hand it must not be forgotten that the only method
                    of investigating the dialects of the single authors was that followed by
                    Lachmann, viz., to reconstruct them by a careful study of the rhymes, for the
                    dialects of the manuscripts are often, nay in most cases, clearly different from
                    those of the writers themselves, as shown by the rhymes. It is therefore not so
                    much the principle of reconstruction that has been resisted by Lachmann’s
                    opponents as the way in which this reconstruction has been practically carried
                    out. For prose writings of course no such reconstruction is possible; still,
                    prose documents, especially such as were destined for local use only (charters,
                    &lt;fcc.), and therefore less liable to adulterations of the original, are often
                    the main sources for German dialectology.</p>
                <p>The prominent feature of German (Low German included) in this period is the
                    levelling of the unaccented vowels of the inflexional and some of the derivative
                    syl-tables<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n536/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0536-0519"/> already mentioned. As to the former there is only
                    one exception, viz., the retaining of the termination <hi rend="italic">iu</hi>
                    (pronounced as Modern German <hi rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> qt</hi> French long w) for the nom. sing. fem. and the nom. and acc.
                    plur. neutr. of the adjectives <hi rend="italic">(flindiu,</hi> while all other
                    cases have the levelled <hi rend="italic">e)</hi>; and even this seems to be a
                    speciality of Upper German, the corresponding Midland form being <hi
                    rend="italic">blinde</hi> as in Modern German. The unaccented <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> is frequently dropped in all dialects, especially in the south, where
                    the dropping is almost regular after an <hi rend="italic">r</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> closing a short syllable, as in <hi rend="italic">bern,
                    steln,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">bereu,</hi><hi rend="italic">stelen,</hi> to
                    bear, to steal; Old High German, <hi rend="italic">beraη, stelaη.</hi> In the
                    Midland dialects <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is often written for this <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> thus <hi rend="italic">berin, steliη.</hi> The accented
                    vowels of the root syllables are greatly changed in this period by the “Umlaut,”
                    or mutation of sounds, being an assimilation of these vowels to an <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">y</hi> originally following. Thus <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a, o,</hi><hi rend="italic">o, u, ü,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >uo</hi> are changed to e, ce, <hi rend="italic">Ü</hi> or ö, ce, w, <hi
                    rend="italic">iu</hi> (long <hi rend="italic">ü), üe,</hi> as may be seen in the
                    following instances :— <hi rend="italic">hant,</hi> hand, pl. <hi rend="italic"
                    >hende; rat,</hi> council, pl. <hi rend="italic">rcete; golt,</hi> gold, <hi
                    rend="italic">güldîn,</hi> golden, or <hi rend="italic">mohte,</hi> I might,
                    subj. <hi rend="italic">mohte; groz,</hi> great, <hi rend="italic">groeze,</hi>
                    size; <hi rend="italic">kus,</hi> a kiss, <hi rend="italic">küssen,</hi> to
                    kiss; <hi rend="italic">müs,</hi> mouse, pl. <hi rend="italic">miuse∙,
                    guot,</hi> good, <hi rend="italic">güete,</hi> goodness. The Umlaut, however, is
                    not always expressed in the spelling of the manuscripts, though it must have
                    existed in the living language. Of the diphthongs, <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> has
                    been changed into long <hi rend="italic">ü,</hi> but the old spelling is often
                    retained in the MSS. <hi rend="italic">(liute,</hi> modern <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leute,</hi> Old High German <hi rend="italic">liuti,</hi> people). As to the
                    consonants, the <hi rend="italic">th</hi> sound had nearly disappeared at the
                    beginning of the period, and was lost entirely in its course; <hi rend="italic"
                    >sk</hi> has passed into the <hi rend="italic">sh</hi> sound, written <hi
                    rend="italic">sch</hi> as in Modern German. Spelling in general is simpler, and
                    in some points more rigidly phonetic than in Old German. Final voiced
                    consonants, as <hi rend="italic">b, d, g,</hi> are generally changed into the
                    corresponding voiceless sounds, as <hi rend="italic">p, t, c</hi> (in High
                    German <hi rend="italic">grap,</hi> grave, gen. &lt;7rαδes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρfat,</hi> path, gen. <hi rend="italic">pfades, tac,</hi> day, gen. <hi
                    rend="italic">dages;</hi> in Low German <hi rend="italic">graf graves, pat
                    pades, dach dages).</hi> Double consonants are simplified in the same position,
                    as in Old German <hi rend="italic">{fal,</hi> ball, gen. <hi rend="italic"
                    >banes').</hi> The use of the letter <hi rend="italic">v</hi> has greatly
                    increased; in High German it means simply <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and is
                    therefore quite superfluous; in Low German its pronunciation is <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> at the beginning of words, while in the middle of words it
                    lias the same sound as English <hi rend="italic">v.</hi></p>
                <p>The leading dialects of the period are those of Old German, the most noteworthy
                    difference being the accession of the dialects of the kingdom of Saxony <hi
                    rend="italic">{Obersächsisch,</hi> or Upper Saxon) and Silesia to the midland
                    dialects, and those of some eastern provinces of Prussia <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Niedersächsisch,</hi> or Low Saxon) to Low German, in consequence of the
                    German colonization of these countries. Low German, to begin with, has retained
                    the phonetic structure of its consonantal system unaltered, except by the loss
                    of the <hi rend="italic">th</hi> sound. The spelling of the vowel system is very
                    imperfect. Umlaut is not expressed in the older manuscripts, except in the case
                    of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> A long <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> corresponds to both High German <hi rend="italic">ei</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> a long <hi rend="italic">o</hi> to High German
                    <hi rend="italic">ou, ou,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uo,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >üe,</hi> the only diphthong generally admitted being <hi rend="italic">ou</hi>
                    before a w, as in <hi rend="italic">hrnιwen,</hi> to hew. The pronunciation of ë
                    and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> must, however, in these cases have been different
                    according to their etymological values, for all the High German sounds mentioned
                    above are distinctly kept asunder in the modern Low German dialects, and <hi
                    rend="italic">ei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> or <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    are often written for ë and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> where they stand for High
                    German <hi rend="italic">ei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uo</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">üe,</hi> but never otherwise. It is most likely, judging from the
                    present state of things, that open <hi rend="italic">e,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >o</hi> were the equivalents for High German <hi rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ou, ou,</hi> while close <hi rend="italic">e,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> corresponded to High German <hi rend="italic">ie,
                    uo,</hi><hi rend="italic">üe.</hi> The préfixais dropped, as in English and in
                    the Scandinavian languages (thus <hi rend="italic">bort,</hi> birth, High German
                    <hi rend="italic">geburt).</hi> But the most remarkable fact in the history of
                    Low German sounds is the restoration of <hi rend="italic">nd</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ηn</hi> for <hi rend="italic">th</hi> after a dropped nasal sound
                    (see above, p. 516), as in <hi rend="italic">ander</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >anner,</hi> other, for Old Saxon <hi rend="italic">6thar,</hi> or in <hi
                    rend="italic">muηt,</hi> mouth, for Old Saxon <hi rend="italic">muth.</hi> This
                    transition cannot be explained by any phonetic laws, but must necessarily be
                    ascribed to High German influence. As to the inflexional system, a similar
                    influence seems to have introduced the High German terminations of the plural of
                    verbs <hi rend="italic">{wi geven, gi gevet, se geven</hi> we, you, they give).
                    The Old Saxon ∙* in the nominative plural has been dropped, as in High German.
                    The following lines quoted from the municipal laws of the town of Hamburg
                    (written 1270) maybe taken as a fair specimen of 13th-century Low German :—“Dat
                    nement syn erue verkopen schal, he ne bede id erst synen negesten. So we syn
                    erue vorkopen wil, dat bynnen desser stad vnde bynnen dessem wicbelde belegen
                    is, de schal id beden twen synen negesten vrunden, dar syn erue vp vallen mach,
                    vnde wil it erer nen kopen, so mot he syn erue wol vorkopen deme de erne dar
                    vmme allermest geuen wil.” “That nobody shall sell his inheritance, unless he
                    offer it first to his nearest (relations). Whosoever is willing to sell his
                    inheritance, that is situated within this town and within these precincts, shall
                    offer it to two his nearest friends (relations), to whom his inheritance may
                    fall, and if neither of them is willing to buy it, he must (may) well sell his
                    inheritance to him who is willing to give him most for it.”</p>
                <p>The differences of the main dialects of High German are not very striking during
                    the first stage of this period. Alemannian is best characterized by its rigidly
                    keeping its original vowel qualities, some of the modern Swiss dialects showing
                    exactly the same system as about 1200. Swabian is easily discovered by its
                    frequent use of <hi rend="italic">au</hi> for <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> as in
                    <hi rend="italic">gaun,</hi> to go, for <hi rend="italic">gaη.</hi> A very
                    important change of vowel qualities is found to have taken place, at a very
                    early time, in the Bavarian dialect. While <hi rend="italic">ie, uo, He</hi>
                    were preserved as in Alemannian, <hi rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou,
                    ou</hi> were changed into <hi rend="italic">oei</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">ai),
                    au, eu</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">au),</hi> and three new diphthongs, <hi
                    rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou, eu,</hi> sprang up from the long
                    vowels <hi rend="italic">ï, Û,</hi><hi rend="italic">iu (u).</hi> In the Midland
                    dialects again, <hi rend="italic">ei, mi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ï, ü,
                    ü</hi> were kept, as in Alemannian (although <hi rend="italic">ü</hi> is
                    generally not distinguished from <hi rend="italic">u</hi> in writing, as in most
                    Midland manuscripts no special signs for the Umlaut vowels are u≡ed, except <hi
                    rend="italic">e),</hi> but <hi rend="italic">ie, uo,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >üe</hi> were contracted to simple <hi rend="italic">ï, ü</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(u),</hi> differing from the old <hi rend="italic">ï, ü,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >iu</hi> only in their open quality. The system of these changes may be
                    illustrated by the following list :—</p>

                    exercise discipline with the ban).”</p>
                <p>In the 14th and 15th centuries the development of the dialects rapidly advanced.
                    The greatest changes were those occurring in the vowel system. The new
                    diphthongs <hi rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou, eu,</hi> for older z,
                    w, <hi rend="italic">iu,</hi> which had originated in the southeastern parts of
                    the Bavarian district gradually spread to the north and west; even some of the
                    South Midland dialects, as Bohemian and Silesian, began to partake of this
                    change, while the north Midland dialects and Alemannian remained unaltered.
                    Short root syllables ending in a single consonant began to be lengthened in
                    almost all dialects, as <hi rend="italic">geben,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >riemeη,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">geben,</hi><hi rend="italic">nemen,</hi> to
                    give, to take. Unaccented <hi rend="italic">e</hi> was dropped in the southern
                    dialects, especially in Bavarian, to the utmost extent possible. Such forms as
                    <hi rend="italic">pschoech,</hi><hi rend="italic">gtorst, hcert,</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">beschoehe,</hi> happened (subj.), <hi rend="italic">getorste,</hi>
                    I durst, <hi rend="italic">gehoeret,</hi> heard (part.), began to be quite
                    familiar. Even before a final <hi rend="italic">l</hi> or nasal sound <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> was now and then dropped in Bavarian, as in&lt;7eδm for <hi
                    rend="italic">geben,</hi> to give, <hi rend="italic">gegnt</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">eg</hi><hi rend="italic">ende</hi>
                    country, which are exactly the forms still used in our time. Midland and Low
                    German dialects continued to be much more conservative in all these respects. In
                    the consonantal system we have to mention the loss of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >2</hi> sound in all dialects, where it was a simple spirant (notis); although
                    the letter <hi rend="italic">z</hi> was still often preserved in spelling, it
                    was frequently confounded with s in the rhymes, a thing which never occurred in
                    the earlier centuries. Alemannian is chiefly distinguished by its constant
                    change of <hi rend="italic">sm, sn, sl, sw, sp, st</hi> into <hi rend="italic"
                    >schm, schn,</hi><hi rend="italic">seid,</hi><hi rend="italic">schιv,
                    schp,</hi><hi rend="italic">seht,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">schmit,</hi>
                    smith, <hi rend="italic">sehne,</hi> snow, <hi rend="italic">schlahen,</hi> to
                    slay, <hi rend="italic">schwimmen,</hi> to swim, <hi rend="italic"
                    >geschproehen</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> spoken, <hi rend="italic"
                    >geischtlich,</hi> “ghostly,” spiritual. Late Bavarian favours such spellings as
                    <hi rend="italic">chrankch, pekch,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">krank,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">becke.</hi> Spelling in general was much neglected, although it
                    was not quite so bad as often in the 1Gth century, when there was a strong
                    tendency towards crowding as many letters into a word as possible.</p>
                <p>While the 15th century was thus marked by great divergencies of the spoken
                    dialects, important steps towards gaining a greater uniformity of literary
                    speech were made in the same period by the invention of the art of printing, and
                    by the development of certain <hi rend="italic">Kanzleisprachen,</hi> or
                    literary idioms of the imperial and other chanceries. There is no need to
                    explain how the habit of reading books printed in dialects not familiar to the
                    reader must have obliged the learned public of the time to acquire a certain
                    amount of knowledge of dialects in general, and must have made them better aware
                    of the peculiarities of their own idioms than was either necessary or possible
                    at the time when manuscripts written expressly in the local dialects of the
                    readers were the only means of conveying literary information. Besides, writers
                    as well as printers must soon have found it profitable to publish their works in
                    a language readily understood by readers in all parts of the country. The
                    principal work, however, was doue in Germany by the chanceries. Among these the
                    imperial chancery naturally held the most prominent position; and, inasmuch as
                    its public acts were addressed to readers of all dialects existing throughout
                    the empire, it obviously had also the greatest interest in calling into
                    existence a general idiom. In the 14th century no difference between the
                    language of the imperial chancery and the local idioms of the particular
                    emperors was yet visible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Louis of Bavaria (1314-1347) were written in the Bavarian dialect. The
                    succession of Charles IV. (1347-1378) was accompanied by the introduction of the
                    Bohemian dialect into the imperial charters. This dialect, as was natural from
                    its local position, was neither purely Southern nor purely Midland. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou, eu</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ï,
                    ü,</hi><hi rend="italic">iu</hi> were frequently adopted from the Southern
                    dialects, but <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> for <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> for <hi rend="italic">b</hi> were generally rejected;
                    unaccented vowels were preserved to about the same extent as in Midland German.
                    In the reign of Wenceslaus of Bohemia (1378-1400) the same state of things was
                    maintained; but in the charters of Rupert, the elector palatine (1400-1410), we
                    find the Midland dialect of the Palatinate. Sigismund (1410-1437) reintroduced
                    the Bohemian dialect, which by this time had, with the exception of a very short
                    period, prevailed for nearly a hundred years in the imperial chancery. It was
                    therefore but natural that Duke Frederick of Austria should exchange the
                    Austrian dialect of his ducal chancery (which abounded with <hi rend="italic"
                    >kch, kh, kg [oxk,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> for δ) for the Bohemian
                    chancery dialect of his predecessors, when he succeeded to the imperial throne
                    (1470-1493). His example was followed by Maximilian (1493-1519), but only so far
                    as public Acts were concerned. In charters destined for local Austrian use as
                    well as in his private correspondence he always kept his vernacular Austrian
                    dialect, showing thus that no change of the spoken idioms had been caused as yet
                    by the introduction of the new artificial language. In the same manner and at
                    the same time the Midland dialect of the electoral chancery of Saxony came to be
                    better adapted for general use by the adoption of the Southern <hi rend="italic"
                    >ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou, eu</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ï, ü,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">iu,</hi> and the abolition of several prominent Midland
                    peculiarities.</p>

                    tried to give a short sketch of the origin of literary Modern High German; and
                    it is this very idiom of the imperial and Saxon chanceries that Luther made
                    afterwards popular by his translation of the Bible and his numerous other
                    writings. We may quote his own words in confirmation :— .</p>
                <p>“Ich habe keine gewisse, sonderliche, eigne spräche im deutschen, sondern brauche
                    der gemeinen deutschen spräche, das mich beide Ober-und Niederländer verstehen

                    grammarians, as Sebastian Franck (1531) and Johannes Clajus (1578), and was
                    accordingly imitated, as the <pb break="no"

                    the 1Cth century many writers, especially in Switzerland and Lower Germany,
                    still clung with great pertinacity to their native dialects. But about 1600
                    Luther’s language was fully established as the only idiom of literary
                    intercourse throughout Germany.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    mostly concern the inflexional system. In the strong verbs the differences
                    between the singular and plural and the indicative and subjunctive of the past
                    have been levelled in the course of time: thus, <hi rend="italic">ich
                    fand,</hi><hi rend="italic">zvir</hi><hi rend="italic">fanden,</hi> I, we found,
                    subj. <hi rend="italic">ich fände,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ich schnitt, wir
                    schnitten,</hi> I, we cut, for <hi rend="italic">ich fand·, wir fanden, ich
                    fände,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ich schneit, ivir schnitten.</hi> At present
                    the verb <hi rend="italic">werden,</hi> to become, is the only specimen left of
                    the old regular inflexion :— <hi rend="italic">ich</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ward,</hi><hi rend="italic">wir</hi><hi rend="italic">ιvurden,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ich würde’,</hi> but even here a new irregular form, <hi
                    rend="italic">ich wurde,</hi> has come into use and almost superseded the more
                    archaic <hi rend="italic">ich</hi><hi rend="italic">ward,</hi> which is now
                    chiefly confined to poetry. Many other vowel changes have taken place besides,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">ιvebe,</hi><hi rend="italic">wob, gewoben,</hi> weave,
                    wove, woven, for Middle High German <hi rend="italic">wibe, reap, geweben,</hi>
                    so that the old system of “Ablaut,” or vowel change in the root syllables of the
                    strong verbs has often become quite indistinct. A great number of verbs have
                    passed from the strong inflexion to the weak, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> The declension of substantives has also been greatly altered. Umlaut
                    is now regularly used as a plural sign with most monosyllabic and many
                    dissyllabic masculine words, as in <hi rend="italic">baum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bäume,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nagel, nagel,</hi> for Middle High German <hi
                    rend="italic">bourn, bourne,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nagel, nagele-,</hi>
                    originally it was confined to a much smaller number of words (7-stems, as <hi
                    rend="italic">gast, gäste,</hi> Middle High German <hi rend="italic"
                    >gast,</hi><hi rend="italic">geste).</hi> Other masculine words have adopted the
                    plural-er, together with Umlaut of the root syllables, from the neuter
                    declension, as <hi rend="italic">mann, männer,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >geist,</hi><hi rend="italic">geister,</hi> besides frequent exchanges between
                    the strong and weak declensions, which cannot be specified here. The strong and
                    the weak declension of feminine words originally ending in <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> have been melted together, one form (ending in <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    or a consonant) being used for all singular, and one (ending in <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi> or <hi rend="italic">η</hi> after a consonant) for all
                    plural cases, as &lt;∕cιδe, <hi rend="italic">gaben, zahl, zahlen,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">zuηge,</hi><hi rend="italic">Zungen,</hi> for Middle High German
                    <hi rend="italic">gäbe, gäbe,</hi> gen. and dat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >gäben-,</hi><hi rend="italic">zαl,</hi><hi rend="italic">zal,</hi> gen. and

                    >Zungen,</hi> pl. <hi rend="italic">Zungen</hi> throughout. As to phonology, no
                    change of vowel quality is noticeable in literary German. Modern High German
                    still has the Midland sounds 7 (often spelt <hi rend="italic">ie),</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ü,</hi><hi rend="italic">ü,</hi> for Southern <hi rend="italic"
                    >ie, uo,</hi><hi rend="italic">üe,</hi> as well as the Bavarian diphthongs <hi
                    rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">au, eu</hi> (αw), for the older sounds
                    7, <hi rend="italic">u, iu,</hi> the latter not being distinguished either in
                    spelling or in educated pronunciation from the older diphthongs <hi
                    rend="italic">ei,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou,</hi><hi rend="italic">on.</hi> We
                    have thus <hi rend="italic">zwei, drei,</hi><hi rend="italic">baum,</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">vronde, hiuser, liute.</hi> Change of vowel quantity is the most
                    prominent phonetic feature of Modern High German when compared with the earlier
                    stages of the language. All root-syllables ending formerly in a short vowel
                    followed by a simple consonant have now become long, either by lengthening the
                    vowel or by doubling the consonant, thus <hi rend="italic">täg, täge,
                    säl,</hi><hi rend="italic">bote,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gott, gottes,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">blatt, blätter,</hi> for AIiddle High German <hi rend="italic"
                    >tag</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">täc), täge,</hi><hi rend="italic">sal, bote,
                    got, gδtes, blat, bleter.</hi> The rules for dropping unaccented vowels have
                    often been changed accordingly. It must not be forgotten, however, that all
                    these rules are only applicable to the literary idiom; the dialects, and even
                    those of the educated people, often differ very materially from the rules laid
                    down above. There is, indeed, no such thing as a generally recognized standard
                    pronunciation of German, except perhaps on the stage, which no doubt has
                    exercised and still exercises a certain influence on the cur rent opinions as to
                    how one ought to pronounce, but has not been powerful enough to abolish all
                    dialectal peculiarities in the case of even the highest classes. Only a very few
                    general rules can be given. Englishmen will do well to pronounce the vowels as
                    in Italian: <hi rend="italic">ü</hi> and <hi rend="italic">'o</hi> are rounded
                    or labialized <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> sounds,
                    formed by pouting the lips while trying to pronounce <hi rend="italic">i</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> Long vowels are always pronounced simple, never as
                    diphthongs (which is frequently the case in English, especially with <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o).</hi> Unaccented <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> is invariably dropped in the terminations <hi rend="italic">el,</hi><hi

                    >häbm,</hi><hi rend="italic">nem</hi> (with a lengthened <hi rend="italic"

                    easily detected by their generally inserting a real vowel-sound before the l,
                    n.</p></note> Among the peculiarities of the consonantal system we may mention
                    the sound of <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> (in two distinct varieties as in <hi
                    rend="italic">αch</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ich),</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >z,</hi> which is a combination of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi

                    trilled with the tip of the tongue, but is often pronounced as a uvular or
                    guttural sound. <hi rend="italic">S</hi> initial is generally sounded like the
                    English 2, in stage pronunciation, but not usually elsewhere; <hi rend="italic"
                    >st</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sp</hi> initial are never pronounced on the stage
                    like English <hi rend="italic">st</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sp,</hi> but are
                    always <hi rend="italic">sht, slip,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">stein,
                    spiel,</hi> pronounced (to use English spelling) as <hi rend="italic">shtine,
                    shpeel.</hi> The English <hi rend="italic">10</hi> ought to be avoided. The
                    German <hi rend="italic">w</hi> sound is more like English <hi rend="italic"
                    >v,</hi> but somewhat softer; in Midland pronunciation a sound intermediate
                    between English <hi rend="italic">w</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> takes its
                    place. German <hi rend="italic">v</hi> is simply ∕.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The varieties of the German dialects of the present are too numerous to be
                    described here. It may suffice to state that the old divisions of Low German,
                    Midland, and Upper German dialects are still applicable. Among the first, the
                    Western or Westphalian dialects are distinctly marked by the pronunciation of
                    <hi rend="italic">g</hi> initial as a <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> or voiced <hi
                    rend="italic">ch</hi> (sometimes even voiceless), and the use of numerous
                    diphthongs, both long and short, instead of simple vowels. The principal
                    subdivisions of Midland German are the Lower Rhenish or Middle Frankish dialect
                    (including the German dialects of Transylvania), South-Western and Eastern or
                    High Frankish, Hessian, Thuringian, Saxon, and Silesian. Alemannian is divided
                    into the three main groupsof Swabian, Alsatian, and Swiss, while Bavarian is
                    constituted by several subdialects spoken in Bavaria and Austria. The study of
                    these dialects has been carried on in Germany for a considerable time,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A very full list of books
                    referring to German dialectology has been given by C. H. Herrmann, Bibliotheca

                    especially so far as phonology is concerned; for many observers, while
                    well-trained in all the disciplines of the older school of philology, have been
                    totally ignorant of the simplest laws of phonetics. It is only within the last
                    few years that the value of phonetic studies (although they began in German
                    researches) has been duly recognized in the country of their origin, and
                    dialectology has not hitherto gained much by the more theoretical study of
                    general phonetics. Some excellent beginnings indeed have been made, among which
                    Dr Winteler’s book on his native Swiss dialect holds by far the foremost
                    rank;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J. Winteler, Die

                    Counties of Scotland, published in 1873.</p></note> but it is probable that a
                    long time must yet elapse before Germany can possess so well trained and
                    independent a school of phonetists as that which already exists in England
                    headed by Mr A. Melville Bell and Mr Alexander J. Ellis. Not till then, however,
                    can a real history of the German language be written. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.

                <p>There is a deep vein of poetry in the Teutonic nature, and it appears to have
                    revealed itself in the earliest ages. According to Tacitus, the Germans of his
                    time had ancient songs relating to the god Tuisco, his son Mannus, and the three
                    forefathers of the Teutonic race. They had also poems in honour of Arminius, the
                    original subject of which was probably the god Irmin, whose pillar Charles the
                    Great overthrew long afterwards in his first campaign against the Saxons. A song
                    called “barditus,” celebrating the greatness of the war-god whom Tacitus calls
                    Hercules, was sung or chanted by the freemen as they advanced to battle. The
                    name “barditus” led some ingenious writers of the 18th century to speculate
                    respecting an order of bards among the ancient Germans; but there is no evidence
                    that any such order existed. “Barditus” meant in the first instance a shield,
                    and was transferred to the song because, while the singing went on, the shield
                    was held to the mouth to make the sound more terrible. It is the opinion of many
                    critics that the stories of “Reynard the Fox” and “Isengrim the Wolf” may be
                    traced back to these remote times. If so, the probability is that they were
                    brought by the Teutons from Asia, and were originally common to the Aryan
                    family. There is every reason to believe that some elements of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> belong to the prehistoric age. The legend of
                    Siegfried has all the marks of extreme antiquity, and it seems to have had at
                    first a purely mythological character. Of the rhythm in which these primitive
                    conceptions were embodied we have no certain knowledge; but as the most ancient
                    poems which have been preserved are in alliterative verse, it is reasonable to
                    assume that this had grown up long before writing came into use.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">The Early Middle Age.—</hi> When the German tribes began to
                    accept Christianity the clergy every where opposed the native poetry, and strove
                    to replace its rude conceptions by the milder imagée of the gospel. Among the
                    Goths of the 4th century Bishop Ulfilas took the most effectual means of
                    achieving his purpose by preparing a clear, faithful, and simple rendering of
                    the Scriptures,—a translation which has been of inestimable value in the
                    scientific study of the Teutonic languages. No clergyman of like genius arose in
                    Germany itself; but there, too, pagan compositions were steadily discouraged.
                    Charles the Great was the first to check this hostile movement. He showed his
                    love of his native speech, not only by beginning to put together a German
                    grammar, but by issuing orders for a collection of old German poetry. Louis the
                    Pious had little sympathy with the taste of his father, but he could not efface
                    the impression produced by the great emperor. Many of the clergy ceased to
                    dislike that which so mighty a friend of the church had approved, and in some
                    monasteries there were ardent collectors of ancient epic fragments and
                    ballads.</p>
                <p>These treasures of Old High and Low German literature are nearly all lost, but
                    from the small portions which have come down to us, and from hints in Latin
                    chronicles, we can at least make out the themes with which many of them dealt.
                    Ermanrick, or Ermanaricus, the famous Gothic king of the 4th century, was the
                    subject of a large number of poetical legends. Siegfried continued to be a great
                    epic hero, and from about the 7th century he appears to have been no longer
                    treated as superhuman. The legend of the overthrow of the Burgundian king,
                    Gundicarius or Günther, by Attila assumed many forms, and was at a later time
                    connected with the story of Siegfried. Around the name of Theodoric the East
                    Goth, as Dieterich, several legends soon grouped themselves; and from about the
                    9th century he was associated with Attila, with whom in history he had nothing
                    to do. Unfortunately, the fragments which have been preserved—all of which are
                    alliterative—do not treat of these supreme heroes; their subjects are of
                    subordinate importance and interest. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hildebrandsl·ied,</hi> which was written from traditional narratives early in
                    the 9th century, and is in a mixed dialect, introduces us to a follower of
                    Dieterich. Hildebrand, returning from the wars carried on by his lord, is
                    compelled to fight his own son; but we are left in uncertainty whether father or
                    son is conqueror. The <hi rend="italic">Ludwigslied</hi> is a ballad of the
                    latter part of the 9th century, written in honour of a victory gained over the
                    Northmen by Louis III., the West-Frankish king. The author was probably a monk
                    who had been a favourite at the court of Charles the Bald. There is also an Old
                    High German ballad celebrating the reconciliation of Otto I. with his brother
                    Henry; and similar ballads are known to have kept up the fame of Duke Ernest of
                    Swabia, who rebelled against Conrad II., and of many other popular heroes.
                    Walter of Aquitania, who flies with his bride fpm the court of Attila, and at
                    Worms fights King Günther and his warriors, is the hero of a Latin poem of the
                    10th century, written by a mouk of St Gall, whose materials were evidently taken
                    from a more vigorous German original. The <hi rend="italic">Merseburger</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gediçhte,</hi> two songs of enchantment, were written in the 10th
                    century, but must have come down from a much more remote period. They are
                    chiefly interesting for the light they throw upon the religious beliefs and
                    customs of ancient Germany.</p>
                <p>The old ballads, which were intended to be sung as well as recited, were handed
                    down from generation to generation, and necessarily underwent many changes. They
                    were preserved from an early period in the memory of the people by professional
                    minstrels, who were held in considerable honour in the time of Charles the
                    Great, but were afterwards rather tolerated than encouraged by the higher
                    classes. Many of them were blind men, and in their solitary wanderings the
                    ancient stories must often have assumed in their minds new shapes. They usually
                    accompanied their singing with the zither or the harp.</p>
                <p>Of the works with which the church sought to counteract pagan influences very few
                    remain. The most important is <hi rend="italic">Heliand,</hi> a Low German poem
                    in alliterative verse said to have been written by a Saxon at the request of
                    Louis the Pious. It is a narrative of the life of Christ, and follows closely
                    the Four Gospels, whose separate accounts it attempts to harmonize. The author
                    has considerable force and freedom of expression, and seems to have been so
                    absorbed in the grandeur of his theme as to have deliberately rejected
                    rhetorical ornament. The so-called <hi rend="italic">Krist</hi> of Otfrid, a
                    High German poet, who dedicated his work to Louis the German, has the same
                    subject, but is not nearly so effective. It is the first rhymed German poem, and
                    the necessities of rhyme often compel Otfrid to fill out his line with words and
                    phrases which obscure his meaning. His lyrical passages are too didactic to rank
                    as genuine poetry. The fragment of <hi rend="italic">Muspilli,</hi> a Bavarian
                    poem of the 9th century on the Last Judgment, indicates power of a much higher
                    order. Its form is alliterative; and reminiscences of paganism are strangely
                    mingled with its Christian ideas.</p>
                <p>Duriug the reigns of Charles the Great and Louis the Pious secular learning was
                    zealously cultivated in the monasteries of Germany as well as in those of other
                    portions of the Frankish empire. The school established by Hrabanus Maurus in
                    the famous abbey of Fulda vied with that of Tours, where Hrabanus had been a
                    pupil <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n540/mode/1up"

                    the wars with the Northmen, with the Magyars, and with the Slavs under the later
                    Carolingian kings, many of the ecclesiastical institutions were destroyed; but
                    they sprang up again under the protection of Henry I. From the time of his son
                    Otto I. the Germans stood in direct relation with Italy; the marriage of Otto
                    II. with the princess Theophano brought them into connexion with the learning
                    and refinement of the Byzantine court and Gerbert, the friend of Otto III.,
                    afterwards Pope Silvester II., introduced them to some of the achievements of
                    Arabian science. These influences quickened the energies of enlightened
                    churchmen, and originated an intellectual movement which to some extent
                    continued during the vigorous reigns of the first two Franconian sovereigns,
                    Conrad II. and Henry III. The chief subject of study was the scholastic
                    philosophy, to which, however, in its earlier stages, Germany made no supremely
                    important contribution. The Neo-Platonic tendencies of Scotus Erigena were
                    opposed by Hrabanus Maurus, who remained loyal to Aristotle and Boetius; and his
                    example was generally followed, not only by his successors in Fulda, but by the
                    members of all other German schools. The school of St Gall was exceptionally
                    active, and one of the monks, Notker Labeo, who died in 1022, wrote some
                    original philosophical books, and translated into German the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consolatione</hi> of Boetius and two of Aristotle’s
                    works. In pure literature very little was done; but there are several
                    well-written Latin histories belonging to the 11th century. The best thought of
                    the age was manifested in its Romanesque architecture, and in the then
                    subordinate arts of painting, sculpture, and music.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">The Age of Chivalry.—</hi> The reign of Henry IV., during
                    which the struggle between the empire and the papacy began, had a disastrous
                    effect on the national culture; and the evil was not remedied under the
                    disturbed rule of his two immediate successors. But under the Hohenstaufen
                    dynasty, during the period of Middle High German, the country passed through one
                    of the greatest epochs of its literature. The more learned of the clergy
                    interested themselves deeply in the development of scholasticism through the
                    nominalists and the realists; and in the 13th century Albertus Magnus, a native
                    of Swabia, produced the first systematic exposition of Aristotle, in the full
                    light of Arabian research. It was, however, in poetry that Germany achieved the
                    highest distinction; and her most important poets were members of the knightly
                    class, which at this time rose to its utmost power and fame. There were many
                    reasons why the members of this class became sensitive to the higher influences
                    of the imagination. In the first place, they had the elevating consciousness of
                    a life shared with a vast community which set before itself the loftiest aims.
                    Historians sometimes take a malicious pleasure in contrasting the mean
                    performance of many knights with their high vows; but these vows at any rate
                    introduced into the life of rough nobles an ideal element, and inclined them to
                    take interest in the gentler and nobler aspects of existence. In the Italian
                    wars of Frederick Barbarossa the German knights saw more than they had ever
                    before done of Southern civilization, and their minds were continually
                    stimulated by the varying fortunes of their adventurous emperor. Of still
                    greater importance was the influence of the crusades, in which the Germans first
                    took an active part under Frederick’s predecessor, Conrad III. The crusaders had
                    a remote and unselfish aim, connected with all that was most sacred and most
                    tender in their religious ideas; and this alone would have created a sentiment
                    favourable to poetic aspiration. But, besides this, the far-off Eastern lands,
                    with their strange peoples and mystical associations, awoke dreams which could
                    not have other than harmonious utterance, and on the return of the warriors they
                    stirred the fancy of their friends with reports of a new and greater world.
                    While the crusades lasted,the knights were forced into intimate acquaintance
                    with the clergy, whose refined culture inevitably to some extent softened their
                    rudeness; they also formed friendships with representatives of French chivalry.
                    In France the works of the troubadours and the trouvères formed one of the most
                    prominent elements of the national life, and the French nobles did not forget in
                    Palestine the songs and romances of their home. The better minds in the German
                    armies caught the inspiration, and longed to distinguish themselves by like
                    achievements. And their desire was deepened when, by the acquisition of the Free
                    County of Burgundy, Frederick Barbarossa opened a new pathway by which
                    intellectual influences might pass from the western to the eastern bank of the
                    Rhine.</p>
                <p>The poetic impulse which thus entered Germany affected a wide circle; the highest
                    princes as well as the humblest knights felt its power. Even the emperor Henry
                    VI. himself is said to have been moved by the prevailing feeling, and to have
                    composed verses. At the imperial and princely courts poets were encouraged to
                    give expression to their genius; and the ladies whose beauty and virtues they
                    delighted to praise stimulated their endeavours by marked appreciation. Thus the
                    national imagination found in the whole temper of the age an atmosphere well
                    adapted to the blooming of its first spring-time.</p>
                <p>The most characteristic outcome of this active era is the series of poetical
                    romances produced in the 12th and 13th centuries. The German poets might have
                    found magnificent material in their old, native legends; but for the most part
                    they preferred subjects which had already been artistically wrought by the
                    trouvères, whose methods and style they also closely imitated. Among the themes
                    they selected may be mentioned the legends of Alexander the Great, of Charles
                    the Great and his paladins, of Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, with
                    the allied legend of the Holy Grail. The fortunes of Tristram and Iseult also
                    exercised a powerful charm over many minds. These and all other chosen subjects
                    were treated wholly in the spirit of chivalry. The poets of the Middle Age had
                    no idea of being true to the characteristics of a particular epoch; their own
                    time was the only one they attempted to understand. Ancient heroes became in
                    their hands mediaeval knights; men who had died long before the rise of
                    Christianity were transformed into devoted servants of the Church. And in every
                    romance the supreme aim was to present an idealized picture of the virtues of
                    knighthood.</p>
                <p>One of those who prepared the way for the chief romancewriters was Conrad, a
                    priest in the service of Henry the Proud, who, before 1139, composed the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rolaηdslied,</hi> setting forth, in imitation of the French <hi
                    rend="italic">Chanson de Poland,</hi> the overthrow of Roland, the favourite
                    paladin of Charles the Great, in the pass of Roncesvalles. He was followed by
                    another priest, Lamprecht, who, also working upon a French original, relates in

                    Alexaηderlied</hi> the deeds of the Macedonian hero. Greater than either of
                    these was Heinrich von Veldeke, the first of the poets who may claim to rank as
                    German trouvères. His great work was <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    only in armour and in dress that Virgil’s characters are here changed; in
                    thought and feeling they are recreated. The language of the poem is so carefully
                    chosen, and the incidents are narrated with so much spirit, that it is still
                    possible to understand the immense popularity it once enjoyed. Hartmann von Aue,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Der Arme</hi><hi rend="italic">Heinrich</hi> and other
                    poems, selected themes that are extremely repulsive to modern feeling; but he
                    was endowed with genuinely plastic force, and interests us by touching certain
                    mystical -aspects of mediaeval sentiment<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n541/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0541-0524"/>. The master in whom these aspects were most fully
                    represented was Wolfram von Eschenbach, a member of a noble family of Franconia,
                    who wa3 born during the reign of Frederick Barbarossa and died during that of
                    his grandson, Frederick II. He was one of a group of poets who established
                    themselves at the Wartburg, the court of the brilliant landgrave Hermann of
                    Thuringia; and his chief poem, <hi rend="italic">Parzival,</hi> was composed
                    there towards the end of the 12th century. Germany did not produce during the
                    Middle Ages a more truly poetic mind, and it is curious to observe how exactly
                    he anticipated some of the qualities for which she long afterwards became
                    famous. He has all the dreaminess, the sentiment, the passion for the ideal,
                    which are, or rather at one time were, her most attractive characteristics. The
                    hero, trained by his mother amid circumstances of idyllic simplicity, suddenly
                    passes into a world of movement and adventure, and he is brought by accident to
                    the gorgeous palace of the Holy Grail, of whose kingdom he ultimately becomes
                    lord. The object of the poem is evidently to depict the strivings of a restless
                    but noble spirit, dissatisfied with passing pleasure, having always before it a
                    high and spotless aim. It is difficult for modern readers to detect the
                    spiritual significance of many of the scenes; the poet seems to escape from us
                    into a far-off region, whence his words reach us rather as dim echoes than as
                    clear, ringing sounds. And some of the descriptions are in themselves tedious
                    and superfluous, while advance from one stage of the tale to another apparently
                    proceeds according to the arbitrary whim of the moment. Nevertheless, the
                    character of Parzival is a true conception of genius, and enables us to
                    understand, better than any other imaginative creation of mediaeval Germany,
                    that discontent with life as it is, that sense of being haunted by visions of
                    spiritual loveliness, which, throughout the Middle Ages, existed side by side
                    with unrestrained delight in the outward world.</p>
                <p>A complete, almost a dramatic, contrast to Wolfram von Eschenbach is found in
                    Gottfried of Strasburg, the greatest of his literary contemporaries. These two
                    men are representatives of a distinction which incessantly recurs,—that between
                    the poet who fashions spirits of a finer mould than those we actually know, and
                    the poet who contents himself with penetrating into the innermost recesses of
                    existing character. Gottfried’s theme is Tristram and Iseult; and the charming
                    tale, which unfortunately he did not live to carry to the end, was perhaps never
                    more beautifully told. There are no mystic longings in the men and women he
                    presents tous: they love the earth and the sky, with their gorgeous colours,
                    graceful forms, and happy sounds; they care not to inquire what may lie behind
                    these, or whether in the scheme of things there is a place for moral law. Few
                    poets have set forth so powerfully the×fascination of youthful passion. In his
                    glowing pictures we find no shadowy figures like those of Wolfram, with step so
                    light that they appear to be the figures of a dream; his images are clear,
                    sharply cut, like those of the world from which they are taken. And although
                    psychological analysis was unknown to him, the actions of his characters display
                    keen insight into the secrets of human hearts when entangled in the most
                    confused meshes.</p>
                <p>Mediaeval romance bore its richest fruit in the works of these two great poets;
                    and most of their successors imitated one or other of them. Those who followed
                    in Gottfried’s steps came nearest to a happy result, for Wolfram was one of
                    those lonely and daring spirits in whose remote path it is given to few to tread
                    without stumbling. The best known of Gottfried’s imitators was Conrad von
                    Würzburg, who wrote on the Trojan war and many other subjects, and 13 considered
                    one of the most artistic of mediaeval writers. Towards the end of the 13th
                    century the movement showed signs of exhaustion, and romances began to make way
                    for rough popular tales and rhymed chronicles.</p>
                <p>Fortunately the poets of the age of chivalry did not all occupy themselves with
                    the subjects of French romances. A few, whose names we do not know, turned
                    towards the rich material in the metrical legends of their native land. Of these
                    poets the most important was he who collected and put into shape the ancient
                    ballads which make up the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied.</hi> How far he
                    modified them we cannot tell. In the form in which we possess them, they
                    probably owe something of their force to his genius; but he needed rather to
                    arrange and to curtail than to invent, and, although a genuine poet, he was not
                    at all times competent for his task. The work includes the legends of Siegfried,
                    of Gundicarius, or Günther, king of Burgundy, of Dieterich, and of Attila; and
                    the motives which bind them into a whole are the love and revenge of Kriemhild,
                    the sister of Günther and Siegfried’s wife. She excites the envy of Brunhild,
                    the Burgundian queen, whose friend, Hagen, one of Günther’s followers, discovers
                    the vulnerable point in Siegfried’s enchanted body, treacherously slays him, and
                    buries in the Rhine the treasure he has long before conquered from the race of
                    the Nibelungen. There is then a pause of thirteen years, after which Kriemhild,
                    the better to effect her fatal purpose, marries Attila, king of the Huns.
                    Thirteen years having again passed, her thirst for vengeance is satiated by the
                    slaying of the whole Burgundian court. The Germans justly regard this great epic
                    as one of the most precious gems of their literature. It has little of the grace
                    of courtly poetry; its characters are without subtlety or refinement; we are
                    throughout in the presence of vast elemental forces. But these forces are
                    rendered with extraordinary vividness of imagination, and with a profound
                    feeling for what is sublime and awful in human destiny. The narrative begins
                    with epic calmness, but swells into a torrent, and dashes vehemently forward,
                    when the injured queen makes a fearful return for her wrongs, and is herself
                    swept away by the tragic powers she has called to her service. In the management
                    of the story there are occasional traces of mediaevalism; but its spirit is that
                    of a more primitive time, when the German tribes were breaking into the Roman
                    empire, when passions were untamed by Christian influence, and when the
                    necessities of a wandering and aggressive life knit closely the bonds that
                    united the chief to his followers. Deliberate villany hardly appears in the
                    poem; the most savage actions spring either from the unrestricted play of
                    natural feeling, or from unquestioning fidelity to an acknowledged superior.
                    Here and there we come upon touches which indicate that the poet who preserved
                    the ancient legends was not incapable of appreciating finer effects than those
                    at which he generally aims. The sketch of the hospitable and chivalrous Rüdiger,
                    who receives the Burgundians on their way to the court of Attila, and afterwards
                    dies while unwillingly fighting them in obedience to his queen’s command, is not
                    surpassed in the most artistic of the mediaeval romances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gudrun</hi> is another epic in which a poet of this period gave
                    form to several old legends. They had for centuries been current along the
                    coasts of Friesland and Scandinavia, and the society they represent is
                    essentially the same as that of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> a society in which the men are rude, warlike, and loyal,

                <p>In the 15th century a German writer brought together in a single volume which he
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Heldenbuch</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the “Book
                    of Heroes”—a number of old legendary tales that must have been frequently on the
                    lips of the people and of the wandering minstrels, while the knightly poets were
                    singing of Tristram or of Arthur. This work, which was partly written by Kaspar
                    von der Rhön, will not compare in imaginative force with its more famous rivals.
                    The most powerful of the stories is probably the “Grosser Rosengarten,” in which
                    a monk, Ilsan, displays a very unclerical, but truly Teutonic, passion for
                    war.</p>
                <p>The age of chivalry was remarkable not only for its romances and epics but for
                    its lyrics. All the leading writers of the time exercised themselves in lyrical
                    poetry, and it was laboriously cultivated by multitudes who did not feel equal
                    to the task of a prolonged effort. Among those who gained more or less
                    distinction may be named Heinrich von Morungen, Reinmar der Alte, and Gottfried
                    von Neifen. The poets of this class were known as Minnesänger, because their
                    favourite theme was Minne or love. They began by imitating the troubadours,
                    whose metres they often reproduced when not penetrated by the emotion which
                    originally found in these forms a genuine expression. At a later stage it was
                    considered a point of honour for each poet to invent a stanza of his own,
                    whether or not those already existing were appropriate to his feeling. Thus many
                    of the minne songs produce an impression of unreality and coldness, seeming at
                    best to be but clever pieces of handiwork. But when the utmost deduction has
                    been made, it is surprising how much of what wa3 achieved by these ardent
                    writers still appeals to us. The best among them strike notes which respond in
                    every age to a master’s touch; and they do it with a fine sense of beauty, a
                    trained instinct for the appropriateness of words, and an evident delight both
                    in simple and in subtle melody.</p>
                <p>Perhaps no group of writers has ever had a deeper undertone of sadness than is to
                    be detected in the greatest of the minnesänger. They had a vivid consciousness
                    of the evanescence of human pleasure, an abiding feeling that corruption lurks
                    behind the gayest forms and brightest colours. But they caught with proportional
                    eagerness the passing rapture, letting no drop escape from the cup that would
                    soon fall from their grasp. This intensity of feeling is reproduced in their
                    lays, yet it was purified and generalized as it passed from the fleeting reality
                    to the permanent realm of art. Their treatment of love, although sometimes,
                    according to modern ideas, extravagant and fantastic, often displays genuine
                    elevation of sentiment. They sing also in impassioned strains the loyalty of the
                    vassal to his lord, the devotion of the Christian to his church. If they do not
                    exhibit the soaring spiritual ambition of Wolfram’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parzival,</hi> they have a kind of pathetic memory of a lost paradise, a vague
                    longing, by some distant difficult service, in battle with the infidel, to
                    attain to a world in which the discords of the present life may be forgotten or
                    harmonized. And behind all their images is the background of nature, whose
                    loveliness they do not the less appreciate because they refrain from elaborately
                    describing it. To the dwellers in dreary towers winter had often a cheerless and
                    melancholy aspect; but this made all the more enchanting the new life of spring.
                    It is in hailing the returning warmth and colour of the young season that the
                    minnesänger attain their happiest triumphs.</p>
                <p>Of all the minnesänger the first place belongs without question to Walther von
                    der Vogelweide, probably of Tyrol, whom Gottfried of Strasburg praises as
                    heartily as he slyly depreciates Wolfram von Eschenbach. Walther lived some time
                    at the Wartburg, and wa3 the friend of King Philip and Frederick II; he died on
                    a little estate which the latter gave him in fief. Other Minnesänger lavished
                    praise on generous princes; Walther was of a more manly character, and seems
                    always to have maintained an independent bearing. Besides the usual themes of
                    the lyrical poetry of his time, he wrote with enthusiasm of his native land; he
                    also frequently alludes to the strife between the spiritual and secular powers,
                    and sternly rebukes the ambition of the papacy. Beyond all his rivals he gives
                    us the impression of writing with ease and delight. The structure of his stanzas
                    does not hamper the movement of his feeling; it appears to provide the
                    conditions of perfect freedom. Such a lyric as his <hi rend="italic">Unter
                    der</hi><hi rend="italic">Linden an</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Heide,</hi> with its musical refrain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tandaradei,</hi> although a masterpiece of art, is exquisite in its childlike
                    simplicity; it has the unaffected grace of a flower, the spontaneity of a bird’s
                    song.</p>
                <p>As the expression of all that was fantastic and ridiculous in the age of
                    chivalry, must be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Frauendienst</hi> of Ulrich
                    von Lichtenstein, a work which was written about the middle of the 13th century,
                    and had a certain popularity in its time. It is an autobiography, with a number
                    of lyrics interwoven to give variety and animation to the narrative. The solemn
                    gravity with which the author relates the amazing tasks imposed upou him by his
                    mistress shows how easily the worship of womanhood degenerated into almost
                    incredible childishness. Ulrich is sometimes compared to Don Quixote, but this
                    is to do extreme injustice to Cervantes’s hero. Amid all his illusions the
                    fictitious knight maintains a certain pathetic dignity; the knight of reality
                    passes from absurdity to absurdity without a touch of idealism to redeem his
                    folly. And his lyrics are the tasteless manufacture of a thoroughly prosaic
                    spirit.</p>
                <p>Several of the minnesänger, Walther von der Vogelweide especially, display at
                    times a strongly didactic tendency. From the beginning of the period this
                    tendency was developed by writers who took little interest in poetry for its own
                    sake, and it became more and more prominent as the purely lyrical impulse passed
                    away. The didactic poet, however significant his labours may be to his
                    contemporaries, has necessarily the stamp of commonplace for posterity; and the
                    gnomic writers of the 13th century form no exception to this rule. But several
                    of them have at least the interest that attaches to sincerity and earnestness.
                    There is genuine enthusiasm for pure morality in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Welsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Gast</hi> of Thomasin Zerklar; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bescheidenheit</hi> of Freidank expresses so high a conception of
                    duty, and expresses it so well, that the work was ascribed to Walther himself.
                    Reinmar von Zweter and Heinrich Frauenlob came a little later, and they were
                    followed by Hugo von Trimberg, whose <hi rend="italic">Renner</hi> sets forth
                    unimpeachable lessons in homely and satirical verses. A higher tone is
                    perceptible in <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Winsbecke,</hi> a
                    collection of sayings in which we find an echo of the reverence for noble women
                    that marked the epoch at its dawn. Among didactic writings must be classed the
                    well known <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Krieg</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">auf der</hi><hi rend="italic">Wartburg</hi> (“The Contest at the
                    Wartburg”). It includes the verses supposed to have been sung at a tournament of
                    poets attended by Heinrich von Ofterdingen, Walther von der Vogelweide, and
                    Wolfram von Eschenbach.</p>
                <p>As Latin continued to be the speech of scholars, and the passion for metrical
                    expression pervaded the higher classes, there was not much scope for the growth
                    of prose. Nevertheless, it is in this age that we find the first serious
                    attempts to secure for German prose a place in the national literature. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Sachsenspiegel</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schwabenspiegel,</hi> two great collections of local laws, although of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> a scientific character, and mainly interesting
                    because of their social importance, had considerable influence in encouraging
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n543/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0543-0526"/> respect of the Germans for their own language.
                    The preachers, however, were the principal founders of prose style. Preaching
                    became about the middle of the 13th century an agency of great power in the life
                    of Germany. A number of the clergy, dissatisfied with the technicalities of
                    scholasticism, and with the mere forms under which spiritual aspiration was
                    often crushed, strove to attain to a fresh vision of religious truth, and to
                    kindle their own enthusiasm in the minds of others. Of this generous band the
                    most popular was Brother Berthold, a Franciscan monk, a man of a noble and
                    commanding temper, and an orator of the highest rank. Love for the poor was his
                    dominant motive, and he sometimes expressed it in language a modern socialist
                    might envy. Having something of the imaginative glow of the minnesänger, he gave
                    such colour to his abstract teaching as made it at once intelligible and
                    attractive. Of a less poetical nature than Berthold, Master Eckhart, the next
                    early master of religious prose, was more deeply philosophical. Although
                    familiar with the scholastic systems, he broke away from their method, and
                    became the founder of the mystical school which was one of the most potent
                    factors in preparing the way for the Reformation. Eckhart’s reasonings are
                    sometimes hard to follow, but he is not a confused thinker; his obscurity arises
                    rather from the nature of his themes than from his mode of handling them. He
                    occasionally touches profound depths in the spiritual nature of man, and it is
                    refreshing to pass from the formal hairsplitting of the scholastic philosophers
                    to the large conceptions of a mind which obeys its own laws and is evidently in
                    direct contact with the problems it seeks to solve.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">The Later Middle Age.—</hi> After the fall of the
                    Hohenstaufen dynasty the age of chivalry in Germany virtually came to an end.
                    The breaking up of the old duchies set free a large number of petty nobles from
                    their allegiance to mediate lords; and as there was no longer a strong central
                    authority, either to hold them in check or to provide them with such outlets for
                    their energy as they had found in the crusades and in the imperial expeditions
                    into Italy, nearly the whole class sank from the high level to which it had
                    temporarily risen. Many knights became mere robbers, and thought themselves
                    honourably employed in taking part in the innumerable little wars which
                    shattered the prosperity of the nation. Men of this kind were not very likely to
                    inherit the free and poetic spirit of Walther von der Vogelweide. In the course
                    of the 14th and loth centuries attempts were still made by Wolkensteiu,
                    Muskatblüt, and other writers to imitate his style; but in their hands the lyre
                    of the minnesänger gave forth only feeble or discordant notes. For a long time
                    the princes were no more inclined to literature than the npbles; they were too
                    much occupied with mutual jealousies, and with incessant attempts to shake
                    themselves free of the crown, to give heed to anything so removed from practical
                    interests as poetry.</p>
                <p>It so happened that during this period the cities rose to a position of higher
                    importance than they had ever before occupied. There was a while when it even
                    seemed possible that by their leagues, and by alliance with those emperors who
                    had insight enough to recognize their strength, they might become the
                    preponderating element in the state. Driven from the castles of the princes and
                    the towers of the nobles, literature took refuge in these young and growing
                    centres of a vigorous life. Not one or two here and there, but multitudes of
                    honest citizens, became possessed by the desire to distinguish themselves in the
                    arts in which they had been so much surpassed by the nobles of a previous
                    generation. Unfortunately, they had no literary training; they were not familiar
                    with any great models; few of them had leisure for the cultivation of style; and
                    the character of their daily employments was not such as to kindle thoughts that
                    demand poetic utterance. At that time every trade had its guild; and they now
                    formed guilds of poetry, the task of whose members was in intervals of leisure
                    to produce songs according to a body of strict rules, as in hours of business
                    they produced shoes or loaves. The rules were called the “Tabulatur,” and the
                    rauk of each member was determined by his skill in applying them. The lowest
                    stage was that of a man who had simply been received into the guild; the
                    highest, that of a master, who had invented a new melody. Between these were the
                    scholar, the friend of the school, the singer, and the poet. Literature produced
                    under such conditions could not have much vitality. It amused the versifiers,
                    and developed a certain keenness in the detection of outward faults; but the
                    spirit of poetry was wanting, and there is hardly a “meistersänger” whose name
                    is worthy of being remembered.</p>
                <p>Much more important than these tedious manufacturers of verse were the unknown
                    authors of the earliest attempts at dramatic composition. In the 10th century
                    Hroswitha, the abbess of Gandersheim, wrote Latin imitations of Terence; but
                    they were without influence on the progress of culture. The real beginnings of
                    the modern drama were the crude representations of scriptural subjects with
                    which the clergy strove to replace certain pagan festivals. These
                    representations gradually passed into the “Mysteries” or “Miracle Plays,” in
                    which there was a rough endeavour to dramatize the events celebrated at Easter
                    and other sacred seasons. They were acted at first in churches, but afterwards
                    in open courts and market places; and for many hours, sometimes day after day,
                    they were listened to by enormous audiences. The fragment of a Swiss “Mystery”
                    of the 13th century has survived; but the earliest that has come down to us in a
                    complete form is a play of the first half of the 14th century, treating of the
                    parable of the ten virgins. Like those of France and England, these mediaeval
                    German dramas display little imagination; and they are often astonishingly
                    grotesque in their handling of the most awful themes. Along with them grew up
                    what w ere known as “Shrove Tuesday Plays,” dialogues setting forth some scene
                    of noisy fun, such as a quarrel between a husband and wife, with a few wise saws
                    interspersed. They were declaimed without much ceremony in the public room of an
                    inn, or before the door of a prominent citizen, and gave ample occasion for
                    impromptu wit. Nuremberg seems to have been particularly fond of “Shrove Tuesday
                    Plays,” for one of its poets, Hans Rosenblüt, who flourished about the middle of
                    the 15th century, was the most prolific author of them. A little later he was
                    extensively imitated by Hans Folz, a Nuremberg barber and meistersänger.</p>
                <p>By far the most interesting writers of the 14th century were the mystics, who
                    continued the movement started by Eckhart. Johannes Tauler of Strasburg
                    (1300-61) had not the originality and force of his predecessor, but the ultimate
                    mysteries of the world had an intense fascination for him, and his tender and
                    sensitive spirit opened itself to lights which find no way of entrance into more
                    robust and logical intellects. He did not in the main pass beyond the
                    speculations of Eckhart, but he added grace and finish to their expression, and
                    made them a greater popular power than they could have become through the
                    master’s writings. Heinrich Suso, of Constance (1300-65), who has been called
                    “the minnesangei ’ of the love of God,” made the doctrines of Eckhart an
                    occasion for the outpourings of a full and sometimes extravagant fancy.
                    Eckhart’s teaching was also put into shape by an unknown author, whose work was
                    afterwards published by Luther under the title <hi rend="italic">Eyn</hi><hi

                    space and time, in union with which man rises to his true life. They are chiefly
                    of importance in the history of speculative thought, but even from the point of
                    view of literature they were of high service in the development of a rich and
                    vigorous prose.</p>
                <p>A plain narrative prose style was cultivated in the chronicles which began at
                    this time to be written in different parts of Germany. The Limburg Chronicle
                    written between 1336 and 1398, the Alsace Chronicle about 1386, and the
                    Thuringian Chronicle, by Rothe, a monk of Eisenach, about 1430, have all
                    considerable historical value; and the fact that they are in German, not like
                    previous chronicles in Latin, proves the rising respect among the people for
                    their native speech.</p>
                <p>During the latter part of the 15th century there was in Germany, as in the other
                    leading European nations, a great revival of intellectual life. And it was due
                    to the same causes as prevailed elsewhere,—especially the rediscovery of Greek
                    literature and the invention of printing. The movement was naturally most
                    powerfully felt in the universities. The first of these institutions had been
                    founded early in the 14th century by Charles IV. in Prague. Soon afterwards
                    others were established in Vienna, Heidelberg, Cologne, and Erfurt; and in the
                    15th century universities were set up also in Rostock, Greifswald, Tübingen,
                    Leipsic, and elsewhere. For a long time lav; and divinity were almost the only
                    subjects studied; but when the Renaissance passed from Italy into Germany,
                    university teaching became the instrument of a freer and larger culture.
                    Scholastic philosophy fell into disrepute; the most active minds occupied
                    themselves only with the intellectual treasures of the ancient world. The men
                    devoted to the new studies were called “Humanists,” and they carried on
                    continual warfare with the more ignorant and intolerant of the clergy.
                    Unfortunately they knew nothing of the value of their own language; they wrote,
                    as the scholastic philosophers had done, solely in Latin, and they gave but
                    slight and contemptuous attention to the movements of popular literature.</p>
                <p>Yet the popular literature of their time was quite worthy of study, for the stir
                    of new life had affected not only scholars but all classes of society, citizens
                    and even peasants included. It is surprising how many books found their way to
                    the public between 1450 and the outbreak of the Reformation; every one seemed
                    anxious that the newly discovered process by which writers could appeal to so
                    wide an audience should be turned to the utmost possible advantage. Of this
                    great mass of literature a comparatively small proportion was created in
                    obedience to the free impulses of the intellect. The problems of the time were
                    mainly social and practical; men were less moved by ideal interests than by
                    questions as to the tyranny of the princes, the greed and sensuality of the
                    clergy, the worldliness of the papacy, the powerlessness of the crown to enforce
                    peace and order. Multitudes of little tales in prose and verse appeared, in
                    which the princes, the nobles, the clergy, and sometimes rich citizens, were
                    held up to ridicule. The “Shrove Tuesday Plays,” which now became extremely
                    popular, also expressed the general discontent; and there were even “Miracle
                    Plays” whose object was to reveal the wrongs of the people. In one of them, the
                    leading character of which was Joanna, the mythical female pope, a clerical
                    author did not hesitate to pour contempt on the Roman see itself.</p>
                <p>By far the greatest of these satirical writings was the epic narrative, <hi
                    rend="italic">Revneke Fios.</hi> It has beeu already stated that the stories of
                    “Reynard the Fox” and “Isengrim the Wolf” probably belong to prehistoric ages.
                    They became current, through the Franks, in Lorraine and France; and from the
                    11th to the 15th century they formed the subject of many works in Latin, French,
                    and German. The epic to which allusion is now made appeared in 1498, and was
                    probably by Hermann Barkhusen, a printer of Rostock. It is in Low German, and
                    its materials were obtained from a prose version of the tale which had appeared
                    some years before in Holland, and of which Caxton printed an English
                    translation. Originally, the story had no satirical significance; it was a
                    simple expression of interest in what may be called the social life of wild
                    animals. In the hands of the author of this Low German poem it becomes an
                    instrument of satire on some enduring tendencies of human nature. He does not
                    lash himself into fury at the vices he chastises; he laughs at while he exposes
                    them. His humour is broad and frank, and he did more than any one else to make
                    Reynard the type of the resource and cunning which overmaster not only brute
                    force but even truth and justice. There are several renderings of the poem into
                    High German, the most important being the well-known work of Goethe in
                    hexameters.</p>
                <p>Another popular satirical work was the <hi rend="italic">Narrenschif</hi> (“Ship
                    of Fools”) of Sebastian Brandt, published in Basel in 1494. It is an allegorical
                    poem of more than a hundred sections, in which the vices are satirized as fools.
                    This work passed through many editions, and was rendered into more than one Low
                    German dialect, and into Latin, French, and English; it was even made the
                    subject of a series of sermons by Geiler, of Kaisersberg, a well-known preacher
                    of the day, who had himself some satirical talent. Brandt was personally of a
                    mild and unassuming character, and the fact that he became a satirist in spite
                    of himself is a striking proof of the confusion which had fallen upon both
                    church and state. Now that the occasion of his book has passed away, it is
                    difficult to realize that it once enjoyed almost unprecedented popularity. We
                    cannot but feel that the writer was an honest man; but his allegories are
                    without force or charm, and his moral lessons have been the commonplaces of
                    every civilized society. A satirist of a bolder type was Thomas Murner, who,
                    although he lived far into the age of the Reformation, belongs in spirit
                    altogether to the preceding period. He was a preacher, and both in sermons and
                    in secular writings attacked without mercy the classes who were the butts of his
                    fellow-satirists. After the beginning of the Reformation he included Luther
                    among the objects of his comprehensive dislikes. His laughter was loud and
                    harsh, and can hardly have been favourable to any small buddings of charity that
                    may have revealed themselves among the antagonisms of his generation.</p>
                <p>One of the favourite books of this time was <hi rend="italic">Tyll</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Eulenspiegel.</hi> It was published in 1519, and the author
                    (probably Murner) seems to have included in it many anecdotes already well
                    known. According to the preface, Tyll was a Brunswick peasant of the 14th
                    century, who went about the country perpetrating practical jokes. The force of
                    his humour mainly consists in taking every word addressed to him in its most
                    literal sense, and in giving it applications altogether different from those
                    intended by the speaker. There are readers who still find amusement in his rough
                    pleasantries.</p>
                <p>During the better part of this stirring period Maximilian I. was emperor, and he
                    interested himself a good deal in the current literature. As in politics,
                    however, so in poetry, his sympathies were altogether with an earlier age; and
                    he attempted to revive the taste for mediaeval romance. From a sketch said to
                    have been prepared by him, Melchior Pfinzig celebrated iu <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theuerdanh</hi> the emperor’s marriage with Princess Mary of Burgundy. The work
                    was splendidly printed, and attracted much notice; but romantic poetry, once so
                    fascinating, produces in its pages <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n545/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0545-0528"/> the effect of an elderly coquette who, refusing
                    to believe in the ravages of years, tricks herself out in the gay adornments of
                    youth. An earlier book, the <hi rend="italic">Weiss Kunig,</hi> an autobiography
                    of Maximilian, written by his direction in prose by his secretary
                    Treizsauerwein, has the excellence neither of a chrouicle nor of a romance; it
                    is for the most part the fantastic work of a mind which misunderstood its epoch
                    and its own powers.</p>
                <p>Behind the strife aud noise of contending sections there was slowly growing up an
                    admirable intellectual product of Germany,—its popular poetry. One of the
                    earliest writers who struck the note of the popular poets was Veit Weber, a
                    Swiss who fought with his countrymen against Charles the Bold, and who
                    celebrated in vigorous verses the battles of Granson, Murten, and Nancy. From
                    this time the German people had always a living poetry of their own, created by
                    unknown authors, but caught up by the masses, passed on from village to village
                    till it was everywhere known, and handed down by each generation to its
                    successors. This popular poetry ultimately reflected every aspect of daily life
                    among the humbler classes; each section among them had its appropriate lyrics,
                    and there were songs of youth, of age, and of middle life. There is no
                    elaboration in these offshoots of the popular fancy, but many of them have an
                    artless beauty which touches the fountains of smiles and tears, and which had an
                    irresistible fascination for the poets of the greatest period of German
                    literature.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">The Century of the Reformation.—</hi> It is possible that
                    if there had been no Reformation the Renaissance would have revealed itself in
                    Germany in a great literary movement, as in France and England, or in a great
                    artistic movement, as in Italy. The conditions of both movements were present in
                    the labours of the humanists on the one hand, and of' the Holbeins, Albert
                    Dürer, and Lucas Cranach on the other. But the questions of the Reformation were
                    too profound and agitating for the mind of the nation to turn seriously to any
                    task save that which they imposed. Thus it happened that the young shoots of the
                    Renaissance withered almost before they were in leaf. It was settled that
                    Germany must wait until a much later time for the full exercise of her highest
                    energies.</p>
                <p>In literature not less than in religion Luther (1483-1546) was the commanding
                    spirit of the age; but he was so rather by accident than by choice. For form for
                    its own sake he cared little; he studied it solely that he might the better
                    produce the moral effect at which he aimed. It is hardly possible for any one to
                    sympathize now with the violence and the dogmatism of his tracts, addresses, and
                    sermons; but they had the high merit of addressing the nation in a language it
                    could understand. They are always clear, simple, warm with the glow of a
                    passionate nature; and amid their noise and fury an attentive ear will sometimes
                    catch the still small voice of a spirit touched to finer issues than mere party
                    warfare. “My husk may be hard,” he him3elf said, “but the kernel is soft and
                    sweet.” We do extreme injustice to Luther if we do not recognize in him a
                    strongly poetic element,—an element which had free play only in the best of his
                    private letters, and in his still popular hymns. By the highest of his literary
                    achievements, his translation of the Bible, he made a truly splendid
                    contribution to the spiritual life of his people. No body of literature has been
                    so fortunate in its translators as the Scriptures; and Luther’s rendering ranks
                    with the best. Its absolute simplicity brings it to the level of a child’s
                    understanding; its strength and grace give it an enduring place as a work of
                    art. Germany instantly felt its charm; and for three centuries it has been to
                    innumerable millions the supreme consoler and sanctifier, the power associated
                    with their tenderest, most pathetic memories, the one link which has connected
                    sordid lives with noble and sublime ideas. And for the first time it gave the
                    nation a literary language. Up to this stage every author had written in the
                    dialect with which he was himself familiar; henceforth for the men of Swabia, of
                    Bavaria, of Saxony, and of all other districts there was a common speech, which
                    the writers of each state could use without any sense of inferiority to those of
                    another. It is thus to Luther that the Germans owe the most essential of all the
                    conditions of a truly national life and literature.</p>
                <p>The writer who deserves to stand next to Luther is Ulrich von Hutten (1488-1523).
                    An accomplished humanist, he effectively attacked the enemies of the new culture
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Epistoloe</hi><hi rend="italic">Obscurorum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Virorum</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> of which he was
                    one of the chief writers. This was before the special work of Luther began; and
                    at a still earlier period he had assailed in a series of fine Latin orations the
                    tyranny of Duke Ulrich of Würtemberg, who was accused of murdering a member of
                    Hutten’s family. He had little real sympathy with Luther’s religious aims; but
                    he threw himself heartily into a movement by which it seemed possible to purge
                    the state of the spiritual and secular ills which were in deadly antagonism to
                    the progressive energy of humanism. His German writings are mainly short
                    satirical poems and prose dialogues and addresses. Their style is direct, bold,
                    and trenchant; but they are now in teresting mainly because of the spirit of
                    freedom which breathes through them, the lofty political ideals of the writer,
                    and his generous ardour for the popular welfare.</p>
                <p>A far more voluminous author than Hutten or Luther was Hans Sachs, meistersänger
                    of Nuremberg (1494- 1576). He was, indeed, one of the most prolific of German
                    writers, having composed, according to his own calculation, more than 6000
                    poems. Although extremely popular in his own time, Sachs was almost forgotten
                    after his death. His memory was revived by Wieland and Goethe, and he is now
                    universally admitted to have been the chief German poet of the 16th century.
                    Every species of verse then known he freely cultivated, and there is no
                    important element of his age which is not touched in one or other of his works.
                    He had little of the culture of the schools, and many of his verses are
                    excessively rude. But Hans had considerable force of imagination, sly humour,
                    and, in his happiest moments, a true feeling for melody. His best works are his
                    “Shrove Tuesday Plays.” It is true he makes hardly more attempt than Rosenblüt
                    to develop a dramatic action, but his characters have life, and in many
                    individual scenes are artistically grouped. His didactic dialogues and satirical
                    tales present a remarkably vivid picture of the ideas, controversies, and moral
                    sentiments of his generation; and some of his lyrics still live in the memory of
                    the nation. The song in which he hailed the “Wittenberg Nightingale” gave fine
                    utterance to the reverence of the Lutherans for their chief, and in his hymn,
                    <hi rend="italic">Warum betrübst du dich, mein Herz?</hi> he so happily met the
                    spiritual need of the day that it was soon translated into eight languages,
                    including English, French, and Greek.</p>
                <p>If Ilans Sachs was the most industrious poet of the century, Johann Fischart was
                    beyond all comparison its greatest satirist. There was a distinctly Rabelaisian
                    touch in this restless, bizarre, and effusive spirit,—a man of upright and manly
                    character, keenly alive to the evils of his time, and continually opening fire
                    at new points on his enemies. He was an enthusiast for the Reformation, and did
                    it more lasting service among the middle class than half the theologians. His
                    chief work was an adaptation of Rabelais’s <hi rend="italic">Gargantua,</hi>
                    which he rendered with an insight into its purpose, and a fulness of sympathy

                    poem, <hi rend="italic">Das Glückhaft</hi><hi rend="italic">Schiff,</hi> he
                    gives evidence of a faculty for stirring narrative verse, but his prose is
                    richer, fuller, and more free. Considering how imperfectly prose style was then
                    developed, he had an astonishing command over the resources of the language. He
                    delighted in new and complicated word-formations, and by means of them often
                    succeeded, while dealing with his main theme, in casting side lights on its
                    subordinate branches. Even he, penetrating and enlightened as he was, could not
                    rise so far above his age as to condemn the burning of witches; but hardly
                    another popular folly escaped his glance. From the evil practices of
                    hypocritical priests to the impudence of astrologers and weather prophets every
                    abuse found in him a watchful critic; and nothing of the kind could be more
                    admirable than the skill with which he excites contempt while professing to
                    write in a spirit of respect and credulity. The secret of his poweι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> lay also partly in his profound humanity, for this
                    scathing satirist was at heart thoroughly genial; his mockery had its root in an
                    abiding faith injustice.</p>
                <p>Several other cultivators of prose style deserve mention. Albert Durer, whose
                    paintings, drawings, and engravings gave to the age of transition between
                    mediaevalism and the modern world its most perfect artistic expression, wrote
                    several scientific treatises, one of which, on the proportions of the human
                    body, is a masterpiece of calm, clear, and systematic exposition. Johann
                    Thurnmeier, called Aventinus (1466-1534), Sebastian Franck (1500-45), and
                    Aegidius Tschudi, of Glarus (1505-72), wrote histories which,' as ordered
                    narratives, rank considerably above mere chronicles. The autobiography of Götz
                    von Berlichingen, if its style is without merit, has an enduring interest as a
                    sketch of the rude lives of the petty nobles at the time when the old social
                    order was breaking up under the influence of new ideas. Huldrich Zwingli, the
                    Swiss Reformer (1484- 1531), could state an argument with logical precision, but
                    his style is thin and weak in comparison with the nervous force of Luther.
                    Johann Agricola (1492-1566) wrote some theological work3 on the Catholic side;
                    he is chiefly important, however, for a collection of German proverbs, which
                    afford important evidence as to the currents of popular thought. Of a far higher
                    class as a religious writer was Johann Arndt (1555-1621), who wrote the most
                    widely read work of the 16th century, <hi rend="italic">Vier Bücher vom Wahren
                    Christenthum</hi> (“Four Books on True Christianity ”). Soon after Luther’s
                    death the doctrines of the Reformation lost nearly all vitality; becoming the
                    subjects of vehement controversy among contending theologians, they ceased to
                    interest the m ιsses, who turned to simpler and more congenial themes. Arndt,
                    like Eckhart, Tauler, and Luther himself, being a man of religious genius, saw
                    the futility of these noisy disputes, and brushing them aside went to the heart
                    of Christianity as a power fitted to nourish spiritual feeling and to govern
                    conduct. His work appeared in Magdeburg in 1610, passed through edition after
                    edition, and was translated into eleven languages. It still has a place of its
                    own, for beneath the forms of a past age there burns the fire of a true
                    enthusiasm. Sebastian Franck, already mentioned as a historian, wrote some
                    religious works in a spirit akin to that of Arndt; but he lacked the intensity,
                    the power of touching the popular mind, which was possessed by the later writer.
                    Less practical in tendency, but incomparably deeper in philosophic thought, were
                    the writings of the Görlitz theosophist, Jacob Boehme (1575-1624). Boehme is in
                    many respects one of the most striking figures in the history of German
                    speculation. A man of mild and humble temper, working in patient obscurity as a
                    shoemaker, he spent his life in grappling with the vastest problems which
                    perplex humanity. Starting from the dogmas of Christianity, he sought to ground
                    them in the deepest reason; and although he often appears to darken counsel by
                    words, yet his writings contain many bold suggestions, which have profoundly
                    influenced later philosophical systems. There are times when one feels that his
                    struggling thought is imperfectly uttered only because it is not expressed in
                    poetic forms. For Boehme was one of those thinkers who occupy the borderland
                    between philosophy and poetry, a fact often perceptible in the concrete shape
                    which the most abstract ideas assume in his hands. There is a touch of poetry in
                    the very title of his first and best known, although not perhaps his best, book,
                    <hi rend="italic">Aurora.</hi></p>
                <p>The secular poetry of this period, if we except the works of Hans Sachs and
                    Fischart, is without value. An ambitious didactic poem by Rollenhagen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Frosch-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mäusler,</hi> gained a certain reputation; but it stands far beneath <hi
                    rend="italic">Reineke</hi><hi rend="italic">Vos,</hi> of which it is partly an
                    imitation. The religious lyrics of the age are, however, of high excellence;
                    they, indeed, are the sole works in which a perfect marriage was effected
                    between idea and form in the epoch of the Reformation. In his grand battle-hymn
                    <hi rend="italic">Ein feste Burg ist unser</hi><hi rend="italic">Gott,</hi> in
                    his pathetic verses <hi rend="italic">Aus tieffer Not schrey</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ich zu</hi><hi rend="italic">dir,</hi> and in other lyrics, Luther
                    led the way; and he was, as we have seen, followed by Hans Sachs. Nicolaus
                    Herrmann in his <hi rend="italic">Erschienen ist der herrlich Tag,</hi> Paul
                    Eber in his <hi rend="italic">Wenn wir in höchsten Nöthen sein,</hi> Philip
                    Nicolai in his <hi rend="italic">Wie schön leucht uns der Morgenstern,</hi> and
                    several other writers not less distinguished, created, in moments of genuine
                    inspiration, lyrics which must move men while religious instincts survive. The
                    adherents of the Reformation everywhere opened their hearts to these beautiful
                    poems, for in them alone, not in creeds or sermons or controversial treatises,
                    were the deepest emotions of the time freely poured forth. Next to the
                    translation of the Bible, nothing did so much as the popular hymns to unite the
                    Protestants, to stimulate their faith, and to intensify their courage.</p>
                <p>During this century the drama made considerable progress. Besides the “Mysteries”
                    and “Shrove Tuesday Plays,” “School Comedies,” in imitation of Terence and
                    Plautus, were written and acted in the universities and public schools. Luther,
                    with the large humanity characteristic of him when dogmatic disputes were not in
                    question, encouraged these comedies, and was, indeed, friendly to dramatic
                    effort of all kinds. To persons who complained that modesty was often offended
                    by the actors he replied that if they carried out their principle they would
                    have to refrain from reading the Bible. When the Jesuits began to agitate in
                    opposition to Protestantism they detected at once, with their usual tact, the
                    importance of this element in popular life; and through their influence more
                    attention was paid not only to the plays but to the manner in which they were
                    represented. Towards the end of the 16th century Germany was visited by a band
                    of English comedians, who went about acting in their own language. They appear
                    to have produced a deep impression; and at least one of their importations, the
                    clown, the “Pickelhäring” of the Dutch, survived in Hanswurst or Jack Pudding,
                    who was formore than a century an indispensable character in every play designed
                    to gratify the prevailing taste. In imitation of the English comedians,
                    wandering companies, consisting largely of idle students, now began to be
                    formed, and thrilled both rustic and city audiences with blood-and-thunder
                    tragedies, and with comedies too coarse to deserve even the name of farces.
                    About the middle of the century a theatre was built in Nuremberg, and Augsburg
                    and other cities soon followed the example. Duke Julius of Brunswick (1564-1613)
                    not only built a theatre in his capital but maintained a permanent company; and
                    he amused himself by writing for it comedies and tragedies in the approved style
                    of the day.</p>

                <p>It is significant of the stage of literary culture reached by Germany that she
                    enjoyed the barbarous productions of this scribbling prince while English
                    audiences were appreciating “Hamlet” and “Othello.”</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">The Period of Decay.—</hi> The period at which we have now
                    arrived is in many respects the most dismal in German history. From 1618 to 1648
                    the country was desolated by the Thirty Years’ War, a struggle which—as Gustavus
                    Adolphus, its greatest hero, declared—absorbed into itself all the other wars of
                    Europe. It completed the disintegration of Germany, blurred every great national
                    memory, fastened upon the people hundreds of petty despotisms, reduced the
                    population by more than half, paused a whole generation to grow up in ignorance,
                    accustomed all classes to an almost incredible brutality of manners, and put an
                    end to the material prosperity which had been steadily growing during the 16th
                    century. It is not surprising that pure literature drooped and nearly died out
                    during the time which followed this tremendous war, for the conditions of pure
                    literature were almost wholly wanting. Had a man of high genius arisen, the buds
                    of his fancy must have faded for lack of light and air.</p>
                <p>The only species of literature for which the conditions were favourable was the
                    religious lyric. Under the pressure of grinding care, with no hope that a better
                    day would dawn for them in this world, meditative and gentle spirits devoted
                    their thoughts to another life; and many of them linked themselves to the truest
                    poets of the previous century by giving musical voice to their spiritual fears
                    and joys. Their prevailing tone in regard to “things seen” is one of profound
                    melancholy; but all the brighter are the strange lights from the invisible which
                    break through the gloom. The greatest of these writers is Paul Gerhardt
                    (1606-75), many of whose hymns—such as <hi rend="italic">0 Haupt</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">voll Blut und Wunden,</hi><hi rend="italic">0</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Welt sieh hier dein Leben—</hi> penetrate to the essence of
                    Christianity as the religion of humility, of sacrifice, and of sorrow. He had
                    worthy associates among the Protestants in Johann Rist (1607-67), Joachim
                    Neander (1610-88), and Louise Henriette of Brandenburg, wife of the Great
                    Elector (1627—67). Some of the wiser Jesuits also attempted the lyrical
                    expression of religious feeling; and one of them, Friedrich von Spee
                    (1592-1635), fell little short of the best among his Lutheran rivals. Spee was a
                    man of admirable moral as well as literary qualities. Asked by the elector of
                    Mainz how it happened that at the age of forty his hair was white, he answered,
                    “It is because I have accompanied to the stake so many women accused of
                    witchcraft, not one of whom was guilty.”</p>
                <p>The standard of pure speech set up by Luther in his translation of the Bible had
                    not been maintained by later writers. The innumerable dialects of Germany are an
                    almost inexhaustible fountain for the renewal of the youth of her literary
                    language; but when the literary language was less fixed than it is now, they
                    were also a temptation to barbarism. In addition to the evils of excessive
                    provinciality, the written speech had suffered from a too generous importation
                    of Latin, Spanish, and French words. In the early years of the 17th century the
                    prevailing laxity suggested to an enlightened prince, Louis of Anhalt-Köthen,
                    that it would be desirable to introduce into Germany institutions resembling the
                    Italian academies. Accordingly, in 1617, the “Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft”
                    (“The Fruit-bearing Society”) was established,—a union which took the form of an
                    order, with a palm tree for its emblem, and the words “Alles zu Nutzen”
                    (“Everything for use”) for its motto. It immediately became fashionable for
                    members of the highest classes of central Germany to belong to this society; and
                    at a somewhat later time other societies were started in imitation of it. Of
                    these the most famous was the “Order of the Pegnitzschäfer” (“Shepherds of the
                    River Pegnitz”) in Nuremberg, which to some extent took the place of the school
                    of meistersanger on which honour had been reflected by Hans Sachs.</p>
                <p>These societies were associated with much pedantic folly, and from none of them
                    proceeded any great work of genius; but they did good service by at least
                    protesting against unlawful forms of speech. One of the earliest writers who
                    worked in their spirit was Weckherlin (1584—1651), who, being associated with
                    the German embassy in London, became intimately acquainted with some of the many
                    forms in which the English genius then revealed itself. He wrote a number of
                    odes, idylls, and sonnets, with an evident desire to give them a careful
                    artistic finish. To him belongs the doubtful honour of having introduced
                    alexandrines into German poetry,—a measure totally unsuited to the national
                    spirit, but which for more than a century was in general use. The fame of
                    Weckherlin was soon overshadowed by that of Martin Opitz (1597-1639). The
                    beginnings of modern German poetry are often dated from the publication of his
                    critical book, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">deutsche</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Poeterei,</hi> which appeared in 1624, and enjoyed an astonishing
                    popularity. It became a sort of secular Bible to the “Fruit-bearing Society,” of
                    which Opitz was a member, and was regarded by several generations of
                    verse-makers as an almost infallible guide. In regard to merely outward forms,
                    it deserved its reputation, for Opitz was the first German writer who attempted
                    sharply to distinguish the different species of poetry, to bring together some
                    of the external laws which govern them, and to insist with emphasis that purity
                    of style is essential to high literary effect. He altogether missed the fact,
                    however, that poetry must be the expression of an emotional life; it became in
                    his exposition a mere handicraft, for excellence in which industry and
                    familiarity with good models are alone necessary. The result is seen in his own
                    lyrical and didactic poems, which are laudably correct in language and in metre,
                    but are hardly once lighted up by the fire of intense feeling.</p>
                <p>Opitz was born in Silesia; and from this circumstance the writers who shared his
                    tendency or came under his influence are known as the first Silesian school. By
                    far the most distinguished member of this so-called school was Paul Fleming
                    (1609-40), the only secular German poet of the 17th century of whom it can be
                    confidently said that he was endowed with true genius. He did not live long
                    enough to reveal his full capacity; he confined himself to short rapid flights,
                    and all his lyrics are contained in a moderately sized volume, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geistliche und Weltliche</hi><hi rend="italic">Poemata.</hi> This single
                    volume, however, comprises enough to secure for him an enduring place in
                    literature. He moves freely over the whole range of lyrical poetry, but his
                    charm is at once strongest and most delicate in his love verses, which sometimes
                    recall the gaiety of Herrick, although a touch of sentimentalism distinguishes
                    the German writer from the more worldly Englishman. A fine spirit of manliness
                    is the note of Fleming’s sonnets; and in several hymns he almost equals the
                    religious depth of Gerhardt. Even in its artistic qualities his best work is
                    higher than anything achieved by Opitz; in its power of awakening permanent
                    human sympathies it stands alone in its era.</p>
                <p>Another writer of the first Silesian school was Andreas Gryphius (1616-64), who
                    sought to create a drama in accordance with the laws laid down by Opitz. He was
                    the first German dramatist who divided his tragedies—of which he wrote five—into
                    five acts; but his characters are roughly conceived, and he produces his effects

                <p>His comedies, although also rude, have more life than his tragedies. In one of
                    them, <hi rend="italic">Peter Squenz,</hi> there are traces of Shake3peare <hi

                    which Gryphius appears to have had some knowledge through a third writer.
                    Friedrich von Logau (1604-55) applied the principles of Opitz in epigram. He had
                    a decided talent for terse, emphatic expression, and a considerable number of
                    the vast collection of his epigrams have a keenness of edge which must have made
                    him a dreaded enemy. His prevailing tone is satirical, and the chief object of
                    his satire is the moral corruption of his time. Joachim Rachel (1618-69) was
                    another satirist who strove by means of polished verses to castigate popular
                    vices; but he lacked force and invention. There was much more vigour in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scherzgedichte</hi> of Hans Wilmsen Lauremberg (1591-1659), who
                    wrote in Platt Deutsch; he, however, can hardly be claimed as a member of the
                    first Silesian school. Philip von Zesen (1619-89), a writer of some versatility,
                    wrought in the spirit of Opitz by warring against foreign words which had
                    intruded into German,—a warfare in which his zeal was not always as wise as it
                    was patriotic. He founded in Hamburg, in imitation of the “Fruit-bearing
                    Society,” an association (the “Deutschgesinnte Gesellschaft ”) inspired by his
                    enthusiasm for Teutonic purity of speech.</p>
                <p>While the admirers of Opitz were striving, with the best intentions, to introduce
                    a correct poetic style, a movement of a very different kind originated among the
                    “Pegnitzschäfer” of Nuremberg. The members of this society, conscious of the
                    barrenness of existing poetry, and not feeling in themselves the sources of a
                    higher activity, turned for help to Italian literature. Instead of studying the
                    great Italian poets they attached themselves to Marino and his extravagant
                    school; and the chief result was a number of fantastic pastorals, the writers of
                    which seemed to have no other aim than to show how much silly affectation the
                    German language may be made to express. Their tendency was carried to its utmost
                    development by the second Silesian school, whose leading representatives were
                    Hoffmanns waldau (1618-79) and Lohenstein (1635-83). Hoffmannswaldau wrote odes,
                    pastorals, and heroic epistles, which are marked by a childish foppery of
                    manner, and whose tone affords startling evidence of the moral laxity of the
                    society to which they were addressed. Lohenstein chiefly cultivated the drama,
                    and he has the distinction of having written perhaps the worst plays ever
                    accepted as literature by a modern community. They are so wild and bombastic
                    that, even if presented as burlesques, they would now be condemned as
                    ridiculously extravagant. The lyrics of this pretentious writer are not less
                    crude and unnatural than his plays.</p>
                <p>As the century advanced, the German courts passed more and more under the
                    influence of France. Pocket editions of Louis XIV. were to be found in all the
                    little capitals, courtiers talked more French than German, and it was
                    unfashionable not to know, or not to affect to know, contemporary French
                    literature. It was, therefore, inevitable that some writers should turn away
                    from the path of the second Silesian school, and compete for court favour by
                    imitating the French style. This was done by Canitz (1654-99), Besser
                    (1654-1729), König (1688-1744), and many other authors of the same class. These
                    “court poets” took Boileau for their guide, and had, therefore, the negative
                    merit of avoiding the absurdities of Lohenstein and Hoffmannswaldau. But they
                    were, as a rule, tame, cold, and dull. In Canitz alone, who was a Prussian
                    statesman and wrote for his pleasure, is there any evidence of original energy;
                    the others were professional versifiers who produced appropriate odes and
                    sonnets at the bidding of their employers.</p>
                <p>During the greater part of the 17th century Germany produced few prose works that
                    can now be tolerated. Notwithstanding the efforts of the purists, the language
                    became more and more corrupt, and mo3t writers were either artificial, or
                    pedantic, or coarse. One of the small number whose power we can still feel was
                    Grimmelshausen, whose <hi rend="italic">Simplicissimus</hi> (1659) has qualities
                    bordering upon genius. The hero is a peasant’s son, who tells his own tale. Torn
                    from his parents during the Thirty Years’ War, he is brought up by a hermit;
                    afterwards in the service of a commandant, he makes himself notorious for tricks
                    like those of Tyll Eulenspiegel; he then becomes a soldier, rises to wealth and
                    rank, but ultimately loses both, passes through many wild adventures, and
                    retires from the world to a desert island, in which he devotes himself to
                    religion. The value of the book consists in its graphic pictures of the horrors
                    of the Thirty Years’ War,—pictures relieved by touches of rough, sometimes of
                    the coarsest, humour. Another writer of great but insufficiently cultivated
                    talent was Moscherosch, author of <hi rend="italic">Gesichte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Philanders von Sittewalt</hi> (1650), which is partly an imitation
                    of the Suenos of Quevedo. It is made up of a number of visions or dreams, some
                    of which, like passages of <hi rend="italic">Simplicissimus,</hi> convey a vivid
                    idea of the sufferings of Germany during her great struggle; in others the
                    writer strikes with effect at popular follies, including the extravagances of
                    the second Silesian school. Sigmund von Birken wrote a history of the house of
                    Austria, which, although one-sided, is not without merit as a plain narrative;
                    and an ecclesiastical history by Gottfried Arndt has some interest as an attempt
                    to do justice to heretics condemned by the church. A very good book of travels
                    was written by Adam Olearius, describing the adventures of a mission to Persia,
                    of which the author and Paul Fleming were subordinate officials. A Protestant
                    pastor, Balthasar Schupp (1610-61), was the author of several didactic prose
                    works, which, although rough in form, display native wit, and pour wholesome
                    ridicule on the follies and barbarisms of contemporary writers. Against these
                    more or less valuable prose writings we must set piles of enormous romances in
                    the style of D’Urfé and Mademoiselle Scudéry. The favourite authors of these
                    astonishing productions were Buchholtz, who wrote <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hercules</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Valisca,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Herculiscus</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Herculadisla;</hi> Anton Ulrich, duke of Brunswick, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Octavia</hi> was loudly applauded by aristocratic readers; and Von Ziegler, the
                    writer of <hi rend="italic">The Asiatic Banise,</hi> an incredibly foolish book
                    which, published in 1688, took Germany by storm, and maintained its popularity
                    for more than a generation. Lohenstein was also the author of a romance, dealing
                    with the fortunes of Arminius and Thusnelda. It is hard to understand the
                    interest which works of this class once excited; they are barren of every
                    imaginative quality, with no kind of relation to life, and grotesque in style.
                    They were ultimately driven from the field by imitations of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Robinson Crusoe,</hi> which, notwithstanding the charm of their model, display
                    no more talent than the romances. Various writers imitated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simplicissimus,</hi> but they succeeded only in reproducing in an exaggerated
                    form its occasional brutalities. Abraham a Sancta Clara (1642-1709), a Vienna
                    priest, whose real name was Megerlin, revealed considerable power of satire in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Judas</hi><hi rend="italic">der Erzschelm</hi> (“Judas the
                    Arch-Rogue”), and in pamphlets and sermons; but his naturally rich fancy was
                    wholly uncontrolled, and his humorous passages are marred by a far larger number
                    in which he is pedantic or vulgar.</p>
                <p>No progress was made during the 17th century towards the formation of a national
                    drama. At the courts the Italian opera was the favourite entertainment, and the
                    wandering companies of actors represented for the most part barbarous plays of
                    their own devising, in which Hanswurst was generally the popular character.
                    Occasionally a man of some talent found his way into these companies<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n549/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0549-0532"/>; and one such actor, Velthen, showed so much
                    insight as to include in his repertory some of the works of Molière. But the
                    general tendency of what passed for the drama was from bad to worse, and the
                    usual character of the plays to a considerable extent justified the hatred with
                    which they were denounced by the clergy.</p>
                <p>For a time it almost seemed as if Germany could never hope to emerge from the
                    intellectual degradation into which she had sunk; but in reality the higher
                    forces of the nation were rallyiug in preparation for a new era. One of the
                    first symptoms of revival was presented by the remarkable pietistic movement,
                    which, although it ultimately led to the formation of the pettiest of petty
                    sects, was in its origin noble both in aim and in method. Its originators were
                    the ardent, generous, and eloquent Jacob Spener (1633— 1705), and August Hermann
                    Francke (1663-1727). The labours of these writers and preachers, who had close
                    affinity to the mystics, not only gave more sincerity to religious forms, but
                    did service to literature by quickening the popular intellect, and awakening
                    emotions which could find no satisfaction in the tedious writings of the day. Of
                    still greater importance were the beginnings of modern German philosophy. It was
                    in this dreary period that Germany gave birth to one of the most brilliant of
                    her thinkers, Leibnitz (1646-1716). The prevailing style of the day-—
                    “Mischmasch,” he called it—seems to have disgusted him with his own language,
                    for nearly all his writings are in French or Latin. Nevertheless, he exercised a
                    profound influence on the best minds of his generation. His monadology, his
                    doctrine of the pre-established harmony, his theory of the best of possible
                    worlds, while carrying on the central current of European thought, offered
                    Germauy new problems for solution, and helped to replace a rigid orthodoxy by a
                    spirit of disinterested curiosity. The task of giving shape to his ideas was
                    undertaken by Wolf (1679— 1754), who had none of Leibnitz’s genius, and often
                    crushed his fruitful suggestions under a burden of logical proofs. The disciple,
                    however, so far taught in his master’s spirit as to exalt the claims of reason
                    over mere authority; he aLso encouraged habits of systematic thinking, and
                    proved by his practice that serious writers had no excuse for clothing their
                    doctrines in any other language than their own. Less philosophical than
                    Leibnitz, and even than Wolf, Christian Thomasius (1655-1728) was an impressive
                    popular thinker. He edited the first German periodical, a sort of monthly
                    magazine, in which he vigorously attacked pedants and bigots. His style,
                    although not pure or graceful, received glow and warmth from his moral
                    earnestness. Through him literature became a great practical power, for it was
                    mainly he who put an end to the burning of witches and to punishment by
                    torture.</p>
                <p>Even in poetry, before the close of this period, there were a few glimmerings of
                    dawn. Wernicke, a man of cultivated and severe taste, published a volume of
                    epigrams (1697) in which he thrust home at the follies of Lohenstein and his
                    followers; and that his mockery had effect was plain from the outcry of two
                    noisy members of the school, Postel and Hunold. Günther (1695-1723), who died
                    too soon for his genius, wrote lyrics in which the voice of nature was once more
                    heard. “A poet in the full sense of the word,” Goethe calls him; and no one can
                    realize how great was his achievement without making some acquaintance with his
                    truly dismιl predecessors. Brockes (1680-1747) had not Günther’s fine
                    spontaneity, but he had the merit of giving simple expression to unaffected
                    pleasures,—a virtue for which historians of literature, remembering the
                    formality of the court poets and the insincere posturing of the second Silesian
                    school, readily forgive his occasional flatness and garrulity. He was the first
                    German poet who displayed some knowledge of English literature. Although
                    unacquainted with Shakespeare, he directed his countrymen to Milton, Young, and
                    Pope; and he appended to his chief work, <hi rend="italic">Irdisches
                    Vergnügen</hi><hi rend="italic">in Gott,</hi> a fair translation of Thomson’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Seasons.</hi></p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">The Period of Revival.—</hi> For five centuries there had
                    been no great literary period in Germany which deserves to be named with the
                    famous periods in the history of England, France, Italy, and Spain. The
                    Reformation was a spiritual achievement of splendid originality, but in
                    literature Germany had for the most part followed timidly in the footsteps of
                    her neighbours. She was soon to make up amply for this tardy progress; and we
                    have now reached the age in which she fairly awoke to a consciousness of her
                    strength,—an age mainly of preparation, but one which has also an independent
                    interest, since it includes names that rank high in the history of European as
                    well as of German culture. We have seen that in the midst of the period of decay
                    there were already symptoms of revival. These became more and more numerous, and
                    while they increased, Germany was suddenly startled by the appearance in her
                    midst of a great warrior and statesman. It is impossible to estimate with any
                    approach to exactness the impression produced by Frederick II.; but it is beyond
                    doubt that he profoundly affected the intellectual life not only of Prussia but
                    of Germany. After the Thirty Years’ War the people had lost confidence in
                    themselves. They forgot that they had a magnificent history; they only saw that
                    the structure of society had been rudely battered, and that nearly every
                    enterprise of the nation as a whole ended in failure. Frederick the Great
                    restored to them faith in their own vigour; he convinced them that it depended
                    on themselves whether or not they should rise to their ancient place in Europe;
                    and by the prompt, faithful, and energetic discharge of his personal duties he
                    set before them an example which was widely felt. Literature shared the impulse
                    which penetrated the national life. It became stronger, more independent, and
                    moved forward with the assured step of a power conscious of high destinies.</p>
                <p>Several causes of a purely literary character contributed to promote this
                    advance. One of these was the revival of classical study in the best sense.
                    Classical study had been pursued with ardour by the humanists; but after them it
                    became dry, pedantic, and tedious, and was subordinated to theological
                    controversy. In the 18th century a number of scholars arose, who, ceasing to
                    interest themselves in merely verbal criticism, sought to pierce to the meaning
                    of classical writers, to understand and enjoy their imagi native effects, their
                    ideas, and their style. They also strove to construct what the Germans call
                    “Alterthumswissenschaft,” the science of antiquity—that is, to comprehend the
                    life of the Greeks and Romans, their religion, art, and philosophy, and to
                    interpret their literature in the light of this knowledge. The movement passed
                    from one university to another and soon made itself felt in the public, schools.
                    Thus the best class of minds were familiarized with higher ideals than they had
                    yet known, and received, almost without being aware of it, the germs of new
                    activity. Another cause, which co-operated with the more intelligent study of
                    the classics, was acquaintance with English literature. Hitherto the foreign
                    influences which had affected the Germans had come from Italy, Spain, and, above
                    all, France; but now they began to know something of contemporary English
                    writers, and gradually worked their way back to Shakespeare. The English genius

                    belongs to Haller (1708-77), who, although chiefly famous as a man of science,
                    revealed imagination and poetic sympathies in his descriptive and didactic poem
                    <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Alpen</hi> (“The Alps”). Hagedorn
                    (1708-54) was for a time the most popular poet of his day in virtue of his
                    songs, odes, fables, and narratives in verse. He was of a genial and happy
                    temper; and no author who preceded him was master of so clear, bright, and
                    animated a style. One of the chief characteristics of the time was the tendency
                    of writers to group themselves in schools. If two or three writers who lived in
                    the same place happened to become friends, they forthwith called themselves a
                    school; and the result was that they usually developed some marked common
                    characteristics. These coteries inevitably became more or less narrow and
                    exclusive; but they also stimulated each other to fresh effort, and the clash of
                    their ideals sometimes helped the outside world to new points of view. The Saxon
                    school, whose headquarters were in Leipsic, was for some years more prominent
                    than any of its rivals. It was founded by Gottsched (1700-66), who, although he
                    made himself ridiculous by pedantry and vanity, became the ruling literary man
                    of Germany. He was appointed a professor in Leipsic in 1724, and founded there
                    “The German Society,” which soon became the centre of a number of similar bodies
                    for the cultivation of literature. Gottsched aimed at nothing short of the
                    complete reformation of German poetry. He had the sense to see that if he wished
                    to reach the people he must begin with the drama, and he was fortunate enough to
                    find in Frau Neuber, who had formed a company in Leipsic, an intelligent actress
                    capable of giving effect to his ideas. With her help he banished Hanswurst from
                    the stage; and she was forthwith supplied with plays by himself, by his clever
                    wife Louisa Victoria, and by several disciples. He gave his attention chiefly to
                    tragedy, and unfortunately he had but one idea in regard to it—that it had
                    reached the utmost possible excellence in the classic drama of France. The
                    English drama, he admitted, had some merit, but only in so far as it had
                    modelled itself on the work of Corneille and Racine. Hence, in his chief tragedy
                    <hi rend="italic">Der Sterbende</hi><hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> (“The Dying
                    Cato”) he availed himself freely of Addison’s <hi rend="italic">Cato;</hi> the
                    Elizabethan dramatists, of whom hie direct knowledge was slight, he believed to
                    be mere barbarians. His taste gave the law in nearly every theatre in which
                    German plays were acted; and it was certainly a good consequence that Lohenstein
                    fell into permanent disrepute, while even the groundlings began to feel that the
                    uncouth works which actors themselves had hitherto produced were, to say the
                    least, far from perfection. On the other hand, the German genius was forced to
                    submit to arbitrary laws antagonistic to its true nature; and so long as its
                    submission lasted, a genuinely native drama was impossible. It was not only in
                    regard to drama that Gottsched insisted on absolute subservience to France. In
                    regard to all species of verse his sympathies were with the court poets, and
                    both by example and by critical precept he insisted that in poetry as in
                    everything else the understanding must be supreme, and that clearness of
                    statement, correctness in the management of figures, and logical arrangement are
                    the highest literary virtues. Regarding the function of imagination and feeling
                    in poetry he had no suggestion to offer.</p>
                <p>There were writers who instinctively felt that this could not be a complete
                    theory; and of these the chief were Bodmer and Breitinger, the leaders of the
                    Swiss school, which was formed in Zürich. These writers, although destitute of
                    creative genius, had nourished their imagination on English poetry, especially
                    on <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> and it was incredible to them that a
                    critical doctrine could be correct which left out of account or condemned their
                    favourite writers. At first they were on friendly terms with Gottsched, but when
                    the latter harshly criticized a translation of Milton’s epic issued by Bodmer,
                    his Swiss rivals prepared to defend themselves; and thus broke out a literary
                    controversy which made much noise at the time, and in which the angry critics,
                    to the edification of onlookers, pelted each other unmercifully with abusive
                    epithets. Neither party was fully conscious of the significance of its attack,
                    and sometimes the warriors seemed almost to change sides. But the general
                    tendency of the dispute was that the Swiss school, amid much exaggeration,
                    defended the claims of free poetic impulse, while the Saxon school, in a narrow
                    and pedantic spirit, maintained those of conscious art. It is hard werk now to
                    follow their arguments, but at the time they interested a considerable public in
                    literature, and opened fresh lines of investigation. One of the results was that
                    Baumgarten, a disciple of Wolf, published a book which Germans regard as the
                    beginning of modern aesthetics,—a branch of mental science to which their
                    philosophers have ever since devoted thought and labour.</p>
                <p>While this warfare of critics was going on, there were in Leipsic a number of
                    young writers who more or less attached themselves to Gottsched, but who
                    gradually shook off his authority. They founded a periodical, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bremer</hi><hi rend="italic">Beiträge</hi> (the “Bremen
                    Contributions ”), which had considerable influence in forming their own style,
                    and in keeping alive the popular interest excited by the central controversy.
                    After a while many of them were scattered over different parts of Germany, but
                    they retained their original impulse, and continued to be known as members of
                    the Saxon school. Gellert (1715- 69) was by far the most famous of the circle.
                    It is impossible to mention without respect this amiable writer. His plays are
                    unimportant, but his fables and tales reveal so gentle and pure a spirit that we
                    cannot wonder at his great popularity. He was a favourite among all classes,
                    even Frederick the Great himself, who rarely condescended to notice a German
                    author, declaring after a long interview that he was “the most reasonable of
                    German scholars.” His supreme defect was a tendency to weak sentimentalism and
                    pious commonplace. Rabener (1714-71) acquired fame as a good-humoured satirist.
                    His prose is fresh and clear, but he has not sufficient grasp of any important
                    principle to entitle him to very high rank among moralists. Christian Felix
                    Weisse (1726-1804), the friend of Lessing’s youth, failed as a writer of
                    tragedy, but was a favourite author of comic operettas. He was also the first
                    successful German writer for children, and edited for many years a periodical
                    (the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothek der schonen Wissenschaften)</hi> which had a
                    favourable influence on popular culture. Johann Elias Schlegel (1718-49), uncle
                    of the two Schlegels who became long afterwards leaders of the Romantic school,
                    gave evidence of high dramatic talent, but died when he was beginning to be
                    conscious of his power. Arnold Ebert distinguished himself by good translations
                    from English; and Zachariä wrote with some success mock heroics in the style of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Pape of the Lock.</hi> Kästner, whose disputations at the
                    Leipsic university were diligently attended by young Lessing, made himself
                    feared as a biting epigrammatist. Cramer became one of the most eloquent
                    preachers of the day, wrote popular religious odes, and edited <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Northern Guardian,</hi> a well-meaning but rather commonplace imitation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> of Steele. These writers, who from being
                    Gottsched’s friends all became more or less hostile to him, have a clearness and
                    grace of style which were unknown in the previous century. Another author who
                    was from the beginning Gottsched’s enemy, but who had no relation with this
                    particular school, may be here mentioned,-—Liscow (1701-60).</p>

                <p>The Halle school of poets was in some respects different both from the Saxon and
                    the Swiss schools. Its original members were Gleim (1719-1803), Uz (1720-96),
                    and Götz (1721-81). These three writers formed a friendship in their student
                    days at Halle, where they came under the influence of the poets, Pastor Lange,
                    and the tutor of his children, Immanuel Pyra, ardent disciples of Bodmer and
                    Breitinger. The young students, while feeling sincere respect for the Swiss
                    critics, did not attempt any very serious flight; they preferred to amuse
                    themselves with lively little anacreontic verses, which they soon brought into
                    high repute. Afterwards Gleim settled in Halberstadt, where he lived to an
                    extreme age. His didactic poem <hi rend="italic">Halladat,</hi> which he wrote,
                    he himself modestly explained, in order to gratify a wish of his youth to
                    produce a book like the Bible, has no vitality; but during the Seven Years’ War
                    he composed TΓαr <hi rend="italic">Songs of a Grenadier,</hi> which were
                    everywhere read, and have not yet lost their popularity. They were edited by
                    Gleim’s friend Lessing, who, however, protested against their patriotic
                    vehemence. Gleim was one of the most kindly of men, and became the patron of
                    young poets, several of whom he always had in his pleasant bachelor’s home. He
                    also kept up an extensive correspondence with other writers·, which is now an
                    important source of information respecting the movements of contemporary
                    literature. One of his most intimate friends, who resembled him only in
                    geniality of disposition, was the noble-hearted Ewald Christian von Kleist
                    (1715-59), who was fatally wounded on the battle-field of Kunersdorf. He would
                    still deserve to be remembered as the man whom, of all others, the equally noble
                    Lessing most loved. His descriptive poem <hi rend="italic">Frühling</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(“</hi> Spring ”) is partly an imitation of Thomson; but it is
                    also the work of an independent lover of nature, who knew how to give beautiful
                    utterance to true and simple feeling. Ramler (1725-98), another friend of Gleim,
                    and the friend, too, of Kleist and Lessing, wrote spirited odes in Horatian
                    metres, which, like the <hi rend="italic">War Songs of a Grenadier,</hi> gave
                    pleasure because of their strongly patriotic tone,—the direct result in both
                    cases of Frederick’s influence. Anna Louisa Karsch (1722-91), a poetess who owed
                    much to Gleim’s goodness, was a favourite among the literary men of the day,
                    butj her verses are ruder than they ought to have been at so late a date.
                    Idyllic poetry, which Kleist and Götz to some extent cultivated, was taken up in
                    earnest by Solomon Gessner (1730-87), whose prose idylls, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Death of Abel, The First Sailor,</hi> and others, were translated into French
                    and English, and were better received in their foreign dress than in their
                    original form. They are written in an easy style, and express much harmless
                    although somewhat tedious sentiment. He was imitated by Xaver Bronner, a
                    Catholic priest, whose idylls have not half the merit of his autobiography,
                    which affords remarkable insight into the religious life of Catholic Germany
                    about the middle of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>The religious lyric, which had shared the general decay during the latter half of
                    the 17th century, displayed more vitality during part of this period. It owed
                    its fresh life mainly to the pietists, who reopened fountains of spiritual
                    feeling that had been apparently dried up by theologians. Among the best of this
                    younger generation of hymn writers were Freylinghausen, Neumeister, and
                    Tersteegen. Their fame was, however, less extensive than that of Count von
                    Zinzendorf (1700-60), the founder of the sect of Herrnhiiter or Moravian
                    Brethren. Besides hymns he wrote religious works in prose, and made himself one
                    of the most prominent figures of his time by ardent missionary zeal. His
                    followers, like all deeply religious sects in Germany, delighted in hymns; and
                    many of those they produced are remarkable for the sensuous, sometimes almost
                    sensual, forms in which their emotions are expressed.</p>
                <p>Fables were at this time an extremely popular class of writings, and nearly every
                    imaginative writer sought to distinguish himself as a fabulist. The Swiss
                    school, indeed, in their zeal for a combination of the wonderful and the useful
                    in literature, maintained that the fable was the highest type of literature. As
                    a rule, Lafontaine was taken as the model in works of this kind, but we look in
                    vain among his German imitators for his exquisite grace and naïveté Gellert
                    stands at the head of the more sentimental fabulists; after him may be named
                    Willanow and Lichtwer. The latter (1719-83) has humour as well as sentiment, and
                    some of his fables have an artistic finish that indicates a faculty by which he
                    might have won distinction in more important labours.</p>
                <p>From about the middle of the 18th century onwards a number of prose writers, who
                    may be classed together as popular philosophers, worked effectively for the
                    enlightenment of ordinary readers. They attached themselves to some extent to
                    Wolf; they also came under the influence, although not in any great degree, of
                    the French Encyclopedists; and they were admiring students of the English
                    deists, and of Locke, Shaftesbury, and Hutcheson. They are often condemned for
                    the shallowness of their thought; and if we compare them with the great thinkers
                    who followed them, the condemnation is just. They did not grasp the significance
                    of the problems which had been handed down by Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibnitz,
                    with which Hume was now grappling, and which were soon to enter upon a new phase
                    in the critical philosophy of Kant. In regard to religion they had a very
                    imperfect appreciation of every'element that could not be expressed in clear
                    logical statements; feeling and imagination were rigidly subordinated to the
                    understanding. And they had not even a remote suspicion of what is now familiar
                    as the historical spirit, so that they displayed amazing narrowness of vision in
                    their treatment of past spiritual developments, and of contemporary creeds with
                    which they did not happen to agree. But if we are to do justice to these popular
                    philosophers, they must be compared rather with their predecessors than with
                    their successors. An important place belongs to them in the movement by which
                    vital human interests have been raised above theological disputes, by which
                    morality has received a basis independent of dogmatic religion, and by which
                    toleration has been secured for men of every faith. They were penetrated by a
                    truly humane sentiment; and it must be counted a high merit that in a country
                    which had been more or less dominated by pedants, and whose great writers of a
                    later age have not always attempted to be both profound and clear, they sought
                    to express themselves in unpretending and straightforward German. The chief of
                    the popular philosophers was Moses Mendelssohn (1729-86), not a deep or massive
                    thinker, but a man of fine moral sympathies, an enthusiast for freedom—from the
                    lack of which he himself, as a Jew, keenly suffered—and an incisive
                    psychological analyst. His friend, Frederick Nicolai (1733-1811), the Berlin
                    bookseller, had the misfortune to outlive his epoch. He had only words of
                    contempt for Goethe and Schiller; and Kant, whom he did not profess to
                    understand, seemed to him a sort of cross between a bungler and an impostor.
                    These terrible mistakes have made poor Nicolai, notwithstanding his lifelong
                    warfare against bigotry, the type of a narrow-minded bigot. Yet in his earlier
                    days he was recognized by such a judge as Lessing, with whose friendship he was
                    honoured, as a writer of talent. And his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothek</hi>

                    popular philosophers with a medium for the expression of their opinions on all
                    the great questions which then agitated Germany. Other popular philosophers were
                    George Sulzer (1720-79), who devoted himself to aesthetics in the spirit of the
                    Swiss school, but with the advantage of later lights; Thomas Abbt (1738-66),
                    whose style was one of uncommon vigour; Christian Garve (1742-98), who did not
                    attempt any great original work, but in letters and articles examined many
                    individual philosophic questions from new points of view; and Johann Jacob Engel
                    (1741-1802), whose <hi rend="italic">Philosoph für</hi><hi rend="italic">die
                    Welt</hi> (“Philosopher for the World”) interested a class of readers who would
                    have been unable to follow a more adventurous guide. Zimmermann (1728— 95)
                    hardly deserves to be mentioned in such good company; but his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Betrachtungen über</hi><hi rend="italic">die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Einsamkeit</hi> (“Observations on Solitude ”) by its sentimentalism and
                    rhetoric carried his name far beyond the bounds of Germany. Some theologians,
                    without exactly sharing the beliefs of the popular philosophers, were profoundly
                    affected by them. Among these were Mosheim, the ecclesiastical historian;
                    Spalding, the translator of Shaftesbury; and Jerusalem, the father of the young
                    writer whose suicide suggested some elements in Goethe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Werther.</hi> These liberal theologians did not hold a very intelligible
                    logical position, but they were of some importance by their attempts to
                    introduce a freer and more polished style of eloquence than had hitherto marked
                    the German pulpit. In regard to the permanent movements of thought, their
                    influence was greatly inferior to that of Michaelis and Semler, whose labours
                    heralded the approach of modern Biblical criticism.</p>
                <p>In history Germany produced at this time at least one writer of high eminence,
                    Justus Möser (1720-94), author of the <hi rend="italic">Osnabrückische
                    Geschichte</hi> (“History of Osnabrück ”) and <hi rend="italic">Patriotische
                    Phantasien</hi><hi rend="italic">(f</hi> Patriotic Fancies ’’). Möser was the
                    first German historian who wrote a good style and attempted to penetrate to the
                    meaning of events and to present them in the light of great principles. He also
                    produced a strong impression by his enlightened patriotism and by his burning
                    scorn of wrong. Schröck and Schlözer were prominent historians, and the latter
                    made himself known as a clear writer on contemporary politics. Karl von Moser,
                    of Stuttgart, applied to political subjects a faculty for wit and satire that
                    was estimated highly in his own day. *</p>
                <p>It has been already stated that the revival of classical study was one of the
                    chief causes by which the mind of Germany was awakened to new effort. Professors
                    Christ and Ernesti, of Leipsic, who were the favourite teachers of many young
                    students, including Lessing, were two of the chief writers to whom this revival
                    was due. Incomparably greater than either, however, was Johann Joachim
                    Winckelmann (1717-68), whose <hi rend="italic">History of Ancient Art</hi>
                    (1764) opened a new era in the appreciation of ancient life. Later investigation
                    has corrected Winckelmann on many points, but no critic has displayed a keener
                    feeling for the beauty and the significance of such works as came within his
                    knowledge, or a truer imagination in bridging over the gulfs at which direct
                    knowledge failed him. And his style, warm with the glow of sustained enthusiasm,
                    yet calm, dignified, and harmonious, was worthy of his splendid theme. What he
                    did for ancient art was to some extent done for ancient literature by the
                    untiring editorial labours of Christian Gottlob Heyne (1729-1812).</p>
                <p>Important as were many of these writers, Winckelmann above all, they exercised
                    slight influence on the national mind compared with the three men whom the
                    Germans justly regard as the founders of their classical literature— Klopstock
                    (1724-1803), Wieland (1733-1813), and Lessing (1729-1781).</p>
                <p>Klopstock stood in direct relation to the Swiss writers. When a pupil at
                    Schulpforta, one of the great Saxon schools which sent forth many of the best
                    authors of the day, he was a diligent student of Bodmer, by whose critical
                    principles he guided himself in reading Homer, Virgil, and Milton. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Messiah,</hi> on which his fame mainly rests, is now little read,
                    and it is impossible even to glance through it without becoming conscious of
                    glaring faults. Klopstock’s genius was essentially lyrical; he lacked the
                    plastic force of imagination necessary for a great epic. His central figure is
                    nowhere presented in clear sharp outlines; it wavers between two distinct
                    conceptions, that of a divine and that of a human character. And the facts to
                    which he turns our gaze in the crisis of his narrative are not such as kindle
                    the deepest sympathies; he exhausts the powers of language to convey an
                    impression of the Messiah’s sufferings, but we hear nothing of the qualities of
                    soul which these sufferings rouse into action. The subordinate characters are
                    innumerable, and except Abaddona, a repentant fallen angel, between whose
                    character and whose fate there is an effective contrast, none of them can be
                    said to live; they exist only as an excuse for the utterance of Klopstock’s
                    feelings. They talk incessantly, weep, embrace, and kiss, but they never do
                    anything that exhibits more than a vast quantity of obtrusive sentiment.
                    Notwithstanding its obvious defects, however, the <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi>
                    has qualities which must still command admiration; it reveals a nature full of
                    lofty aspiration and deep humanity, and it contains individual images of
                    striking force and beauty.</p>
                <p>It would be difficult to imagine anything more dreary than Klopstock’s plays, the
                    subject of three of which is Arminius, while the others deal with scriptural
                    themes. He knew enough neither of life nor of the stage to be a true dramatist;
                    his characters are mere names, and the incidents are grouped according to no
                    principle of art. His odes, which he continued to write from the beginning to
                    the end of his long career, are of far higher excellence. Those which derive
                    their inspiration from Northern mythology are too remote from general sympathy
                    and too obscure in construction to awaken interest; but the stamp of genius is
                    upon several of the lyrics in which he expresses his passionate feeling for the
                    grander phenomena of nature, his ardent patriotism, his enthusiasm for freedom,
                    and his elevated sense of human worth and destiny. Both as an epic poet and as a
                    writer of odes he had many imitators, who, like most others of their class,
                    exaggerated the defects of their model and left his virtues alone. His influence
                    upon the intellectual life of Germany was deep, and, on the whole, beneficent.
                    He encouraged the self-respect of his countrymen, intensified their desire for
                    an independent literature, and by handling high themes, sometimes powerfully,
                    alwayβ seriously, suggested that the national imagination would reveal its full
                    capacity only by undertaking greater enterprises than any it had yet
                    attempted.</p>
                <p>Although Klopstock was one of the central literary figures during two
                    generations, he was not a prolific writer; Wieland, on the other hand, was one
                    of the most prolific of German authors. He was continually at his desk, and in
                    the course of his career produced a considerable library. Of his many works the
                    romantic poem <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> is by far the most famous, and the
                    only one that really pleases modern readers. <hi rend="italic">Agathon</hi> is
                    perhaps the best of the prose romances in which he endeavoured to depict ancient
                    Greek life. He was not endowed with great vividness of imagination, and his
                    prevailing tendency is to extreme diffuseness; but some of his descriptive
                    passages, especially those in <hi rend="italic">Oberon,</hi> have a touch of
                    ideal grace which enables us to return to them with fresh relish. He had a fine
                    appreciation of style, and by the study of Greek <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n553/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0553-0536"/> and French masterpieces persistently strove to
                    acquire lightness, clearness, and ease. Even yet few German writers will compare
                    with him in these qualities. In all his works he had a strongly didactic
                    tendency, but his teaching was the opposite of that inculcated by most modern
                    writers who deliberately aim at ethical effect. Above all, he differed from his
                    great contemporary, Klopstock. Writing at first as a strict pietist, he
                    ultimately became a pronounced Epicurean in the popular sense, and made it his
                    object to proclaim an Epicurean theory of life, discouraging enthusiasm,
                    laughing at such aspirations as those of his own youth, exalting the claims of
                    the senses, and placing the highest virtue, in kindliness and good humour. This
                    tendency often conducts him to more slippery ground than any on which a German
                    writer of his standing would now venture; but it also gives him innumerable
                    occasions for the play of a gentle and refined irony.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the excellences of Wieland and Klopstock, both are essentially
                    writers of the past. This cannot be said of Lessing, the third great German of
                    this period; he is still a living influence. He is, indeed, the only writer
                    before Goethe whom Germans can now read without feeling themselves in a world
                    foreign to their sympathies. Throughout his career he strove to renew and
                    fructify the intellectual life of his nation, and he achieved his aim by
                    important creative activity, and by the clearest, freest, and most drastic
                    criticism of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>As an imaginative writer he was chiefly distinguished in the drama, and his most
                    important dramatic work is <hi rend="italic">Minna von Barnhelm.</hi> If it
                    cannot be said that this is, in the highest sense, a comedy of genius, it is at
                    any rate a comedy which contains elements of permanent interest. The characters
                    are vividly presented; the plot is systematically, yet naturally, unfolded; the
                    dialogue is clear, fresh, and animated. And the work has the high merit of
                    giving artistic shape to elements taken by the dramatist from the living world
                    around him. <hi rend="italic">Emilia Galotti</hi> is marred by a deep flaw in
                    the conception of the central figure; but every other character in the tragedy
                    is conceived with bold imaginative force, and it is possible for a competent
                    actress to sotten, if not to harmonize, even the clashing elements in Emilia
                    herself. No drama making even a distant approach to the excellence of these two
                    plays had been produced in Germany; they thus gave literature in its highest
                    department a fresh start.</p>
                <p>But valuable as were Lessing’s imaginative creations, they were inferior to his
                    labours as a thinker. Here he was absolutely supreme among his contemporaries;
                    and in some respects he has not since been surpassed. His method is invariably
                    critical, but he aims at rising to the highest, most universal aspects of every
                    subject with which he deals. As a master of style he ranks with the greatest
                    European writers. The structure of his sentences is clear, precise, and compact;
                    and he keeps the mind awake by vivid images drawn from nature and from human
                    life, by interesting, sometimes remote, allusions, by rapid strokes of wit, and
                    by unexpected turns of thought, as if he were abandoning his main theme, while
                    he is in reality indirectly advancing it. He has often been called the most
                    critical of poets; it would be equally just to call him the most poetical of
                    critics.</p>
                <p>The greatest of Lessing’s purely critical writings is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laocoon,</hi> a fragment, but a fragment containing the germs of much of the
                    best thought of his own and the immediately succeeding generations. It has an
                    enduring value as the first serious and great attempt to distinguish sharply the
                    realms of art and poetry, and to foster both by subjecting each to its own laws.
                    Next in importance stands his <hi rend="italic">Hamburgische Dramaturgie,</hi> a
                    series of criticisms on plays represented at the Hamburg National Theatre. By
                    these splendid criticisms, which are based in the main on Aristotle’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Poetics,</hi> with many side-references to Diderot’s theories, he
                    put an end to the abject submission of dramatic writers to French traditions. In
                    his later years he issued the <hi rend="italic">Wolfenbüttel</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fragments,</hi> portions of a theological work by Reimarus, a
                    deistical writer of admirable force and clearness. He thus became involved in a
                    hot controversy with indignant professors and pastors, the noisiest of whom was
                    Pastor Goeze of Hamburg. The tracts issued by Lessing in the course of this
                    controversy are in form among the most perfect of his writings; they are at once
                    learned, keen, and witty. And in the history of Western thought they are of deep
                    significance. His immediate object was to secure for criticism absolute freedom
                    of movement; but he did very much more. He foreshadowed, as a vital element of
                    the coming time, inquiry as to the origin and growth of the Scriptures, the rise
                    of Christianity, and the fundamental character of religion. And he indicated a
                    far higher standpoint than that of the popular philosophers by vindicating the
                    claims of feeling in spiritual life as opposed to those of the bare
                    understanding. In his <hi rend="italic">Education of the Human Race</hi> he gave
                    systematic shape to the fruitful principle that a religion which is not true
                    absolutely or for all time may be of vast importance by meeting the needs of a
                    portion of the race in special epochs, and that there is in history,
                    notwithstanding apparent reactions, a progressive movement towards higher
                    intellectual and moral ideals. The suggestions thrown out in controversy he
                    developed artistically in one of the greatest of his writings, the fine dramatic
                    poem, <hi rend="italic">Nathan the Wise,</hi> a work which enshrines all that
                    was noblest in the struggles and the aspirations of his age, and connects the
                    thought of the 18th with that of the 19th century. As a drama, it has serious
                    faults; but it powerfully effects its purpose by revealing, in the enlightened
                    Jew, its hero, the grandeur of a nature which, instead of binding itself in
                    dogmatic fetters, cultivates a spirit of free and disinterested humanity.</p>
                <p>Thus in all directions this great writer laboured for the intellectual
                    regeneration of his people. If Goethe, Schiller, and Kant found a nation
                    prepared to receive their work, they owed the fact to many causes; but among
                    these the chief were the political activity of Frederick II. and the literary
                    activity of Lessing.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="italic">The Classical Period.—</hi> At the close of the Seven
                    Years’ War the conditions of public life were very unfavourable to literature.
                    The country was impoverished, and Frederick the Great and Maria Theresa were
                    almost the only sovereigns who showed the least regard for the welfare of their
                    subjects. But the mind of the nation had been thoroughly aroused from its long
                    slumber. It had been startled into patriotism by Frederick’s unsurpassed energy,
                    while the labours of the chief writers had imbued the better part of the middle
                    class with a desire for a more varied and interesting life. As political freedom
                    was still a dream of the future, they turned more and more to books for
                    refreshment and stimulus. Multitudes of young men who in other circumstances
                    would have occupied themselves solely with practical duty became authors, and
                    they urged each other to an activity without parallel in any previous
                    period.</p>
                <p>Most of these young writers were deeply influenced by the men of the older
                    generation—Lessing, Wieland, and Klopstock. They were also ardent students of
                    Shakespeare, Ossian, and Dr Young, poets who were oddly supposed to be on the
                    same level and to share the same tendencies. Rousseau excited almost as much
                    enthusiasm in Germany as in France, and the criticism of Diderot found many warm
                    admirers. Under these diverse influences a curious movement began which is known
                    as that of “Sturm und <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0554-0537"/> Drang” (“Storm and Pressure”). It lasted, from
                    about 1770, for ten or twelve years, and included nearly all the writers who
                    still had fame to win. Their most prominent quality was discontent with the
                    existing world. They detested not only tyranny and superstition but everything
                    which prevented, or seemed to prevent, the free exercise of any powerful
                    impulse. To break down conventionalities appeared to the “Sturm und Drang” poets
                    their true function; but even this did not satisfy them. They longed for some
                    knowledge deeper and more intimate than that attained by science, philosophy, or
                    history, for some emotion intenser than can arise from any known human relation.
                    All these conflicting feelings they expressed in their writings. From slavish
                    submission to French critical laws they were of course completely emancipated.
                    Most of them despised laws of every kind in literature as well as in life, and
                    continually proclaimed that the duty of a man of genius was towrite precisely as
                    nature dictated. By “genius” they meant vehement sensations, by “nature” a free
                    use of vigorous epithets.</p>
                <p>The writer who formed the connecting link between Lessing on the one hand and
                    Goethe and Schiller on the other, and whom the best writers of the “Sturm und
                    Drang” movement regarded as their critical guide, was Johann Gottfried Herder
                    (1744-1803). Herder is sometimes compared with Lessing, but while Lessing has a
                    cosmopolitan touch which makes him intelligible and attractive to all the world,
                    Herder is in the strictest sense a German, and is only slightly studied beyond
                    his own nation. He was less boldly original than his older contemporary, and
                    never attained the clearness, force, and classic beauty of Lessing’s style.
                    Nevertheless he is justly ranked among the most distinguished spirits Germany
                    has produced. His mind was receptive in many different directions, and what he
                    absorbed he made his own by independent thought, giving it out in new and
                    suggestive forms. As an original poet, Herder does not rank high; yet genuine
                    poetic impulses are visible in the poem in which he gave shape to the Spanish
                    legends of the Cid. The literature in which he looked for the highest
                    manifestation of thought and feeling was that which appeals to popular sentiment
                    and has its root in popular life. Lessing had already called attention to the
                    songs and ballads of the people; but Herder was the first German who decisively
                    followed the impulse which led in England to the publication of Percy’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Reliques.</hi> In his <hi rend="italic">Stimmen der Völker</hi>
                    (“Voices of the Peoples”) he brought together an admirable collection of the
                    lyrical utterances of many races; and it would be difficult to overrate the
                    service he thus rendered, for he conducted his countrymen to a source of
                    imaginative pleasure and revival in which their literature is exceptionally
                    rich. By far his most important prose work was his <hi rend="italic">Ideen zur
                    Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit</hi> (“Ideas towards the Philosophy of
                    the History of Humanity”), in which, working to some extent on the lines laid
                    down in the brief paragraphs of Lessing’s <hi rend="italic">Education of the
                    Human Race,</hi> he develops the conception of progress, and indicates that we
                    can fully understand any single element of history only by seeing it in the
                    light of human evolution as a whole. This excellent book elevated the aims and
                    enlarged the scope of historic inquiry in Germany; and it still produces a
                    powerful moral effect by its noble spirit of humanity. To the end of his days
                    Herder was animated by a fine enthusiasm for human happiness, and it lights up
                    his pages even when his subject does not lead to its direct expression.</p>
                <p>To Herder belonged the high honour of stimulating and directing, at a critical
                    stage, the young genius of Johann Wolfgang Goethe (1749-1832). In naming Goethe
                    we mention the writer who holds in German literature the place held by
                    Shakespeare in the literature of England, and by Dante in that of Italy. He
                    towers high above even the greatest of his contemporaries, predecessors, and
                    successors,—Schiller himself, who is most worthily associated with him, being
                    far inferior in breadth of sympathy and splendour of creative impulse. Goethe,
                    indeed, is one of the few writers who, while marked by strongly national
                    characteristics, belong to the world rather than to a particular country. The
                    special phases of his age have begun to pass away, but his best work has lost
                    none of its freshness: it cannot become old, since it is rooted in elements of
                    human life that eternally endure.</p>
                <p>All things co-operated to render worthy of his destiny this favoured child of
                    fortune. During his long life he enjoyed almost uninterrupted physical vigour;
                    he was born into a family of prosperous circumstances, although not so highly
                    placed as to satisfy his ambition; he received the best intellectual training
                    his epoch could afford; in Weimar he was free to adapt the plan of his life to
                    his inclinations; and he appeared at the very time when, by an era of sincere
                    poetic endeavour and unparalleled critical labour, the mind of the nation had
                    been prepared for the boldest efforts of genius. Nature has seldom lavished so
                    many advantages on the greatest of her great men.</p>
                <p>The quality in Goethe which immediately arrests attention is the extraordinary
                    range of his activity. Hardly any aspect of human existence was strange to him.
                    He possessed in an unsurpassed degree the faculty of dramatically thinking
                    himself into phases of life to which his personal impulses would not have led
                    him; and he deliberately enlarged his experience by exercising this power at
                    every stage of his career. It was his prevailing conviction that all ideals
                    which fascinate or have fascinated humanity must have a touch of vitality; and
                    none was so remote from him but he sought to penetrate to its meaning. He could
                    be just to Hellenic culture without doing wrong to mediaevalism; he appreciated
                    the spirit of Christianity without being indifferent to the faith of the Parsees
                    or the Buddhists; he presented the ascetic aspirations of a “beautiful soul,”
                    while setting forth the gaiety of the brightest and. most careless tempers; he
                    felt the charm of art at the same time that he carried on profound researches in
                    science; he loved his country, and yet, even when it was overrun by Napoleon’s
                    troops, he would not join the patriots in saying a harsh word of France. This
                    absolute universality destroyed enthusiasm for special practical movements; but
                    it gave astonishing variety to his literary achievements. Goethe’s was in every
                    respect a thoroughly poetic nature. He could not pass through a profound
                    experience, an image of beauty could not cross his vision, without an
                    accompanying impulse to find for his emotion an adequate sensuous
                    representation. So vast a body of writings as bis inevitably includes much that
                    is tedious, but in his happiest moments his genius moved with the ease, the
                    certainty, the calmness of the great forces of nature; he could be as perfect in
                    the lightest stroke of delicate feeling as in the grandest flight of soaring
                    imagination. The world he reflects is the world we actually know; but he is not,
                    therefore, in any narrow sense, a realist. The facts he images are shaped and
                    coloured by his thought and feeling; he breathes into them a life by which they
                    are made of universal significance. This combination of realism and idealism is
                    one of the chief secrets of his power. His art aims at producing the most
                    general effects, yet it is kept fresh, vivid, and true by incessant contact with
                    the concrete life of men.</p>
                <p>Heine relates that he felt inclined to address Goethe in Greek, so like was the
                    calm dignified old man to an earthly Zeus; and this is probably the image
                    suggested to most minds by his name. But in youth he was full of eager life,
                    restless, and passionate, and his early works bear the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n555/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0555-0538"/> impress of turbulent feeling. Of these the first
                    published was <hi rend="italic">Götz</hi><hi rend="italic">von
                    Berlichiηgeη,</hi> which instantly established his fame as one of the chief
                    writers of the “Sturm und Drang” school. It is almost as formless as their
                    inartistic writings. The language is sometimes excessively rude, and there is no
                    attempt to combine the different scenes into an harmonious picture. Yet it is
                    sharply separated off from the tasteless plays with which it was compared, for
                    everywhere we find traces of immature power. The characters are alive; they act
                    and react upon each other as we should expect men and women to do in a stormy
                    and troubled epoch; and by a few touches of apparently unconscious art we are
                    made to realize the vital change through which the society of the age of the
                    Reformation was passing. <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Leiden des
                    jungen Werthers</hi> (“The Sufferings of Young Werther”) gave Goethe a European
                    reputation. Much of its sentimentalism now excites smiles instead of tears; but
                    with all its faults it has an enduring fascination. It breathes a warm love of
                    nature, of which it presents vivid pictures; it conveys a powerful impression of
                    the mingled force, sweetness, and unreasonableness of early passion; and it
                    expresses with deep pathos that weariness of life which forms one of the moods
                    of poetic youth, and the manifestation of which was a favourite pastime of the
                    less sincere “Sturm und Drang” versifiers. The promise of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glitz</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> was not sustained by all the
                    works produced in the first part of his career. <hi rend="italic">Clavigo</hi>
                    is only a fairly good acting play; and <hi rend="italic">Stella</hi> has even
                    more than the extravagant sentimentalism of <hi rend="italic">Werther.</hi> with
                    only an occasional touch of its poetry. On the other hand, it was now that
                    Goethe began <hi rend="italic">Faust;</hi> and the fragment, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prometheus,</hi> expresses a grand defiance that is the more impressive because
                    of the deep philosophic thought which may be .traced in the background. It was,
                    however, in his lyrics that the richly varied life of Goethe’s youth most
                    perfectly revealed itself. There are no German lyrics, if we except Heine’s,
                    which deserve to be compared with Goethe’s; perhaps none in any literature have
                    a more subtle charm. Profiting by the teaching of Herder, he studied the artless
                    beauty of the best songs of the people, to some of which he gave new form, while
                    retaining their primitive simplicity. His own lyrics are at once popular and
                    artistic; he takes as his themes the joys, the longings, the regrets which all
                    men understand, and weds them to melodies of delightful ease and grace. Almost
                    every poem was suggested by some passing emotion of his own; yet his feeling is
                    so purified that his words become the voice rather of humanity than of an
                    individual man. His ballads are not, as a rule, so powerful as his songe, but
                    both have one quality in common—without elaborate descriptions they continually
                    call up by an apparently accidental word or phrase a clear vision of some
                    natural object or scene. He is equally master of himself in rendering nature as
                    a mirror in which we see the reflection of our own experience, or as a power
                    moving on in calm indifference to our hopes and fears.</p>
                <p>In 1775 Goethe settled in Weimar, where Wieland already was, and whither he was
                    ultimately followed by Herder and Schiller, so that the little town became the
                    centre of the intellectual life of Germany. After an interval of ten years,
                    during which he published nothing, he paid his famous visit to Italy. Here his
                    genius was kindled anew, and a close study of sculpture and painting suggested
                    to him the necessity of submitting more fully than he had yet done to the
                    permanent laws of art. The fruits of this experience were <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iphigenia, Tasso,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Egmont,</hi> all of which he took
                    with him to Italy in an unfinished form. The first two of these dramas were
                    accepted as imitations of the antique; but they are so only in the sense that in
                    each the parts are rigidly subordinated to the intention of the whole, that
                    there is an orderly sequence in the development of the action, and that they are
                    marked by elevation and simplicity of style. While incomparably more finished as
                    works of art than any of the greater works he had before produced, they
                    indicated no falling off in energy of imagination. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iphigenia,</hi> although its subject is Greek, is in tone and motive altogether
                    Christian; and it would be difficult to name a more attractive picture of a
                    modern lady than the pure and high-minded heroine. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tasso</hi> Goethe draws in strong and sure outlines the sorrows of a poetic
                    nature which will not sharply discriminate the real from its own ideal world.
                    This dramatic poem is hardly more remarkable for the truth and vividness of its
                    conceptions than for the charm of its versification and the wealth and beauty of
                    its language. <hi rend="italic">Egmont,</hi> however, has more movement, and
                    touches human experience at deeper points. Most readers agree with Schiller’s
                    criticism, that there is too much melodrama in the closing scene, in which
                    Clärchen appears to the hero as the spirit of freedom, and that, notwithstanding
                    the liberties taken with history, Goethe has hardly succeeded in making Egmont
                    the type of an enemy of despotism. But Clärchen is a beautiful study of a mind
                    stirred by love to great resolves; and there is splendid portraiture in the
                    characters of Alva, William of Orange, and the Princess of Parma.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, a new literary force had revealed itself in the life of Germany:
                    Schiller (1759-1805), Goethe’s great rival, had begun to divide with him the
                    public attention and interest. The names of these two poets, in virtue of whose
                    labours their period deserves to be called classical, are indissolubly
                    connected, yet they were marked off from each other by profound distinctions.
                    Goethe is often called the poet of culture, and it is true that he never ceased
                    to subject his powers to systematic discipline. He was also one of the keenest
                    critics of modern times. But the charm of his best writings is not dependent on
                    criticism or culture; it springs from the spontaneous movement of a great
                    imaginative faculty. Schiller, on the other hand, while also endowed with
                    imagination, possessed it in a much less degree. His poetry would probably have
                    lived even if he had not had the advantage of a thorough grasp of aesthetic
                    laws; but it would certainly have had no claim to the distinguished place it now
                    holds in European literature. He did not attempt so wide a range as Goethe, and
                    within his scope he was not, like Goethe, a disinterested observer; he flung
                    himself into the midst of the struggles of his time, and fought valiantly as the
                    champion of a side. Fortunately for Germany, his side was always that of a truly
                    chivalrous mind; for Schiller was one of the most unselfish of men, with lofty
                    aspirations for the race, and a generous confidence in its essential goodness.
                    These qualities determined the character of his conceptions. Goethe presents us
                    with idealized pictures of the world; Schiller’s creations are not so much
                    pictures of the world as the figures of a realm distinct from actual life. His
                    supreme aim was to express great sentiments and ideas, and as the medium for
                    their utterance he conceived characters which are to be found only in a poet’s
                    dreams.</p>
                <p>Schiller began his literary career as a youth of two-and-twenty, inspired by
                    revolutionary ardour, detesting every conventionality of society, dreaming of a
                    world in which will and passion should have absolute licence. He relieved
                    himself of his vehement emotions in his first three plays, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Bäuber</hi><hi rend="italic">(“</hi> The Robbers ”),
                    <hi rend="italic">Fiesco,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cabale</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">und Liebe</hi> (“Intrigue and Love”). Genius never beat with more
                    Titanic energy against an unsympathetic world than in these dramas; the impulse
                    of the “Sturm und Drang” period, as it was about to die away, spoke in them its
                    wildest, most passionate word. <hi rend="italic">Don Carlos,</hi> his next
                    drama, still manifested inability to form an organic whole; it contains scenes

                    deeds by natural and intelligible motives. But we are no longer in the presence
                    of one who merely raises an outcry against the existing world; furious
                    resistance to despotism has become enlightened enthusiasm for freedom, humanity,
                    and progress. Although the part of Marquis Posa is imperfectly worked into the
                    scheme of the play, he is a nobly ideal creation; through him Schiller pours
                    forth his own aspirations for the welfare of mankind. There is admirable art in
                    the momentary elevation caused by his greatness of soul even in the dark and
                    selfish Philip and the restless and wayward Don Carlos.</p>
                <p>After he settled in Jena in 1789 as professor of history, Schiller was often in
                    Weimar; but for a time he and Goethe held apart. By and by they began to
                    approach each other, and from about 1794 their acquaintance ripened into fast
                    friendship. The friendship of Goethe and Schiller is one of the most beautiful
                    in the history of literature. It made no essential change in Goethe’s modes of
                    thought or expression, but it spurred him to the highest activity of which his
                    genius was capable. His friend, he himself declared, “created for him a second
                    youth, and again made him a poet, which he had almost ceased to be.” On the
                    other hand, in contact with Goethe’s larger intellectual life, Schiller was
                    raised to new points of view, and he acquired for the first time that mastery of
                    artistic methods which secured for him his highest triumphs. He now became as
                    remarkable for the perfection of his form as for the depth and warmth of his
                    feeling.</p>
                <p>The two friends worked harmoniously in connexion with Schiller’s journal <hi
                    rend="italic">Die Horen,</hi> and wrote in common the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Xenien,</hi> a number of epigrammatic verses meant to wound their literary
                    enemies. On the whole, it is surprising that comparatively so few of the arrows
                    in this rather large quiver are delicately pointed and feathered. A very
                    different stage of excellence is reached by Schiller’s well-known ballads, which
                    were written during the period of his intimacy with Goethe. Nearly all of them
                    are marked by force of conception and by purity and dignity of style. In lyrical
                    poetry he had acquired some distinction before he knew Goethe, but it was in
                    competition with his friend that he achieved his masterpiece, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Das</hi><hi rend="italic">Lied</hi><hi rend="italic">von der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cloche</hi> (“The Song of the Bell”), in which within a small
                    compass he presents an impressive picture of the course of human life, varying
                    his melody with subtle art to suit the changing aspects of his theme. Less
                    artistically perfect than the <hi rend="italic">Cloche,</hi> other lyrics, such
                    as <hi rend="italic">Der Genius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ideale, Der Spaziergang,</hi> have the power which belongs to deeper personal
                    emotion. In ease and spontaneity none of Schiller’s lyrics equal Goethe’s, in
                    which, as Heine says, “the word embraces you while the thought kisses you.” But
                    they express in clear and noble language some of the highest feelings excited in
                    a poetic mind by contemplation of human life and destiny,</p>
                <p>In his dramatic writings Schiller was influenced by Goethe even more than in his
                    lyrics and ballads. The whole series of tragedies which he now wrote have
                    historic or legendary themes, and he displays remarkable skill in unfolding
                    through the past his greatest ideas respecting the future. At the same time he
                    evokes from it a company of finely ideal figures, whose qualities are revealed
                    by the systematic development of large and carefully conceived schemes. <hi
                    rend="italic">Wallenstein,</hi> the earliest of the series, consists of two
                    plays, <hi rend="italic">The Piccolomini</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wallenstein’s Death,</hi> the former of which is preceded by a number of scenes
                    presenting a vivid picture of Wallenstein’s camp. The tragic motive of this
                    great work is somewhat obscure. We are made conscious by many artful touches of
                    the ultimate issue; but Schiller does not render fully intelligible the play of
                    the influences which result in disaster. There is, however, high imaginative
                    faculty in his conception of Wallenstein’s powerful, dark, and wavering
                    character; and every reader feels the charm of the love passages between Max
                    Piccolomini and Thekla. In <hi rend="italic">Maria Stuart</hi> Schiller triumphs
                    over an obvious difficulty by admitting the heroine’s guilt, while he stirs our
                    pity for her sufferings and our admiration for the spirit of endurance with
                    which they are met. In the <hi rend="italic">Jungfrau von Orleans,</hi> “The
                    Maid” would have given purer pleasure if she had not been represented as loving
                    one of the English commanders; but this only slightly mars the splendid picture
                    of her patriotic devotion. As a •work of art, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traut</hi><hi rend="italic">von Messina</hi> is the least successful of the
                    later dramas, for it attempts to combine romantic and classic elements which are
                    irreconcilable; it contains, however, some of the most brilliantly rhetorical
                    passages in the German language. The last of his completed works, and in some
                    respects the best, was <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Tell.</hi> Here his love of
                    freedom shaped for itself forms of immortal beauty. At a time when the French
                    emperor threatened the independence of all Europe, men felt the power of the
                    play more keenly than can be done in a calmer period; but it has permanently
                    enriched the life of humanity by its conception of a character dominated by
                    high, ideal passions. Schiller never saw Switzerland, yet in this powerful drama
                    he renders with astonishing vividness the grander effects of Alpine scenery.</p>
                <p>During his friendship with Schiller Goethe wrote in competition with him many
                    lyrics and ballads. In works of the latter class, as Goethe himself thought, he
                    was surpassed by his friend. He is incomparably more subtle and suggestive than
                    Schiller; but for this very reason he is less effective. A ballad does not
                    deserve its name if it is not popular; and we hear the voice of the people
                    themselves in Schiller’s free, bold, and simply harmonious verses. One of the
                    longer works published by Goethe during this period was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermann</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Dorothea.</hi> His
                    delicately chosen language and dignified hexameters are not always in keeping
                    with the somewhat prosaic life they are here used to portray; but the poem is
                    the nearest approach that has been made to the successful epic treatment of an
                    ordinary theme. And it rises to a high level of imaginative power in the
                    contrast it suggests between the still life of the humble village, with its
                    little idyll of satisfied love, and the far-off desolation of the revolutionary
                    wars, of which we are reminded by the band of emigrants. The genius of Goethe
                    moves more freely in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister,</hi> of which the first
                    part was now published. This work has perhaps given rise to more contradictory
                    criticism than any other book in modern literature. We may safely disregard the
                    opinion of those who find in it all the excellences that can be combined in a
                    prose romance, for it is without plan, and its style is singularly unequal. When
                    Goethe himself admitted that he did not possess the key to its full
                    significance, his warmest admirers may allow that perhaps there is no key to
                    possess. Yet few of his writings present more striking evidence of the fertility
                    of his power. He interests us equally— to recall only a few of the characters—in
                    the gay and worldly Phillina, in the romantic Mariana, and in that most
                    mysterious, lovely, and fascinating of creations, Mignon, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Kennst</hi><hi rend="italic">du das Land</hi> is perhaps the
                    noblest of those pathetic poems in which a soul in an uncongenial world calls up
                    a momentary vision of its true home. It is not only in its dramatic conceptions
                    that <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> is great; it contains some of
                    Goethe’s deepest thoughts on life and literature.</p>
                <p>After the death of Schiller Goethe turned his attention more and more to science,
                    his achievements in which have been fully appreciated only since the growth of
                    the doctrine of evolution. Still, it was in hi⅛ latest period that he completed
                    the most famous and the greatest of his works, <hi rend="italic">Faust,</hi> a
                    poem which he began in youth and did not finish <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n557/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0557-0540"/> until nearly his last birthday. The Faust of
                    legend was a vulgar magician; Goethe so conceives the character that it
                    indicates the deepest mysteries of human existence. The second part, in which
                    the problem of the poem is solved, can hardly be regarded as a work of art; it
                    is, or seems to be, confused and dark. And the individual elements of the first
                    part are not completely welded; they form rather a series of poems than a single
                    creation. In these individual elements, however, we find the grandest sweep of
                    imaginative thought yet achieved by the German genius. The episode of Gretchen
                    reflects with perfect art the most alluring and the most sorrowful facts of
                    life; and philosophy and religion in their highest aspects meet in Faust’s
                    aspirations and struggles.</p>
                <p>It might have been supposed that at the age of seventy Goethe had no new
                    imaginative worlds to conquer; yet he then published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Westöstlicher</hi><hi rend="italic">Divan,</hi> representing, with dramatic
                    sympathy and lyric force almost unabated, the combined mysticism and
                    sensuousness of Oriental life. Ten years before, he had issued <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wahlverwandtschaften</hi> (“Elective Affinities”), a powerful picture of
                    impulses which law cannot control, and in which are concealed the germs of
                    tragic issues. It has, however, less charm than another prose work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Dicldung</hi><hi rend="italic">und Wahrheit</hi> (“Poetry and
                    Truth”), in which he draws a slightly idealized sketch of his early life. This
                    fascinating book has made the figure of young Goethe as familiar as his chief
                    dramatic characters; and no creations of the fancy are better known than the
                    Frederikas and the Lilis, who had long before occasioned his sweetest lyrics,
                    and the memory of whom in old age gave delicacy and music to his style. ·</p>
                <p>While Goethe and Schiller were in thé midst of their career, Europe was startled
                    by the French Revolution. At first it stirred as much interest in Germany as in
                    England. The aged Klopstock greeted it with odes full of the fiery energy of
                    youth, and for a time Schiller almost fancied that his loftiest hopes were about
                    to be realized. Sympathy, however, was transformed into bitter opposition by the
                    Reign of Terror; and when Germany was trodden under foot by Napoleon, she turned
                    more and more from every kind of French influence. Thus it happened that,
                    although the ideas of the Revolution have indirectly affected the literature of
                    Germany as deeply as that of the. rest of Europe, their immediate effect was
                    slight and transitory.</p>
                <p>An event of the highest importance in the intellectual growth of Germany was the
                    publication, in 1781, of Kant’s <hi rend="italic">Kritik der Reinen
                    Vernunft.</hi> It is hard for men of a later time, accustomed to metaphysical
                    speculation, to realize the impression produced by this great book. Its effect
                    in philosophy was not unlike that caused in our own day in science by Mr
                    Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species.</hi> Everywhere among thoughtful
                    men, at the universities especially, philosophy became the absorbing subject of
                    study; and it was taken up at a point from which its whole past development was
                    for the first time intelligible. Goethe, without neglecting the movement, was
                    perhaps less stirred by it than any other prominent writer; Schiller became one
                    of Kant’s most enthusiastic students, and traces of the new system are to be
                    found in many of his later lyrics and dramas. He also applied its principles to
                    aestlietics in several admirable critical writings. By and by, dissatisfied with
                    the gulf left by Kant between mind and matter as “things in themselves,”
                    philosophers started in search of some principle which should harmonize all the
                    elements of existence; and thus grew up, one after the other, the systems of
                    Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. For more than a generation these thinkers excited
                    deeper interest than imaginative writers; the most serious minds were fascinated
                    by speculations which placed in new lights all the greatest questions relating
                    to human thought and action.</p>
                <p>Of the poets or versifiers who began their career with Goethe, the one who for
                    some time attracted most notice was Klinger (1753-1831), whose play, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sturm</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Drang,</hi>
                    is at least memorable through its title. Other plays of his were <hi
                    rend="italic">Conradin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Medea·,</hi> and he also wrote
                    romances, of which the best known were <hi rend="italic">Paust</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Leben,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thaten,</hi><hi rend="italic">und Höllenfahrt</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Der Weltmann und der Dichter.</hi> His writings are
                    violent and noisy, without a touch of true art; what he mistook for imagination
                    was a power of crude and unmeasured declamation. His later works express the
                    bitterness of a deeply disappointed man. Lenz (1750-92), whose name is usually
                    connected with that of Klinger, did not make even so distant an approach to
                    imagination as his rival; his plays are the wild outgrowths of a mind which has
                    made no sincere observation of life, and has submitted neither to intellectual
                    nor to moral discipline. A man of much greater talent than either was Daniel
                    Schubart (1739-91), the restless, licentious, and unfortunate poet who, for
                    publishing a piece of false news, was confined for ten years in a fortress,
                    where he suffered incredible hardships. In his attempts to portray the horrible
                    he is sometimes extremely grotesque, but his best verses have both music and
                    pathos, and they had the good fortune to exercise some influence on Schiller. He
                    was one of the earliest publicists of Germany, and his hatred of despotism was
                    the real cause of the infamous act which deprived him of freedom. Writers who
                    shared the spirit of “Sturm und Drang,” and applied it in new directions, were
                    Lavater and Basedow. Lavater enjoyed the friendship of nearly every
                    distinguished man of his day, yet he was vain and fanatical. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiognomische</hi><hi rend="italic">Fragmente</hi> (“Fragments
                    on Physiognomy ”) were supposed by thousands of readers to find in the relations
                    of mind and body the materials of a new and mysterious science; but the
                    pretended science was in reality a mixture of commonplace and extravagance.
                    Basedow, although with too passionate a faith in the power of education to
                    effect an immediate transformation of the race, did excellent service by
                    advocating, after Rousseau, a more humane and natural system of mental training
                    than had before prevailed. The same cause was more temperately promoted by
                    Campe, who wrote some admirable books for the young; and the Swiss educational
                    reformer, Pestalozzi, set forth methods of instruction in earnest didactic works
                    which had some effect in nearly every country in Europe.</p>
                <p>The excitement of the “Sturm und Drang” writers was shared by a band of young
                    poets who in other respects displayed a wholly different temper. Most of them
                    were students at Göttingen, where they gathered round Boie, editor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Musenalmanach,</hi> a journal he had started in imitation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Mercure de France,</hi> and to which
                    Goethe and many of the best of the younger men of the day contributed. They
                    called themselves the “Hainbund” (“Grove Confederation ”), because of their
                    dancing one night by moonlight round an oak tree, swearing eternal friendship,
                    and vowing to devote themselves to their native land. The god of their idolatry
                    was Klopstock, whose somewhat fantastic enthusiasm for primitive Germany they
                    fully shared, and whose labours on behalf of virtue they never ceased to
                    celebrate, while they loathed and despised Wieland. Several members of the
                    “Hainbund” afterwards acquired distinction, and all of them were more or less
                    remarkable for the genuinely popular tone of their writings. By far the greatest
                    of them was Bürger (1748-94), who, although he never did full justice to
                    himself, gave evidence of an original and adventurous geniu3. His <hi

                    work, is full of weird power, and his sonnets are among the most perfect in
                    German literature. His faculty of meeting the popular taste was possessed by
                    Holty (1748-76), who, however, delighted <pb break="no"

                    Bürger’s poems are full of stir and action. Johann Martin Miller (1750-1814)
                    became known chiefly as the author of the romance <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siegwart,</hi> a rather weak imitation of <hi rend="italic">Werther.</hi> Some
                    irreverent spirits ventured to laugh at its tedious pathos, but it was welcomed
                    by the majority of the middle class, who took especial delight in the songs it
                    includes. Christian, Count Stolberg, and his brother, Frederick Leopold, were
                    also members of the Göttingen school. Besides imitations of Greek plays, they
                    issued odes, ballads, and songs. Of the two the most powerful was Frederick
                    Leopold (1750-1819), in some of whose briefer pieces there is true feeling for
                    nature. He continually verges, however, on extravagance, and often takes the
                    fatal step from the sublime. A stronger writer was Johann Heinrich Voss
                    (1751-1826), author of a famous idyll, <hi rend="italic">Louise,</hi> which was
                    received by Schiller as a poem of first-rate importance, and suggested to Goethe
                    the idea of his <hi rend="italic">Hermann</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dorothea.</hi> Its homeliness of style is perhaps more in keeping
                    with its simple and commonplace theme than the classic grace of Goethe’s verses.
                    Voss acquired a better title to fame by an admirable translation of Homer, which
                    did for the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> in Germany what Pope’s translation did
                    in England. Voss’s rendering is less polished than Pope’s, but incomparably more
                    faithful. Matthias Claudius (1740-1815), although not a member of the
                    “Hainbund,” is usually associated with it because of his general sympathy with
                    its tone. The <hi rend="italic">Waηdsl)ecker Bote</hi> (“Wandsbeck Messenger ”),
                    in which he brought together all his writings, contains much simple poetic
                    feeling, and some of his songs are still popular favourites.</p>
                <p>While these writers attached themselves to Klopstock, others showed traces of
                    Wieland’s influence. The most important of this class was Wilhelm Hei∏3e
                    (1749-1803), whose chief work was <hi rend="italic">Ardinghello,</hi> a prose
                    romance. He shares Wieland’s general theory of life, but, instead of expressing
                    it in the calm, ironical style of his master, he is vehement, tumultuous, and
                    enthusiastic. Amid his wild exaggerations he sometimes displays a remarkable
                    power of describing physical beauty. He was an ardent student of art, and was
                    the first German writer who succeeded in reproducing in glowing language the
                    impression produced upon him by pictures and music. Other imitators of Wieland
                    were Aloys Blumauer, who mistook vulgar burlesque for satire; Alxinger, whose
                    <hi rend="italic">Doolin von Mainz</hi> may be taken to represent a large class
                    of tiresome poems of chivalry; and Von Thümmel, who, with considerably more
                    ability than these writers, spoiled his good qualities by cynical grossness. An
                    indefinite number of mediaeval plays were written in imitation of Goethe’s <hi
                    rend="italic">C'otz,</hi> and robber romances in imitation of Schiller’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Räuber.</hi> Of the latter the earliest and most famous was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo Rinaldini</hi> of Vulpius. Jung Stilling (1740-1817)
                    continued the sentimental tone of <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> in a number of
                    curious autobiographic tales, which acquired extraordinary popularity, and threw
                    much light on the inner tendencies of the later pietists. Among imitators of
                    Schiller’s lyrical poetry the best were Matthison and Salis-Seewis; but they
                    were more successful in reproducing his moral feeling than in rivalling his high
                    art. For many years the stage was in the possession of Iffland (1759-1814) and
                    Kotzebue (1761-1819). The former, who was a distinguished actor, wrote dramas
                    chiefly of domestic interest. They are without genius, but had the merit of
                    almost displacing the foolish mediaeval plays of Goethe’s imitators. Kotzebue
                    was a most prolific writer; and although he had no imagination, and wrote merely
                    to catch the applause of the moment, his comedies still deserve to be named
                    among the few works of this class which have hitherto been produced in
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>A writer who exercised some influence over the youth of Goethe was Frederick
                    Jacobi (1743-1B19). He was the author of two romances, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alwill</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Woldemar,</hi> in both of which there is a
                    little of Werther’s sentimentalism, although their main purpose is didactic. He
                    also wrote a number of philosophical works. His main principle is that the
                    sources of religion and morality are to be found in intuition; and by a constant
                    reiteration of this doctrine he worked in opposition to Spinoza, to Kant, and to
                    Schelling. There are occasional gleams of philosophical genius in Jacobi, and he
                    is of some interest to English readers because of the attention Sir William
                    Hamilton appears to have devoted to his writings. An author of a very different
                    type, and of far greater eminence, was Jean Paul Richter, usually called Jean
                    Paul (1763-1825). It is difficult to do justice to Jean Paul, for he commits
                    almost every fault of which a writer of romance can be guilty; he is at
                    different times pedantic, extravagant, sentimental, and tedious. He prescribed
                    for himself no limits; everything that occurred to him at the moment of his
                    writing went down exactly as it suggested itself. Yet it is impossible even to
                    look into any of his innumerable books without recognizing his genius. The work
                    which has maintained the strongest hold over the nation is perhaps his charming
                    prose idyll, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Flegeljahre</hi> (“The
                    Years of Wild Oats”); but his great romance, <hi rend="italic">Titan,</hi> and
                    the less ambitious <hi rend="italic">Siebenkäs,</hi> or “Flower, Fruit, and
                    Thorn Pieces,” have also kept their place as works of permanent excellence. The
                    most admirable quality of Richter is his humour. No German writer plays with his
                    subject more delightfully, and he produces his most striking effects in dealing
                    with the simplest, most unpretending relations of life. He is usually very near
                    the sources of pathos when he smiles, and Jean Paul’s pathos, at its best, is
                    full of power, awakening the deepest feeling by its obvious sincerity. Sometimes
                    it is associated with lofty imagination, as in the famous dream in which he
                    describes a universe without religion. His feeling for the periodic changes of
                    season in nature is that of a poet in the highest sense, his descriptions of
                    spring being perhaps unsurpassed for their glowing yet tender beauty. To his
                    other excellences we must add the manly spirit which led him to scoff,
                    occasionally without due measure, at every kind of vulgarity and pretence, and
                    at the same time preserved in its original freshness bis sympathy with his
                    fellow-men and his passion for their enlightenment and progress.</p>
                <p>The most important literary movement which originated duringthe lifetime of
                    Goethe was that of the Romantic school, whose leading members at first attached
                    themselves to him, but gradually diverged more and more from his spirit. The
                    rise of the school was in some measure due to the philosophy of Fichte, whose
                    theory of the ego as the principle which freely creates its own world gave new
                    importance to the individual as opposed to law and convention. ’ Schelling still
                    more effectually prepared the way for the Romanticists by his poetic treatment
                    of the relations between the mind and nature; and several of his disciples,
                    especially Steffens, worked in the same direction by dwelling on the
                    possibilities of mystery in human life and in the external world. The aim of the
                    Romantic school was to assert for modern feeling the right of a freer, more
                    varied utterance than can be provided for it by the forms of classic literature.
                    They were not in sympathy with their own time; they found it tame, prosaic,
                    colourless; and to enrich it with new elements they went back to mediaevalism,
                    in which, as they conceived it, daily life had not been divorced from poetry.
                    They drew enthusiastic pictures of the Middle Ages, of the charms of chivalry,
                    of the loyalty of each class to the class above it and to society as a whole,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n559/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0559-0542"/> of the devout piety which was supposed to
                    regulate the conduct of prince and peasant alike, and which revealed itself in
                    splendid architecture aud a gorgeous ritual. With a like purpose the
                    Romanticists pointed to Oriental life, and began the serious study of Sanskrit
                    and Persian poetry. The chief writers whom they opposed to the classical poets
                    both of antiquity and of modern times were Shakespeare and Calderon; but they
                    also brought to light many mediaeval authors who had previously been neglected,
                    and. stimulated the Germans to a systematic study of the whole of their past
                    literature.</p>
                <p>The Romanticists did not strike out a wholly original path, for there were in the
                    writings of Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller—especially of Goethe—elements in full
                    harmony with all that was best in the new tendency. They were guilty of
                    grotesque exaggeration in their descriptions of the superior happiness of
                    mediaeval nations and Oriental peoples, aud they did much harm by checking the
                    rising appreciation of measure and order iu literary form which had been
                    encouraged by the great classical writers, In practical life, too, their labours
                    led to results opposed to the progressive tendencies of the age; for in the case
                    of many adherents of the Romantic school, enthusiasm for the Middle Ages soon
                    ceased to be a mere literary fancy,—they strove to reproduce obsolete mediaeval
                    ideas. Large numbers of them joined the Catholic Church, and became the most
                    vehement opponents of spiritual and political freedom. Still the Romanticists
                    gave prominence to certain vital principles. That we now feel the charm of what
                    was great and beautiful in the Middle Ages, is in part the result of their
                    teaching; and to some extent we owe to them the recognition of deeper elements
                    in the world than reason can formulate, and the conviction that the thought of
                    each age must create for itself a medium of expression adapted to its special
                    nature.</p>
                <p>The writer known as the prophet of the Romantic school was Frederick von
                    Hardenberg, generally called Novalis (1772-1801). In his unfinished romance, <hi
                    rend="italic">Heinrich von Ofterdingen,</hi> he revealed a mystical and
                    sensitive spirit, penetrated by religious aspiration, and feeling itself ill at
                    ease in the hard rough world. These qualities are still more pathetically
                    expressed in his poems, the best perhaps being those in which he directly utters
                    spiritual emotions. The critical leaders of the school were the brothers August
                    Wilhelm von Schlegel (1767-1845) and Friedrich von Schlegel (1772-1829). It is
                    to be feared that many English readers have derived their impression of the
                    former mainly from Heine’s malicious caricature. In reality, although destitute
                    of creative power, he was a man of great intellectual distinction. His
                    translations from Shakespeare are masterly, and his rendering of Calderon has
                    also genuine merit. He did much to promote the scientific study of Sanskrit, and
                    his lectures on dramatic art and literature, and on the theory and history of
                    plastic art, contain many fruitful suggestions. Friedrich von Schlegel, who <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> was a writer of greater depth and versatility than
                    his brother, caused much scandal by his romance, <hi rend="italic">Lucνnde,</hi>
                    in which the school appeared for the moment as a powerfully dissolving force in
                    regard to the most sacred of human relations. His most important work, however,
                    is his <hi rend="italic">History of Ancient and Modern Literature.</hi>
                    Throughout his exposition he is a propagandist of his special ideas; but the
                    book is of lasting importance as the earliest attempt to present a systematic
                    view of literary development as a whole. The period in which the brothers worked
                    most effectually for their school was between 1796 and 1800, when they lived in
                    Jena, and formed the centre of a brilliant circle which included Fichte,
                    Schelling, Tieck, and Wilhelm von Humboldt. Here they edited the <hi
                    rend="italic">Athenoeum,</hi> in which they chastised feeble and pretentious
                    writers, and awoke general interest in mediaeval art and literature, and in the
                    systems of philosophy that harmonized with their special tendency.</p>
                <p>The most productive, and for a time the most famous, writer of the Romantic
                    school was Ludwig Tieck (1773— 1853). Many of the smaller tales in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Phantasus</hi> have not yet lost their interest. They are, indeed,
                    as far as possible from representing the real life of mediaevalism, but they
                    have a mystic and fairy-like charm which is not the less powerful because it is
                    purely imaginative. In his later novels he took his themes from modern life, and
                    they display a remarkable talent for keen and searching satire. Most of them,
                    however, are already practically forgotten, for Tieck was unable to give form to
                    his ideas, and his imagination was wayward and eccentric. In his lyrical poetry
                    he seldom touches a true note, and his dramas have no high qualities to make up
                    for their utter and deliberate lack of plan. Yet his dramatic criticism, of
                    which he wrote a great deal in Dresden,—where he lived for many years, the
                    centre of an adoring body of disciples,— is often happy and suggestive; and his
                    completion of Schlegel’s translation of Shakespeare is poetic in feeling, and
                    indicates a rare mastery of language aud versification. A writer of less
                    importance, but who exercised considerable influence over Tieck at an early
                    period of his career, was W. H. Wackenroder (1772-98), whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phantasien über</hi><hi rend="italic">die Kunst</hi> (“Fancies concerning Art
                    ”) was published by Tieck after the writer’s early death. Both in this book and
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Overflowings from the Heart of an Art-loving Friar</hi>
                    he expresses a deep feeling for Christian, especially allegoric, art. He was
                    here in full sympathy with the whole Romantic school, which derived intense
                    delight from the spiritual art of the early mediaeval painters, but cared little
                    for the noble beauty of Greek art or of the art of the Renaissance.</p>
                <p>Among the authors who wrote in the spirit of the Romantic school, and who were
                    for a long time extremely popular, one of the chief was E. T. A. Hoffmann (1776-
                    1822). His treatment of ghostly and horrible themes is often very grotesque; but
                    he has flashes of vivid narrative which indicate a deep appreciation of some of
                    the more mysterious aspects of human nature. Clemens Brentano (1777-1842) was
                    one of the most ambitious of the Romanticists, and he had originality both of
                    thought and fancy; but he was too confused, too indifferent to form, to produce
                    more than a passing impression. Of far more enduring excellence than anything he
                    himself wrote was <hi rend="italic">Des Knaben Wunderhorn,</hi> a book of
                    popular lyrics which he collected with his brother-in-law, Achim von Arnim.
                    Arnim (1781-1831) revealed imagination and feeling in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kronenwächter</hi> (“' Guardians of the Crown ”); and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Countess Dolores</hi> gives evidence of great natural power. His works,
                    however, suffer the penalty which attaches to the total neglect of art. De La
                    Motte Fouqué (1777-1843) does not, in the majority of his writings, rise above
                    the level of his fellows; like them, he usually lacks clearness, precision, and
                    genuinely human interest. But in one little book, <hi rend="italic">Undine,</hi>
                    he achieved a masterpiece. This charming tale, with its sweetness, pathos, and
                    dream-like beauty, is now above criticism; it has taken its place as one of the
                    select clas≡ of creations which appeal to all the world, and do not depend for
                    their popularity on the tendencies of a particular time. Joseph von Eichendorff
                    (1788-1857) is an adherent of the Romantic school only in some of his tales; his
                    lyrics combine its depth of emotion with clear and musical expression, and his
                    best stories are written in a frank and attractive style. Adelbert von Chamisso
                    (1781-1838), although usually classed as to some extent a Romanticist, has none
                    of the dreaminess and mysticism of the school. He became a German both in
                    thought and feeling; but his <pb break="no"

                    of his French origin. He is now chiefly remembered by <hi rend="italic">Peter
                    Schlemihl,</hi> a tale of quaint and suggestive humour. The most distinguished
                    dramatist of the Romantic school was Heinrich von Kleist (1776-1811), whose
                    dramas were not represented till after his death, but have since then attracted
                    much attention. Some of his characters are conceived with great vigour, but in
                    his tragic motives he lacks invention, and all his works are more or less marred
                    by morbid sentimentalism. Allied to the Romantic school, although not directly
                    connected with it, were the writers of the so-called fate-tragedies. The
                    originator of this curious class of works was Werner (1768-1823). It would be
                    difficult to imagine a more trivial conception of fate than that which he
                    develops in his <hi rend="italic">Twenty-Fourth of February,</hi> which
                    represents a series of disasters as occurring at intervals on a particular day
                    in consequence of a father’s curse. The notion, however, struck the popular
                    fancy, and for ten years even Kotzebue could not contest the supremacy of the
                    fate-tragedians. The chief followers of Werner were Miillner and Houwald. Franz
                    Grillparzer (1791-1872) began his career with a play— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Ahnfrau</hi><hi rend="italic">(“</hi> The
                    Ancestress”)—in the style of these popular writers, but in his later tragedies
                    he strove to attain classic force and dignity; and by at least one play, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sappho,</hi> he achieved a place among the most distinguished
                    German dramatists.</p>
                <p>The whole life of Germany was to some extent influenced by the Romantic school.
                    In politics it was represented, among others, by Joseph Gorres, who agitated
                    with constantly growing enthusiasm for the revival of mediaevalism both in
                    church and state. In philosophy Franz Xaver von Baader followed a like tendency
                    by entering deeply into the spirit of Jacob Boehme’s mystical philosophy, and
                    interpreting its principles in accordance with Catholic doctrine. Frederick
                    Schleiermacher (1768-1834) was a thorough Protestant, and his services to
                    serious literature were incomparably higher than those of Baader. He was an
                    admirable dialectician, and did more than any other writer to promote in Germany
                    a sympathetic study of Plato. Yet there is a touch of Romanticism in the vague,
                    shadowy, and mystic language in which he presents the elements of Christian
                    thought and life. The love of the Romantic writers for previous epochs of German
                    history and literature led to the great researches of the brothers Grimm, who
                    founded the scientific study of the German language and of German antiquities.
                    They were followed by many devoted scholars, among whom may be named Beneke,
                    Lachmann, Moritz Haupt, and Franz Pfeiffer. The Oriental studies of the
                    Romanticists also promoted comparative philology, which acquired something of
                    the character it now bears through the labours of the illustrious scholars,
                    Wilhelm von Humboldt and Franz Bopp.</p>
                <p>During the calamitous period when Germany was beaten and humbled by Napoleon the
                    Romantic school, by continually recalling the past glories of the nation,
                    contributed largely to the revival of patriotic feeling. A like result was
                    achieved by Fichte, whose addresses to the German people, delivered in Berlin
                    while it was occupied by French soldiers, are models of fervid yet thoughtful
                    and dignified eloquence. In the war of liberation the popular excitement was
                    expressed with great spirit by Theodor Körner (1791-1813) and Ernst Moritz Arndt
                    (1769-1860). Of these two writers Arndt is the most poetic, but few even of his
                    lyrics have much literary value. To judge them fairly we must think ourselves
                    back into the epoch in which the nation spontaneously arose to avenge its wrongs
                    and assert its independence. It was as a writer of patriotic war-songs that
                    Frederick Rückert (1789-1866) opened his career. Afterwards he moved over a wide
                    range, distinguishing himself especially as a translator of Oriental poetry. He
                    was master of almost every form of lyrical expression, and had hardly less
                    facility in narrative and didactic verse. As regards the substance of his
                    poetry, he is perhaps chiefly remarkable for the tone of calm resignation which
                    he learned from his Eastern masters. In his preference for Oriental modes of
                    thought he has been followed in recent times by Daumer, Bodenstedt, and other
                    poets, who, however, chiefly aim at contrasting the ascetic ideals of
                    Christianity with a gayer, brighter scheme of life. The whole movement had its
                    origin, and was virtually exhausted, in Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Westostlicher
                    Divan.</hi></p>
                <p>Had the hopes of German patriots been realized after the war of liberation,
                    literature might have profited by the growth of an intelligent national spirit.
                    But the reward of the German people for their immense sacrifices was bitter
                    opposition on the part of their Governments to every aspiration for freedom and
                    unity. Arndt himself, who had done so much to kindle patriotic ardour, was
                    dismissed in disgrace from his professorship at Bonn, which he did not regain
                    till 1840, when Frederick William IV. mounted the Prussian throne. And the
                    brothers Grimm with other scholars were ignominiously turned out of Gottingen.
                    The mass of the people lost interest in high thought and endeavour, and
                    nourished itself on weak poetry like the <hi rend="italic">Urania</hi> of
                    Tiedge, and detestable novels like those of Clauren. Yet even in poetry the
                    period was not destitute of important names. Ludwig Uhland (1787-1862), whose
                    first volume of poems appeared in 1815, ranks with the greatest of modern
                    lyrical writers. He is truly popular and patriotic in tone, yet his songs and
                    ballads have an ease and grace of style which raise him far above any of the
                    Romantic schotjl. Uhland was the founder of the so-called Swabian school of
                    poets, of whom the most cultivated was Gustav Schwab. Other Swabian poets were
                    Justinus Kerner, who attempted, not unsuccessfully, to combine pathos and
                    humour, and Eduard Mörike, whose poetry is generally of a melancholy tone,
                    relieved, however, by touches which indicate a fine sympathy with nature. The
                    theatre was dominated by Raupach (1784- 1852) and Freiherr von Auffenberg
                    (1798-1857), the former reigning in Berlin, the latter in Carlsruhe. Both had
                    talent and knowledge of the stage, but there is neither genius nor art in their
                    plays. Immermann (1796-1840), although not without poetic power, lacked the
                    faculty of controlling his dramatic conceptions. He was more successful in
                    romance—his <hi rend="italic">Epigonen,</hi> and still more his <hi
                    rend="italic">Münchhausen,</hi> displaying vivid fancy and a quaintly original
                    humour. Sir Walter Scott, who was deeply influenced by German literature, repaid
                    his obligations by influencing it in turn. One of the best of his imitators was
                    Wilhelm Hauff (1802-1827), who had the merit of nearly putting an end to
                    Clauren’s popularity by satirizing his style. Hauff ’ s chief work was <hi
                    rend="italic">Lichtenstein,</hi> which excited hopes that were too soon
                    extinguished by death. Wilhelm Häring, known as Wilibald Alexis (1798-1876),
                    also began as an imitator of Scott, but he afterwards wrote more original
                    historical romances, the scenes of which he laid in Brandenburg. Johanna
                    Schopenhauer, mother of the philosopher, was considered in her day an attractive
                    writer of romance, but she is now remembered only for the sake of her son. She
                    was surpassed in vigour of thought and style by Caroline Pichler (1769-1843),
                    who wrote several well-known historical novels.</p>
                <p>Throughout the whole of this period Germany maintained her eminence in classical
                    study, contributions of the highest importance to the knowledge of ancient life
                    being made by Wolf, Hermann, Boeckh, and Otfried Müller. In history she produced
                    several writers of distinction. Spittier (1752- 1810) was a worthy successor of
                    Justus Möser in the free and artistic treatment of historical subjects; in youth
                    he <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n561/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0561-0544"/> was kindly treated by Lessing, whose clear style
                    he appears to have taken as his model. Johannes von Müller (1752-1809), the
                    historian of Switzerland, used to be considered by the Germans an eloquent
                    writer, almost a prose poet, but he is now generally regarded as an affected
                    rhetorician. Raumer, in his chief work, <hi rend="italic">History of the</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hohenstaufen,</hi> gave forth the results of deep research in an
                    animated and vigorous narrative. Schlosser, author of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Eighteenth Century,</hi> was also an historian who combined
                    purity and strength of style with learning. Niebuhr, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homan History,</hi> pushed his scepticism too far, but he profoundly modified
                    opinion in regard to the tests of historic credibility.</p>
                <p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">The Latest Period.—</hi> With the death of Goethe in 1832
                    began a new era in German literature, an era not yet closed. The period has been
                    one of intense political excitement. In 1848 the national aspiration for freedom
                    and unity found decisive expression in action; since that time Germany has
                    achieved unity by the sword, while she still slowly feels her way towards
                    freedom. It was inevitable that in such an epoch much of the best energy of the
                    nation should be devoted to politics, but there has also been great literary
                    activity—activity deeply influenced by the practical struggles, hopes, and fears
                    of the time.</p>
                <p>Philosophical speculation has been continued without interruption, and in many
                    respects it has been, and still is, the deepest current in the intellectual life
                    of Germany. From 1818 till his death in 1831, when he was a professor in Berlin,
                    Hegel dominated the highest thought. His vast system, in which he attempted to
                    explain the ultimate facts of the world and to bind by a chain of deductive
                    reasoning the elements of all knowledge, found enthusiastic adherents among the
                    more ambitious of the younger literary men, and for many years after his death
                    it determined the character of their work. Gradually, however, the school broke
                    up into three distinct divisions, the right, the centre, and the left. Of these
                    the most active were the members of the latter party, who interpreted Hegel’s
                    doctrine in a revolutionary sense. Arnold Ruge, one of the most brilliant
                    writers of the school, applied Hegelianism to politics, in which he associated
                    himself with the extreme radicals. David Friedrich Strauss, who also started as
                    a follower of Hegel, in his memorable <hi rend="italic">Leben Jesu</hi> resolved
                    the narratives of the Gospels into a series of myths, and found the vital
                    element of Christianity in its spiritual teaching. Feuerbach, going still
                    further, warred against all religion, urging that it should be replaced by a
                    sentiment of humanity. While the different sections of Hegelians opposed each
                    other, Schelling developed the later phases of his system; and thought was
                    turned into a new channel by Herbart, whose psychological work has been carried
                    on at a later time by Lotze. Krause also attracted attention by philosophical
                    ideas through which he aimed at solving the practical difficulties of modern
                    life. Ulrici and the younger Fichte have exercised considerable influence as the
                    advocates of a pantheistic doctrine by which they endeavour to reconcile
                    religion and science. None of these names, however, have the importance which
                    attaches to that of Arthur Schopenhauer, who, although his chief book was
                    written in the lifetime of Goethe, did not secure a hearing until long
                    afterwards. At the present time he stirs deeper interest than any other thinker.
                    German philosophers have, as a rule,been utterly indifferent to style, but
                    Schopenhauer’s prose is clear, firm, and graceful, and to this fact he owes much
                    of his popularity. He expressed bitter contempt for his philosophical
                    contemporaries, and, going back to Kant, claimed to have corrected and completed
                    his system. His main doctrine is that will is the fundamental principle of
                    existence; but his importance arises less from his abstract teaching than from
                    his descriptions of the misery of human life. History seemed to him but a record
                    of turmoil and wretchedness; and there is high literary genius as well as moral
                    earnestness in his graphic and scornful pictures of the darker aspects of the
                    world. Eduard von Hartmann, the latest original philosopher of Germany, works on
                    essentially the same lines, but seeks to reconcile Schopenhauer not only with
                    Hegel and Schelling but with Leibnitz.</p>
                <p>The growth of science has been one of the most powerful factors in the recent
                    intellectual development of Germany, and some of the best books of the period
                    have been works presenting in a popular form the results of scientific labour.
                    Among these the first place still belongs to the <hi rend="italic">Cosmos</hi>
                    of Alexander von Humboldt. Its fundamental conceptions are no longer in full
                    accordance with the best thought; but it is made enduringly impressive by the
                    writer’s power of handling vast masses of facts, by his poetic feeling for the
                    beauty and the order of nature, and by the purity and nobility of his style.
                    Some of the greatest men of science, such as Liebig, Virchow, and Helmholtz,
                    have also made admirable attempts to render their subjects intelligible and
                    interesting to ordinary readers. Büchner and Vogt have considerable merit as
                    popular scientific authors, but their writings are marred by a polemical
                    tendency, which induces them to dogmatize on metaphysical questions beyond their
                    proper range.</p>
                <p>In historical literature Germany has recently produced many eminent writers. The
                    historian who enjoys the widest popularity is Leopold Ranke, who has instructed
                    two generations by communicating in an agreeable style the results of extensive
                    research in many different fields of inquiry. Gervinus acquired a permanent
                    place as an historian by his excellent <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Nineteenth Century.</hi> Works of high value have also proceeded from
                    Giesebrecht, who has written on the Holy Roman Empire with enthusiastic
                    appreciation of the great emperors; from Droysen, the diligent historian of
                    Prussia; from Dahlmann, whose labours included German, English, French, and
                    Danish history; from Häusser, whose masterpiece is an elaborate history of
                    Germany since the death of Frederick the Great; from Waitz, the chief authority
                    on the growth of the German constitution; from Sybel, by whose researches much
                    new light has been thrown on the French Revolution; from Mommsen, the vigorous
                    historian of ancient Rome; and from Curtius, whose history of Greece is not more
                    remarkable for its learning than for the clear and attractive arrangement of its
                    materials. Of late years much attention has been devoted to “Culturgeschichte,”
                    which describes the life of a people in all its phases, either through the whole
                    past or during a particular epoch. A favourable example of works of this class
                    is Karl Biedermann’s <hi rend="italic">Germany in the Eighteenth
                    Century.</hi></p>
                <p>Recent German literature is extraordinarily rich in histories of the individual
                    elements of intellectual development. In its histories of philosophy it is
                    absolutely supreme. Hegel still ranks as one of the greatest historians of
                    philosophy, although the value of his expositions is lowered by a tendency to
                    find his own doctrine in preceding thinkers. Erdmann, Schwegler, and Ueberweg
                    were among the most important workers in the same department; and with them may
                    be named Kuno Fischer, who writes the history of philosophy with a striking
                    power of sympathetic appreciation and in a fascinating literary style. Less
                    attractive in manner than Fischer, Lange, in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Materialism,</hi> did full justice for the first time to the different phases of
                    materialistic philosophy, and is especially happy in the skill with which he
                    traces the growth of a recognition of law in the phenomena of nature. Since
                    Lessing, aesthetics have always formed a prominent branch of philosophy among
                    the Germans; and they have hardly <pb break="no"

                    historians of metaphysics. High distinction has been achieved, among other art
                    historians, by Kugler, Vischer, Carrière, and Lübke. Of historians of
                    literature, especially German literature, there is almost a small army. One of
                    the earliest of these was Gervinus, who, although his critical canons are not
                    now in favour, had an unusual faculty for grouping his materials and sharply
                    defining what seemed to him the essential qualities of particular writers and
                    movements. The history of German literature by Vilmar, although written in an
                    eloquent style, is too partial in its judgments to have permanent value.
                    Koberstein is remarkable rather for industry than for insight; but the literary
                    histories of Julian Schmidt and Gυttschall are both marked by decisive, often
                    penetrating, critical judgment. One of the best works of this kind for style,
                    thought, and research is Hettner’s elaborate <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Literature in the Eighteenth Century.</hi></p>
                <p>The Germans possess a vast mass of biographical literature, a large proportion of
                    which is rendered almost worthless by inartistic treatment. Luther alone forms
                    the subject of more than one hundred and fifty biographies; yet a satisfactory
                    study of the Reformer has still to be written. In recenttimes, however, there
                    has been amarked improvement, several biographers having conscientiously striven
                    not only to be thorough in research but to write simply, clearly, and vividly.
                    The first to set a good example was Varnhagen von Ense, whose numerous
                    biographies are masterpieces of well ordered and dignified prose. Germany owes
                    an admirable biography of Ulrich von Hutten to Strauss, who also wrote
                    interesting sketches of several prominent modern authors. Other biographies
                    which deserve mention are Karl Grün’s philosophical study of Feuerbach,
                    Rosenkranz’s scholar-like life of Diderot, and Justi’s life of Winckelmann. The
                    popularity of Mr Lewes’s life of Goethe for a long time deterred German writers
                    from touching a subject he had handled with so much talent; but of late there
                    has been a remarkable revival of interest in Goethe, and Hermann Grimm has
                    ventured to present a fresh study of his intellectual and moral character.</p>
                <p>In imaginative literature the greatest writer of the latest period is Heinrich
                    Heine. No German writer since Goethe and Schiller has excited so much interest
                    throughout Europe, and among the Germans themselves his fame is steadily rising.
                    He professed to care little for what men said of his poetry, yet it is mainly as
                    a lyrical poet that his name lives. His <hi rend="italic">Buch der Lieder</hi>
                    is one of the most fascinating collections of lyrics in European literature.
                    Although a deadly enemy of the Romantic school, he had moods, especially in
                    youth, in which he shared its dreaminess and mysticism; and these qualities he
                    expressed in some of his best songs, but with perfect grace of style and melody.
                    He struck with equally finished art chords of passion and aspiration beyond the
                    range of even the chief Romanticists, for Heine was in every respect a modern
                    man, penetrated by a love of freedom, and by a high enthusiasm for beauty.
                    Except Goethe, no other German poet achieves his effects by such simple means;
                    with the language of a village maiden he gives shape to feelings and ideas of
                    exquisite refinement and subtlety. His satirical poems are sometimes gross and
                    cynical; but none of them are without touches of humour. In his pro≡e, which
                    deals with a wide range of subjects, he is rather French than German in his love
                    of sparkling epigram and biting wit Almost every theme, however sacred, gives
                    Heine occasion for mockery, but in the midst of cruel laughter he is often
                    restrained by a pathetic memory, which he expresses with unsurpassed delicacy.
                    This combination of pathos, wit, and humour giveshim a unique place in the
                    literature of his country.</p>
                <p>Platen, who belongs rather to the previous period, was one of the many writers
                    whom Heine bitterly attacked, but he was a poet of considerable power. Like
                    Heine himself, he failed in the drama; and even in his successful writings he is
                    not remarkable for wealth of thought or depth of feeling. His odes and sonnets,
                    however, are in language and metre so artistically finished as to rank among the
                    best classical poems of modern times. Börne was another writer whose fame,
                    although the two men were at one time warm friends, suffered from Heine’s
                    satire. He was a manly literary critic, and as a political writer dealt at the
                    despotic Governments of Germany blows which they keenly felt.</p>
                <p>A school of writers known as Young Germany was deeply influenced by Heine, and
                    had the good fortune to be singled out for persecution by the confederate diet.
                    Their object was to effect a complete revolution in the political and social
                    institutions of Germany, and at the same time they became the propagandists of
                    ideas intended to undermine the church. The most important member of the school
                    was Karl Gutzkow, who wrote a number of dramas which maintain their hold of the
                    stage. He was also the author of many romances, of which the chief were <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Ritter vom Geiste</hi> (“The Knights of
                    the Mind”) and <hi rend="italic">Der Zauberer</hi><hi rend="italic">von
                    Roni</hi> (“The Magician of Rome”). These works are of enormous length, and
                    their polemical tendency has already begun to weaken their interest. But the
                    leading characters are genuine creations, and the incidents are interwoven with
                    great artistic skill. Heinrich Laube, another member of the group, is the author
                    of an historical romance, <hi rend="italic">The German War,</hi> which
                    represents, in a clear, fresh, and vivid style, the condition of Germany during
                    the Thirty Years’ War. He has also enriched the stage with several excellent
                    plays. Less important authors associated with these writers were Gustav Kühne,
                    Theodor Mundt, and Ludolf Wienbarg—the latter universally recognized as a keen
                    and vigorous critic.</p>
                <p>The novel has acquired the same important place in Germany as in France and
                    England, and it need scarcely be said that the vast majority of works of this
                    class are forgotten almost as soon as they are issued. One of the most
                    distinguished of recent novelists is Gustav Frey tag, whose chief work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Soll und Haben</hi> (“Debit and Credit”), is a study of commercial
                    life intensely realistic in tendency. Lately he has undertaken a series of
                    romances, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Ahnen</hi> (“The
                    Forefathers”), intended to represent in a highly poetic form the different
                    epochs of German history. Important historical romances have been written by
                    Levin Schücking, who is remarkable for his power of vividly conceiving
                    character. The Countess Ida Hahn-Hahn is the writer of a number of novels in an
                    artificial style, affecting to represent good society. Her manner has been
                    cleverly satirized by Fanny Lewaid, who is one of the best German novelists,
                    keen and true in observation of life, and artistic in method. Paul Heyse’s short
                    tales have firmness of outline, and are at the same time full of delicate grace;
                    as a writer of elaborate romance, he has also achieved success. The humour of
                    Hackländer is generally considered to surpass that of any other recent writer;
                    and among the novelists of simple village life Auerbach easily takes the first
                    place. Frederick Spielhagen has penetrated deeply into the spirit of the age,
                    and in <hi rend="italic">Problematische</hi><hi rend="italic">Haturen</hi>
                    (“Problematic Natures”) and other works reveals its tendencies with cultivated
                    imaginative force. The novels of Fritz Reuter, although written in Platt
                    Deutsch, take high rank; they are fresh in style, and combine keen observation
                    of life with a fine appreciation of comic effect.</p>
                <p>Contemporary literature has not, as in England, been divorced from the stage; the
                    best imaginative writers find scope for their energies in work for the theatre.
                    Besides Gutzkow and Laube, Gottschall has been a fertile writer <pb break="no"

                    Prutz, are original dramatic authors. The dramas of Christian Grabbe, full of
                    eccentricity, but with a certain wild power, originated a movement resembling to
                    some extent that of the “Sturm und Drang” poets. Its chief representative was
                    Hebbel, a writer endowed with imaginative gifts, but who marred every play by
                    affectation and extravagance. Freiherr von Münch-Bellinghausen, known as
                    Friedrich Halm, author of <hi rend="italic">Der Fechter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >von Pavenna</hi> (“The Gladiator of Ravenna”), and Mosenthal, author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Deborah,</hi> achieved distinction by aiming at something higher
                    than mere stage effect. Paul Lindau is the author of some refined comedies, and
                    Adolf Wilbrandt has written both comedies and tragedies which meet the taste of
                    Vienna. Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer and Roderich Benedix were prolific writers of
                    plays with the sort of merit that belongs to an intimate knowledge of the
                    technical necessities of the stage.</p>
                <p>Many recent writers have attempted lyrical and narrative poetry, some of them
                    with sufficient power to maintain worthily the traditions of German literature.
                    From about 1830 onwards, a group of Austrian poets, more or less political in
                    tendency, commanded the respect of all Germans. The chief was Count von
                    Auersperg, who assumed the name of Anastasius Grün. His first important work was
                    <hi rend="italic">Walks of a Vienna Poet,</hi> published in 1831, but his fame
                    rests chiefly on two volumes of lyrics issued some years later. He had
                    enthusiastic faith in the future, and expresses his hopes in verses full of
                    colour, sometimes brilliant and effective. Another Austrian writer, Nicholas
                    Strehlenau, generally called Lenau, gives powerful utterance in several poems to
                    the sorrows of a deeply melancholy nature. Meissner and Hartmann, Bohemian
                    poets, have a considerable reputation, the latter as a writer of great artistic
                    merit, the former as a poet of vivid imagination and free sympathies. Leopold
                    Schefer was for a long time a popular poet, and the genial optimism of his chief
                    book, the <hi rend="italic">Laienbrevier,</hi> is interesting because of the
                    contrast it presents to the pessimist tone of more recent writers. Before the
                    revolutionary movements of 1848 a number of writers attempted to force poetry
                    into the service of freedom. Of these one of the best known is Herwegh. He
                    advocated liberty with a vehemence that won for him immense popularity, but the
                    interest of his writings is rather historical than literary. Ferdinand
                    Freiligrath was of a more truly poetic temperament. His poems, although without
                    delicacy, have graphic force, and in his earlier writings he displayed a
                    remarkable talent for reproducing the gorgeous colours of tropical landscape.
                    Other poets who have made verse a means of awakening in the popular mind a
                    passion for political justice are Hoffmann von Fallersleben, who has a
                    considerable command of musical expression, and Franz Dingelstedt, a versatile
                    writer who has done good work as a novelist and dramatist. Gottschall, already
                    named as a dramatist and an historian of literature, began as a political poet,
                    but afterwards gave evidence of disinterested imagination in two narrative
                    poems, <hi rend="italic">Göttin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zeno.</hi> The lyrics
                    of Emmanuel Geibel, some of which are also political, with a conservative
                    tendency, have found favour with nearly all classes; they reveal a gentle and
                    refined spirit, and are written with something of Uhland’s grace. Among the most
                    distinguished contemporary writers iβ Robert Hamerling, whose poetry is
                    remarkable for the boldness of its conceptions and its almost vehement
                    passion.</p>
                <p>Since the middle of the 18th century Germany has never been without writers of
                    deep thought and vast research; and in her supreme writers — in Lessing, Goethe,
                    Schiller, and Heine—these qualities have been associated with a feeling for
                    artistic finish which has not been surpassed in England or even in France. But
                    the tendency of German authors beneath the highest rank has been to neglect the
                    laws of expression. Thus there is in Germany an extraordinary quantity of
                    literature which, although the result of great labour, and full of ideas, makes
                    intolerable demands on the patience of readers. The lack of measure and
                    precision has in many cases deprived of nearly all value powers of imagination,
                    reason, and industry, which would have made the literary fortune of a Frenchman.
                    This deficiency of style is in some degree explained by the fact that an undue
                    proportion of German literature has hitherto been addressed, not to the public,
                    but to specialists, who naturally concern themselves more with substance than
                    with form. During the present generation there have been symptoms of a
                    remarkable change. Ever since the Germans began to feel that they are one
                    people, arid to strive after political unity, an increasing number of scholars
                    and thinkers have displayed an ambition to extend their influence, while several
                    imaginative writers have consciously appealed to the nation as a whole. The
                    inevitable result has been that they have aimed at more methodical arrangement
                    than their predecessors, and have cultivated greater force, simplicity, and
                    directness of speech. Nothing has fostered this wholesome tendency so much as
                    the growing respect of the nation for the great masters of its language, a
                    respect indicated by the new editions of their writings which appear year after
                    year. The higher class of poets, dramatists, and novelists have also profited by
                    the deepening conviction that the function of art is not to battle with
                    practical evils, but to create a world of ideal beauty in which the mind may
                    find refuge from the perplexities of real life.</p>
