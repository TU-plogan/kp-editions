                    (1777-1855), an eminent German mathematician, was born of humble parents at
                    Brunswick, April 23, 1777, and was indebted for a liberal education to the
                    notice which his talents procured him from the reigning duke. His name became
                    widely known by the publication, in his twenty-fifth year (1801), of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dis</hi><hi rend="italic">quisitiones Arithmeticae.</hi> In 1807
                    he was appointed director of the Göttingen observatory, an office which he
                    retained to his death: it is said that he never slept away from under the roof
                    of his observatory, except on one occasion, when he accepted an invitation from
                    Humboldt to attend a meeting of natural philosophers at Berlin. In 1809 he
                    published at Hamburg his <hi rend="italic">Theoria Motus Corporum Coeles</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tium,</hi> a work which gave a powerful impulse to the true
                    methods of astronomical observation; and his astronomical workings,
                    observations, calculations of orbits of planets and comets, &amp;c., are very
                    numerous and valuable. He continued his labours in the theory of numbers and
                    other analytical subjects, and communicated a long series of memoirs to the
                    Royal Society of Sciences at Göttingen. His first memoir on the theory of
                    magnetism, <hi rend="italic">Intensitas</hi><hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">magneticoe</hi><hi rend="italic">terrestris</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    revocata,</hi> was published in 1833, and he shortly afterwards proceeded, in
                    conjunction with Professor Wilhelm Weber, to invent new apparatus for observing
                    the earth’s magnetism and its changes; the instruments devised by them were the
                    declination instrument and the bifilar magnetometer. With Weber’s assistance he
                    erected in 1833 at Göttingen a magnetic observatory free from iron (as Humboldt
                    and Arago had previously done on a smaller scale), where he made magnetic
                    observations, and from this same observatory he sent telegraphic signals to the
                    neighbouring town, thus showing the practicability of an electromagnetic
                    telegraph. He further instituted an association (Magnetische Verein), composed
                    at first almost entirely of Germans, whose continuous observations on fixed
                    term-days extended from Holland to Sicily. The volumes of their publication, <hi
                    rend="italic">Resultate aus der Beobachtungen des</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Magnetischen Vereins,</hi> extend from 1836 to 1839; and in those for 1838 and
                    1839 are contained the two important memoirs by Gauss, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Allgemeine</hi><hi rend="italic">Theorie der Erdmagnet</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ismus,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lehrsätze</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> on the theory of forces attracting
                    according to the inverse square of the distance. The instruments and methods
                    thus due to him are substantially those employed in the magnetic observatories
                    throughout the world. He co-operated in the Danish and Hanoverian measurements
                    of an arc and trigonometrical operations (1821-48), and wrote (1843, 1846) the
                    two memoirs <hi rend="italic">Ueber</hi><hi rend="italic">Gegenstände</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic">htihern</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geodäsie.</hi> Connected with observations in general we have (1812-26) the
                    memoir <hi rend="italic">Theoria</hi><hi rend="italic">combinations</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">observationum erroribus</hi><hi rend="italic">minimis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">obnoxia,</hi> with a second part and a supplement. Another memoir
                    of applied mathematics is the <hi rend="italic">Dioptrische</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Unter</hi><hi rend="italic">suchungen,</hi> 1840. Gauss was well
                    versed in general literature and the chief languages of modern Europe, and was a
                    member of nearly all the leading scientific societies in Europe. He died at
                    Göttingen early in the spring of 1855. The centenary of his birth was celebrated
                    (1877) at his native place, Brunswick.</p>
                <p>Gauss’s collected works have been recently published by the Royal Society of
                    Göttingen, in 7 vols. 4to, Gött., 1863-71, edited by E. J. Schering,—(1) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,</hi><hi rend="italic">{T) Theory of
                    Numbers,</hi> (3) <hi rend="italic">Analysis,</hi> (4) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geometry and Method of Least Squares,</hi> (5) <hi rend="italic">Mathematical
                    Physics,</hi> (6) <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> and (7) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Theoria Motus Corporum Coelestium.</hi> They include, besides his
                    various works and memoirs, notices by him of many of these, and of works of
                    other authors in the <hi rend="italic">Göttingen gelehrte Anzeigen,</hi> and a
                    considerable amount of previously unpublished matter, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nachlass.</hi> Of the memoirs in pure mathematics, comprised for the most part
                    in vols, ii., iii., and iv. (but to these must be added those on <hi
                    rend="italic">Attractions</hi> in vol. v.), it may be safely said there is not
                    one which has not signally contributed to the progress of the branch of
                    mathematics to which it belongs, or which would not require to be carefully
                    analysed in a history of the subject. Running through these volumes in order, we
                    have in the second the memoir, <hi rend="italic">Summatio quarun-dam
                    serierum</hi><hi rend="italic">singularium,</hi> the memoirs on the theory of
                    biquadratic residues, in which the notion of complex numbers of the form <hi
                    rend="italic">a + bi</hi> was first introduced into the theory of numbers; and
                    included in the <hi rend="italic">Nachlass</hi> are some valuable tables. That
                    for the conversion of a fraction into decimals (giving the complete period for
                    all the prime numbers up to 997) is a specimen of the extraordinary love which
                    Gauss had for long arithmetical calculations; and the amount of work gone
                    through in the construction of the table of the number of the classes of binary
                    quadratic forms must also have been tremendous. In vol. iii. we have memoirs
                    relating to the proof of the theorem that every numerical equation has a real or
                    imaginary root, the memoir on the <hi rend="italic">Hypergeometric Series,</hi>
                    that on <hi rend="italic">Interpolation,</hi> and the memoir <hi rend="italic"
                    >Determinatio Attractionis</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> in which a planetary
                    mass is considered as distributed over its orbit according to the time in which
                    each portion of the orbit is described, and the question (having an implied
                    reference to the theory of secular perturbations) is to find the attraction of
                    such a ring. In the solution the value of an elliptic function is found by means
                    of the <hi rend="italic">arithmetico</hi><hi rend="italic">geometrical
                    mean.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Nachlass</hi> contains further researches on
                    this subject, and also researches (unfortunately very fragmentary) on the
                    lemniscate-function, &amp;c., showing that Gauss was, even before 1800, in
                    possession of many of the discoveries which have made the names of Abel and
                    Jacobi illustrious. In vol. iv. we have the memoir <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine
                    Auflösung,</hi> on the graphical representation of one surface upon another, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Disquisitiones</hi><hi rend="italic">generales circa
                    superficies</hi><hi rend="italic">curvas.</hi> And in vol. v. we have a memoir
                    <hi rend="italic">On the Attraction of Homogeneous Ellipsoids,</hi> and the
                    already mentioned memoir <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Lehrsätze,</hi> on the
                    theory of forces attracting according to the inverse square of the distance. <hi
