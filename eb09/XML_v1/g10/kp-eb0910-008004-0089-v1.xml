                <p><label type="entry">GARHWAL</label>, a district of British India, in the Kurnâon
                    division, under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western
                    Provinces, situated between 29° 16' 15" and 31° 5' 30" N. lat., and 78° 18' 45"
                    and 80° 8' E. long, and bounded on the N. by Chinese Tibet, on the E. by Kumâon
                    district, on the S. by Bijnor district, and on the W. by Independent Garhwâl or
                    Tehri. Garhwâl district consists almost entirely of rugged mountain ranges
                    running in all directions, and separated by narrow valleys, which may almost be
                    described as gorges or raviues. The only level portion of the district consists
                    of a narrow strip of waterless forest, between the southern slopes of the hills
                    and the fertile plains of Rohilkhand. The highest moun tains are in the north of
                    the district, the principal peaks being Nandâ Devi (25,661 feet), Kamet
                    (25,413), Ircoul (23,382), Dunagiri (23,181), Badrinath (22,901), and Kedarnath
                    (22,853). The Alaknanda, one of the main sources of the Ganges, receives with
                    its affluents the whole drainage of the district. The river is regarded as of
                    peculiar sanctity, and is annually resorted to by thousands of devout Hindus. At
                    Deoprayâg the Alaknandâ joins the Bhâgirathi, and thenceforward the united
                    streams bear the name of the Ganges. Navigation is impracticable in all the
                    rivers, owing to the velocity of their currents, and the existence of shoals and
                    rapids. Cultivation is principally confined to the immediate vicinity of the
                    rivers, which are employed for purposes of irrigation; but out of a total
                    estimated area of 5500 square miles in 1872, only 209 were returned as under
                    cultivation. Agriculture, however, is carried on with great skill and industry,
                    by terracing out the hill sides. Wheat, rice, and <hi rend="italic">mandud</hi>
                    are the staple crops, the surplus produce being exported to Tibet. Tea planting
                    is also carried on under European supervision.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 disclosed a population in the Garhwâl district of 310,288
                    (115,745 males and 154,537 females), distributed among 3944 villages and 57,293
                    houses. The Hindus numbered 308,398, or no less than 99 ’ 3 per cent, of the
                    population, the Mahometans 1799, and Christians 85. The two great Hindu temples
                    of Badrinath and Kedarnath, which lie hidden among the recesses of the snowy
                    range, attract large numbers of pilgrims, who considerably add to the prosperity
                    of the district. No place in Garhwâl contains as many as 5000 inhabitants.
                    Srinagar is the largest town, but the administrative headquarters is at Pauni.
                    Trade is principally carried on with Tibet, by way of the Mana and Niti passes,
                    sheep and goats being used as beasts of burden. The chief exports are grain, <hi
                    rend="italic">gur,</hi> cloth, and tobacco; the imports salt, borax, wool, gold,
                    and precious stones. Good hill roads, from 10 to 12 feet in width, intersect the
                    district in every direction, the total length being about 1000 miles. The land
                    revenue in 1875 amounted to £9555. Only a small force of regular police is
                    stationed at headquarters, and there is little crime of any kind.</p>

                <p>Education has made greater progress among these mountain valleys than in the
                    plain districts beneath them. In 1875 73 schools afforded education to 3609
                    pupils.</p>
                <p>Garhwâl originally consisted of 52 petty chieftainships, each chief with his own
                    independent fortress <hi rend="italic">(yarh).</hi> Between 400 and 500 years
                    ago, one of these chiefs, Ajai Pal, ruler of Chandpur, reduced all the minor
                    principalities under his own sway, and founded the Garhwâl kingdom. He and his
                    ancestors ruled over Garhwal and the adjacent state of Tehri, in an
                    uninterrupted line till 1803, when the Gurkhas invaded Kumâon and Garhwal
                    driving Prithimân Sâh, the Garhwal chief, into the plains. For twelve years the
                    Gιirkhas ruled the country with a rod of iron, until a series of encroachments
                    by them on British territory, led to the war with Nepal in 1814. At the
                    termination of the campaign, Garhwal and Kumâon were converted into British
                    districts, while the Tehri principality was restored to Pridliimân Sâh, whose
                    grandson still holds it. Since the annexation, Garhwâl has rapidly advanced in
                    material prosperity. Cultivation lias rapidly increased, and the spread of
                    tea-culture has opened the country to British capital and enterprise, which are
                    converting this long harassed tract into an important and wealthy district.</p>
