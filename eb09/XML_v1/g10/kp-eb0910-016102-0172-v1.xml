                    rend="smallcaps">von</hi> (1764-1832), born at Breslau, May 2, 1764, aptly and
                    accurately described by his distinguished friend Varnhagen von Ense as a
                    writer-statesman (Schriftsteller Staatsmann). He was more than a publicist or
                    political writer. His position was peculiar, and his career without a parellel.
                    It is believed that no other instance can be adduced of a man exercising the
                    same amount of influence in the conduct of public affairs, without rank or
                    fortune, without high office, without being a member of a popular or legislative
                    assembly, without in fact any ostensible means or instrumentality besides his
                    pen. Born in the middle class in an aristocratic country, he lived on a footing
                    of social equality with princes and ministers, the trusted partaker of their
                    counsels and the chosen exponent of their policy.</p>
                <p>His father heldan employment in the Prussian civil service; his mother was an
                    Ancillon distantly related to the statesman of that name. On his father’s
                    promotion to the mint <pb break="no"

                    the capital, he was sent to a gymnasium there, and in due course completed his
                    education at the university of Frankfort-on-the-Oder. He is said to have shown
                    neither liking nor aptitude for intellectual pursuits till after his attendance
                    on the lectures of Kant at Königsberg, in his twentieth or twenty-first year,
                    when, suddenly lighted up as by inspiration, he set to work in right earnest,
                    mastered the Greek and Latin languages, acquired as perfect a knowledge of
                    French as could well be attained by one who was not a Frenchman, and a
                    sufficient familiarity with English to enable him to translate from it with
                    clearness and fluency. He also managed to gain an intimate acquaintance with
                    English commerce and finance, which he afterwards turned to good account. The
                    extent of his acquirements was rendered more remarkable by his confirmed habits
                    of dissipation; for from the commencement to the conclusion of his career he was
                    remarkable for the manner in which, in the midst of the gravest occupations, he
                    indulged his fondness for female society and a ruinous passion for play. In 1786
                    he was appointed private secretary to the royal general directory, and was soon
                    afterwards promoted to the rank of <hi rend="italic">Kriegsrath</hi>
                    (war-councillor). Like Mackintosh, he was fascinated by the French Revolution at
                    its dawn, and, like Mackintosh, was converted to a sounder estimate of its then
                    pending results by Burke. He broke ground in literature in 1794, by a
                    translation of the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Essay on the French
                    Revolution,</hi> followed in 1794 and 1795 by translations from Mallet du Pan
                    and Mounier. In 1795 he founded and edited a monthly journal which soon came to
                    an untimely end. In November 1797 he published a pamphlet under the title of ’ a
                    <hi rend="italic">Sendschreiben</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Missive</hi> addressed
                    to Frederick William HI. of Prussia on his accession, pointing out the duties of
                    the new sovereign and especially recommending the complete freedom of the press.
                    In the course of the next three years he contributed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historisches</hi><hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> a series of articles “On the
                    Origin and Character of the War against the French Revolution,” with express
                    reference to Great Britain. These led to his visiting England, where he formed
                    intimate relations with Mackintosh, Lord Grenville, Pitt, and other eminent men,
                    which proved lasting, flattering, and remunerative. The first entries in his
                    published diary, beginning April 14, 1800, and continued (with breaks) to the
                    end of 1828, run thus</p>
                <p>“On the 14th of April, an agreeable surprise. The Jew elder, Hirsch, brought me
                    50 thalers for drawing up I know not what representation (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Vorstellung}.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mag 28.—</hi> Received through Baron
                    Krüdener a watch set with (small) brilliants, a present from the emperor of
                    Russia. <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 1.—Received through Garlicke a letter from
                    Lord Grenville, together with a donation of &lt;£500, the first of its
                    kind.”</p>
                <p>The last entry for this year, 1800, is :—“At the end of the year great pecuniary
                    embarrassment. Received £100 from Garlicke and negotiated with Carysfort.”</p>
                <p>The diary for 1801 begins :— <hi rend="italic">“February.—</hi> Very remarkable
                    that on the one side Lord Carysfort charged me with the translation into French
                    of the English Notes against Prussia, and shortly afterwards Count Haugwitz with
                    the translation into German of the Prussian Notes against England.”</p>
                <p>Frequently recurring entries of this kind illustrate his position through life.
                    He was to all intents and purposes a mercenary of the pen, but he was so openly
                    and avowedly, and he was never so much as suspected by those who knew him best
                    of writing contrary to his own convictions at the time. This is why he never
                    lost the esteem or confidence of his employers,—of Prince Metternich, for
                    example, who, when he was officially attached to the Austrian Government, was
                    kept regularly informed of the sources from which the greater part of his income
                    was derived. Embarrassments of all sorts, ties and temptations from which he was
                    irresistibly impelled to tear himself, led to his change of country; and an
                    entry for May 1802 runs :—“On the 15th I take leave of my wife, and at three in
                    the morning of the 20th I leave Berlin with Adam Müller, never to see it again.”
                    It does not appear that he ever saw his wife again either; and his intimacies
                    with other women, mostly of the highest rank, are puzzling from their
                    multiplicity. He professes himself unable to explain the precise history of hi3
                    settlement in Vienna. All he remembers is that he was received with signs of
                    jealousy and distrust, and that the emperor, to whom he was presented by Count
                    Colloredo, showed no desire to secure his services. Many years were to elapse
                    before the formation of the connexion with Metternich, the most prominent
                    feature and crowning point of his career.</p>
                <p>Before entering into any kind of engagements with the Austrian Government he
                    applied to the king of Prussia for a formal discharge, which was granted with an
                    assurance that his Majesty, “in reference to his merits as a writer, coincided
                    in the general approbation which he had so honourably acquired.” A decisive
                    proof of the confidence placed in him was his being invited by Count Haugwitz to
                    the Prussian headquarters shortly before the battle of Jena, and commissioned to
                    draw up the Prussian manifesto and the king’s letter to Napoleon. It was in
                    noticing this letter that Napoleon spoke of the known and avowed writer as “a
                    wretched scribe named Gentz, one of those men without honour who sell themselves
                    for money.” In the course of 1806, he published <hi rend="italic">JFar between
                    Spain and England,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fragments upon the Balance of
                    Power in Europe,</hi> on receiving which (at Bombay) Mackintosh wrote :—“I
                    assent to all you say, sympathize with all you feel, and admire equally your
                    reason and your eloquence throughout your masterly fragment.” The bond of union
                    between him and Metternich was formed in 1810. This was one reason, joined to
                    his general reputation, for his being named first secretary to the congress of
                    Vienna in 1814, where, besides his regular duties, he seems to have made himself
                    useful to several of the plenipotentiaries, as he notes in his diary that he
                    received 22,000 florins in the name of Louis XVIII. from Talleyrand, and
                    &lt;£600 from Lord Castlereagh, accompanied by <hi rend="italic">“les</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plus</hi><hi rend="italic">folles promesses.”</hi> He acted in the
                    same capacity at the congress or conference of Paris in 1815, of Aix in 1818,
                    Karlsbad and Vienna in 1819, Troppau and Laybach in 1820 and 1821, and Verona in
                    1822. The following entry in his diary for December 14, 1819, has exposed him to
                    much obloquy as the interested advocate of reactionary doctrines :—“About
                    eleven, at Prince Metternich’s: attended the last and most important sitting of
                    the commission to settle the 13th article of the Bundes-Akt, and had my share in
                    one of the greatest and worthiest results of the transactions of our time. A day
                    more, important than that of Leipsic.” The 13th article provides that in all
                    states of the Bund the constitutional government shall be byestates instead of
                    by a representative body in a single chamber: “in allen Bundestaaten wird eine
                    landständische Verfassung stattfinden.” Remembering what ensued in France from
                    the absorption of the other estates in the Tiers État, it would have been
                    strange if Gentz had not supported this 13th article. He was far from a
                    consistent politician, but he was always a sound Conservative at heart; and his
                    reputation rests on his foreign policy, especially on the courage, eloquence,
                    and efficiency with which he made head against the Napoleonic system till it was
                    struck down.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable phase of Gentz’s declining years was his passion, in his
                    sixty-seventh year, for Fanny Elssler, the celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >danseuse,</hi> which forms the subject of some very remarkable letters to his
                    attached friend Rahel (the wife of Varnhagen von Ense) in 1830 and 1831. He died
                    June 9, 1832. There is no complete edition of his works. The late Baron von
                    Prokesch was engaged in preparing one when the Austrian Government interfered,
                    and the design was perforce abandoned. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. h.)</hi><pb
