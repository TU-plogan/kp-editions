                <p><label type="entry">GAMES</label>. The public games of Greece and Rome were
                    athletic contests and spectacles of various kinds, generally connected with and
                    forming part of a religious observance. Probably no institution exercised a
                    greater influence in moulding the national character, and producing that unique
                    type of physical and intellectual beauty which we see reflected in Greek art and
                    literature, than the public contests of Greece. Fo them each youth was trained
                    in the gymnasium, they were the central mart whither poet, artist, and merchant
                    each brought his wares, and the common ground of union for every member of the
                    Hellenic race. It is to Greece then that we must look for the earliest form and
                    the fullest development of ancient games, and we propose in the present article
                    to treat principally of the Greek αγώνες. The shows of the Roman circus and
                    amphitheatre were at best a shadow, and in the later days of the empire a
                    travesty, of the Olympia and Pythia, and require only a cursorÿ notice.
                    “Corruptio optimi fit pessima.” From the noblest spectacle in the world, the
                    Greek Olympia, the downward course of public games can be traced, till we reach
                    the ignoblest, the Roman amphitheatre, of whose horrors we may still form a
                    faint picture from its last survival, the Spanish bull-fight.</p>
                <p>The earliest games of which we have any record are those at the funeral of
                    Patroclus, which form the subject of the twenty-third Iliad. They are noticeable
                    both as showing that the belief that the dead would be appeased or gratified by
                    the same exhibitions which pleased them in life was a common heritage of Greeks
                    and Romans from their Aryan progenitors, and as already including all the
                    distinctive competitions which we find in historical times,—the chariotrace,
                    archery, boxing, wrestling, and putting the weight. Each of the great Grecian
                    games was held near some shrine or consecrated spot, and is connected by myth or
                    legend with some hero, demigod, or local deity.</p>
                <p>The Olympian games were the earliest, and to the last they remained the most
                    celebrated of the four national festivals. Olympia was a naturally enclosed spot
                    in the rich plain of Elis, bounded on the N. by the rocky heights of Kronos, and
                    on the S. and W. by the Alpheus and its tributary the Kladeus. There was the
                    grove of Altis, in which were ranged the statues of the victorious athletes, and
                    the temple of Olympian Zeus with the chryselephantine statue of the god, the
                    masterpiece of Phidias. There Hercules (so ran the legend which Pindar has
                    introduced in one of his finest odes), when he had conquered Elis and slain its
                    king Augeas, consecrated a temenos and instituted games in honour of his
                    victory. A later legend, which probably embodies historical fact, tells how,
                    when Greece was torn by dissensions and ravaged by pestilence, Iphitus inquired
                    of the oracle for help, and was bidden restore the games which had fallen into
                    desuetude; and there was in the time of Pausanias, suspended in the temple of
                    Hera at Olympia, a bronze disk whereon were inscribed, with the regulations of
                    the games, the names of Iphitus and Lycurgus. From this we may safely infer that
                    the games were a primitive observance of the Eleians and Pisans, and first
                    acquired their celebrity from the powerful concurrence of Sparta. In 776 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Eleians engraved the name of their countryman
                    Coroebus as victor in the foot race, and thenceforward we have an almost
                    unbroken list of the victors in each succeeding Olympiad or fourth recurrent
                    year. For the next fifty years no names occur butthose of Eleians or their next
                    neighbours. After 720 B.c. we find Corinthians and Megareans, and later still
                    Athenians and extra-Peloponnesians. Thus what at first was nothing more than a
                    village bout became a bond of union for all the branches of the Doric race, and
                    grew in time to be the high feast to which every Greek gathered, from the
                    mountain fastnesses of Thessaly to the remotest colonies of Cyrene and
                    Marseilles. It survived even the extinction of Greek liberty, and had nearly
                    completed twelve centuries when it was abolished by the decree of the Christian
                    emperor Theodosius, in the tenth year of his reign. The last Olympiau victor was
                    a Romanized Armenian named Varastad.</p>
                <p>Let us attempt to call up the scene which Olympia in [its palmy days must have
                    presented as the great festival approached. Heralds had proclaimed throughout
                    Greece the truce of God, which put a stop to all warfare, and ensured to all a
                    safe conduct during the sacred month. So religiously was this observed that the
                    Spartans chose to risk the liberties of Greece, when the Persians were at the
                    gates of Pylae, rather than march during the holy days. Those white tents which
                    stand out against the sombre grey of the olive groves belong to the
                    Hellanodicae, or ten judges of the games, chosen one for each tribe of the
                    Eleians. They have been here already ten months, receiving instruction in their
                    duties. All, too, or most of the athletes must have arrived, for they have been
                    undergoing the indispensable training in the gymnasium of the Altis. But along
                    the “holy road” from the town of Elis there are crowding a motley throng.
                    Conspicuous in the long train of pleasureseekers are the 0εωpoi or sacred
                    deputies, clad in their robes of office, and bearing with them in their
                    carriages of state offerings to the shrine of the god. Nor is there any lack of
                    distinguished visitors. It may be Alcibiades, who, they say, has entered no less
                    than seven chariots; or Gorgias, who has written a famous ∈7rt‰^ις for the
                    occasion <hi rend="italic">; or</hi> the sophist Hippias, who boasts that all he
                    ⅛ears about him, from the sandals on his feet to the dithyrambs he carries in
                    his hand, are his own manufacture; or Aetion, who will exhibit his picture of
                    the Marriage of Alexander and Roxana—the picture which gained him no less a
                    prize than the daughter of the Hellanodices Praxonides; or, in an earlier age,
                    the poet-laureate of the Olympians, Pindar himself. Lastly, as at the mediaeval
                    tournament, there are “store of ladies whose bright eyes rain influence;”
                    matrons, indeed, are excluded on pain of death, but maidens, in accordance with
                    Spartan manners, are admitted to the show.</p>
                <p>At daybreak the athletes presented themselves in the Bouleuterion, where the
                    presidents were sitting, and proved by witnesses that they were of pure Hellenic
                    descent, and had no stain, religious or civil, on their character. Laying their
                    hands on the bleeding victim, they swore that they had duly qualified themselves
                    by ten months’ continuous training in the gymnasium, and that they would use no
                    fraud or guile in the sacred contests. Thence they proceeded to the stadium,
                    where they stripped to the skin and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n73/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0073-0064"/> anointed themselves. A herald proclaimed—“Let the
                    runners put their feet to the line,” and called on the spectators to challenge
                    any disqualified by blood or character. If no objection was made, they were
                    started by the note of the trumpet, running in heats of four, ranged in the
                    places assigned them by lot. Tho presidents seated near the goal adjudged the
                    victory. The footrace was only one of twenty-four Olympian contests which
                    Pausanias enumerates, though we must not suppose that these were all exhibited
                    at any one festival. Till the 77th Olympiad all was concluded in one day, but
                    afterwards the feast was extended to five. The order of the games is for the
                    most part a matter of conjecture, but, roughly speaking, the historical order of
                    their institutiou was followed. We will now describe in this order the most
                    important.</p>
                <p>(1.) The <hi rend="italic">foot-race.</hi> For the first 13 Olympiads the δρό/wç,
                    or single lap of the stadium, which was 200 yards long, was the only contest.
                    The δίαυλον, in which the course was traversed twice, was added in the 14th
                    Olympiad, and in the 15 th the δόλιχο?, or long race, of 7, 12, or, according to
                    the highest computation, 24 laps, over 3 miles in length. We are told that the
                    Spartan Ladas, after winning this race, dropped down dead at the goal. There was
                    also, for a short time, a race in heavy armour, which Plato highly commends as a
                    preparation for active service. (2.) <hi rend="italic">Wrestling</hi> was
                    introduced in the 18th Olympiad. The importance attached to this exercise is
                    shown by the very word <hi rend="italic">palcεstra,</hi> and Plutarch calls it
                    the most artistic and cunning of athletic games. The practice differed little
                    from that of modern time3, save that the wrestler’s limbs were anointed with oil
                    and sprinkled with sand. The third throw, which decided the victory, passed into
                    a proverb, and struggling on the ground, such as we see in the famous statue at
                    Florence, was not allowed, at least at the Olympia. (3.) In the same year was
                    introduced the 7rεvτα0λov, a combination of the five games enumerated in the
                    well-known pentameter ascribed to Simonides :—</p>
                <p>g,∖μα, πoδωκe'ιηv, δίσκον, 6,.covτa, πάλην.</p>
                <p>Only the first of these calls for any comment. The only leap practised seems to
                    have been the long jump. The leapers increased their momentum by means of <hi
                    rend="italic">aλτηρcς</hi> or dumb-bells, which' they swung in the act of
                    leaping. By the help of them, and of the spring-board, enormous distances were
                    covered, though the leap of 55 feet with which Phayllus is credited is simply
                    incredible. It is disputed whether a victory in all five contests, or in three
                    at least, was required to win the <hi rend="italic">πivτaθλov.</hi> (4.) <hi
                    rend="italic">Boxing</hi> was added in the 23d Olympiad. The rules were much the
                    same as those of the modem ring, except that the boxer’s fists and wrists were
                    armed with straps of leather. The force of the blow was thereby increased; but
                    no arm so terrible as the cestus of the Romans can ever have been admitted in
                    Greek contests, seeing that the death of an antagonist not only disqualified a
                    combatant, but was severely punished. In the pancraiùm, a combination of
                    wrestling and boxing, the use of these straps, and even of the clenched fist,
                    was disallowed. (5.) The <hi rend="italic">chariot-race</hi> had its origin in
                    the 23d Olympiad. It was held in the hippodrome, a race-course 1200 feet long by
                    400 broad, laid out on the left side of the hill of Kronos. The whole circuit
                    had to be traversed twelve times. In the centre near the further end was the
                    pillar or goal (the <hi rend="italic">spina</hi> of the Romans), round which the
                    chariots had to turn. “To shun the goal with rapid wheels” has been well
                    selected by Milton as the most graphic feature of the Olympian games. So
                    dangerous indeed was the manoeuvre that, according to Pausanias, a mysterious
                    horror attached to the spot, and horses « hen they passed it would start in
                    terror without visible cause, upsetting the chariot and wounding the driver. The
                    number of chariots that might appear on the course at once is uncertain. Pindar
                    <hi rend="italic">(Pyth.,</hi> v. 46) praises Arcesilaus of Cyrene for having
                    brought off his chariot uninjured in a contest where no fewer than forty took
                    part. The large outlay involved excluded all but rich competitors, and even
                    kings and tyrants eagerly contested the palm. Thus in the list of victors we
                    find the names of Cylon, the would-be tyrant of Athens, Pausanias the Spartan
                    king, Archelaus of Macedon, Gelon and Hiero of Syracuse, and Theron of
                    Agrigentum. Chariot-races with mules, with mares, with two horses in place of
                    four, were successively introduced, but none of these present any special
                    interest. Races on horseback date from the 33d Olympiad. As the course was the
                    same, success must have depended on skill as much as on swiftness. Lastly, there
                    were athletic contests of the same description for boys, and a competition of
                    heralds and trumpeters, introduced in the 93d Olympiad.</p>
                <p>The prizes were at first, as in the Homeric times, of some intrinsic value, but
                    after the 6th Olympiad the only prize for each contest was a garland of wild
                    olive, which was cut with a golden sickle from the kallistephanos, the sacred
                    tree brought by Hercules “from the dark fountains of Ister in the land of the
                    Hyperboreans, to be a shelter common to all men and a crown of noble deeds”
                    (Pindar, <hi rend="italic">Ol.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> iii. 18).
                    Greek writers from Herodotus to Plutarch dwell with complacency on the
                    magnanimity of a race who cared for nothing but honour and were content to
                    struggle for a corruptible crown. But though the Greek games present in this
                    respect a favourable contrast to the greed and gambling of the modern
                    race-course, yet to represent men like Milon and Damoxenus as actuated by pure
                    love of glory is a pleasing fiction of the moralists. The successful athlete
                    received in addition to the immediate honours very substantial rewards. A herald
                    proclaimed his name, his parentage, and his country; the Hellanodicae took from
                    a table of ivory and gold the olive crown and placed it on his head, and in his
                    hand a branch of palm; as he marched in the sacred revel to the temple of Zeus,
                    his friends and admirer3 showered in his path fioweι ’ 3 and costly gifts,
                    singing the old song of Archilochus, τr)v∈λλα καλλίνικε, and his name was
                    canonized in the Greek calendar. Fresh honours and rewards awaited him on his
                    return home. If he was an Athenian he received, according to the law of Solon,
                    500 drachmae, and free rations for life in the Prytaneum; if a Spartan, he had
                    as his prerogative the post of honour in battle. Poets like Pindar, Simonides,
                    and Euripides sung his praises, and sculptors like Phidias and Praxiteles were
                    engaged by the state to carve his statue. We even read of a breach in the town
                    walls being made to admit him, as if the common road were not good enough for
                    such a hero; and there are well-attested instances of altars being built and
                    sacrifices offered to a successful athlete. No wonder then that an Olympian
                    prize was regarded as the crown of human happiness. Cicero, with a Roman’s
                    contempt for Greek frivolity, observes with a sueer that an Olympian victor
                    receives more honours than a triumphant general at Rome, and tells the story of
                    the Rhodian Diagoras, who, having himself won the prize at Olympia, and seen his
                    two sons crowned on the same day, was addressed by a Laconian in these words :—
                    “Die, Diagoras, for thou hast nothing short of divinity to desire.” Alcibiades,
                    when setting forth his services to the state, puts first his victory at Olympia,
                    and the prestige he had won for Athens by his magnificent display. But perhaps
                    the most remarkable evidence of the exaggerated value which the Greeks attached
                    to athletic prowess is a casual expression which Thucydides employs when
                    describing the enthusiastic reception of Brasidas at Scione. The Government, he
                    says, voted him a crown of gold, and the multitude flocked round him and decked
                    him with garlands, <hi rend="italic">as though he were an athlete.</hi></p>

                <p>The above description of the Olympian games will serve generally for the other
                    great festivals of Greece. Without entering on any detailed account of these, it
                    will be sufficient here to glance at the most prominent characteristics of
                    each.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pythian</hi> games, second only to the Olympian in
                    importance, were founded after the first Sacred War out of the spoils of Cirrha,
                    595 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Originally a local festival held every eighth
                    year in honour of the Delphic god, with no other contests but in the harp and
                    the paean—in fact a sort of Greek Eisteddfod—they developed into a common άγων
                    for all Greece (so Demosthenes calls them), with all the games and races of
                    Olympia, from which they were distinguished only by their musical and poetical
                    competitions. They were held under the superintendence of the Amphictyones in
                    the autumn or first half of every third Olympian year. The prizes were a wreath
                    of laurel and a palm.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nemean</hi> games, originally a warlike gathering and
                    review, were held in honour of Nemean Zeus at the grove of Nemea, between
                    Cleonae and Phlius, in the second and fourth year of each Olympiad. They date
                    from about 570 B.c. The prize was a chaplet of parsley.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Isthmian</hi> games, founded a little earlier than the
                    Nemean, partook at first of the nature of mysteries. They were held on the
                    narrowest part of the Isthmus of Corinth in honour of Poseidon in the first and
                    third year of each Olympiad. Their prize was a wreath of pine leaves. The
                    importance of the Isthmian games in later times is shown by the fact that
                    Flamininus chose the occasion for proclaiming the liberation of Greece, 196 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> That at a later anniversary (67 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> Nero repeated the proclamation of Flamininus, and coupled with it
                    the announcement of his own infamous victory at Olympia, shows alike the
                    hollowness of the first gift and the degradation which had befallen the Greek
                    games, the last faint relic of Greek worth and independence.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ludi Ρτd&gt;lici</hi> of the Romans included feasts and
                    theatrical exhibitions as well as the public games with which alone we are
                    concerned. As in Greece, they were intimately connected with religion. At the
                    beginning of each civil year it was the duty of the consuls to vow to the gods
                    games for the safety of the commonwealth, and the expenses were defrayed by the
                    treasury. Thus, at no cost to themselves, the Roman public were enabled to
                    indulge at the same time their religious feelings and their love of amusement.
                    Their taste for games naturally grew till it became a passion, and under the
                    empire games were looked upon by the mob as one of the two necessaries of life.
                    The aediles who succeeded to this duty of the consuls were expected to
                    supplement the state allowance from their private purse. Political adventurers
                    were not slow to discover so ready a road to popularity, and what at first had
                    been exclusively a state charge devolved upon men of wealth and ambition. A
                    victory over some barbarian horde or the death of a relation served as the
                    pretext for a magnificent display. But the worst extravagance of private
                    citizens was eclipsed by the reckless prodigality of the Caesars, who squandered
                    the revenues of whole provinces in catering for the mob of idle sight-seers on
                    whose favour their throne depended. But though public games played as important
                    a part in Roman as in Greek history, and must be studied by the Roman historian
                    as an integral factor in social and political life, yet, regarded solely as
                    exhibitions, they are comparatively devoid of interest, and we sympathize with
                    Pliny, who asks his friend how any man of sense can go day after day to view the
                    same dreary round of fights and races.</p>
                <p>It is easy to explain the different feelings which the games of Greece and of
                    Rome excite. The Greeks at their best were actors, the Romans from first to last
                    were spectators. It is true that even in Greek games the professional element
                    played a large and ever-increasing part. As early as the 6th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Xenophanes complains that the wrestler’s strength is
                    preferred to the wisdom of the philosopher, and Euripides, in a well-known
                    fragment, holds up to scorn the brawny swaggering athlete. But what in Greece
                    was a perversion and acknowledged to be such, the Romans not only practised but
                    held up as their ideal. No Greek, however high in birth, was ashamed to compete
                    in person for the Olympic crown. The Roman, though little inferior in gymnastic
                    exercises, kept strictly to the privacy of the palaestra; and for a patrician to
                    appear in public as a charioteer is stigmatized by the satirist as a mark of
                    shameless effrontery.</p>
                <p>Roman games are generally classified as <hi rend="italic">fixed,
                    extraordinary,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">votive·,</hi> but for our present
                    purpose they may be more conveniently grouped under two heads according to the
                    place where they were held, viz., the circus or the amphitheatre.</p>
                <p>For the Roman world the circus was at once a political club, a fashionable
                    lounge, a rendezvous of gallantry, a betting ring, and a playground for the
                    million. Juvenal, speaking loosely, says that in his day it held the whole of
                    Rome; and there is no reason to doubt the precise statement of P. Victor, that
                    in the Circus Maximus there were seats for 350,000 spectators. Of the various
                    <hi rend="italic">Ludi Circeηces</hi> it may be enough here to give a short
                    account of the most important, the <hi rend="italic">Ludi Magni</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Maximi.</hi></p>
                <p>Initiated according to legend by Tarquinius Priscus, the <hi rend="italic">Ludi
                    Magni</hi> were originally a votive feast to Capitoline Jupiter, promised by the
                    general when he took the field, and performed on his return from the annual
                    campaign. They thus presented the appearance of a military spectacle, or rather
                    a review of the whole burgess force, which marched in solemn procession from the
                    Capitol to the fonιm and thence to the circus, which lay between the Palatine
                    and Aventine. First came the sons of patricians mounted on horseback, next the
                    rest of the burghers ranged according to their military classes, after them the
                    athletes, naked save for the girdle round their loins, then the company of
                    dancers with the harp and flute players, next the priestly colleges bearing
                    censers and other sacred instruments, and lastly the simulacra of the gods,
                    earned aloft on their shoulders or drawn in cars. The games themselves were
                    fourfold:—(1) the chariot race; (2) the <hi rend="italic">ludus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Troioe</hi>; (3) the military review; and (4) gymnastic contests.
                    Of these only the first two call for any comment. (1.) The chariot employed in
                    the circus was the two-wheeled war car, at first drawn by two, afterwards by
                    four, and more rarely by three horses. Originally only two chariots started for
                    the prize, but under Caligula we read of as many as twenty-four heats run in the
                    day, each of four chariots. The distance traversed was fourteen times the length
                    of the circus or nearly five miles. The charioteers were apparently from the
                    first professionals, though the stigma under which the gladiator lay never
                    attached to their calling. Indeed a successful driver may compare in popularity
                    and fortune with a modern jockey. The drivers were divided into companies
                    distinguished by the colours of their tunics, whence arose the faction of the
                    circus which assumed such importance under the later emperors. In republican
                    times there were two factions, the white and the red; two more, the green and
                    the blue, were added under the empire, and for a short time in Domitian’s reign
                    there were also the gold and the purple. Even in Juvenal’s day party spirit ran
                    so high that a defeat of the green was looked upon as a second Cannae. After the
                    seat of empire had been transferred to Constantinople these factions of the
                    circus were made the basis of political cabals, and frequently resulted in
                    sanguinary tumults, such as the famous Nika revolt (532 A.D.), in which 30,000
                    citizens lost their lives. (2.) The Ludus Troiae was a sham fight on horseback
                    in which the actors were patrician youths. A spirited description of it will be
                    found in the 5th Aeneid. See also Cincus.</p>
                <p>The two exhibitions we shall next notice, though occasionally given in the
                    circus, belong more properly to the amphitheatre. <hi rend="italic">Venatio</hi>
                    was the baiting of wild animals who were pitted either with one another or with
                    men—captives, criminals, or trained hunters called <hi rend="italic"
                    >bestiarii.</hi> The first certain instance on record of this amusement is in
                    186 B.c., when Μ. Fulvius exhibited lions and tigers in the arena. The taste for
                    these brutalizing spectacles grew apace, and the most distant provinces were
                    ransacked by generals and proconsuls to supply the arena with rare
                    animals—giraffes, tigers, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n75/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0075-0066"/> and crocodiles. Sulla provided for a single show
                    100 lions, and Pompey 600 lions, besides elephants, which were matched with
                    Gaetulian hunters. Julius Caesar enjoys the doubtful honour of inventing the
                    bull-fight. At the inauguration of the Colosseum 5000 wild and 4000 tame beasts
                    were .killed, and to commemorate Trajan’s Dacian victories there was a butchery
                    of 11,000 beasts. The <hi rend="italic">naumachia</hi> was a sea fight, either
                    in the arena, which was flooded for the occasion by a system of pipes and
                    sluices, or on an artificial lake. The rival fleets were manned by prisoners of
                    war or criminals, who often fought till one side was exterminated. In the sea
                    fight on Lake Fucinus, arranged by the emperor Claudius, 100 ships and 19,000
                    men were engaged.</p>
                <p>But the special exhibition of the amphitheatre was the <hi rend="italic">munus
                    gladiatorium,</hi> which dates from the funeral games of Marcus and Decimus
                    Brutus, given in honour of their father, 264 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It
                    was probably borrowed from Etruria, and a refinement on the commou savage custom
                    of slaughtering slaves or captives on the grave of a warrior or chieftain.
                    Nothing so clearly brings before us the vein of coarseness and inhumanity which
                    runs through the otherwise noble character of the Roman, as his passion for
                    gladiatorial shows. We can fancy how Pericles, or even Alcibiades, would have
                    loathed a spectacle that Augustus tolerated and Trajan patronized. Only after
                    the conquest of Greece we hear of their introduction into Athens, and they were
                    then admitted rather out of compliment to the conquerors than from any love of
                    the sport. In spite of numerous prohibitions from Constantine downwards, they
                    continued to flourish even as late as St Augustine. To a Christian martyr, if we
                    may credit the story told by Theodoret and Cassiodorus, belongs the honour of
                    their final abolition. In the year 404 Telemachus, a monk who had travelled from
                    the East on this sacred mission, rushed into the arena and endeavoured to
                    separate the combatants. He was instantly despatched by the pi*aetor’s orders;
                    but Honorius, on hearing the report, issued an edict abolishing the games, which
                    were never afterwards revived. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Gladiators.</hi> (F.
