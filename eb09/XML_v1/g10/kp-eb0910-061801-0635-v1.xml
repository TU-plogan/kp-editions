                    a mammal belonging to the ruminant group of the Artiodactyle Ungulates, and the
                    single living representative of the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cameloparda-</hi><hi rend="italic">lidoe.</hi> Intermediate between the members
                    of the deer and ox families, the giraffe differs from both in having neither
                    true horns nor antlers. It possesses however two solid, bony, and persistent
                    appendages, attached partly to the frontal and partly to the parietal bones; and
                    not to the former only as in the true horned ruminants, and these, unlike the
                    processes of the latter, are distinct bones, separable, at least in the young
                    animal, from those of the forehead. These horn-like peduncles are completely
                    covered over by the skin of the forehead, and are terminated by a tuft of
                    bristles, while in front of them there is a protuberance caused by a thickening
                    of the bone, sufficiently prominent in the male to have been frequently
                    described as a third horn. The giraffe is the tallest of existing animals,
                    measuring usually from 15 to 16 feet high—the females being somewhat less—but
                    attaining in the largest examples a height of 18 feet. This exceptional
                    elevation is chiefly due to its great length of. neck and limb, the cervical
                    vertebrae, although only seven in number as in other mammals, being in this case
                    exceedingly long. Its body is proportionately short, measuring only 7 feet
                    between the breast and rump, and slants rapidly towards the tail—a peculiarity
                    which has <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n636/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0636-0619"/> given rise to the erroneous impression that the
                    fore legs of the giraffe are longer than the pair behind. Its feet terminate in
                    a divided hoof, which, says Sir Samuel Butler, “is as beautifully proportioned
                    as that of the smallest gazelle”; and the accessory hoofs found in most
                    ruminants are entirely awanting. Its head is small, its eyes large and lustrous;
                    and these, which give to the giraffe its peculiarly gentle appearance, are
                    capable of a certain degree of lateral projection, which enable the creature
                    without turning its head to see around and to a certain extent behind it. The
                    elevated eyes of the giraffe thus enjoy a wider range of vision than those of
                    any other quadruped. Its nostrils are provided with a peculiar mechanism of
                    sphincter muscles, by which they can be opened or closed at will, and the animal
                    is thus enabled to avoid the injurious effects of the sand storms which
                    occasionally pass over its native haunts.</p>
                <p>Its tongue is remarkable for its great length, measuring about 17 inches in the
                    dead animal, and for its great elasticity and power of muscular contraction
                    while living. It is covered with numerous large <hi rend="italic">papilloe,</hi>
                    and forms, like the trunk of the elephant, an admirable organ for the
                    examination and prehension of its food. The graceful appearance presented by the
                    giTaffe, to which it owes its name through the Arabian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Xiraphα</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> is greatly heightened by the
                    orange-red colour of its hide, mottled as it is all over with darker spots;
                    while in its long tail, ending in a luxurious tuft of dark-coloured hair, it
                    possesses an admirable fly-whipper, without which it would probably be
                    impossible for the giraffe to maintain its ground against the seroot fly and
                    other stinging insects of central Africa. It lives on open plains in the
                    neighbourhood of low woods, high forest being scrupulously avoided, as depriving
                    it of the exten sive prospect which forms its chief defence against the attacks
                    of its two great enemies—the lion and man. It feeds almost exclusively on the
                    foliage of trees, showing a preference for certain varieties of mimosa, and for
                    the young shoots of the prickly acacia, for browsing on which the prehensile
                    tongue and large free lips of the giraffe are specially adapted. It is
                    gregarious in its habits, living in small herds rarely of more than twenty
                    individuals, although Sir S. Baker, who hunted it in Abyssinia, states that he
                    has seen as many as a hundred thus herding together.</p>
                <p>There is probably no animal more difficult of approach than the giraffe, owing to
                    that exceeding wariness which prompts it to place sentinels to give the herd
                    timely warning of approaching danger, as well as to its ability, from the
                    elevated position of its eyes, and the openness of the ground it frequents, to
                    see danger, and from its keenness of scent to smell it from afar. It is a fleet
                    though by no means graceful runner, its awkward, shambling gait being due to its
                    moving the fore and hind legs of the same side simultaneously. In hunting it on
                    horseback the rule to be observed, according to the traveller already mentioned,
                    is to press the giraffe the instant he starts; “it is the speed that tells upon
                    him, and the spurs must be at work at the very commencement of the hunt, and the
                    horse pressed along at his best pace; it must be a race at top speed from the
                    very start, but should the giraffe be allowed the slightest advantage for the
                    first five minutes the race will be against the horse.” In pursuing it thus on
                    horseback the experienced hunter avoids too close an approach to the creature’s
                    heels, a blow from which he has probably learnt to regard, with Dr Livingstone,
                    as leaving little to choose between it and “a clap from the arm of a windmill.”
                    Although trusting for safety to flight, it will, when brought to bay, even turn
                    upon the lion; and not seldom does it defend itself successfully against his
                    attacks by the vigorous blows of its powerful limbs. It is,however, powerless
                    against the “king of beasts” when taken unawares, and with this object the
                    latter lies in wait by the banks of streams, and springs upon the giraffe as it
                    seeks to quench its thirst. In captivity it is said to make use of its
                    skin-covered horns as weapons of defence, giving impetus to the blow, not by
                    depressing and then elevating the head, as in the butting of an ox or sheep, but
                    by a sidelong swing of its muscular neck. The skin of the giraffe is in many
                    parts so thick that the bullet of the hunter often fails to pierce it, the
                    surest method of hunting it being that pursued by the Hamran Arabs of Abyssinia,
                    who run it down, and when galloping at full speed cut tho tendons of its legs,
                    or “hamstring” it, as this operation is called, with their broadswords, and thus
                    completely disable it.</p>
                <p>The giraffe is only found wild in Africa, where it ranges throughout the open
                    country of Ethiopia as far south as the confines of Cape Colony. Until about
                    fifty years ago it was almost totally unknown in Europe; it is now, however, to
                    be found in most of the European zoological gardens, where it appears to thrive
                    as well on corn and hay as on the mimosas of its native haunts. It also breeds
                    freely in confinement, so that it may now be regarded as acclimatized in Europe.
                    The giraffe family was more largely represented and enjoyed a wider distribution
                    during the Miocene period, fossil remains of extinct species having been found
                    in Greece and the Siwalik Hills; while an allied genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Helladotherium,</hi> with less neck and more body than the existing giraffe,
                    extended during the same period from the south of France to north-west
                    India.</p>
                <p>The skin of the giraffe forms a valuable leather material, that made from the
                    thicker parts being in special request for sandals; its flesh, according to Sir
                    S. Baker, was, when roasted, the best he had ever tasted; the tendons of its
                    long legs are valued by the Arabs as thread for sewing <pb break="no"

                    instruments; while its leg bones, which differ from those of other ruminants in
                    being solid, are largely used in England in the manufacture of buttons and other
                    articles of bone.</p>
