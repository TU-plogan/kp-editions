                <p><label type="entry">GILLYFLOWER</label>, a popular name applied to various
                    flowers, but principally to the clove, <hi rend="italic">Dianthus
                    Caryophyllus,</hi> of which the carnation is a cultivated variety, and to the
                    stock, <hi rend="italic">Matthiola</hi><hi rend="italic">incana,</hi> a
                    well-known garden favourite. The word is sometimes written gilliflower or
                    gilloflower, and is reputedly a corruption of July-flower, “so called from the
                    month they blow in.” Phillips, in his <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Historica,</hi> remarks that Turner (1568) “calls it gelouer, to
                    which he adds the word stock, as we would say gelouers that grow on a stem or
                    stock, to distinguish them from the clove-gelouers and the wall-gelouers.
                    Gerard, who succeeded Turner, and after him Parkinson, calls it gilloflower, and
                    thus it travelled from its original orthography until it was called July-flower
                    by those who knew not whence it was derived.” Dr Prior, in his useful volume on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Popular Hanies of British Plants,</hi> very distinctly
                    shows the origin of the name. He remarks that it was “formerly spelt gyllofer
                    and gilofre with the <hi rend="italic">ο</hi> long, from the French <hi
                    rend="italic">girofee,</hi> Italian <hi rend="italic">garofalo</hi> (M. Lat. <hi
                    rend="italic">gariofUum)</hi> corrupted from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caryophyllum,</hi> and referring to the spicy odour of the flower, which seems
                    to have been used in flavouring wine and other liquors to replace the more
                    costly clove of India. The name was originally given in Italy to plants of the
                    pink tribe, especially the carnation, but has in England been transferred of
                    late years to several cruciferous plants.” The gillyflower of Chaucer and
                    Spenser and Shakespeare was, as in Italy, <hi rend="italic">Dianthus
                    Caryophyllus</hi>; that of later writers and of gardeners <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathiola.</hi> Much of the confusion in the names of plants has doubtless
                    arisen from the vague use of the French terms <hi rend="italic">giroflée,
                    oeillet,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">violette,</hi> which were all applied to
                    flowers of the pink tribe, but in England were subsequently extended and finally
                    restricted to very different plants. The use made of the flowers to impart a
                    spicy flavour to ale and wine is alluded to by Chaucer who writes—</p>
                <p>“And many a clove gilofre</p>
                <p>To put in ale”; also by Spenser, who refers to them by the name of sops in wine,
                    which was applied in consequence of their being steeped in the liquor. In both
                    these cases, however, it is the clove-gillyflower which is intended, as it is
                    also in the passage from Gerard, in which he states that the conserve made of
                    the flowers with sugar “is exceeding cordiall, and wonderfully above measure
                    doth comfort the heart, being eaten now and then.” The principal other plants
                    which bear the name are the wallflower, <hi rend="italic">Cheiranthus
                    Cheiri,</hi> called wallgillyflower in old books; the dame’s violet, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hesperis matronalis,</hi> called variously the queen’s, the
                    rogue’s, and the winter gillyflower; the ragged robin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lychnis</hi><hi rend="italic">flos cuculi,</hi> called marsh-gillyflower; the
                    water-violet, <hi rend="italic">Hottonia</hi><hi rend="italic">palustris,</hi>
                    called water-gillyflower; and the thrift, <hi rend="italic">Armeria
                    vulgaris,</hi> called sea-gillyflower. As a separate designation it has in
                    modern times been chiefly applied to the <hi rend="italic">Mathiola</hi> or
                    stock, but it is now very little used.</p>
