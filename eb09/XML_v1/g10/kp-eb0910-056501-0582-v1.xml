                <p><label type="entry">GHENT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jodocus</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Justus, of</hi></label> (1465-75). The public records of the
                    city of Ghent have been diligently searched, but in vain, for a clue to the
                    history of Justus or Jodocus, whom Vasari and Guicciardini called Giusto da
                    Guanto. Flemish annalists of the 16th century have enlarged upon the scanty
                    statements of Vasari, and described Jodocus as a pupil of Hubert Van Eyck. But
                    there is no source to which this fable can be traced. The registers of St Luke’s
                    guild at Ghent comprise six masters of the name of Joos or Jodocus who practised
                    at Ghent in the 15th century. But none of the works of these masters have been
                    preserved, and it is impossible to compare their style with that of Giusto. It
                    was between 1465 and 1474 that this artist executed the Communion of the
                    Apostles which Vasari has described, and modern critics now see to the best
                    advantage in the museum of Urbino. It was painted for the brotherhood of Corpus
                    Christi at the bidding of Frederick of Montefeltro, who was introduced into the
                    picture as the companion of Caterino Zeno, a Persian envoy at that time on a
                    mission to the court of Urbino. From this curious production it may be seen that
                    Giusto, far from being a pupil of Hubert Van Eyck, was merely a disciple of a
                    later and less gifted master, who took to Italy some of the peculiarities of his
                    native schools, and forthwith commingled them with those of his adopted country.
                    As a composer and draughtsman Giusto compares unfavourably with the better known
                    painters of Flanders; though his portraits are good, his ideal figures are not
                    remarkable for elevation of type or for subtlety of character and expression.
                    His work is technically on a level with that of Gerard of St John, whose
                    pictures are preserved in the Belvedere at Vienna. Vespasian, a Florentine
                    bookseller who contributed much to form the antiquarian taste of Frederick of
                    Montefeltro, states that this duke sent tc⅛the Netherlands for a capable artist
                    to paint a series of “ancient worthies” for a library recently erected in the
                    palace of Urbino. It has been conjectured that the author of these “worthies,”
                    which are still in existence at the Louvre and in the Barberini palace at Rome,
                    was Giusto. Yet there are notable divergences between these pictures and the
                    Communion of the Apostles. Still, it is not beyond the range of probability that
                    Giusto should have been able, after a certain time, to temper his Flemish style
                    by studying the masterpieces of Santi and Melozzo, and so to acquire the mixed
                    manner of the Flemings and Italians which these portraits of worthies display.
                    Such an assimilation, if it really took place, might justify the Flemings in the
                    indulgence of a certain pride, considering that Raphael not only admired these
                    worthies, but copied them in the sketch book which is now the ornament of the
                    Venetian Academy. There is no ground for presuming that Giusto da Guanto is
                    identical with Justus d’Allamagna who painted the Annunication (1451) in the
                    cloisters of Santa Maria di Castello at Genoa. The drawing and colouring of this
                    wall painting shows that Justus d’Allamagna was as surely a native of South
                    Germany as his homonym at Urbino was a born Netherlander.</p>
