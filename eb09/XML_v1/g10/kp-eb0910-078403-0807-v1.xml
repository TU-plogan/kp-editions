                <p><label type="entry">GORGON</label>, γοργώ, according to Hesychius, is a word akin
                    to <hi rend="italic">γοργός,</hi> which means terrible, lively, rapid. Sophocles
                    (fr. 167) calls the sea-nymphs γopγiδ∈ς and γopγαδeς is quoted as a title of the
                    daughters of Oceanus. Now it is a well-established fact that the sea was at one
                    time the sea of air and its nymphs the clouds. Hence we may infer that words
                    from this stem are employed in the sense of quick-moving as epithets of the
                    clouds.</p>
                <p>The various forms in which the Gorgon appears in Greek mythology originate
                    probably from the rapidly gathering terrible thunder-cloud. When the cloud
                    covered the heaven and hid the sun, a primitive race, whose thoughts and words
                    were few and simple, said that the sun was united in marriage to the cloud. From
                    this union sprang the light ning and the thunder. Now the sun, in its different
                    aspects and relations, was conceived in different ways, which developed, as
                    thought unfolded itself, into distinct deities; and, as connected with clouds,
                    rain, and the fertility that springs therefrom, he is the original of the Vedic
                    Savitar and Tvashtar and of the Greek Poseidon. Accordingly (Hes., <hi
                    rend="italic">Theog.,273</hi> ff.) Poseidon on a meadow (7.e.,the heaven, thus
                    often in mythology) begat from the Gorgon Medusa Chrysaor and Pegasus. Chrysaor,
                    Gold-sword, is obviously the lightning; and Pegasus, who bears the thunder and
                    lightning for Zeus <hi rend="italic">(ibid.</hi> 286), was probably at first
                    simply the thunder. Gorgo and Erinys are merely tribal or local varieties of the
                    same conception; Gorgo is specially Attic, Erinys Minyan. A similar legend
                    occurs about children of Erinys and Poseidon (Paus., viii. 37). Hence Aeschylus
                    <hi rend="italic">(Cho.,</hi> 1048) compares the Erinyes to Gorgons.</p>
                <p>Gorgo is always the impersonation of the atmospheric terrors, and is conceived in
                    connexion with the deities that are armed with thunder and lightning—Zeus and
                    Athene. With Athene in particular is the connexion very close, and some facts of
                    ritual and nomenclature almost suggest an original identity of the two.
                    Palaephatus says that Athene was worshipped in the island of Cerne under the
                    name Gorgo; Sophocles <hi rend="italic">(Al.,</hi> 450) calls her γοργωπ«; and
                    Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Arat.,</hi> 32) says that her wooden statue at
                    Pallene, if <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n808/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0808-0785"/> brought out of the temple, destroyed human life
                    (compare the description of the birth of Athene in Pindar, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ol.,</hi> vii. 65 ft'., which strongly suggests the phenomena of the
                    thunderstorm). Here we have preserved to us a relic from the very earliest
                    thought among the Indo-European race. When a phenomenon in the heavens attracted
                    their attention, they naturally spoke of it as of an animated being. The storm
                    appeared to act out its own natural course, to live its own life. But afterwards
                    the phenomenon was conceived with reference to human needs: beneficent and
                    hostile deities worked in nature <hi rend="italic">; a</hi> hostile power denies
                    to men what a friendly power after a conflict grants. Among the Greeks this
                    opposition appears in the antithesis of Olympian and older or Chthonian gods.
                    The goddess who ruled the storm for man was set in opposition to the actual
                    thundercloud—Athene to Gorgo (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Graces).</hi> Accordingly
                    the usual Greek account is that the γopγov∈ιov or <hi rend="italic">γopγelη
                    κeφaλη,</hi> a terror-striking countenance, is fixed in the middle of the aegis
                    of Zeus. Zeus gives the aegis <hi rend="italic">(fliacl,</hi> v. 736 ff., comp.
                    Aesch., <hi rend="italic">Eτιm.,</hi> 825) to Athene, the goddess of the air.
                    The Gorgoneion is always said to have been won in battle, viz., in the conflict
                    of the beneficent gods against the older nature-powers, who would scorch the
                    earth with heat and deny the needed rain. Zeus then assuming the aegis (the
                    shield of the storm-cloud) overthrows the Titans or the Giants in the aerial
                    battle; the rain descends, and a clearer and cooler sky succeeds. Or in other
                    accounts the whole array of gods engages in the battle; Athene then appears
                    naturally as <hi rend="italic">γοργοφόνη,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> she
                    clears the atmosphere, her own special domain, from the terrible cloud, which
                    she keeps on her shield threatening death to all her foes. The Attic tradition
                    was that the Gorgon was a monster produced by Earth to aid her distressed sons
                    the Giants, and was slain by Pallas (Eur., <hi rend="italic">Ion,</hi> 1002). In
                    Homer Gorgo appears also in connexion with Apollo, Agamemnon, Hector, and
                    Persephone,—-a connexion which might be justified by an examination into the
                    mythological ideas that underlie these names.</p>
                <p>Later accounts, beginning from Hesiod <hi rend="italic">(Theog., l,cj},</hi>
                    mention three Gorgons; but Medusa alone inherits the character and history of
                    the older Gorgo, while two sisters are added to make up the sacred number, in
                    analogy with the Moirae, Graeae, Erinyes, etc. The Argive story has established
                    itself in all later literature as the standard account of the Gorgons. Perseus,
                    the light-giving hero, aided by Athene and the other gods, goes to the abode of
                    the Gorgons beside Oceanus far away in the dark West, and cuts off the head of
                    Medusa. Then from the streaming neck sprang Chrysaor and Pegasus, her two sons
                    by Poseidon. This head, which, like the lightning, had the power of turning into
                    stone all that looked on it, was given to Athene, who placed it in her shield.
                    According to another account, Perseus buried the head in the Agora of Argos.
                    Beside it was buried his daughter Gorgophone, who is obviously a mere
                    impersonation of the old epithet of the Gorgon-slaying goddess.</p>
                <p>These ideas of sun and storm give only the starting point for the myths; the
                    history of their further growth involves the whole subsequent history of the
                    nation. Just as in Germany, after Christianity was introduced, many old myths
                    and customs lived on applied to Christ and his apostles instead of the old gods,
                    so must the Greek myths as we know them bear traces of the historical
                    vicissitudes of the race. Hence Böttiger <hi rend="italic">{Kunst-Myth.,</hi> i.
                    369) has possibly some ground for referring the Perseus tale to the extinction
                    of Phoenician human sacrifices by the Greeks.</p>
                <p>The gradual development in art from the old hideous and terrible representation
                    of the Medusa head to the calm repose of a beautiful dead face is described in
                    detail by Müller, <hi rend="italic">History of Ancient Art,</hi> and <hi
