                    (1807-1862), an Austrian painter, son of the landscape painter Jacob Gauerrnann
                    (1773-1843), was born at Wiesenbach near Gutenstein,Jn Lower Austria, 20th
                    September 1807. It was the intention of his father that he should devote himself
                    to agriculture, but the example of an elder brother, who, however, died <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n119/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0119-0110"/> early, fostered his inclination towards art, and
                    though he had enjoyed no special instruction his first attempts at copying
                    nature were so successful that his father was persuaded to permit him to choose
                    a profession which seemed so much to accord with his natural bent. Under his
                    father’s direction he began studies in landscape, and he also diligently copied
                    the works of the chief masters in animal painting which were contained in the
                    academy and court library of Vienna. In the summer he made art tours in the
                    districts of Styria, Tyrol,, and Salzburg. Two animal pieces which he exhibited
                    at the Vienna Exhibition of 1824 were regarded as remarkable productions for his
                    years, and led to his receiving commissions in 1825 and 1826 from Prince
                    Metternich and Caraman, the French ambassador. His reputation was greatly
                    increased by his picture The Storm, exhibited in 1829, and from that time his
                    works were much sought after and obtained correspondingly high prices. His Field
                    Labourer was regarded by maDy as the most noteworthy picture in the Vienna
                    exhibition of 1834, and his numerous animal pieces have entitled him to a place
                    in the first rank of painters of that class of subjects. The peculiarity of his
                    pictures is the representation of human and animal figures in connexion with
                    appropriate landscapes and in characteristic situations so as to manifest nature
                    as a living whole, and he particularly excels in depicting the free life of
                    animals in wild mountain scenery. Along with great mastery of the technicalities
                    of his art, his works exhibit patient and keen observation, free and correct
                    handling of details, and bold and clear colouring. He died at Vienna, 7th July
