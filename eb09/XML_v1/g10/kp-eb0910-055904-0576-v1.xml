                    Gazna, Ghizni, or Ghuznee, in the Oriental histories more generally Ghaznin), a
                    famous city in Afghanistan, the seat of an extensive empire under two different
                    mediaeval dynasties, and again of prominent interest in the modern history of
                    British India. Ghazni stands on the high tableland of central Afghanistan, in
                    68° 20' E. long., 33° 34' N. lat., at a height of 7726 feet above the sea, and
                    on the direct road between Kandahar and Cabul, 233 miles by <pb break="no"

                    the second. It also stands at the head of the Gomal route from the Indus, one
                    much followed by trade.</p>
                <p>Ghazni, as it now exists, is a place in decay, and probably does not contain more
                    than 4000 inhabitants. It stands at the base of the terminal spur of a ridge of
                    hills, an offshoot from the Gul-Koh, which forms the watershed between the
                    Arghandâb and Tarnak rivers (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Afghanistan).</hi> The
                    castle stands at the northern angle of the town next the hills, and is about 150
                    feet above the plain. The town walls stand on an elevation, partly artificial,
                    and form an irregular square, close on a mile in circuit (including the castle),
                    the walls being partly of stone or brick laid in mud, and partly of clay built
                    in courses. They are flanked by numerous towers. There is also a loopholed
                    fausse-braye wall, and a ditch which can be filled (partially at least) from the
                    Ghazni river, which flows close to the west of the town. There are three gates.
                    The town consists of dirty and very irregular streets of houses several stories
                    high, but with two straighter streets of more pretension, crossing near the
                    middle of the town. New fortifications had been erected previous to 1857, but
                    their present state is not known. In 1839 they were of no real power to resist
                    artillery of moderate calibre, though imposing in aspect and highly picturesque,
                    judging from the views given by Sir Keith Jackson and others. Of the strategical
                    importance of Ghazni there can hardly be a question. The view to the south is
                    extensive, and the plain in the direction of Kandahar stretches to the horizon.
                    It is bare except in the vicinity of the river, where villages and gardens are
                    tolerably numerous. Abundant crops of wheat and barley are grown, as well as of
                    madder, besides minor products. The climate is notoriously cold,—snow lying two
                    or three feet deep for about three months, and tradition speaks of the city as
                    having been more than once overwhelmed by snowdrift. Fuel is scarce, consisting
                    chiefly of prickly shrubs. In summer the heat is not like that of Kandahar or
                    Cabul, but the radiation from the bare heights renders the nights oppressive,
                    and constant dust-storms occur. It is evident that the present restricted walls
                    cannot have contained the vaunted city of Mahmiid. Probably the existing site
                    formed the citadel only of his city. The remarks of Ibn Batuta (c. 1332) already
                    suggest the present state of things, viz., a small town occupied, a large space
                    of ruin; for a considerable area to the N.E. is covered with ruins, or rather
                    with a vast extent of shapeless mounds, which are pointed out as Old Ghazni. The
                    only remains retaining architectural character are two remarkable towers, rising
                    to the height of about 140 feet, and some 400 yards apart from each other. They
                    are similar, but whether identical, in design, is not clearly recorded. They
                    belong, on a smaller and far less elaborate scale, to the same class as the Kutb
                    Minar at Delhi. Views of one of the minarets will be found in Fergusson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Indian Architecture,</hi> in Vigne’s <hi rend="italic">Visit to
                    Ghazni, Cαbul, &lt;kc.,</hi> in Atkinson’s <hi rend="italic">Sketches in

                    the most northerly to have been the work of Mahmùd himself, the other that of
                    his son Masa’ùd. On the Cabul road, a mile beyond the Minaret of Mahmffd, is a
                    village called Rauzah (“the Garden,” a term often applied to gardenmausoleums).
                    Here, in a poor garden, stands the tomb of the famous conqueror himself. It is a
                    prism of white marble standing on a plinth of the same, and bearing a Cufic
                    inscription praying the mercy of God on the most noble Amir, the great king, the
                    Lord of church and state, Abul Kâsim Mahmud, son of Sabuktigin. The tomb stands
                    in a rude chamber, covered with a dome of clay, and hung with old shawls,
                    ostrich eggs, tiger-skins, and so forth. The village stands among luxuriant
                    gardens and orchards, watered by a copious aqueduct. Sultan Baber celebrates the
                    excellence of the grapes of Rauzah.</p>
                <p>The famous “Gates of Somnath” (so-styled) were attached to the building covering
                    Mahmùd’s tomb until their removal to India, under Lord Ellenborough’s orders, on
                    the evacuation of the country in 1842. The governor-general’s intention, as
                    announced in a famous prose paean addressed to the Hindu princes, was to have
                    carried them solemnly through Upper and Central India to Guzerat, and there to
                    have restored them to the (longdesecrated) temple. Calmer reflexion prevailed,
                    and the gates were consigned to the arsenal at Agra, where they now remain.
                    These gates (11 feet in height, 9∣ in width) are ascertained to be of Himalayan
                    cedar (deodar), and are richly carved in geometric Saracenic patterns, so that
                    there is no likelihood of any real connexion with Somnath. But tradition did
                    ascribe to them such a connexion. And when Shâh Shùja in 1831 treated with
                    Mahârâja Ranjit <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n578/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0578-0561"/> Singh for aid to recover the throne of Cabul, one
                    of Ranjit’s stipulations was the restoration of the gates to Somnath, a
                    circumstance which probably suggested the notion to the eccentric
                    governor-general. A still more remarkable fact (stated in a report by Capt.
                    Claude Wade, dated 21st Nov. 1831) is that the shâh reminded the mahûrâja of a
                    prophecy that foreboded the downfall of the Sikh dominion on the removal of the
                    Ghazni gates. The gates were removed to India in the end of 1842; and the Sikh
                    kingdom practically collapsed with the death of Sher Singh in September 1843.
                    Another relic of Sultan Mahmûd is the <hi rend="italic">Band-i-Sultan,</hi> a
                    great dam on the Ghazni river, some 12 miles above the city. Baber describes it
                    as 80 or 100 feet in height, probably along the slope, and about 600 feet long.
                    It had lain ruined in his time since its destruction by Alâuddin Jahânsoz, but
                    Baber sent money to restore it. Vigne calls it only 25 feet in height. He found
                    it much out of repair. It supplies irrigation to the plain west of Ghazni.</p>
                <p>There are many holy shrines about Ghazni surrounded by orchards and vineyards.
                    Baber speaks of them, and tells how he detected and put a stop to the imposture
                    of a pretended miracle at one of them. These sanctuaries make Ghazni a place of
                    Moslem pilgrimage, and it is said that at Constantinople much respect is paid to
                    those who have worshipped at the tomb of the great Ghâzi To test the genuineness
                    of the boast, professed pilgrims are called on to describe the chief <hi
                    rend="italic">notabilia</hi> of the place, and are expected to name all those
                    detailed in certain current Persian verses.</p>
                <p>The city is not mentioned by any narrator of Alexander’s expedition, nor by any
                    ancient author so as to admit of positive recognition. But it is very possibly
                    the Gαzαcα which Ptolemy places among the Paropamisadae, and this may not be
                    inconsistent with Sir H. Rawlinson’s identification of it with Gazos, an Indian
                    city spoken of by two obscure Greek poets as an impregnable place of war. The
                    name is probably connected with the Persian and Sanskrit gaηj and ganja, a
                    treasury (whence the Greek and Latin Gaza). We seem to have positive evidence of
                    the existence of the city before the Mahometan times (644) in the travels of the
                    Chinese pilgrim, Hwen Thsang, who speaks of Ho-si-na C.c., probably Ghazna) as
                    one of the capitals of Tsaukuta or Arachosia, a place of great strength. In
                    early Mahometan times the country adjoining Ghazni was called Zdbul. When the
                    Mahometans first invaded that region Ghazni was a wealthy entrepôt of the Indian
                    trade. Of the extent of this trade some idea is given by Ibn Haukal, who states
                    that at Cabul, then a mart of the same trade, there was sold yearly indigo to
                    the value of two million dinars (£1,000,000). The enterprise of Islam underwent
                    several ebbs and flows over this region. The provinces on the Helmand and about
                    Ghazni were invaded as early as the caliphate of Moâwia (662-680). The arms of
                    Ya’kûb Leis swept over Cabul and Arachosia (Al-Rukhaj) about 871, and the people
                    of the latter country were forcibly converted. Though the Hindu dynasty of Cabul
                    held a part of the valley of Cabul river till the time of Mahmùd, it is probably
                    to the period just mentioned that we must refer the permanent Mahometan
                    occupation of Ghazni. Indeed, the building of the fort and city is ascribed by a
                    Mahometan historian to ’Amrù Leis, the brother and successor of Ya’kub (d. 901),
                    though the facts already stated discredit this. In the latter part of the 9th
                    century the family of the Samani, sprung from Samarkand, reigned in splendour at
                    Bokhara. Alptigin, originally a Turkish slave, and high in the service of the
                    dynasty, about the middle of the 10th century, losing the favour of the court,
                    wrested Ghazni from its chief (who is styled Abιi Bakr Lawik, wali of Ghazni),
                    and established himself there. His government was recognized from Bokhara, and
                    held till his death. In 977 another Turk slave, Sabuktigin, who had married the
                    daughter of his master Alptigin, obtained rule in Ghazni. He made himself lord
                    of nearly all the present territory of Afghanistan and of the Punjab. In 997
                    Mahmûd, son of Sabuktigin, succeeded to the government, and with his name Ghazni
                    and the Ghaznevid dynasty have become perpetually associated. Issuing forth year
                    after year from that capital, Mahmûd carried fully seventeen expeditions of
                    devastation through northern India and Guzerat, as well as others to the north
                    and west. From the borders of Kurdistan to Samarkand, from the Caspian to the
                    Ganges, his authority was acknowledged. The wealth brought back to Ghazni was
                    enormous, and contemporary historians give glowing descriptions of the
                    magnificence of the capital, as well as of the conqueror’s munificent support of
                    literature. Mahmûd died in 1030, and some fourteen kings of his house came after
                    him; but though there was some revival of importance under Ibrahim (1059-1099),
                    the empire never reached anything like the same splendour and power. It was
                    overshadowed by the Seljuks of Persia, and by the rising rivalry of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ghur</hi> (q. υ. ), the hostility of which it had repeatedly
                    provoked. Bahram Shah (1118-1152), put to death Kutbuddin, one of the princes of
                    Ghur, called king of the Jibâl or Hill country, who had withdrawn to Ghazni.
                    This prince’s brother, Saifuddin Sûri, came to take vengeance, and drove out
                    Bahram. But the latter recapturing the place (1149) paraded Saifuddin and his
                    vizier ignominiously about the city, and then hanged them on the bridge.
                    Ala-uddin of Ghûr, younger brother of the two slain princes, then gathered a
                    great host, and came against Bahram, who met him on the Helmand. The Ghûri
                    prince, after repeated victories, stormed Ghazni, and gave it over to fire and
                    sword. The dead kings of the house of Mahmud, except the conqueror himself and
                    two others, were torn from their graves and burnt, whilst the bodies of the
                    princes of Ghûr were solemnly disinterred and carried to the distant tombs of
                    their ancestors. It seems certain that Ghazni never recovered the splendour that
                    perished then (1152). Alâ-uddin, who from this deed became known in history as
                    Jahàn-soz (Brûle-rnonde), returned to Ghûr, and Bahram reoccupied Ghazni; he
                    died in 1157. In the time of his son Khusnι Shah, Ghazni was taken by the
                    Turkish tribes called Ghuzz (generally believed to have been what are now called
                    Turkomans). The king fled to Lahore, and the dynasty ended with his son. In 1173
                    the Ghuzz were expelled by Ghiyassuddin Sultan of Ghûr (nephew of Ala-uddin
                    Jahânsôz), who made Ghazni over to his brother Muizuddin. This famous prince
                    whom the later historians call, it is not clear why, Shahab-uddin Ghûri, shortly
                    afterwards (1174-5) invaded India, taking Multan and Uchh. This was the first of
                    many successive inroads on western and northern India, in one of which Lahore
                    was wrested from Khusrû Malik, the last of Mahmud’s house, who died a captive in
                    the hills of Ghûr. In 1192 Prithvi Rai or Pithora (as the Moslem writers call
                    him) the Chohan king of Ajmir, being defeated and slain near Thanesar, the whole
                    country from the Himalaya to Ajmir became subject to the Ghûri king of Ghazni.
                    On the death of his brother Ghiyassuddin, with whose power he had been
                    constantly associated, and of whose conquests he had been the chief instrument,
                    Muizuddin became sole sovereign over Ghûr and Ghazni, and the latter place was
                    then again for a brief period the seat of an empire nearly as extensive as that
                    of Mahmûd the son of Sabuktigin. Muizuddin crossed the Indus once more to put
                    down a rebellion of the Khokars in the Punjab, and on his way back was murdered
                    by a band of them, or, as some say, by one of the Muldhidah or Assassins. The
                    slave lieutenants of Muizuddin carried on the conquest of India, and as the
                    rapidly succeeding events broke their dependence on any master, they established
                    at Delhi that monarchy of which, after it had endured through many dynasties,
                    and had culminated with the Moghul house of Baber, the shadow perished in 1857.
                    The death of Muizuddin was followed by struggle and anarchy, ending for a time
                    in the annexation of Ghazni to the empire of Khwarazm by Mahommed Shah, who
                    conferred it on his famous son, Jalâluddin, and Ghazni became the headquarters
                    of the latter. After Jenghiz Khan had extinguished the power of his family in
                    Turkestan, Jalâluddin defeated the army sent against him by the Mongol at
                    Parwân, north of Cabul. Jenghiz then advanced and drove Jalaluddin across the
                    Indus, after which he sent Okkodai his son to besiege Ghazni. Henceforward
                    Ghazni is much less prominent in Asiatic history. It continued subject to the
                    Mongols, sometimes to the house of Hulakû in Persia, and sometimes to that of
                    Chaghatai in Turkestan. In 1326, after a battle between Amir Husain, the viceroy
                    of the former house in Khorasan, and Tarmashirin, the reigning khan of
                    Chaghatai, the former entered Ghazni and once more subjected it to devastation,
                    and this time the tomb of Mahmûd to desecration. The statement in a recent book
                    on Afghanistan, that a new Ghori dynasty reigned at Ghazni from 1336 to 1383, is
                    erroneous.</p>
                <p>Ibn Batuta (c. 1332) says the greater part of the city was in ruins, and only a
                    small part continued to be a town. Timur seems never to have visited Ghazni, but
                    we find him in 1401 bestowing the government of Cabul, Kandahar, and Ghazni on
                    Pir Mahommed, the son of his son Jahangir. In the end of the century it was
                    still in the hands of a descendant of Timur, Ulugh Beg Mirza, who was king of
                    Cabul and Ghazni. The illustrious nephew of this prince, Baber, got peaceful
                    possession of both cities in 1504, and has left notes on both in his own
                    inimitable Memoirs. His account of Ghazni indicates how far it had now fallen.
                    “It is,” he says, “but a poor mean place, and I have always wondered how its
                    princes, who possessed also Hindustan and Khorasan could have chosen such a
                    wretched country for the seat of their government, in preference to Khorasan.”
                    He commends the fruit of its gardens, which still contribute largely to the
                    markets of Cabul. Ghazni remained in the hand.·» of Baber’s descendants,
                    reigning at Delhi and Agra, till the invas ’ 'on of Nadir Shah (1738), and
                    became after Nadir’s death a part of the new kingdom of the Afghans under Ahmed
                    Shah Durrani. We know of but two modem travellers who have recorded visits to
                    the place previous to the war of 1839. George Forster passed as a disguised
                    traveller with a kafila in 1783. “Its slender existence,” he says, “is now
                    main·</p>

                <p>tained by some Hindu families, who support a small traffic, and supply the wants
                    of the few Mahometan residents.” Mr Vigne visited it in 1836, having reached it
                    from Multan with a caravan of Lohâni merchants, travelling by the Gomal pass.
                    The historical name of Ghazni was brought back from the dead, as it were, by the
                    news of its capture by the British army under Sir John Keane, 23d July 1839. The
                    siege artillery had been left behind at Kandahar; escalade was judged
                    impracticable; but the project of the commanding engineer, Captain George
                    Thomson, for blowing in the Cabul ga‰ with powder in bags, was adopted, and
                    carried out successfully, at the cost of 182 killed and wounded. Two years and a
                    half later, the Afghan outbreak against the British occupation found Ghazni
                    garrisoned by a Bengal regiment of sepoys but neither repaired nor provisioned.
                    They held out under great hardships from 16th December 1841 to 6th March 1842,
                    when they surrendered. In the autumn of the same year General Nott, advancing
                    from Kandahar upon Cabul, reoccupied Ghazni, destroyed the defences of the
                    castle and part of the town, and carried away the famous gates. Since then
                    Ghazni has not been entered by any Englishman; for when Colonel Lumsden’s
                    mission passed this way in 1857 they were not allowed to approach the place.</p>
