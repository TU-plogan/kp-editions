                <p><label type="entry">GENEVA CONVENTION</label>, an agreement concluded at an
                    international conference which was held at Geneva in 1864, under the presidency
                    of General Dufour the Swiss plenipotentiary, for the purpose of ameliorating the
                    condition of the sick and wounded in time of war. The credit of originating this
                    conference must be given to two citizens cf Geneva, Dunant, a physician, who
                    published a startling account of what he had seen in two military hospitals on
                    the field of Solferino, and his friend Moynier, chairman of the Geneva society
                    of public utility, who took up the idea of “neutralizing the sick waggons,”
                    formed associations for its agitation, and at length pressed it upon the
                    Governments of Europe, most of which sent representatives to the conference. The
                    convention was drawn up and signed by them on the 22d August, and since then it
                    has received the adherence of every European power, and one Asiatic (viz.,
                    Persia). The convention consists of ten articles, of which the last two are
                    formal.</p>
                <p>The others provide (1) for the neutrality of ambulances and military hospitals as
                    long as they contain any sick; (2) for that of their stafΓ; (3) that the
                    neutrality of these persons shall continue after occupation of their hospitals
                    by the enemy, so that they may stay or depart, as they choose; (4) that if they
                    depart, they can lake only their private property with them, except in case of
                    ambulances, which they may remove entire; (5) that a sick soldier in a house
                    shall be counted a protection to it, and entitle its occupant to exemption from
                    the quartering of troops and from part of the war requisitions; (6) that wounded
                    men shall, when cured, be sent back to their own country on condition of not
                    bearing arms during the rest of the war; (7) that hospitals and ambulances shall
                    carry, in addition to the flag of their nation, a distinctive and uniform flag
                    bearing a red cross on a white ground, and that their staff shall wear an
                    arm-badge of the same colours; (8) that the details shall be left to the
                    commanders.</p>
                <p>A second conference was held at Geneva on the same subject in 1868, and a
                    supplementary convention drawn out, which, though not formally signed, has been
                    acquiesced in by all the signatories of the original convention, except the
                    pape, and which, while still unratified, was adopted provisionally by France and
                    Germany in their war of 1870. It consists partly of interpretations of the
                    former conven tion, and partly of an application of its principles to maritime
                    wars. Its main provisions are these :—</p>
                <p>That, when a person engaged in an ambulance or hospital occupied by the enemy
                    desires to depart, the commander-in-chief shall fix the time for his departure,
                    and, when he desires to remain, that he be paid his full salary; that account
                    shall be taken in exacting war requisitions not only of actual lodging of
                    wounded men but of any display of charity towards them; that the rule which
                    permits cured soldiers to return home on condition of not serving again shall
                    not apply to officers, for their knowledge might be useful; that hospital ships,
                    merchantmen with wounded on board, and boats picking up wounded and wrecked men,
                    shall be neutral; that they shall carry the red-cross flag and their men the
                    red-cross armlet; that hospital ships belonging to Government shall be painted
                    white with a green strake, those of aid societies white with a red strake; that
                    in naval wars any strong presumption that the convention is being abused by one
                    of the belligerents shall give the other the right of suspending it towards that
                    power till the contrary is proved, and, if the presumption becomes a certainty,
                    of suspending it to the end of the war.</p>
