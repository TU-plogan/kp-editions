                    (1811-1872), was born at Tarbes in the year 1811. He was educated at the grammar
                    school of that town, and afterwards at the Collège Charlemagne in Paris, where
                    it does not appear that he particularly distinguished himself, though in later
                    life his remarkable literary faculty and instinct enabled him to give to much of
                    his work an air of scholarship and almost of erudition. He very early devoted
                    himself to the study of the older French literature, especially that of the 16th
                    and the early part of the 17th century. This study qualified him well to take
                    part in the romantic movement, and enabled him to astonish Sainte-Beuve by the
                    phraseology and style of some literary essays which, when barely eighteen years
                    old, he put into the great critic’s hands. In consequence of this introduction
                    he at once came under the influence of the great romantic <hi rend="italic"
                    >cénacle,</hi> to which, as to Victor Hugo in particular, he was also introduced
                    by his gifted but ill-starred schoolmate Gérard de Nerval. With Gérard, Petrus
                    Borel, Corot, and many other less known painters and poets whose personalities
                    he has delightfully sketched in the articles latterly collected under the titles
                    of <hi rend="italic">Histoire du Romantisme,</hi> &amp;c., he formed a minor
                    romantic clique who were distinguished for a time by the most extravagant
                    eccentricity. A flaming crimson waistcoat and a great mass of waving hair were
                    the outward signs which qualified Gautier for a chief rank among the
                    enthusiastic devotees who attended the rehearsals of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hernani</hi> with red tickets marked “Hierro,” performed mocking dances round
                    the bust of Racine, and were at all times ready to exchange word or blow with
                    the <hi rend="italic">perruques</hi> and <hi rend="italic">grisâtres</hi> of the
                    classical party. In Gautier’s case, however, whatever they might be in others,
                    these freaks were not inconsistent with real genius and real devotion to sound
                    ideals of literature. He began (like Thackeray, to whom he presents in other
                    ways some striking points of resemblance) as an artist, but soon found that his
                    true powers lay in another direction. His first considerable poem, <hi
                    rend="italic">Albertus</hi> (1830), displayed a good deal of the extravagant
                    character which accompanied rather than marked the movement, but also gave
                    evidence of uncommon command both of language and imagery, and iu particular of
                    a descriptive power hardly to be excelled. The promise thus given was more than
                    fulfilled in his subsequent poetry, which, in consequence of its small bulk, may
                    well be noticed at once and by anticipation. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comédie</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Mort,</hi> which appeared soon after
                    (1832), is one of the most remarkable of French poems, and though never widely
                    read has received the suffrage of every competent reader. Minor poems of various
                    dates, published in 1840, display an almost unequalled command over poetical
                    form, an advance even over <hi rend="italic">Albertus</hi> in vigour, wealth,
                    and appropriateness of diction, and abundance of the special poetical essence
                    which is so often absent in the most finished poetical work. All these good
                    gifts reached their climax in theZrøziwa; <hi rend="italic">et Camées,</hi>
                    first published in 1856, and again, with additions, just before the poet’s death
                    in 1872. These poems are in their own way such as cannot be surpassed. Gautier’s
                    poetical work contains in little an expression of his literary peculiarities.
                    There are, in addition to the peculiarities of style and diction already
                    noticed, an extraordinary feeling and affection for beauty in art and nature,
                    and a strange indifference to anything beyond this range— an indifference nearly
                    absolute, and which has doubtless injured the popularity of his work to almost
                    as great a degree as that in which it has increased its special excellence and
                    its charm to those who have a taste for it.</p>
                <p>But it was not, after all, as a poet that Gautier was to achieve either profit or
                    fame. Thrown as he was into circles which were nothing if not literary, it was
                    natural that he should attempt all literary forms, and certain, considering his
                    powers, that he should be successful in all. For the theatre, however, he had
                    but little gift, and his dramatic efforts (if we except certain masques or
                    ballets in which his exuberant and graceful fancy came into play) are by far his
                    weakest. For a time he acted as secretary to Balzac, but found this occupation
                    uncongenial enough, though it left some traces in his independent work. His
                    first novel of any size, and in many respects his most remarkable work, was <hi
                    rend="italic">Mademoiselle de Maupin</hi> (1835). Unfortunately this book, while
                    it establishes his literary reputation on an imperishable basis, was unfitted by
                    its subject, and in parts by its treatment, for general perusal, and created
                    even in France a prejudice against its author which he was very far from really
                    deserving. During the years from 1833 onwards, his fertility in novels and tales
                    was very great, <hi rend="italic">Les Jeune France</hi> (1833), which may rank
                    as a sort of prose <hi rend="italic">Albertus</hi> in some ways, displays the
                    follies of the youthful romantics in a vein of humorous and at the same time
                    half-pathetic satire. <hi rend="italic">Fortunio</hi> (1838) perhaps belongs to
                    the same class. <hi rend="italic">Jettatura,</hi> written somewhat later, is
                    less extravagant and more pathetic. A crowd of minor tales display the highest
                    literary qualities, and rank with Mérimée’s at the head of all contemporary
                    works of the class. First of all must be mentioned the ghost story of <hi
                    rend="italic">La Morte Amoureuse,</hi> a gem of the most perfect workmanship.
                    For many years Gautier continued to write novels. <hi rend="italic">La Belle
                    Jenny</hi> (1864) is a not very successful attempt to draw on his English
                    experience, but the earlier <hi rend="italic">Militona</hi> (1847) is a most
                    charming picture of Spanish life. In <hi rend="italic">Spiιite</hi> (1866) he
                    endeavoured to enlist the fancy of the day for supernatural manifestations, and
                    a <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Momie</hi> (1856) is a
                    learned study of ancient Egyptian ways. His most remarkable effort in this kind,
                    towards the end of his life was <hi rend="italic">Le Capitaine Fracasse</hi>
                    (1863), a novel of the school of Dumas projected nearly thirty years before.
                    This book contains some of the finest instances of his literary power.</p>
                <p>It was, however, neither in poems nor in novels that the main occupation of
                    Gautier as a literary man consisted. He was early drawn to the more lucrative
                    task of feuilleton writiug, and for more than thirty years he was among the most
                    expert and successful practitioners of this art. Soon after the publication of
                    <hi rend="italic">Mademoiselle de Maupin,</hi> in which he had not been too
                    polite to journalism, he became irrevocably a journalist. The rest of his life
                    was spent either <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0127-0118"/> in Paris or in travels of considerable extent to
                    Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, England, Algeria, and Russia, all
                    undertaken with a more or less definite purpose of book making. Having
                    absolutely no political opinions, lie had no difficulty in accepting the second
                    empire, and received from it considerable favours, in return for which, however,
                    he in no way prostituted his pen, but remained a literary man pure and simple.
                    He died in October 1872. Accounts of his travels, criticisms of the theatrical
                    and literary works of the day, obituary notices of his contemporaries, and above
                    all art criticism, occupied him in turn. In the last department he has never had
                    a superior, nor perhaps, except in the cases of Diderot and a great living
                    English critic, an equal. It has sometimes been deplored that this engagement in
                    journalism should have diverted Gautier from the performance of more capital
                    work in literature. Perhaps, however, this regret springs from a certain
                    misconception. Gautier’s power was literary power pure and simple, and it is as
                    evident in his slightest sketches aud criticisms as in <hi rend="italic">Émaux
                    et Camées</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi><hi rend="italic">La Morte
                    Amoureuse.</hi> On the other hand, his weakness, if he had a weakness, lay in
                    his almost total indifference to the matters which usually supply subjects for
                    art and therefore for literature. He was neither immoral, irreligious, nor
                    unduly subservient to despotism, but morals, religion, and politics (to which we
                    may add science and material progress) were matters of no interest to him. He
                    was to all intents a humanist, as the word was understood in the 15th century.
                    But he was a humorist as well, and this combination, joined to his singularly
                    kindly and genial nature, saved him from some dangers and depravations as well
                    as some absurdities to which the humanist temper is exposed. As time goes on it
                    may be predicted that, though Gautier may not be widely read, yet his writings
                    will never cease to be full of indescribable charm and of very definite
                    instruction to men of letters. Besides tho≡e of his works which have been
                    already cited, we may notice <hi rend="italic">Une larme</hi><hi rend="italic"
