                <p><label type="entry">GAMES, GAMING</label>. Looking here at these in their legal
                    aspects, it will be seen that from very early times the law of England has
                    attempted to exercise some control over the sports and pastimes of the
                    people—particularly those involving an element of gambling. Certain games were
                    either prohibited altogether, or reserved for people of some position in
                    society. The Act 33 Henry VIII. c. 9, increasing the severity of still older
                    enactments, deals with the whole subject in great detail, and it is interesting
                    to notice that the reason assigned for prohibiting unlawful games was that they
                    interfered with other exercises more useful to the state. The Act is entitled a
                    “Bill for the maintaining artillery and the debarring unlawful games ;” and it
                    recites that, since the last statutes, “crafty persons have invented many and
                    sundry new and crafty games and plays, as loggetting in the fields,
                    slide-thrift, otherwise called shove-groat, as well within the city of London as
                    elsewhere in many other and divers parts of this realm, keeping houses, plays,
                    and alleys for the maintenance thereof, by reason whereof archery is sore
                    decayed, and daily is like to be more and more minished, and divers bowyers and
                    fletchers, for lack of work, gone and inhabit themselves in Scotland and other
                    places out of this realm, there working and teaching their science, to the
                    pursuance of the same, to the great comfort of estrangers and detriment of this
                    realm.” Accordingly penalties are declared against all persons keeping houses
                    for unlawful games, and all persons resorting thereto. It is further provided
                    that “no manner of artificer or craftsman of any handicraft or occupation,
                    husbandman, apprentice labourer, servant at husbandry, journeyman or servant of
                    artificer, mariners, fishermen, watermen, or any serving man, shall play at the
                    tables, tennis, dice, cards, bowls, clash, coyting, loggetting, or any other
                    unlawful game out of Christmas under the pain of xxs. to be forfeit for every
                    time: and in Christmas to play at any of the said games in their masters’ houses
                    or in their masters’ presence; and also that no manner of person shall at any
                    time play at any bowl or bowls in open places out of his garden or orchard” (§
                    16). The social evils of gambling (impoverishment, crime, neglect of divine
                    service) are incidentally alluded to in the preamble, but only in connexion with
                    the main purpose of the statute—the maintenance of archery. Blackstone,
                    commenting on this and subsequent statutes, declares that “the principal ground
                    of modern complaint is the gambling in high life” (vol. iv. c. 13), and he cites
                    the various statutes which, up to his time, had been passed against this
                    pernicious vice. Some of these went so far as to make the mere winning or losing
                    of money at play a criminal offence. By the Act 18 Geo. II. c. 34 (repealed by 8
                    and 9 Vict. c. 109), if any man be convicted upon information or indictment of
                    winning or losing at play or by betting at any one time £10 or £20 within 24
                    hours, he shall be fined five times the sum for the benefit of the poor of the
                    parish. And the evil of gambling, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> betting or
                    wagering, is the ostensible object against which the later statutes on gaming
                    are directed. A bet or wager was, however, at common law as valid as any other
                    kind of contract, and the distinction between bets depending on gaming and bets
                    depending on other contingencies was long retained, and has, in fact, not yet
                    entirely disappeared. Besides the Act last mentioned, the Acts 9 Anne c. 14, 2
                    Geo. II. c. 28, and 13 Geo. II. c. 34 prohibited particular games.</p>
                <p>The modern statutes are the following—8 and 9 Vict. c. 109, 16 and 17 Vict. c.
                    119, and 17 and 18 Vict. c. 38.</p>
                <p>The 8 and 9 Vict. c. 109 (Act to amend the law relating to games and wagers)
                    repeals, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> so much of the old law of Henry
                    VIII. as makes it unlawful to play at any mere games of skill. And it provides
                    that, to prove any house to be a common gaming-house, it “shall be sufficient to
                    show that it is kept or used for playing therein at any unlawful game, and that
                    a bank is kept there by one or more of the players exclusively of the others, or
                    that the chances of any game played therein are not alike favourable to all the
                    players, including among the players the banker or other person by whom the game
                    is managed, or against whom the other players stake, play, or bet.” Gambling, it
                    will be noticed, is still in this definition connected with some kind of game;
                    the later Act, 16 and 17 Viet c. 119 (for the suppression of betting-houses),
                    enacts that any house used for the purpose of “betting with persons resorting
                    thereto” shall be deemed to be a common gaminghouse. To return to the former
                    Act, it provides that proof that the gaming was for money shall not be required,
                    and that the presence of cards, dice, and other instruments of gaming shall be
                    <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> evidence that the house
                    was used as a common gaming-house. The keeping of houses for the game of
                    billiards is to be authorized under licence from the justices to be granted at
                    the general licensing sessions, and the conditions are in general the same as to
                    time of opening, &lt;fcc., as those of the victuallers’ licences. Any persons
                    winning money by cheating at any game or wager shall be deemed guilty of
                    obtaining money by false pretences. The 16 and 17 Vict. c. 119, besides bringing
                    betting-houses within the statutory definition of gaminghouses, makes it a
                    specific offence to publish advertisements, handbills, placards, &amp;c.,
                    showing that any house is kept or opened for the purpose of betting. With
                    reference to the definition of betting-house in this statute, “a place opened,
                    kept, or used for the purpose of <hi rend="italic">the owner, occupier,
                    &lt;jec., thereof,</hi> betting with persons resorting thereto,” it may be
                    mentioned that it was avowedly framed for the purpose of hitting houses open to
                    all and sundry, as distinguished from large but legally private betting-clubs
                    like Tattersail’s. The reason for this distinction, of course, is that the
                    former are frequented mainly by a poorer class of persons, who cannot afford the
                    luxury of gambling, and will be tempted by their losses to defraud their
                    employers. The Act of 17 and 18 Viet, gives additional facilities for enforcing
                    the preceding Acts, and increases the severity of the penalties. The keeper of a
                    gaming-house may be fined up to £50 and costs, and on default of payment may be
                    sent to gaol for twelve <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0076-0067"/> months. Finally, the Vagrant Act, 1873 (36 and 37
                    Vict. c. 38), contains the following clause: “Every person playing or betting by
                    way of wagering or gaming on any street, road, highway, or other open and public
                    place, or in any open place to which the public have, or are permitted to have,
                    access, at or with any table or instrument of gaming, or any coin, card, token,
                    or other article used as an instrument or means of gaming, at any game or
                    pretended game of chance, shall be deemed a rogue and vagabond.” The original
                    Act of 1868, of which this is an amendment, was passed to repress the practice
                    of playing pitch and toss in the streets, which, it seems, had grown to the
                    dimensions of a nuisance in the colliery districts.</p>
                <p>The general result of all these enactments may be briefly stated thus. Apart from
                    statute, no games are unlawful in themselves. Games were originally made
                    unlawful in the interest of the more useful military exercises which they
                    threatened to supplant. The prohibition has been retained and extended on
                    account of the vice of gambling, and severe penalties have been enacted against
                    houses at which persons can play unlawful games. Betting-houses in general were
                    brought within the definition of gaming-houses, and finally betting or gaming
                    was prohibited in any public place. It must be admitted that these distinctions
                    are based on a most invidious principle. Practically gambling is forbidden to
                    the poor and connived at in the rich.</p>
                <p>It may be asked, What games, as such, are lawful under these various statutes,
                    and what are unlawful <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi> The author of an excellent and
                    amusing little work on <hi rend="italic">Gaming and Gamesters' Law</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By F. Brandt, London,
                    1872.</p></note><hi rend="italic">f</hi> gives the following as the result of a
                    careful examination of all the Acts. The following are lawful games
                    :—backgammon, bagatelle, billiards, boat-races, bowls, chess, cricket, croquet,
                    curling, dominoes, draughts, fives, football, foot-races, golf, knurr and spell,
                    putting the stone, quoits, rackets, rowing, skittles, tennis, whist, wrestling.
                    The following are doubtful—boxing, cudgel-playing, and single-stick. The
                    following are absolutely unlawful— ace of hearts, basset, dice (except
                    backgammon), hazard, lotteries (except art-union lotteries), Pharaoh (or faro),
                    boulet (or roly poly). An Act of Geo. II., which prohibited horse-racing for
                    prizes under .£50 value, has since been repealed.</p>
                <p>To turn now to the civil aspects of the case. Gambling apart from gaming, i.e.,
                    simple wagering or betting, was notat common law illegal, and the Act of Anne
                    did not affect wagers other than gaming wagers. In fact, the courts were
                    constantly being called upon to enforce contracts by way of wagers, and were as
                    constantly exercising their ingenuity to discover excuses for ref using. A
                    writer on the law of contracts<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>F. Pollock, <hi rend="italic">Principles of the Law of
                    Contract.</hi></p></note> discovers here the origin of that principle of “public
                    policy” which plays so important a part in English law. Wagering contracts were
                    rejected because the contingencies on which they depended tended to create
                    interests hostile to the common weal. A bet on the life of the emperor Napoleon
                    was declared void because it gave one of the parties an interest in keeping the
                    king’s enemy alive, and also because it gave the other au interest in compassing
                    his death by unlawful means. A bet as to the amount of the hop-duty was against
                    public policy, because it tended to expose the condition of the king’s revenue
                    to all the world. A bet between two hackney coachmen, as to which of them should
                    be selected by a gentleman for a particular journey, was void, because it tended
                    to expose the customer to their importunities. When no such subtlety could be
                    invented, the law, however reluctantly, was compelled to enforce the fulfilment
                    of a wager. Now, however, by the Act 8 and 9 Vict. c. 109, cited <hi
                    rend="italic">supra,</hi> all agreements by way of wager are void, and money
                    lost on them cannot be recovered by action at lav/. There still remains, as
                    hinted above, a distinction between gaming and other wagers. The 5 and 6 Will.
                    IV. c. 41 treats securities <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> promissory notes)
                    given for money lost at gaming as being given for an illegal consideration;
                    under the 8 and 9 Vict. c. 109, securities given for betting are held to be
                    given for a <hi rend="italic">void,</hi> or for no consideration. Thus a third
                    person, coming into possession of a note given for a bet, would have to prove
                    that he gave value for it if the bet was a gaming bet under the statute of Anne;
                    if it was not a gaming bet, he would be presumed to have given consideration for
                    it until it was actually proved that he had not.</p>
                <p>The 8 and 9 Vict. c. 109 exempts all subscriptions, or contributions, or
                    agreements to subscribe or contribute towards any plate, prize, or sum of money
                    to be awarded to the winner of any lawful game. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.</hi><hi
