                <p><label type="entry">GELATIN</label>. When intercellular connective tissue, as met
                    with in skin, tendons, ligaments, and the fasciae of the muscles, of which it
                    forms the basis, is treated with water, preferably hot, or in presence of dilute
                    acids, for some time, a solution is obtained which in cooling solidifies to a
                    jelly. The dissolved substance bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Gelatin</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Glutin.</hi></p>
                <p>The same substance is obtained when the matrix of bones is submitted to similar
                    treatment, after previous removal of the lime salts by means of mineral acids.
                    Again, when unossified cartilage, as for instance the bone-cartilages of the
                    vertebrate foetus, is treated with water or dilute acids, a solution is obtained
                    which also gelatinizes on cooling. The coagulation in this case, however, is
                    due, not to gelatin, but to a closely allied substance called chondrin. At one
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n140/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0910-0140-0131"/> time it was supposed that in each of these three
                    cases the gelatinising materials obtained were formed by the hydration or by a
                    physical metamorphosis of a different substance pre-existing in the respective
                    tissues, to which the names <hi rend="italic">collagen, ossein,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">chondrogen</hi> were given respectively— the two former yielding
                    gelatin, and the last chondrin.</p>
                <p>Further experiments have made it more probable that gelatin and chondrin do not
                    differ essentially from their parent tissues, analyses of tendons and of gelatin
                    or isinglass (a very fine form of gelatin obtainable from the sturgeon) agreeing
                    within the range of experimental error. At the same time, as Foster observes in
                    the case of chondrin, the fact that its extraction from cartilage requires an
                    amount of boiling with water, much more than would be necessary to dissolve the
                    same amount of dried product, points rather the other way. Most probably the
                    change which occurs is of a purely physical character.</p>
                <p>True gelatigenous tissue occurs in all mature vertebrates, with the single
                    exception, according to Hoppe-Seyler, of that in other respects anomalous
                    vertebrate, <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus lanceolatus.</hi> In the embryo it does
                    not appear till late in foetal life, chondrin being found instead; and the
                    change which brings gelatin into the place of chondrin is effected, not by a
                    metamorphosis of the latter, but by its removal, and the independent formation
                    of gelatin. The tissue in question was believed to be peculiar to <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> until Hoppe-Seyler discovered it in the bodies of
                    <hi rend="italic">Octopus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sepiola.</hi> By boiling
                    these cephalopods with water he obtained large quantities of gelatin free from
                    chondrin, but in an extension of his experiments to other invertebrates, as
                    cockchafers and <hi rend="italic">Aηodon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Uηio,</hi>
                    no such tissue could be detected. Gelatin, as such, is not met with in any of
                    the normal fluids of the body, but occurs in the blood in cases of <hi
                    rend="italic">leukhoemia.</hi></p>
                <p>Various qualities of impure gelatin are prepared on the large scale by boiling up
                    the hides of oxen, skins of calves, and spongy parts of horns; from any of the
                    crude gelatins the pure substance may be obtained by bleaching with sulphurous
                    acid and steeping repeatedly in warm water, wheu in the state of soft jelly.</p>
                <p>Pure gelatin is an amorphous, brittle, nearly transparent substance, faintly
                    yellow, tasteless, and inodorous, neutral to vegetable colours, and unaltered by
                    exposure to dry air. Submitted to analysis it exhibits an elementary composition
                    agreeing closely with that of chondrin, containing in round numbers C 50, H 7, N
                    18, O + S 24 per cent.; whilst chondrin contains about 3 per cent, less nitrogen
                    and more oxygen.</p>
                <p>Nothing is known with any certainty as to its chemical constitution, or of the
                    mode in which it is formed from albuminoids. Besides a similarity in elementary
                    constituents, it exhibits in a general way a connexion with that large and
                    important class of animal substances called <hi rend="italic">proteids,</hi>
                    being, like them, amorphous, soluble in acids and alkalies, and giving in
                    solution a left-handed rotation of the plane of polarization. Nevertheless, the
                    ordinary well-recognized reactions for proteids are but faintly observed in the
                    case of gelatin, and the only substances which at once and freely precipitate it
                    from solution are corrosive sublimate, strong alcohol, and tannic acid.</p>
                <p>According to Wanklyn, gelatin is distinctly differentiated from such substances
                    as <hi rend="italic">casein</hi> and <hi rend="italic">albumin</hi> by a marked
                    difference in behaviour when treated successively with boiling potash and
                    alkaline permanganate. All nitrogenous organic substances yield large quantities
                    of ammonia when decomposed by boiling with these solutions; but whereas
                    albuminoids give up their ammonia at two successive stages, one of which is
                    achieved by the action of potash alone, the other on the subsequent addition of
                    permanganate, gelatin yields the same amount after the action of permanganate
                    alone, as the total obtainable by the successive actions of the two reagents.
                    Now, as there appear to be good grounds for believing the molecule of
                    albuminoids to contain one or more urea-residues, and as urea, and presumably
                    therefore a urea-residue, would yield its ammonia to potash alone, Wanklyn
                    concludes that gelatin differs in constitution from albuminoids by containing no
                    urea. On the other hand, as Foster observes, the behaviour of gelatin as a food
                    (see below), in diminishing the amount of fat used by an animal fed partly on
                    it, as well as the quantity of nitrogen abstracted from other sources, is
                    readily intelligible on the hypothesis that it splits into a urea and a fat
                    moiety.</p>
                <p>Although gelatin in a dry state is unalterable by exposure to air, its solution
                    exhibits, like all the proteids, a remarkable tendency to putrefaction; but a
                    characteristic feature of this process in the case of gelatin is that the
                    solution assumes a transient acid reaction. The ultimate products of this
                    decomposition are the same as are produced by prolonged boiling with acid (see
                    below). It has been found that oxalic acid, over and above the action common to
                    all dilute acids of preventing the solidification of gelatin solutions, has the
                    further property of preventing in a large measure this tendency to putrefy when
                    the gelatin is treated with hot solutions of this acid, and then freed from
                    adhering acid by means of carbonate of lime. Gelatin so treated has been called
                    <hi rend="italic">metagelatin.</hi></p>
                <p>Strange to say, in spite of the marked tendency of gelatin solutions to develop
                    ferment-organisms, and undergo putrefaction, the stability of the substance in
                    the dry state is such that it has even been used, and with some success, as a
                    means of preserving perishable foods. The process, invented by Dr Campbell
                    Morfit, consists in impregnating the foods with gelatin, and then drying them
                    till about 10 per cent, or less of water is present. Milk gelatinized in this
                    way is superior in several respects to the products of the ordinary condensation
                    process, more especially in the retention of a much larger proportion of
                    albuminoids.</p>
                <p>Gelatin has a marked affinity for water, abstracting it from admixture with
                    alcohol, for example. Solid gelatin steeped for some hours in water absorbs a
                    certain amount and swells up, in which condition a gentle heat, as that of the
                    water-bath, serves to convert it into a liquid; or this may be readily produced
                    by the addition of a trace of alkali or mineral acid, or by strong acetic acid.
                    In the last case, however, or if we use the mineral acids in a more concentrated
                    form, the solution obtained has lost its power of solidifying, though not that
                    of acting as a glue. By prolonged boiling of strong aqueous solutions at a high,
                    or of weak solutions at a lower temperature, the characteristic properties of
                    gelatin are impaired and ultimately destroyed. After this treatment it acts less
                    powerfully as a glue, loses its tendency to solidify, and becomes increasingly
                    soluble in cold water; nevertheless the solutions yield on precipitation with
                    alcohol a substance identical in composition with gelatin.</p>
                <p>By prolonged boiling in contact with hydrolytic agents, such as sulphuric acid or
                    caustic alkali, it yields quantities of <hi rend="italic">leucin</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">glycocoll</hi> (so-called “sugar of gelatin,” this being the
                    method by which glycocoll was first prepared), but no <hi rend="italic"
                    >tyrosin.</hi> In this last respect it agrees with its near allies, chondrin and
                    elastin, and differs from the great body of proteids, the characteristic solid
                    products of the decomposition of which are leuciu and tyrosin. At the same time
                    the formation of glycocoll differentiates it from chondrin, from which,
                    moreover, it can be readily distinguished by its non-precipitability by acetate
                    of lead.</p>
                <p>When it is mixed with copper sulphate a bright green liquid is formed, from which
                    the copper cannot be thrown down free of organic matter. Addition of potash to
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n141/mode/1up"

                    violet, which by boiling is further transformed into a pale red, but without any
                    precipitation of hydrate. Hence the inapplicability of Trommer’s sugar test in
                    presence of gelatin, the cuprous oxide being soluble in gelatin solutions.</p>
                <p>Treated with strong oxidizing agents, such as a mixture of sulphuric acid and
                    bichromate of potash, or binoxide of manganese, it exhibits a close resemblance
                    in behaviour to casein, formic and valerianic acids being the principal
                    products, along with a small quantity of benzoic aldehyde. When solution of
                    gelatin is mixed with chromate of potash alone, it forms a medium very sensitive
                    to light, which converts it into an insoluble yellow mass.</p>
                <p>As bones are capable of yielding one-third of their weight of solid gelatin, it
                    follows that, if gelatin had a value equivalent to albuminoids, the bones of an
                    animal would contain one-fifth of the total nutritive material in its body.
                    Accordingly, at a time when gelatin was in high esteem for its food-value,
                    recourse was had largely to this source, more especially in France, for a cheap
                    nutritive soup for soldiers, pauper establishments, and hospitals. To prepare
                    such a soup the bones may be either simply boiled in water under pressure, as in
                    a Papin’s digester, or without pressure, or they may be previously freed from
                    salts of calcium by treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid. On the large scale
                    the crushed bones are submitted to the combined action of steam at high pressure
                    and a current of water percolating through the fragments. The bones, preferably
                    in a fresh condition, or preserved by thorough drying or by antiseptic agents
                    such as brine, are crushed by passing them between solid iron cylinders grooved
                    longitudinally and kept revolving. They are then packed into a cylindrical cage,
                    which can be lowered into a cylindrical jacket of rather larger diameter than
                    itself, the whole closing with a well-fitting lid. A pipe for the entrance of
                    water, regulated by a stopcock, projects from the top of the outer cylinder, and
                    is connected before the lid is put on with an adjustable nozzle, through which
                    the water trickles down among the caged bones. Another pipe is connected with
                    the bottom of the apparatus for the passage of high-pressure steam. The gelatin
                    solution may be removed at intervals by means of a stopcock at the bottom. The
                    quantity of water percolating through the bones is carefully regulated in
                    accordance with the varying pressure of the steam, so as to produce a soup of
                    nearly uniform consistence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> As to the nutritive value of such a soup very
                    different opinions have been entertained at different times. It was at the time
                    of the first French Revolution, when the question of the improvement of the diet
                    of soldiers and people was much discussed, that attention began to be directed
                    to gelatin as a cheap and useful food; and at that time such men as Proust and
                    D’Arcet were trying improved methods of extracting it from bone. The discovery
                    of nitrogen as a constituent of foods generally led to its being regarded as the
                    special criterion of food-value, and, as this element was found to exist in
                    large proportion in gelatin, the percentage of gelatin extractable from any
                    substance was held as determining its worth as food.</p>
                <p>In 1802 a commission appointed by the Academy to investigate the question
                    reported that, though it might to a certain extent replace flesh in soups, yet
                    it could not be taken as the measure of food-value. Meanwhile experiments on men
                    and dogs, especially by Donné, Gannal, Edwards, and Balzac, along with the
                    results of hospital rations at St Antoine and St Louis, showed the impossibility
                    of feeding upon gelatin alone, and in general its unsatisfactory character as a
                    food. Accordingly, a second commission was appointed by the Academy in 1841, who
                    reported very strongly against the use of gelatin at all as an article of diet,
                    alleging that, besides being valueless itself, it actually diminishes the value
                    of otherwise nutritious food; but this latter part of the indictment was
                    overturned by the Netherlands’ commission <hi rend="italic">(Compt. Rend.,</hi>
                    1844). It ended by the Academy in 1850 declaring that gelatin was positively
                    injurious to the digestive organs; and the natural result of this extreme
                    reaction was of course a complete cessation of its use as food.</p>
                <p>In Germany, Liebig had declared, in his <hi rend="italic">Thierchemie</hi>
                    (1843), that gelatin, being a product of the decomposition of albumen, could not
                    take the place of albumen as food, though it might be conceived to be useful for
                    the growth of gelatinous tissue. Boussingault’s experiments on ducks <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ann. Chem. Phys.,</hi> 1846) showed that, contrary to what should
                    happen if the report of the French Academy were true, gelatin did not pass
                    unaltered into their faeces, but that a large increase of uric acid was found in
                    their urine, a result which was confirmed by Frerichs and Bischoff, who found in
                    the urine of dogs fed on gelatin large amounts of urea—uric acid in birds and
                    urea in mammals being the characteristic forms in which nitrogen is eliminated
                    from the system of these animals. The conclusion they arrived at was that the
                    use of gelatin as a food was limited to its power of undergoing decomposition in
                    the body, like the carbohydrates, to yield heat, but that it cannot replace the
                    other nitrogenous constituents of the body. In 1853 Dr Donders of Utrecht
                    published a treatise on foods, in which he dealt with gelatin, and expressed
                    opinions that have pretty much held their ground since, and only been confirmed
                    in detail by subsequent investigators. Large quantities of gelatin, he says, are
                    detrimental to digestion. In moderate quantity it gets decomposed in the body,
                    and acts as a food probably by diminishing the otherwise necessary amount of
                    albumen, the sole use of which, he remarks, is not merely to form tissues. In
                    1860 Bischoff and Voit published the result of their experiments on the subject,
                    which completely established the fact that gelatin can take the place of albumen
                    to a limited extent, in a way that fat cannot, so that the body-weight maintains
                    itself on a smaller supply of albumen, and that gelatin has a function therefore
                    of a higher character than a mere heat-producer like starch and sugar. In a more
                    recent memoir by Voit, from which the previous historical sketch is mostly
                    borrowed <hi rend="italic">(Zeitschrift</hi><hi rend="italic">fur Biologic,</hi>
                    viii., 1872), the results of an extensive series of careful experiments are
                    given, in which the same conclusion comes out. He finds, moreover, that the
                    saving of albumen is even more marked when a moderate amount of fat accompanies
                    the gelatin, but that no combination of fat and gelatin can replace albumen or
                    prevent the animal from losing flesh; but, on the contrary, when a dog was fed
                    on equal parts of gelatin and fat it lost more flesh than when fed on gelatin
                    alone. Fed on gelatin alone, it after a time evinced such a repugnance to the
                    food that it would rather starve than feed; and, if it was induced to eat,
                    vomiting and diarrhoea were the results. The time which gelatin takes for its
                    complete metamorphosis in the body is far less than in the case of albumen,
                    never exceeding 24 hours, in the course of which time all its nitrogen may be
                    found in the urine and faeces.</p>
                <p>A parallel series of experiments to determine how far gelatin could replace fats
                    or carbohydrates in food showed that, though it could not be substituted for
                    them to any large extent, it does somewhat diminish the amount of fat used up.
                    As Voit puts it at the end of his paper, gelatin cannot, any more than fats or
                    carbohydrates, take the place of that moiety of albumen which he calls the
                    organic albumen,—the part which goes to build the organs and tissues; it cannot
                    produce new blood-corpuscles to replace those that are worn out, or form muscles
                    or any tissues, not even the gelatigenous. What it is capable of doing is to act
                    as a substitute to some extent for that other and far larger part of the albumen
                    of food which, never at any time forming part of any organ, circulates in the
                    blood, and is carried to all the tissues, undergoing continual
                    metamorphoses.</p>
                <p>A later series of experiments by Etzinger, a pupil of Voit, was undertaken in
                    order to elucidate the action of the digestive fluids on gelatin or gelatigenous
                    tissue. Direct experiments showed that these substances are scarcely altered by
                    prolonged contact with a dilute (0’3 per cent.) solution of hydrochloric acid at
                    the ordinary temperature of the body. But when gelatin or tissues yielding it,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">ligamentum</hi><hi rend="italic">nuchoe,</hi> tendons,
                    and bones were treated at the same temperature with an artificial gastric juice
                    made by acidifying with acid of the above strength glycerin extract of pigs’

                    solution which did not gelatinize. The solution thus obtained exhibits physical
                    and chemical characters so analogous to those of the peptones formed by a
                    similar process from albuminoids that it has been called by some authors <hi

                    made to study the product formed in this digestion transformation. Taking the
                    soluble gelatin obtained by prolonged boiling of gelatin in water to be the same
                    material as is produced by the action of gastric juice, the author found that
                    from the solutions so obtained two distinct substances could be separated, one
                    precipitable by pel chloride of platinum, which he calls <hi rend="italic"
                    >semiglutin,</hi> and the other not so precipitable, and also more soluble in

                    definite salts with platinum and copper, analyses of which agree pretty well

                    >Glue.—</hi> Glue is a form of gelatin, which, on account of its impure
                    condition, is employed only as an adhesive medium for wood, leather, paper, and
                    like substances. There is, however, no absolute distinction between glue and
                    gelatin, as they merge into each other by imperceptible degrees; and although
                    the dark-coloured varieties of gelatin which are known as ordinary glue are in
                    no case treated as food, yet for several purposes the fine transparent kinds,
                    prepared chiefly for culinary use, are employed also as adhesive agents. Neither
                    again, except in respect of its source, is there any chemical or physical
                    distinction between these two substances and isinglass or fish glue, and
                    therefore the preparation and industrial applications of these three varieties
                    of commercial gelatin—glue, gelatin, and isinglass—will be here noticed.</p>
                <p>The gelatin-yielding substances in the animal kingdom are very numerous,
                    comprising the skins of all animals, tendons, intestines, bladders and fish
                    sounds, bones, horns, and hoofs. Chondrin, the substance yielded by
                    cartilaginous tissue, which is simply an impure variety of gelatin (see above),
                    has greatly inferior power of adhesion. In the preparation of ordinary glue the
                    materials used are the parings and cuttings of hides from tan-yards, the ears of
                    oxen and sheep, the skins of rabbits, hares, cats, dogs, and other animals, the
                    parings of tawed leather, parchment, and old gloves, and many other
                    miscellaneous scraps of animal matter. Taking tan-yard refuse to be the
                    principal material, it is first steeped for some weeks in a pit with lime water,
                    and afterwards carefully dried and stored. The object of the lime steeping is to
                    remove any blood and flesh which may be attached to the skin, and to form a lime
                    soap with the fatty matter it contains. So prepared the “scrows” or glue pieces,
                    as they are termed, may be kept a long time without undergoing change. Before
                    being boiled, the glue pieces are thoroughly washed. They are then placed in
                    hemp nets and introduced into an open boiler, which has a false bottom, and a
                    tap by which liquid may be run off. The boiler is heated by direct firing, a
                    series of boilers being arranged in the manner best fitted to obtain the
                    greatest possible heating effect from one fire. As the boiling proceeds test
                    quantities of liquid are from time to time examined and when a sample is found
                    on cooling to form a stiff jelly, it is ready to draw off. Usually the first
                    boiling occupies about eight hours, and when the liquid has been drawn off, more
                    water is added and the boiling process repeated. In this way the gelatinous
                    matter is only exhausted after six separate boilings, occupying about two days,
                    the last boiling yielding a darker-coloured glue than the first. It is essential
                    that the boiling out of a charge should not be continued longer than is
                    necessary for yielding a sufficiently stiff gelatinous solution, as it is found
                    that, when the liquid is long exposed to a heat at or above boiling point, the
                    gelatin loses its power of congealing. From the boiler the sufficiently
                    concentrated solution is run to a tank or “setting back,” in which a temperature
                    sufficient to keep it fluid is maintained, and in this way any impurity is
                    permitted to subside. The glue solution is then run into wooden troughs or
                    coolers about 6 feet long by 2 feet broad and 1 foot deep, in which it sets to a
                    firm jelly. When set, a little water is run over its surface, and with knives of
                    suitable form it is detached from the sides and bottom^ cut into uniform slices
                    about an inch thick, and squares of these are placed on nets stretched between
                    upright wooden frames or hurdles for drying. The drying operation, which
                    requires very special care, is best done in the open air; the plastic masses
                    must, however, be protected from rain. Frost and strong dry heat are equally
                    injurious, and the best results are obtained in spring and autumn weather, when
                    the glue dries in from twelve to eighteen days. When the pieces have become
                    quite hard and sonorous, they are washed to remove dust from their surface, and
                    to give them a glazed or polished appearance. A good quality of glue should be
                    free from all specks and grit, and ought to have a uniform, light
                    brownish-yellow, transparent appearance, and it should break with a glassy
                    fracture. Steeped for some time in cold water it softens and swells up without
                    dissolving, and when again dried it ought to resume its original properties.
                    Under the influence of heat it entirely dissolves in water, forming a thin
                    syrupy fluid with a not disagreeable smell. The adhesiveness of different
                    qualities of glue, on which quality its value depends, differs considerably; and
                    there are several methods of measuring the comparative value of commercial
                    samples, the most reliable of which are based on actual experiment. Glue is also
                    made from bones by first boiling them to remove the fatty matter they contain,
                    and then treating them with strong hydrochloric acid till they become quite soft
                    and translucent. In this condition, after they are washed and the acid
                    neutralized, they are enclosed in a covered vessel and submitted to the action
                    of steam, by which a concentrated gelatinous solution is first obtained. At a
                    subsequent stage the whole mass is boiled by direct heat, and a further quantity
                    of glue is so procured. The glue yielded by bones has a milky hue, owing to the
                    phosphate of lime it carries with it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commercial Gelatin.—</hi> Gelatin, as a commercial product, is
                    prepared in a manner similar to that followed in the manufacture of glue; but
                    the materials used are selected with great attention to purity, and the various
                    operations are carried out with the most scrupulous care and cleanliness. In the
                    manufacture of the well-known sparkling gelatin of Messrs Cox of Gorgie, near
                    Edinburgh, the following is the process followed, according to their patent
                    obtained in 1844. The shoulders and cheeks of ox-hides are preferred, but other
                    parts may be used. The hide and skin pieces are cleansed in water, cut in small
                    pieces by a machine, and reduced to pulp in a pulp mill. The pulp is pressed
                    between rollers, mixed with water, and then subjected to heat varying from 150°
                    to 212° F., whereby gelatin is produced. When a very pure quality is required,
                    liquid gelatin is mixed with a small quantity of ox blood at a temperature not
                    exceeding 160° or 170°, and further heated. The albumen of the blood becomes
                    coagulated, and rises as a scum; the heat is then withdrawn, after which the
                    scum is removed and the purer liquor allowed to settle, and afterwards it is run
                    into copiers to congeal and dry. The gelatin is evaporated tn <hi rend="italic"
                    >vacuo</hi> to avoid the injury caused by long subjection to heat; but it may
                    also be dried on a steam-heated surface. In Nelson’s process the gelatin is
                    extracted by steam heat from hide pieces which have been submitted to the
                    bleaching action of sulphurous acid. The strained and purified product is spread
                    in a thin layer on a marble slab till it partly solidifies, when it is cut up
                    and washed to free it from all traces of acid. It is again redissolved at the
                    lowest possible temperature, then resolidified and dried in thin sheets on nets.
                    Heuze of Berlin prepares a pure transparent gelatin, having a fine meaty
                    flavour, from very impure materials, by intimately mixing with the hot solution
                    of impure darkcoloured<pb break="no"

                    and animal charcoal, leaving the whole together for some hours, then
                    redissolving and straining off the clarified gelatin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Isinglass.—</hi> Isinglass or fish glue, in its raw state, is
                    the swimming-bladder or sound of various species of fish. The sounds undergo no
                    other preparation than careful drying, but in the drying they are variously
                    treated and made up, so that the isinglass comes into commerce under the names
                    of “leaf,” “staple,” “book,” “pipe,” “lump,” “honeycomb,” and other
                    designations, according to its form. The finest isinglass, which comes from
                    Russia, is prepared by cutting open the sounds, steeping them in water till the
                    outer membrane separates from the inner, then washing the latter and exposing it
                    to dry in the air. Russian isinglass is obtained from several species of
                    sturgeon <hi rend="italic">{Acipenser),</hi> found in the Volga and other
                    tributaries of the Caspian Sea, in the Black Sea, and in the Arctic Ocean.
                    Brazilian isinglass, obtained from Brazil and Guiana, is the produce of a large
                    fish, <hi rend="italic">Silurus</hi><hi rend="italic">parkerii,</hi> and
                    probably some other species; and Manila and East Indian isinglass are yielded by
                    species of fish not yet satisfactorily determined. The sounds of the common cod,
                    the hake, and other <hi rend="italic">Gadidoe</hi> are also used as a kind of
                    isinglass. The principal uses to which isinglass is applied are for jellies and
                    confections, and as a clarifying or filtering medium for wine, beer, and other
                    liquids. When used for culinary and confectionery purposes, isinglass is rolled
                    into thin sheets and cut into fine shreds to facilitate its solution. For
                    clarifying liquids its fibrous structure is of great value, as it forms a fine
                    network in the liquid in which it is disseminated, and thereby mechanically
                    carries down all the minute particles which render the liquid thick and turbid.
                    Isinglass dissolved in strong acetic acid forms a powerful cement, much used for
                    repairing glass, pottery, and similar small objects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Uses of Gelatin.—</hi> The gelatin derivable from bones enters
                    very largely into human food, in the stock for soups, &amp;c., and as prepared
                    gelatin, “calves foot jelly,” and isinglass. In addition to the uses already
                    alluded to, gelatin has many other applications in the arts. It is employed as a
                    sizing agent in paper-making, and by painters it is also U3ed for sizing or
                    priming, and for preparing tempera colours. Further, it is used in the
                    preparation of elastic moulds of undercut work, and in the manufacture of inking
                    rollers for printing. Gelatin treated with bichromate of potash, under the
                    influence of light, undergoes a remarkable chemical and physical change, whereby
                    it is rendered entirely inabsorbent of and insoluble by water. The change is due
                    to the'oxidizing effect of the bichromate; and the circumstance has given rise
                    to the numerous so-called carbon-processes introduced into photography by Swan,
                    Johnson, Woodbury, Albert, Edwards, and others, in all of which an image is
                    produced in gelatin oxidized by chromium compounds. An insoluble glue may be
                    prepared by adding to dissolved glue, just before using, a proportion of a
                    solution of bichromate of potash, and such a preparation forms a useful
                    waterproofing medium. Glue may be kept liquid at ordinary temperatures by the
                    addition of concentrated acetic acid or of weak nitric acid. Dumoulin’s liquid
                    glue, which possesses powerful adhesive properties, is composed of glue in the
                    proportion of 2 K&gt; dissolved in 1 quart of water with 7 oz. of nitric acid
                    (sp. gr. 1 ’ 335) added. Mouth or lip glue is prepared by adding ∣ lb or thereby
                    of sugar to each pound of dissolved glue. It forms solid but easily dissolved
                    cakes, and as it can be sufficiently softened by the tongue, it is for many
                    purposes extremely convenient. Transparent gelatin, brightly coloured by dyeing
                    substances, and cast in excessively thin sheets, is largely used for ornamental
                    wrappings for bon-bons, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Various adhesive but non-gelatinous substances are, on account of their
                    properties, known commercially as glue, and are used as substitutes for ordinary
                    glue. Thus marine glue, employed in shipbuilding and for other purposes, is a
                    compound of india-rubber and shell-lac dissolved in coal-tar naphtha. Glue
                    substitutes are also prepared from the albuminoids casein and gluten, but they
                    are not likely to become substances of any considerable commercial importance.
