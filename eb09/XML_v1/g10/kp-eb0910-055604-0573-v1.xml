                    rend="smallcaps">Geisirs</hi></label>, are fountains of a peculiar construction,
                    in virtue of which they shoot up into the air, at more or less regular intervals
                    of time, a column of heated water and steam or of mud. Those of Iceland have
                    been known at least from the time of Saxo Grammaticus, who briefly mentions them
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Dariorum regum historice</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    but no satisfactory explanation of the phenomena was advanced till near the
                    middle of the present century, when Bunsen brought his scientific knowledge and
                    power of investigation to bear on the subject. Sir George Mackenzie, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels in Iceland,</hi> 1811, had written as follows :—“Let us
                    suppose a cavity C (fig. 1 ), communicating with the pipe PQ, filled with
                    boiling water to the height AB, and that the steam above this line is confined
                    so that it sustains the water to the height P. If we suppose a sudden addition
                    of heat to be applied under the cavity C, a quantity of steam will be produced
                    which, owing to the great pressure, will be evolved in starts causing the noises
                    like discharges of artillery, and the shaking of the ground.” He admitted that
                    even to his own mind this could be only a partial explanation of the facts of
                    the case, and that he was unable to account for the frequent and periodical
                    production of the necessary heat; but he has the credit of hitting on what is
                    certainly the proximate cause—the sudden evolution of steam. By Bunsen’s theory
                    the whole difficulty is solved, as is beautifully demonstrated by the artificial
                    geyser designed by Professor J. H. J. Miiller of <pb break="no"

                    beginning to boil, the superincumbent column is consequently raised, and the

                    being raised to <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is there subjected to a diminished
                    pressure; a sudden evolution of steam accordingly takes place at <hi

                    but the under strata of water are naturally those which are least affected by
                    the cooling process; the boiling begins again at A, and the same succession of
                    events is the result (see R. Bunsen, “Physikalische Beobachtungen über die
                    hauptsächlichsten Gisire Islands,” in <hi rend="italic">Poggendorff’s</hi><hi

                    Geyser-theorie,” <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> vol. lxxix., 1850). The principal
                    difference between the artificial and the natural geysertube is that in the
                    latter the effect is not necessarily produced by two distinct sources of heat
                    like the two fires of the experimental apparatus, but by the continual influx of
                    heat from the bottom of the shaft and the differences between the boiling points
                    of the different parts of the column owing to the different pressures of the
                    superincumbent mass. This may be thus illustrated :—AB is the column of water;
                    on the right side the figures represent approximately the boiling points (Fahr.)
                    calculated according to the ordinary laws, and the figures on the left the
                    actual temperature of the same places. Both gradually increase as we descend,
                    but the relation between the two is very different at different heights. At the
                    top the water is still 39° from its boiling point, and even at the bottom it is
                    19°; but at D the deficiency is only 4°. If, then, the stratum at D be suddenly
                    lifted as high as C,it will be 2°above the boiling point there, and will
                    consequently expend those 2° in the formation of steam.</p>
                <p>Any hot spring capable of depositing siliceous material by the evaporation of its
                    water may in course of time transform itself into a geyser, a tube being
                    gradually built up as the level of the basin is raised. And every geyser
                    continuing to deposit siliceous material is preparing its own destruction; for
                    as soon as the tube becomes deep enough to contain a column of water
                    sufficiently heavy to prevent the lower strata attaining their boiling points,
                    the whole mechanism is deranged. In geyser districts it is easy to find thermal
                    springs busy with the construction of the tube; warm pools, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >laugs,</hi> as the Icelanders call them, on the top of siliceous mounds, with
                    the mouth of the shaft still open in the middle; and dry basins from which the
                    water has receded with their shafts now choked with rubbish.</p>
                <p>Geysers exist at the present time in many volcanic regions, as in the Eastern
                    Archipelago, Japan, and South America; but the three localities where they
                    attain their highest development are Iceland, New Zealand, and Wyoming in the
                    United States. The very name by which we call them indicates the historical
                    priority of the Iceland group. It is an old Icelandic word— <hi rend="italic"
                    >geysir,</hi> equivalent to gusher or rager—from the verb <hi rend="italic"
                    >geysa,</hi> itself a derivative of <hi rend="italic">gjosa,</hi> to gush. In
                    native usage it is the proper name of the Great Geyser, and not an
                    appellative—the general term <hi rend="italic">hver,</hi> a hot spring, making
                    the nearest approach to the European sense of the word (see Cleasby and
                    Vigfusson, <hi rend="italic">Icelandic English Dictionary,</hi> s.v.).</p>
                <p>The Iceland geysers are situated about 50 miles N.W. of Hecla, in a broad valley
                    of alluvial formation, at the foot of a range of hills from 300 to 400 feet in
                    height. Within a circuit of about two miles, upwards of one hundred hot springs
                    may be counted, varying greatly both in character and dimensions. The Great
                    Geyser iu its calm periods appears as a circular pool 72 feet in diameter and 4
                    feet in depth, occupying a basin on the summit of a mound of siliceous
                    concretion; and in the centre of the basin is a shaft, about 9 feet in diameter
                    and 70 feet in depth, lined with the same siliceous material. The clear
                    sea-green water flows over the eastern rim of the basin in little runnels. On
                    the surface it has a temperature of from 76° to 89° Cent., or from 168° to 188°
                    Fahr. Within the shaft there is of course a continual shifting both of the
                    average temperature of the column and of the relative temperatures of the
                    several strata. The results of the observations of Bunsen and Descloizeaux in
                    1874 were as follows <hi rend="italic">(cf. Poggendorff's</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    metres from the bottom of the shaft was 121 ·6°C.; at 9 ’ 50 metres, 121’1°; at
                    16 ’ 30 metres, 109° (1); and at 19 ’ 70 metres, 95° (1). About nine hours after
                    a great eruption on July 6 th, at about 0 ’ 3 metres from the bottom, it was
                    123°; at 4'8 metres it was 122-7°; at 9 ’ 6 metres, 113°; at 14 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4 metres, 85∙8°; at 19 *2 metres, 82 ’ 6°. On the
                    7th, there having been no eruption since the previous forenoon, the temperature
                    at the bottom was 127‘5°; at 5 metres from the bottom, 123°; at 9 metres,
                    120’4°; at 14 <hi rend="italic">fl</hi> 5metres, 106"4°; and at 19 metres, 55°.
                    About three hours after a small eruption, which took place at forty minutes past
                    threeo’clock in the afternoon of the 7 th, the temperature at the bottom was 126
                    ’ 5°; at 6 ’ 85 metres up it was 121‘8°; at 14 ’ 75 metres, 110°; and at 19
                    metres, 55°. Thus, continues Bunsen, it is evident that the temperature of the
                    column diminishes from the bottom upwards; that, leaving out of view small
                    irregularities, the temperature in all parts of the column is found to be
                    steadily on the increase in proportion to the time that has elapsed since the
                    previous eruption; that even a few minutes before the great eruption the
                    temperature at no point of the water column reached the boiling point
                    corresponding to the atmospheric pressure at that part; and finally, that the
                    temperature about half-way up the shaft made the nearest approach to the
                    appropriate boiling point, and that this approach was closer in proportion as an
                    eruption was at hand. Observations made by Mr Robert Walker in August 1874
                    remarkably confirm those of Professor Bunsen (see <hi rend="italic">Proceedings
                    of Roy. Soc. of Edinburgh,</hi> vol. viii. p. 514). The Great Geyser has varied
                    very much in the nature and frequency of its eruptions since it began to be
                    observed. In 1809 and 1810, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> according to Hooker and
                    Mackenzie, its columns were 100 or 90 feet high, and rose at intervals of 30
                    hours, while, according to Henderson, in 1815 the intervals were of 6 hours, and
                    the altitude from 80 to 150 feet.</p>
                <p>About 100 paces from the Great Geyser is the <hi rend="italic">Strοkkr</hi> or
                    churn, which was first described by Stanlay in 1789. The shaft in this case is
                    about 44 feet deep, and, instead of being cylindrical, is funnel-shaped, having
                    a width of <pb break="no"

                    about 10 inches near the centre. By casting stones or turf into the shaft so as
                    to stopper the narrow neck, eruptions can be accelerated, aud they often exceed
                    in magnitude those of the Great Geyser itself.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Professor Tyndall (see Royal
                    Institution Notices, 1853, and Heat as a Mode of Motion, 1863), this effect of
                    the stopper is simply due to the fact that it is an impediment to the normally
                    gradual ascent of the heated aqueous strata, and that it is an impediment which
                    at last is suddenly removed.</p></note> During quiescence the column of water
                    fills only the lower part of the shaft, its surface usually lying from 9 to 12
                    feet below the level of the soil. Unlike that of the Great Geyser, it is always
                    in ebullition, and its temperature is subject to comparatively slight
                    differences. On the 8th of July 1847 Bunsen found the temperature at the bottom
                    112 9° C.; at 3 metres from the bottom, lll ’ 4°; and at 6 metres, 108’; the
                    whole depth of water was on that occasion 10 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 15
                    metres. On the 6th, at 2 ’ 90 metres from the bottom, it was 114 2°; and at 6 ’
                    20 metres, 109 ’ 3°. On the 10th, at 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 35 metres
                    from the bottom, the reading gave 113*9°; at 4 ’ 65 metres, 113’7°; and at 8 ’
                    85 metres, 99 ’ 9°.</p>
                <p>The great geyser-district of New Zealand is situated in the south of the province
                    of Auckland in or near the upper baβin of the Waikato river to the N.E. of Lake
                    Taupo. Tn many respects the scene presented in various parts of the districts is
                    far more striking and beautiful than anything of the same kind to be found in
                    Iceland, but this is due not so much to the grandeur of the geysers proper as to
                    the bewildering profusion of boiling springs, steam-jets, and mud-volcanoes, and
                    to the fantastic effects produced on the rocks by the siliceous deposits and by
                    the action of the boiling water. At Whakarewarewa, near Lake Loto Rua, there is
                    a group of eight geysers, one of which, the Waikate, throws the column to a
                    height of 30 or 35 feet (see Hochstetter, <hi rend="italic">New Zealand,</hi>
                    1867). But it is in the Yellowstone Park, in the north-west corner of Wyoming,
                    that the various phenomena of the geysers can be observed on the most portentous
                    scale. The geysers themselves are to be counted by hundreds, and the dimensions
                    and activity of several of them render those of Iceland and New Zealand almost
                    insignificant in comparison. The principal groups are situated along the course
                    of that tributary of the Upper Madison which bears the name of Fire Hole River.
                    Many of the individual geysers have very distinctive characteristics in the form
                    and colour of the mound, in the style of the eruption, and in the shape of the
                    column. The “Giantess,” as observed by Langford (1870) and Dunraven (1874),
                    lifts the main column to a height of only 50 or 60 feet, but shoots a thin spire
                    to no less than 250 feet. The “Castle” varies in height from 10 or 15 to 250
                    feet; and on the occasions of greatest effort the noise is appalling, and shakes
                    the ground like an earthquake. Strong distinct pulsations, says Lord Dunraven,
                    occurred at a maximum rate of seventy per minute, having a general tendency to
                    increase gradually in vigour and rapidity until the greatest development of
                    strength was attained, and then sinking again by degrees. The jets grew stronger
                    and stronger at every pulsation for ten or twelve strokes, until the effort
                    would culminate in three impulses of unusual power. The total display lasted
                    about an hour. “Old Faithful” owes its name to the regularity of its action. Its
                    eruptions, which raise the water to a height of 100 or 150 feet, last for about
                    five minutes, and recur every three-quarters of an hour. The “Beehive” sometimes
                    attains a height of 219 feet; and the water, instead of falling back into the
                    basin, is dissipated in spray aud vapour. Very various accounts are given of the
                    “Giant.” Hayden saw it playing for an hour and twenty minutes, and reaching a
                    height of 140 feet, and Lieutenant Doane says it continued in action for three
                    hours and a half, and had a maximum of 200 feet; but at the earl of</p>
                <p>Dunraven’s visit the eruption lasted only a few minutes. For further details see
