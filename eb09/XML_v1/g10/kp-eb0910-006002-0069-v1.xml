                    rend="smallcaps">Baron</hi> (1756-1833), English admiral, was born on the 13th
                    October'1756, at the Bahamas, of which his father, John Gambier, was at that
                    time lieutenant-governor. He entered the navy in 1767 as a midshipman on board
                    the “Yarmouth,” under the command of his uncle; and, his family interest
                    obtaining for him rapid promotion, he was raised in 1778 to the rank of
                    postcaptain, and appointed to the “Raleigh,” a fine 32-gun frigate. At the peace
                    of 1783 he was placed on half-pay; but, on the outbreak of the war of the French
                    Revolution, he was appointed to the command of the 74-gun ship “Defence,” under
                    Lord Howe; and in her he had an honourable share in the action off Ushant, on
                    the 1st June 1794. In recognition of his services on this occasion, Captain
                    Gambier received the gold medal, and was made a colonel of marines; the
                    following year he was advanced to the rank of rear-admiral, and appointed one of
                    the lords of the Admiralty. In this office he continued for six years, till, in
                    February 1801, he, a vice-admiral of 1799, hoisted his flag onboard the
                    “Neptune,” of 98 guns, as third in command of the Channel Fleet under Admiral
                    Cornwallis, where, however, he remained for but a year, when he wa3 appointed
                    governor of Newfoundland and commander-in-chief of the ships on that station. In
                    May 1804 lie returned to the Admiralty, and, with a short intermission in 1806,
                    continued there during the naval administration of Lord Melville, of hie uncle,
                    Lord Barham, and of Lord Mulgrave, In November 1805 he was raised to the rank of
                    admiral; and in the summer of 1807, whilst still a lord of the Admiralty, he was
                    appointed to the command of the fleet ordered to the Baltic, which, in concert
                    with the army under Lord Cathcart, reduced Copenhagen, and enforced the
                    surrender of the Danish navy, consisting of nineteen ships of the line, besides
                    frigates, sloops, gunboats, and naval stores. This service was considered by the
                    Government as worthy of special acknowledgment; the naval and military
                    commanders, officers, seamen, and s0ldier3 received the thanks of both Houses of
                    Parliament, and Admiral Gambier was rewarded with a peerage.</p>
                <p>In the spring of the following year he gave up his seat at the Admiralty on being
                    appointed to the command of the Channel Fleet; and in that capacity he witnessed
                    the partial, and prevented the total, destruction of the French fleet in Basque
                    Roads, on the 12th April 1809. It is in connexion with this event, which might
                    have been as memorable in the history of the British navy as it is in the life
                    of Lord Dundonald (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Dundonald),</hi> that Lord Gambier’s
                    name is now best known. A court-martial, assembled by order of a friendly
                    Admiralty, and presided over by a warm partisan, “most honourably acquitted” him
                    on the charge “that, on the 12th April, the enemy’s ships being then on fire,
                    and the signal having been made that they could be destroyed, he did, for a
                    considerable time, neglect or delay taking effectual measures for destroying
                    them;” but this decision was in reality nothing more than a party statement of
                    the fact that a commander-in-chief, a supporter of the Government, is not to be
                    condemned or broken for not being a person of brilliant genius or dauntless
                    resolution. No one now doubts that the French fleet should have been reduced to
                    ashes, and might have been, had Lord Gambier had the talents, the energy, or the
                    experience of many of his juniors. He continued to hold the command of the
                    Channel Fleet for the full period of three years, at the end of which time—in
                    1811—he was superseded. In 1814 he acted in a civil capacity as chief
                    commissioner for negotiating a treaty of peace with the United States; for his
                    exertions in which business, he was honoured with the Grand Cross of the Bath.
                    In 1830 he was raised to the high rank of admiral of the fleet, and he died 19th
                    April 1833.</p>
                <p>Although he had the good fortune to attain the very highest service rank, Lord
                    Gambier is assuredly not one of those admirals whoso memory the British navy
                    treasures or idolizes. His predilection was for a life on shore; and during the
                    great war he so utilized his family interest that he remained for nearly half
                    the time a member of the Admiralty. And whether afloat or ashore, he had neither
                    the genius nor the strength of mind fitted for high command or high office.
                    Personally he was a man of earnest, almost morbid, religious principle, and of
                    undoubted courage; but the administration of the Admiralty has seldom given rise
                    to such flagrant scandals as during the time when Lord Gambier was a member of
                    it; and through the whole war, the self-esteem of the navy suffered no such
                    wound as during Lord Gambier’s command in the Bay of Biscay.</p>
