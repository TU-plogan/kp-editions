                    rend="smallcaps">Fura</hi></label>, an important river of Western Africa, which
                    enters the Atlantic about 13° 50' N. lat. Its sources are in the central plateau
                    of the Futa Jallon highlands, a tract of country about 240 miles inland, which
                    also contains the head waters of the Senegal, the Falerne, the Rio Grande, and
                    some tributaries of the Niger. Flowing almost due N. for the first 200 miles of
                    its course, it turns somewhat abruptly to the W., and continues in that
                    direction through a country of great fertility. Steamers can proceed up the
                    river as far as Yaba Tenda; the channel remains navigable for boats 300 miles
                    from the mouth to the falls of Barraconda; and above the falls it is again
                    navigable, as was shown by Governor MacdonnelΓs expedition in 1851, for at least
                    160 miles farther. The principal affluent is the Neries, which, coming from the
                    north, joins the main stream about 30 or 35 miles above the falls. At
                    Fattatenda, a short distance below the falls, the river has a breadth, even in
                    the dry season, of about 320 feet, with a depth of from 13 to 20 feet. In the
                    rainy season it rises from 20 to 50 feet, and the whole country downwards to the
                    sea is laid under water, and receives a rich alluvial deposit.</p>
                <p>The British colony of Gambia comprises a considerable territory mainly on the
                    left bank at the mouth of the river, Elephant’s Island about 100 miles from the
                    sea, and Macarthy’s Island still further inland. The whole area under British
                    authority is 21 square miles. The population in 1851 was stated at 5693, in 1861
                    at 6939, and in 1871 at 14.190 (7306 males and 6884 females). In the 15 years
                    from 1860 to 1874 the total gross revenue was £268,232, making an annual average
                    of £17,802; and the gross amount of public expenditure in the same period was
                    £255,291, making an annual average of £17,019, or a total surplus of revenue
                    over expenditure of £2941. In 1862,1863, and 1864 the liabilities exceeded the
                    assets by £3638, £4817, and £5492 respectively, but there is no funded debt. The
                    Gambia settlement, which formerly cost the imperial revenue from £20,000 to
                    £25,000 per annum, now provides for its own defence,—an armed police force,
                    recruited mainly from the Mahometan tribe of the Houssas, having been
                    substituted since 1869 for the imperial troops. The parliamentary grant, which
                    had averaged about £4200 per annum from 1860 to 1867, was reduced to £1500 in
                    1868, and finally withdrawn in 1871, and all expenses are met by the local
                    revenue. The Gambia district was originally united with Sierra Leone on the
                    dissolution of the African Company in 1822; in 1843 it was made a separate
                    colony, the first governor being Henry Frowd Seagram; in 1868 it was reunited to
                    Sierra Leone; and it is now governed by an administrator. The capital of the
                    colony is Bathurst, a town on the eastern side of St Mary’s Island.</p>
                <p>. St Mary’s Island lies at the mouth of the river on the south side, close to the
                    mainland, from which it is separated by a stretch of mangrove swamp and a
                    narrow’ arm of the river called Oyster Creek. It is about 15 miles in length by
                    less than a mile in breadth, and consists of a slightly elevated plain of sandy
                    soil, which in the dry season becomes a bed of hot and shifting dust. There are
                    naturally not many trees on the island, though a few cocoa-nuts, palms, papaws,
                    willows, bananas, oleanders, and guavas manage to maintain a precarious
                    existence. The Barbados pride, however, flourishes luxuriantly (Captain Hewitt).
                    Bathurst is on the whole a well-built town, the principal material employed
                    being a dirty red sandstone coated with whitewash. It lies about 12 or 14 feet
                    above the level of the river. The market house is built of iron, and the market
                    place was planted with trees in 1869. Besides the Government house and the
                    barracks, there is a hospital founded by General Macdonnell, a court-house, and
                    an Episcopal church completed about 1869. The population of the town is of a
                    very motley description, including, besides the white officials, and traders to
                    the number of about 50, half-castes of all shades, liberated negroes, Jolloffs,
                    Barras, and other local tribes. The part of the mainland immediately contiguous
                    to St Mary’s is known as British Combo, an area of about 6 miles long by from 2
                    to 3 miles broad having b’een secured by treaty with the king of Combo in
                    1853.</p>
                <p>M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Carthy ’ s Island lies about 180 or 200 miles
                    above St Mary’s. It is about 5∣ miles in length and 1 in breadth. There are two
                    or three “factories,” a considerable trading town, peopled partly by liberated
                    Africans, a fort, a Methodist church, and a schoolhouse. Though this was the
                    last spot actually in British possession, it was long understood by Gambia
                    traders that they were under British protection much farther up the stream; but,
                    according to the de. spatches of Lord Carnarvon in 1877, they must proceed at
                    their own risk as soon as they advance beyond British territory. St James’s
                    Island, which was the seat of the British factory in the 18th century, is about
                    17 miles from St Mary’s. It still bears traces of European occupation, but is
                    gradually being washed away by the river.</p>
                <p>The chief exports are ground nuts, wax, hides, ivory, gold dust, palm oil, and
                    gum arabic; but even these are obtained in quantities that look ridiculously
                    small when the natural richness of the country through which the Gambia flows is
                    considered. At the close of the 18th century only two or three ships were
                    employed in the trade; in 1839 no fewer than 239 merchant vessels visited the
                    river; and in 1871 75 British and 154 foreign vessels entered, with a total
                    tonnage of 51,853 tons. During the four rainy months, from July to October, the
                    native trader conveys his employer’s rice or corn up the river, and receives in
                    exchange the pagnes or country cloths; in November he barters these same cloths
                    for ground nuts, hides, and wax; and for the rest of thé year, till the rainy
                    season comes round again, he supplies the natives with arms, powder, rum, Madras
                    handkerchiefs, and other European productions. The French traders, however, who
                    are gradually getting a large share of the commerce into their hands, have
                    introduced the custom of money transactions, and the innovation is well received
                    by the natives.</p>
                <p>The trade in ground nuts is of comparatively recent development. In 1836 the
                    value exported was only £838; in 1837 it reached £8053, and in 1840 no less than
                    £15,209. In 1860 the value was £79,611, and in 1861 £101,060. The average
                    quantity between 1850 and 1860 was 11,196 tons; between 1870 and 1877 it was
                    14,000 tons. The supply is greatly affected by the political state of the
                    country in which the nuts are grown. Most of the necessary tillage is performed
                    by the tribe of the Sera-Woullis, who come down from the interior in great
                    numbers, and return home when they have earned what they desire. The French
                    markets are the principal destination of the nuts. American traders deal mainly
                    in hides, horns, and beeswax; and the honey is chiefly purchased for the German
                    market. The Roman Catholics maintain a mission and a small convent in the
                    Gambia, and the Wesleyans ha,ve long had a number of stations. The latter have
                    done great service to education <pb break="no"

                    1860, being attended by 1273 scholars. It was not till 1869 that, even at
                    Bathurst, a Government school was established; but there are now several schools
                    in connexion with the Episcopal church. The Roman· Catholics began the erection
                    of a large schoolhouse in 1873.</p>
                <p>The Gambia was visited by the Carthaginian explorer Hanno, and it became early
                    known to the Portuguese discoverers; but it was not till 1618 that English
                    traders began to turn their attention to this quarter. Iu that year a company
                    was formed for the exploration of the river. Richard Thompson was sent out in
                    the “Catherine,” and succeeded in reaching Kassan, a Portuguese trading town,
                    but he never returned, and his fate is not known. Two years afterwards, Richard
                    Jobson advanced beyond the falls of Barraconda; and he was followed, about 40
                    years later, by Vermuyden, a Dutch merchant. In 1723 Captain Stibbs was sent out
                    by the African Company to verify Vermuyden’s reports of gold; he proceeded 60
                    miles above the falls. The treaty of Versailles in 1783 assigned the light of
                    trade in the Gambia to Britain, reserving the single port of Albreda for the
                    French; while at the same time it assigned the Senegal to France, and reserved
                    the port of Portendic for the British. By the treaty of Paris in 1851 this
                    arrangement was re-established, and it remained in force till 1857, when an
                    exchange of possessions was effected, and the Gambia became a purely British
                    river. In 1870 there was a proposal to transfer the colony to the French; but it
                    led to nothing more than a voluminous diplomatic correspondence.</p>
