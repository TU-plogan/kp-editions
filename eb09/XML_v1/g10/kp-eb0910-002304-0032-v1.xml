                    rend="smallcaps">Claudius,</hi> called Gallien by Chaucer and other writers of
                    the Middle Ages, the most celebrated of ancient medical writers, was born at
                    Pergamus, in Mysia, about 130 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> His father Nicon,
                    from whom he received his early education, is described as remarkable both for
                    excellence of natural disposition, and for mental culture; his mother, on the
                    other hand, appears to have been a second Xanthippe. In 146 Galen commenced the
                    study of medicine, and in about his twentieth year he left Pergamus for Smyrna,
                    in order to plaee himself under the instruction of the anatomist and physician
                    Pelops, and of the peripatetic philosopher Albinus. He subsequently visited
                    other cities, and in 158 returned from Alexandria to Pergamus. In 164 he went
                    for the first time to Rome. There he healed Eudemus, a celebrated peripatetic
                    philosopher, and other persons of distinction; and ere long, by his learning and
                    unparalleled success as a physician, earned for himself the titles of
                    “Paradoxologus,” the wonderspeaker, and “Paradoxopoeus,” the wonder-worker,
                    thereby incurring the jealousy and envy of his fellow-practitioners. Leaving
                    Rome in 168, he repaired to his native city, whence he was soon sent for to
                    Aquileia, in Venetia, by the emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius. In 170
                    he returned to Rome with the latter, who, on departing thence to conduct the war
                    on the Danube, having with difficulty been persuaded to dispense with his
                    personal attendance, appointed him medical guardian of his son Commodus. In Rome
                    Galen remained for some years, greatly extending his reputation as a physician,
                    and writing some of his most important treatises. It would appear that he
                    eventually betook himself to Pergamus, after spending some time at the island of
                    Lemnos, where he learned the method of preparing a certain popular medicine, the
                    “terra lemnia” or “sigillata.” Whether he ever revisited Rome is uncertain, as
                    also are the time and place of his death. According to Suidas, he died at the
                    age of seventy, or in the year 200, in the reign of Septimius Severus. If,
                    however, we are to trust the testimony of Abul-faraj, one of his Arabian
                    biographers, his decease took place in Sicily, when he was in his eightieth
                    year. Galen was one of the most versatile and accomplished writers of his age.
                    He composed, it is said, nearly 500 treatises on various subjects, including
                    logic, ethics, and grammar. Of the published works attributed to him 83 are
                    recognized as genuine, 19 are of doubtful authenticity, 45 are confessedly
                    spurious, 19 are fragments, and 15 are notes on the writings of Hippocrates.</p>
                <p>Galen, who in his youth was carefully trained in the Stoic philosophy, was an
                    unusually prolific writer on logic. Of the numerous commentaries and original
                    treatises, a <pb break="no"

                    medical and scientific writings. His name is perhaps best known in the history
                    of logic in connexion with the fourth syllogistic figure, the first distinct
                    statement of which was ascribed to him by Averroes. There is no evidence from
                    Galen’s own works that he did make this addition to the doctriues of syllogism,
                    and the remarkable passage quoted by Μ. Minas from a Greek commentator on the
                    <hi rend="italic">Analytics,</hi> referring the fourth figure to Galen, clearly
                    shows that the addition did not, as generally supposed, rest on a new principle,
                    but was merely an amplification or alteration of the indirect moods of the first
                    figure already noted by Theophrastus and the earlier Peripatetics.</p>
                <p>In 1844 M. Minoides Minas published a work, avowedly from a MS. with the
                    superscription <hi rend="italic">Galenus,</hi> entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Takηvov</hi><hi rend="italic">Εισαγωγή Διαλεκτική.</hi> Of this work, which
                    contains no direct intimation of a fourth figure, and which in general exhibits
                    an astonishing mixture of the Aristotelian and Stoic logic, Prantl speaks with
                    the bitterest contempt. He shows demonstratively that it qannot be regarded as a
                    writing of Galen’s, and ascribes it to some one or other of the later Greek
                    logicians. A full summary of its contents will be found in the 1st vol. of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Geschickte der Logik</hi> (591-610), and a notice of the
                    logical theories of the true Galen in the same work, pp. 559-577.</p>
                <p>There have been numerous issues of the whole or parts of Galen’s works, among the
                    editors or illustrators of which may be mentioned Jo. Bapt. Opizo, N.
                    Leonicenus, L. Fuchs, A. Lacuna, Ant. Musa Brassavolus, Aug. Gadaldinus, Conrad

                    Theodore Goulston, Caspar Hoffman, Bene Chartier, Haller, and Kühn. Of Latin
                    translations Choulant mentions oι⅛e in the 15th and twenty-two in the following
                    century. The Greek text was edited at Venice, in 1525, 5 vols, fol.; at Basel,
                    in 1538, 5 vols, fol.; at Paris, with Latin version by René Chartier, in 1639,
                    and in 1679, 13 vols, fol.; and at Leipsic, in 1821-33, by C. G. Kühn,
                    considered to be the best, 20 vols. 8vo. Au epitome in English of the works of
                    Hippocrates and Galen, by J. R. Coxe, was published at Philadelphia in 1846.</p>
